0,TheLittleSongbird,"""Do you smoke after sex?"" ""I don't know. I've never looked""",8,4 May 2010,"The plot once again is daft and while Heather Graham is really pretty she isn't quite in the same league as Elizabeth Hurley. That said, it is a fun, witty and sophisticated ""shagadelic"" sequel, that is literally like a lava-lamp lampoon that is stupid and as sophisticated as the first film. It isn't as good as a film to the first, but I think where it is improved from its predecessor is that it is more relaxed in style. Once again, the sets and costumes are gorgeous to look at, the soundtrack is funky and takes you back to the period and there are many moments of sparkling wit in the script. The film also moves quickly while being more relaxed at the same time. The performances from Mike Myers, Michael York and Rob Lowe are top notch too. Overall, a tad inferior, but a fun sequel nonetheless. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
1,bkoganbing,"To Shag Or Not To Shag, That Is The Question?",6,19 December 2009,"Like Fu Manchu back in the day, Dr. Evil is defeated, but not destroyed in the first Austin Powers film. He's back and he's got a plan to make things right. The way to do it is to defeat Austin Powers and the way to do that is to steal his Mojo. I mean what would James Bond be without his Mojo. A whole slew on Bond girls would go UnBondified.The operation is successful and the Powers Mojo is now in the hands of Dr. Evil. In the first film, Dr. Evil begat a son Scott Evil by artificial insemination, but now with the Powers Mojo he sees some hidden charms (well hidden) in Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling). He even gets cloned and from that procedure, we get Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). Of course filling the world with Evil is only part of the plan, he still has it mind to get some big bucks from the USA for not blowing up Washington, DC with a space laser.So Mike Myers as Powers has to both get his Mojo back from Powers as Dr. Evil and foil the Evil plans. As his Shagadelic sidekick he has Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell from the American CIA. Without his Mojo, Powers is lost when dealing with her obvious charms.As for Graham she in the line of duty has to do some mercy Shagging on another of Mike Myers's comic creation, Fat Bastard the Scot's guardsman who's a double agent. I have to say I really enjoyed what Myers did with this character although the film does get a bit gross when dealing with this guy. However it was the makeup job on Myers for Fat Bastard that got Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me an Oscar nomination in that department.If possible the humor gets a little more low brow than the first film was, but still plenty funny.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
2,Leofwine_draca,Ugh!,1,16 September 2021,"This was the film that turned me right off the 'gross out' comedy that was becoming popular in Hollywood at the time. I refused to go and see any more from this point onwards. All of the charm of the first film vanishes to be replaced by one crudity after another, pushing everything towards infantile jokes and sexual antics. Still one of my most hated films some twenty years later. Ugh!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
3,SnoopyStyle,"Mini-Me great, but Fat Bastard ill-fitting gross-out humor",7,29 March 2015,"Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is trying to live happily-ever-after with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) but she turns out to be a deadly fembot. At least, he's single again. The gang is back. Number Two (Robert Wagner) clones Dr. Evil to create Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). His son Scott Evil (Seth Green) is not quite evil enough. He and Mini-me travel in his time machine to 1969 to steal Austin Powers' mojo. Fat Bastard is the baby-eating disgruntled inside man who steals the mojo. Austin travels back in time in his VW convertible Bug to stop them with the help of CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham).It's almost as fun as the original. The addition of Mini-Me is genius. ""Stop humping the laser."" Heather Graham is hot in her booty shorts. Rob Lowe replacing Robert Wagner as the younger Number Two works. I can do without the gross Fat Bastard. The gross-out jokes don't really fit. Quite frankly, James Bond never had a Fat Bastard equivalent. He's the only one that sticks out.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
4,lee_eisenberg,"mostly good, but one scene was unnecessary",7,25 May 2006,"""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" was mostly really funny - with Austin continuing his face-off with Dr. Evil - but the stool sample scene was unnecessary. Still, the rest of the movie was a hoot, especially all the slang names for the spaceship. Some of the things in these movies, I wonder how they're able to come up with, especially some of Mini-Me's gags. All in all, it's a movie that you're sure to love, particularly with the Jerry Springer scene and all the associations with world events.Fat Bastard. What a name! And of course, the character in the next movie had an even wackier name.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
5,jboothmillard,Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,8,9 March 2005,"The spy spoof hero returns for a very good sequel. Mike Myers returns as Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and a new and very funny character called Fat Bastard. Dr. Evil has gone back in time to 1969 two years after Austin was frozen and sent Fat Bastard to steal his ""Mojo"". Without it, Austin is helpless in the future. So Austin goes back in time to catch Dr. Evil with the help of the gorgeous Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). A very funny sequel. One of the best bits is seeing Mini Me (Verne Troyer) for the first time. The other two funniest bits are the rocket that looks like a penis, and the shadows in the tent. Also starring Michael York as Basil Exposition, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Rob Lowe as Young Number Two, Seth Green as Scott Evil, Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina and Elizabeth Hurley as a quick Vanessa. Look out for appearances by Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Jerry Springer, Tim Robbins and Woody Harrelson. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup, and the Golden Globe for Best Song for Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger"". Mike Myers was number 46 on The Comedians' Comedian. Very good!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
6,ccthemovieman-1,Funny But Nasty 'R-Rated' Look At The Stupid '60s,8,27 February 2006,"I get a perverse kick out of the other deliberately-stupid humor of these ""Austin Powers"" movies. They are extremely bright and colorful - photography- wise, but full of dark comedy moments as well as light-hearted slapstick. Best of all, they poke fun at the ludicrous 1960s lifestyle, particularly in England. Many people may think they glorifying the hedonism of the period, and maybe that's the case, but find it more of a satire and see it that way.What I don't like, however, is the rating of this film and the others as PG-13. How typical of sick Hollywood, pandering these and the other Powers movies to the teen crowd. They are filled with nothing but sex, sex, and more sex. Even the term ""shag,"" is British for ""f--k."" I mean, they don't even try to be subtle anymore. Rate it R, stick to it, and let the adults have fun with all the innuendos, puns, cleavage, penis jokes, and general pagan lifestyles of the 1960s.Mike Myers does a good job playing several over-the-top roles. Sometimes he's better off saying nothing, just opening up his mouth with that stupid grin and horrible teeth. That usually gets a laugh. The other two Powers were better because this was too mean-edged and too profane.I would imagine that Myers and the Austin Powers films in general were either loved or hated by whomever is viewing it. I get a lot of humor out of these because I don't take them seriously and look at it more as making fun of the moronic attitudes of the late '60s more than anything else. Great fun....for adults.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
7,Tweekums,An amusing if rather crude sequel,7,5 July 2017,"As this, the first Austin Powers sequel, gets underway our protagonist learns that his new wife is in fact a fembot who tries to kill him! If that wasn't enough Dr Evil is back; he has a miniature clone, dubbed Mini-Me'; and he has a diabolical plan. He and Mini-Me will use a time machine to travel back to 1969 and steal Austin's mojo. This lead to Austin suddenly failing to perform in bed in the '90s. There is only one thing for it; he must return to the sixties and get his mojo back. Here he teams up with US agent Felicity Shagwell and starts tracking down Dr Evil. He meanwhile has a new dastardly plan; he will place a laser on the moon and use it to destroy cities if his demands aren't met.After the success of the first film a sequel was almost inevitable. The jokes are similar so if you enjoyed the original you'll probably enjoy this film as well. The humour is fairly puerile at times sometimes this is funny but some gags are a bit weak and are dragged on far too long; most notably the comments about Dr Evil's somewhat phallic rocket. The story provides lots of amusing nods to Bond and other films, notably Star Wars. The best addition to the series is Mini-Mi; he doesn't say anything but just about everything he does is funny; Verne Troyer does a fine job in the role. Heather Graham's appearance as Felicity Shagwell was a lot of fun; she was sexy without just being a cypher. Unfortunately we also get 'Fat Bastard'; a character who is revolting rather than amusing. Overall I'd say this was funny enough but lacked the charm, and inevitably the originality, of the original.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
8,BA_Harrison,It's a bit nutty.,8,22 August 2012,"With Canadian comedian Mike Myers such an unapologetic Anglophile, its not surprising that the humour in his Austin Powers films is a blend of two of Britain's most celebrated comedic styles: Pythonesque surrealism and Carry On crudity (toilet humour and double entendres). The Spy Who Shagged Me, the second in Myers' spoof spy series, provides 95 minutes of sheer lunacy for fans of such fare, delivering a constant stream of gags about poo, farts, bottoms, and willies, wacky homages to 60s spy movies, off-beat skits introducing such bizarre characters as an overweight, baby-eating Scotsman called Fat Bastard and Dr. Evil's dwarf clone Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), lots of fun star cameos (including Jerry Springer, Burt Bacharach, Will Ferrell, Tim Robbins and Woody Harrelson), some very silly time travel shenanigans, and the sexiest secret agent sidekick ever to grace the silver screen in the lovely form of Heather Graham as the aptly named Felicity Shagwell.It might not be all that sophisticated, but it ain't half funny!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
9,moonspinner55,Cartoony smut goes a bit limp...,4,26 October 2005,"Follow-up to 1997's ""Austin Powers International Man Of Mystery"" has Dr. Evil back from space, using a time-machine to travel back to 1969 in hopes of finishing off super-spy Austin Powers for good. Colorful but extremely thin comedy spoofs everything '60s (from ""Barbarella"" to ""The Thomas Crown Affair""); while these are endearing targets, the film has more dead space than hilarity, and the barest minimum of a plot. The first film was all about building the character of Austin Powers; he was fun, and the slapstick surrounding him was affectionate and happy. This sequel is just an excuse for Mike Myers (in three roles) to cut up; the character of Austin is no longer explored as much as he is exploited. As Fat Bastard, Myers is terrifically, grossly hilarious, but Dr. Evil is already starting to wear out his welcome. The movie is just a lightweight doodle, entertaining enough yet a big step down from its predecessor. ** from ****",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
10,Quinoa1984,For the first time,7,6 May 2000,"I found the sequel to Austin Powers to be funny the first time around, maybe even funnier than the first film.  But then I saw it again and again, and it became not as funny.  Still, I think Mike Myers did some equally good (and equally bad) things here.  Good because there are some new characters, including Verne Troyer (who steals the show) as Dr. Evil's completence, Mini-Me, and Myers as a new villain (a metric ton villain) Fat Bastard. These characters add more humor, but this is also bad because the story feels recycled and not too original.  The first had some originality and added to the hilarity.  Still, I'm not complaining.  This  film had me rolling in the isles, and if it's your first time watching this, I reccomend it.  One of the best films of the year.  A+",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
11,BandSAboutMovies,Another round,6,14 April 2020,"The first Austin Powers film was a modest success, but this was a monster, earning more its first weekend than the first film did in the entire time that it was in theaters.After getting married to Ms. Kensington in the last film, it turns out that she's one of the fembots. She attempts to kill Austin before self-destructing. Our hero grieves briefly before realizing that he's single. And then we're off to more hijinks.Dr. Evil's plan this time is to go back in time to 1969 and steal Austin's mojo. Our hero also goes back in time - meeting CIA Agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) - before battling younger versions of Number 2 (Rob Lowe instead of Robert Wagner) and Frau Farbissina (still Mindy Sterling).This film also adds Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, who is as much based on Knick-Knack from The Man with the Golden Gun as he is Majai, the miniature form of Dr. Moreau from the 1996 version of the film.When Graham was asked to audition for the role, at Mike Myers' request, she was saved from what she saw as a potential career-ending mistake. She was seriously considering accepting a major part in a softcore lesbian movie after not having any film roles for a year and a half. The first thing she did after getting paid for this movie? Buy a copy of the movie in which she would have appeared.Thanks to the suggestive title, this movie has multiple titles all over the world. In Argentina? Austin Powers: The Seductive Spy. In Brazil? Austin Powers: The Agent Bond In Bed. Finland: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shoved Me. France? Austin Powers: The Spy Who Pulled Me. Germany? Austin Powers: Spy in a Secret Missionary Position. Iceland got even dirtier with Austin Powers: The Spy Who Nailed Me. In Japan, it was Austin Powers Deluxe. Norway was Austin Powers: The Spy Who Spermed Me. And Poland was softer with Austin Powers: A Spy Who Never Dies.While this was in theaters for a long time following, Austin Powers impressions were all the rage. Perhaps more people cared about a parody of Bond than Bond himself, if only for a short period of time.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
12,Coventry,The FUNNIEST of all Austin Powers films...,4,3 June 2003,"...And I do choose my words carefully when I say ""funny"" , cause you can't really refer to the Austin Powers series by using the words ""BEST"" or even ""GOOD"". When you use these terms, there should be at least a storyline or a decent plot, which is obviously not the case here. But it's not Mike Meyers' intention to bring a great story (he even says that in the movie: "" don't worry about those things and just enjoy it) so that's OK.Like I said, in my opinion this is the most funny one of all three. The first had some great moments and the 3rd one really stinks. ( I only laughed 2 or 3 times with that one ). I probably prefer this one because of the introduction of 2 very funny characters. The clone of Dr. Evil called ""Mini-Me"" is very hilarious as played by Verne Troyer. He's a nasty little brat, who only loves Dr. Evil. To all others ( even to Number Two ) he's aggressive. The second new character in the film is ""Fat Bastard"" , Also played by Mike Myers. He's pretty much what he's name is telling us. He's supposed to be from Scotland, he's accent is very cool and his habits of eating and farting are hilarious from time to time. Dr. Evil remains very funny...maybe that's my opinion because I'm from Belgium. Then there's the story. I can be very short on that. There where in the first film Austin goes from 1967 to 1999, he goes back to 1969 here because Dr. Evil stole his ""Mojo"" while being frozen...that's it. Then, finally there's the girl. Although Liz Hurley is one of the most beautiful woman in the world, Heather Graham comes very close here. You'll never see her so sexy and beautiful as in Austin Powers the spy who shagged me. If you ever have to make the decision of watching one of the three Austin Powers-films ... pick this one.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
13,michaelRokeefe,A 'shagging' international spy needs his 'mojo' back.,4,11 June 2000,"There is no question to the talent of Mike Myer. This time out he plays three characters in this self penned sequel. This is really not my type of comedy, but I did laugh a few times. The jokes that were not funny, were just plain sick. Most of the visual comedy was of the 'bathroom humor' variety.Dr. Evil creates a time machine; so he can go back to the sixties and steal Power's 'mojo', the elixir that makes groovy chicks crave him. The hip music and colorful sets were a plus for this aimless romp.The cast was made up of diverse talent: Heather Graham, Elizabeth Hurley, Robert Wagner, Rob Lowe and Michael York.Keep your eyes on this Austin Powers guy, with his 'mojo' working, he could 'shag' your cat.

15,Theo Robertson,Will Film Buffs Like This ? ...,7,23 May 2004,"... Yeah baby yeah I didn't watch the original Austin Powers INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY down to the fact that there's been more than enough Bond spoofs made over the years like those movies in the 1980s that starred Roger Moore . What ? they were actually official Bond movies ! Oh dear , I honestly thought they were spoofs and how do you spoof a spoof ? CASINO ROYALE tried it and failed while those movies that featured THE MAN FROM UNCLE are so dated they're almost unwatchable and lets not forget those awful Matt Helm movies . Come to think of it a comedy like THE PARTY that pokes fun at 1960s youth counter culture also feel very dated a surrogate Bond figure transported from the 1960s doesn't hold much appeal to me baby However I was very surprised as to how much I enjoyed THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME down to the fact it's far more sophisticated than I expected . There's umpteen references to other TV shows and movies that IMDb die hards can enjoy . There's an edition of THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW ( Complete with bouncers Todd and Steve ) which could have easily have been a proper edition than a send up , there's a set stolen from crap 60s series THE TIME TUNNEL , a scene stolen from THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU , a fight scene very reminiscent of the dog attack from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY . I could go on listing all the movie and TV connections but I won't bother except to say that the plot of this movie is merged with the plots of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and MOONRAKER The aforementioned elements will certainly appeal to the film buffs while the bad taste jokes will appeal to the teenage market . I wasn't all that taken with the character of Fat Bastard or the fart jokes or the scene with "" This coffee tastes like sh*t "" but it's refreshing to see a movie comedy that does try to mix post modernist sophistication with gross out humour , JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK probably tried this but totally failed . Also naming characters with double entrede names like Felicity Shagwell and Robin Spitz Swallows might be crass but film fans will remember the Bond movies also had similarly named characters like Miss Goodthighs ( "" So I can see "" ) and Plenty O Toole ( "" Of course you do "" ) so I guess this is also an amalgamation between schoolboy humour and sophisticationTHE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is hardly Oscar material but is very entertaining",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
16,zardoz-13,"You'll Die Laughing at ""Austin Powers 2!""",9,22 August 2008,"Anybody that enjoyed the first Austin Powers epic should love the sequel. The gags in ""Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" surpass the original not only in comic creativity but also in how much they make you cringe. The cosmic struggle between good and evil as embodied in Austin Powers' battle against Dr. Evil has never been funnier. Cheeky scatological humor permeates this derivative tale along with the usual bad puns, double-entendres, infantile innuendo, and farcical slapstick. Director Jay Roach and writer & star Mike Myers have boned-up their flaky-flashy formula, introduced new characters, embellished on-going subplots, and pulled out all stops to top the original. Naturally, the Austin Powers movies celebrate as much as poke fun at those hip 1960's spy sagas where James Bond, Matt Helm, and Derek Flint used their wits and ways with women to vanquish the villains.Co-scripted by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers, ""AP2"" picks up where the original left off. Opening with a campy nod to ""Star Wars,"" they recap the original adventure with their own prologue scrolling into deep space. Not only has Austin Powers (Mike Myers) defeated his arch enemy Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and exiled him to the dark recesses of space, but Powers also gotten his ugly teeth fixed and has married Vanessa Keningston (Elizabeth Hurley in a cameo).While Austin and Vanessa shag away in the honeymoon suite, Dr. Evil's Big Boy rocket reappears on Norad Radar. An American astronaut working on the space shuttle looks up and finds the famous Shoney's Restaurant icon hovering ominously in an atmospheric ""Armageddon' like rendezvous that sets the tone of hilarity in this facetious sequel. Whirling 180 degrees around the smiling Big Boy rocket, the camera focuses on the Big Boy's butt as a hinged compartment lowers, launching an egg which tumbles to the Earth. Indeed, the diabolical Dr. Evil is back! Meanwhile, Austin learns that Vanessa isn't really Vanessa. Instead, she is a fembot, a Terminator-like robot equipped with machine guns in her breasts which she deploys to gun down Austin. Predictably, he survives her barrage of bullets and rescue her Swedish, penis-enlarging machine while the deadly fembot obliterates everything in sight before she self-destructs.Later, Austin learns from Basil Exposition (Michael York), chief of British Intelligence, that they knew all along that Vanessa was a fembot. Rejoicing at his new found freedom, Austin cavorts throughout the motel in his birthday suit while psychedelic screen credits carefully obscure his genitals. When the credits don't cover up his crotch, different objects resembling his genitals show up in a series of inventive sight gags cover them up. Basically, director Jay Roach has recycled the same joke from the first ""AP"" movie but has tripled the objects standing in for Austin's genitalia.While the first ""AP"" movie gave its eponymous hero the lion's share of screen time, Dr. Evil dominates the sequel. Actually, between the two, Dr. Evil is far more interesting. Resembling Ernst Blofeld from ""You Only Live Twice,"" Dr. Evil is the epitome of irony. Just as he did in ""AP,"" Dr. Evil allows his vendetta to kill Powers overshadow his plans to enlarge his astronomically wealthy empire. The product placement here is clearly over-the-top as we find Dr. Evil in his high-rise headquarters in the Seattle space needle. Number Two (Robert Wagner in a cameo) reports that since they have acquired a minor coffee franchise, Starbucks, they have reaped a fortune. Acquiring a fortune takes a back seat to Dr. Evil's latest mad scheme. He intends to go back in time to 1969, two years before Austin Powers has been frozen cryogenically, to pinch our hero's mojo. Dr. Evil dispatches his most odious hoodlum, Fat Bastard (Myers in a third role), a baby-chomping, kilt-clad Scottish bagpipe blowing thug who weighs a ton.Meanwhile, back in the future, Austin learns to his chagrin that he has lost his mojo. Essentially, the swinging secret agent no longer has his virility, leaving him impotent. Basil Exposition confirms it, and British Intelligence plans to send him back to the past in a time machine to 1969. Appropriately enough, a new Volkswagen Beetle with psychedelic colors serves as the time machine. Austin returns to swinging London and hooks up with fox CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham of ""Boogie Nights""). They set out to recover his mojo and thwart Dr. Evil's fiendish plan to destroy Washington with a moon-based laser.The Austin Powers movies synthesize the spy flicks of the 1960s along with the premise from the Sylvester Stallone thriller ""Demolition Man."" References to other movies creep into the action. When Dr. Evil's chair spins out of control, he invokes the chant from ""The Exorcist."" Incidentally, we learn in ""AP2"" that Austin's favorite movie is ""In Like Flint."" Nothing more than a loosely aligned jumble of ""Saturday Night Live"" skits like the original, ""AP2"" happily acknowledges its own absurdity in a couple of self-depreciating asides. Boldly, the filmmakers tell audiences in one scene to ignore the loopholes in the plot and enjoy the show. During a ride along a scenic stretch of road, Austin observes, ""Amazing how England looks in no way like southern California."" Director Jay Roach, who helmed the first ""AP"" movie, returns for the sequel. Clocking in at a trim 95 minutes, ""AP2"" rarely slows down, so if you watch it with a rowdy audience, you may miss some of the punch lines. The dancing interludes are flavorful and flashy, and the film's energy never wanes. Roach keeps the story rolling and the jokes flying as thick as bullets. One of the funniest scenes has Dr. Evil flying a spaceship shaped like erect male genitalia. Quick cuts from different people reacting to the object fuel the comedy.""AP2"" boasts beefed up production values that approximate the films that it sends up. Some of the funniest scenes involve Dr. Evil's relationship with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green). You'll die laughing at ""AP2.""",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
17,Boba_Fett1138,Too much of the same.,6,17 April 2004,"Instead of being original the movie recycles too many jokes from the previous Austin Powers movie. Not that that takes away the fun of it of course.Once again the movie is full with the most craziest characters and jokes. A positive addition to the movie are the characters Mini-me and Fat Bastard. All of the other main characters from the first movie are also back again in this one and once again more than enough cameo's with a fun part for Tim Robbins as the president of the United States.The movie tries nowhere to surpass its predecessor mainly because it plays at safe, meaning that it doesn't try out anything new or something that hasn't been done before in the previous Austin Powers movie, with as a result a not so original but still fun movie.Of course the quality of the movie and story isn't always very high and some of the jokes are simply lame but on the other hand there are more than enough other jokes that are hilarious. It is a movie that is so dumb that it is actually funny.If you liked the first one you'll also like this one and will be worth your time watching, otherwise just skip it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not as good as the first, but worth seeing if you liked the first",7,9 March 2004,"The main problem with this sequel is all the recycled jokes. Apart from that, a few of the jokes are taken too far, are too extreme to really be funny, in my opinion. The plot is very much like the first, and still a spoof of one or several Bond movies. The acting is, like in the first, good. The new characters are not as entertaining as the ones from the first, but fortunately, most of the more important characters return here, even those who had small parts in the first one. While I liked this, I didn't think it was as funny as the first. Something was missing. It isn't entirely bad though, some of the new gags and jokes are well worth seeing the movie for. If you liked the first one, you'll most likely, at the very least, enjoy this. Some of it is bad, but most of it is pretty good. I loved the cameos, and several of the crude gags were hilarious. If you liked the first, or you're into crude, sexual humor you'll probably enjoy this; it's good to see if you want more of Austin Powers after having seen the first, but just don't expect it to be as funny as the first. 7/10",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
19,view_and_review,Dr. Evil and Mini Me Are the Best,7,14 December 2020,"I remember when ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" came out in '99. The movie tried to use ""Star Wars"" fame to promote itself as it was being released around the same time.Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is back and so is Number Two (Robert Wagner) and so is Mustafa (Will Ferrell). Austin is single again because his wife ended up being a fembot. Go figure. Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers) has a new scheme in mind. This time he wants to travel back in time to 1969, when Powers was frozen, and steal his mojo. For that task he uses a new henchman, Fat B_____d (IMDb won't allow me to write it).I actually liked ""Spy Who Shagged Me"" more than ""International Man."" The addition of Mini Me (Verne Troyer) was hilarious and as I said about part one, I much prefer to see more Dr. Evil. The back and forth between him and his son Scott (Seth Green) is priceless.The absence of Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) meant that Austin would need another female partner fawning over him. When he followed Dr. Evil back to 1969 he was partnered up with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) who, much like Vanessa, was a sex symbol with a gun.The movie suffered a little with one of its run on jokes (the rocket ship shaped like a phallus). There were a few more stars which didn't help much, but we got a tad more Dr. Evil which was a big bonus.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
20,evanston_dad,Shag Me Baby,7,30 June 2010,"Mike Myers plays both Austin Powers, as groovy as secret agents get, and Dr. Evil, Powers' arch enemy, in this comedy franchise that spoofs everyone's favorite secret agent, James Bond.Though all three entries in the series are hit and miss funny, the hits mostly outnumber the misses, and if you think Mike Myers is funny, you'll probably think the films are funny, because they're basically just venues for Myers' trademarked brand of schtick. Though the plots differ nominally, the three separate parts of the trilogy are essentially the same movie with the same jokes just put in different order. But they're good jokes, and it's just as funny watching Myers and company deliver the same punch line for the third time as it was the first.Grade: B for the whole series",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
21,anaconda-40658,Totally Shagged.,4,25 June 2015,"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Verne Troyer, Rob Lowe, Seth Green: Sequel is more of the same yet with some added vulgar bits. Its slang title is based on the 1977 Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, and was controversial in some countries. It has a hilarious opening where Dr. Evil is a guest on The Jerry Springer Show. After an unsuccessful honeymoon Austin's mojo is stolen by Dr. Evil. With a suddenly available time machine Powers ventures back to 1969 to stop him. Director Jay Roach is skilled at comedy but the idea that Powers never needed his mojo makes the plot totally useless. Mike Myers effectively plays three roles. Asides from Powers and Dr. Evil he also plays evil agent Fat Bastard. Heather Graham plays Miss Shagwell whose name sums up her nature. She seems to have better chemistry with Myers than Elizabeth Hurley, whose role was too much of a romantic cliché. Rob Lowe is hilarious as agent #2 despite the fact that the role is somewhat reduced. Verne Troyer steals scenes as Mini-Mi who is a clone of Dr. Evil. He conducts whatever orders given until he is ""flushed"" into space. Seth Green also returns as Scott Evil whose status as Dr. Evil's son is pushed aside by Mini-Mi. Great colourful production and makeup effects highlight this sequel with a screenplay that was totally shagged. Score: 4 / 10",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
22,Aaron1375,"Another funny entry in the series, actually my favorite.",9,17 July 2007,"Yes, I am sure most people probably prefer the first one over this one, but I thought this was the most funny one of the series. To me, this time both Dr. Evil and Austin are equally funny, unlike part one where Dr. Evil to me was clearly the more funny. The jokes run the gambit from clever to just disgusting bathroom humor...but for the most part they are hits. In this installment Austin is on his honeymoon and his new wife is explained away in rather humorous fashion, though that is a bit of a shame seeing how Elizabeth Hurley was the best Austin girl in the series. Well Austin does a dance number and then during a trist with a Russian spy loses his mojo. Well actually it is stolen by a minion of Dr. Evil named fat bastard. Well you know the drill, Dr. Evil along with his army of villains including the new mini me are going to hold the world ransom for a very high price. Well, Austin is off with a new female agent a very attractive, but not as good actress Heather Graham. Well you have more elaborate death traps, a death ray to destroy the world, Austin battling the all powerful Mini me, and a part of the movie Independence Day. So prepare to laugh as you get to see various jokes on Bond too, the most prominent being the coming out of water scene from Dr. No.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
23,Wuchakk,Arguably the best of the zany trilogy,7,27 April 2015,"Mike Meyer's three Austin Powers flicks parody James Bond and the swinging 60s-70s. They are as follows: ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" (1997), ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" (1999) and ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" (2002). What's interesting about these films is that Austin Powers (the character) is not a full spoof of 007 as he's his own character, just with Bond-like qualities.Anyway, I wasn't sure I wanted to review any these flicks because, by doing so, I'm admitting that I actually watched them (lol)! I say this because they're so goofy, juvenile, silly, sometimes raunchy (more verbally than pictorially) and filled with toilet humor. So I was never a fan and didn't even watch any of them until 2009. What turned me off? Besides the toilet humor and raunch, Powers (the character) seemed to have a gayish quality despite being a renowned ladies man in the stories. A good example is when he says, ""Oh, beHAAAve,"" which never struck me as funny, just gay.I've since seen all three twice and, despite my reservations about Powers and distaste for toilet humor, I do enjoy the zaniness and stoo-pid humor. If you can catch a grip with these films they're laugh-out-loud funny about a third of the time, sometimes more depending on the movie.""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is my favorite of the three simply because it's the funniest IMHO, but the third one comes close to matching it. Meyers and his team were brimming with confidence and creativity after the box office success of the first film. Heather Graham replaces Elizabeth Hurley as Austin's babe while Rob Lowe appears as the young version of Number Two. Mini-Me and Fat Bastard are introduced.Best quote: ""Riiiiiiigggghhhttt."" The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Southern California and Seattle, Washington.GRADE: B+",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Dr. Evil is back along with his son, Scott played brilliantly by Seth Green. This time, they go on the Jerry Springer Show entitled ""My Evil Dad wants to take over the world."" I have to say that is a brilliant moment. My favorite moments are not with Austin but with Dr. Evil and his son, Scott. I love Mini-Me who is Dr. Evil's clone. He's more his son than Scott Evil ever was. Anyway we learn of Scott's mother's identity but I knew all along and won't spoil the surprise. Robert Wagner is back and it's another spoof of the Bond films but I still love watching Dr. Evil and Scott bond best of all or at least try too.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
25,StevePulaski,Behave Yourself Once More,8,4 July 2010,"Mike Myers has had some good movies, and some bad. I would like to say. This is one of the main good things I have seen from him. The first Austin Powers movie, remains one of my favorite 90s Comedies. This one was quickly added to the list as well. Though I'm getting a little tired of hearing ""Shag me"" or ""Ya wanna shag?"" in pop culture.This one picks up, almost directly were ""International Man of Mystery"" left off. We find out Powers' last sidekick, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) was a fembot of Dr. Evil's after malfunctioning right in front of him. Now, Austin is single, and looking for a new sidekick.His life has turned, he is a photographer, and is hoping to get his life back on track after his encounter with Dr. Evil.Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) go back to 1969 were they meet Number Two (Rob Lowe), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), and an uncanning fat guy, named who else but Fat Bastard (Mike Myers).Austin arrives back at a party in his London with his new sidekick, Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) where he learns they both have to go to back to 1969 to foil Evil and Mini-Me's plan of launching a laser to the moon. Also to get Powers' ""Mojo"" back from Evil as well.A funny, yet bizarre sequel Myers continues to deliver his ""Oh Behaaaaaaaave"" style acting and his obsess with ""Shagging a women."" I have to love Seth Green's corny one-liners in the film. They keep going as he complains Evil (his father) doesn't love him. A very funny character, who in my opinions needs to have more scenes like his father.A funny, yet quite crude 90s Comedy, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" delivers, as well as the first.Starring: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Verne Troyer, Rob Lowe, Mindy Sterling, and Seth Green. Cameos by Willie Nelson, David Koechner, and Willie Nelson. Directed by: Jay Roach.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Yeah, Baby!!! This is one of the funniest friggin' movies of all time",9,28 July 2002,"I know it sounds silly, but I just think this is one of the funniest movies I had ever seen. Maybe I was just in a good mood or something, but I was a little surprised by the rating of just 6.5 because I knew a lot of people who enjoyed the movie as well as I did.We have Austin Powers and he's back and funnier and nakeder than ever! Despite some recycled jokes, they still get a laugh when he's walking through the hotel butt naked and only certain objects cover him. When Dr. Evil escapes the giant dummy in space and heads back to Earth, Austin alone must go on his mission alone since we find out Venessa was a fembot. We have a new addition to the family with a miniature replica that is 1/8 the size of Dr. Evil he calls ""Mini Me"". Mini Me is just so cute and he wants to kill Scott. Scott and Mini Me just steal the movie from this point on. Dr.Evil decides to go back into the 60's and take over the world by aiming a ""lazer"" at the moon.Austin must now go back in time back to the 60's and finds his sexy assistant, Felicity played by a very beautiful but pretty bad actress Heather Grahm. Together they must find and fight Dr. Evil before he makes over a trillion... oops! I mean a billion dollars! There is another addition of a villain, Fat Bastard, despite most of his gross jokes, you except him into the Austin family.Like I said, there are recycled jokes, but that doesn't keep you from laughing and having a good time. Just let go and learn to have fun with the movie. Come on, you have got to admit that #2's death was just great and so funny! Let's get the rating up, it deserves better than a 6.5!

27,MovieAddict2016,"""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is light-hearted entertainment which supplied me with a ton of laughs!",7,26 March 2003,"Austin is back and more raunchy than ever in ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.""""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is light-hearted entertainment which supplied me with a ton of laughs, no matter how crude they were.Mike Myers returns to his role of Austin Powers in this sequel, as well as playing Dr. Evil, and a new character, Fat Bastar#.Austin Powers has since settled down with new wife Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) since the first film, and is quite happy. Until he finds out his wife is a homicidal fembot of a bride bent on destroying him. After the Vanessa Fembot blows up, Austin immediately forgets about her and goes out for a photo shoot.But what Austin doesn't know is that Dr. Evil has a new plan - to steal Austin Powers' mojo! Evil (along with a clone 1/6 his size - played by Verne J. Troyer) has sent Fat Bastar# back to the sixties to steal Powers' mojo while he is cryogenically frozen. Without his mojo, Powers is nothing. So 90's Austin travels back to the 1960's to claim back his mojo - along with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) - from a time-traveling Dr. Evil.This sequel is a lot different than the first film. The first seemed to be more of a spoof on the spy/James Bond genre. This movie, however, runs a bit more on Powers and his mojo - not a whole lot of Bond spoofs here. But that doesn't mean the jokes aren't any good.Dr. Evil has much more screen time in this sequel, and I'm happy for that. Dr. Evil is a character we didn't see a whole lot of in the original, and in this film, he has just as much - if not more - screen time than Powers himself (it sounds weird referring to them as different actors - they're both Myers!).Mike Myers is just as funny as he was in the first film. I recently viewed ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" for the second and a half time, and I realized that Myers really isn't as funny when he's playing someone close to himself. His character in ""So I..."" isn't as shy as Myers is in real life, but he talks, looks, walks, smiles, and dresses like Myers. Myers as Powers is entirely different, however - he's about twenty times funnier. Not that Myers isn't funny, but you'll notice he is much more funny dressed up as someone else. Look at his ""Saturday Night Live"" skits and you'll see that Myers' best skits were those when he dressed up as different people (i.e. the Scottish Crap Store man).Heather Graham may not be the most talented actress, and I especially found her over--or under--acting in this film compared to her performances in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Bowfinger""--but I think she may have done that on purpose. As we all know, Bond girls usually aren't the best actresses, so perhaps she over/under-acted as a parody on Bond films. Maybe not.Either way she's much better than Hurley was.Robert Wagner returns to the role of Number 2, a spoof on...well...Number 2 from the James Bond film ""Thunderball""--complete with the eye patch and all. He does just as well as he did in the first film, if not better. I think he was a bit apprehensive of enveloping his character in the original ""Powers"" film--but he seems more confident here.Mindy Sterling returns to her role of Frau, Dr. Evil's female henchman--and we find out here that the only man she has ever been with--or ever will be with--is Dr. Evil. Their offspring? Seth Green, reprising his role as Scott Evil--whom was thought to be Dr. Evil's test tube baby, when he is, in fact, the outcome of a one-night-stand with Evil and Frau. Of course the chance that Evil would have the exact same son (Green) with Frau as he did when Scott Evil was born by means of test tubes (even if Frau was the test tube mother) is around one in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to the tenth power (if that whole theory is a little unclear, sorry--I can't think of any other way to put it without getting too...medical...), but that doesn't matter--it's a comedy!It's also worth mentioning that a younger version of Number 2 is played by Rob Lowe--who perfectly mimicks Robert Wagner.All in all, ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is not exactly the greatest comedy, but it's just about as good as the first, if off by a little.3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
28,Buddy-51,hit-and-miss sequel,6,6 August 1999,"The original 1997 ""Austen Powers: International Man of Mystery"" was something of a movie boxoffice phenomenon.  Earning less than $60 million dollars domestically in its theatrical run, the film blossomed into a worldwide ""cult"" favorite via its release on home video.  Its sequel will easily earn three or four times that amount in theatres and, when it hits video stores in the fall - well the sky's the limit. Like many others, I first encountered the original film on home video and found it to be a refreshingly wacky, high-spirited take off on 60's spy films that also managed to deftly satirize the mood and mores of that time as well as of the less-than-swinging '90's.  Part of the comic genius driving the original film was the ludicrous juxtaposition of Powers' anything-goes mentality of the free-love decade with the more foulmouthed, but actually less liberated, lifestyle of the present.  The new film, like most sequels, almost by definition, lacks the freshness and originality of the first film (which itself does not, I must admit, hold up that well upon repeated viewings). Myers' double personas - of Powers the irrepressibly horny, always blissfully invulnerable secret agent and Dr. Evil, the hopelessly anachronistic want-to-rule-the-world villain - still reflect this extraordinarily talented actor's comic genius.  The now classic expressions, inflections and repeated catchphrases with which Myers imbues both characters cannot fail to provoke a chuckle and even an occasional guffaw from the audience.  But ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" suffers from the curse of all these scattershot, laugh-a-minute gagfests:  for every joke or sightgag that works, there are an equal number that land with a resounding thud.  Moreover, the frenetic pacing often leaves the audience more exhausted than exhilerated.  This is not to say that this new film does not have its share of silly laughs - with this many comic attempts a goodly number are bound to succeed.  The humor, in fact, runs the gamut from the satirically witty to the downright scatalogical. Prepare to be offended if endless jokes about male sexual organs and human waste products are not to your taste.  As before, the colorful costume design, reflecting the psychedelic motifs of the 1960's fashion world, are brilliantly recreated - even more so in this film because the plot this time involves Powers' return to that time period to retrieve his ""mojo"" which Dr. Evil has had extracted from him in the past.  One clever touch is having Rob Lowe portray Robert Wagner's 1990's character as he appeared in 1969, utilizing Wagner as a voice over.  The series of jokes that are least successful are the exchanges between Dr. Evil and his son Scott which emerge as uninspired and grating.  All in all, this ""Austen Powers"" is worth a few hearty chuckles and gives us a chance to watch Myers in action again.  I wonder though if this concept may have already gone once too often to the well. The inevitable Part 3 will surely tell.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
29,thesar-2,Watch Number Two One Time,5,20 November 2009,"I hate to say this, but watch Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me once and only once. I wish I had.The reason I say ""I hate to say this"" is because there are a lot of positives about this comedy-sequel. Such as the introduction to the now-iconic Mini-Me, Madonna's wonderful single: ""Beautiful Stranger"" and there are a lot of absolutely hilarious scenes in this movie. But, unfortunately, they are somewhat few and far between.In fact, speaking of which, like Myers's other series Wayne's World, part one is drop-dead hilarious while number two, is well, as a whole, number two.Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me takes place immediately after part one, showing where Austin left off with Vanessa and Dr. Evil frozen. Of course, the doctor's coming back, now in tow with Myers's other creation: Fat Bastard and his smaller-clone Mini-Me and the same gang from part one. Dr. Evil's new plan is to steal his ""mojo"" in order to cause harm. He must travel back in time, with Austin at his heels, to do so. It's not easy to describe the entire plot, but that's the gist. The fun in the movie is just to go along for the ride, but, again, just once.Unfortunately, the movie seems like a bunch of skits just spliced together (such as a ""rap video"") with no real direct plot and a lot of real stepped up crude/vulgar humor. It's a fun event movie, released in 1999 at the heels of Star Wars Episode I, a movie it sincerely mocks. At least Austin one had a direct plot. This one was just made for fans.It's worth watching, if only for Mini-Me, a young Ferrell, Lowe as a pitch-perfect young-Number Two, a scene involving definitions of male anatomy and a lot of time-travel-paradoxes that mock other time-travel movies.

Most of them tickled my funny bone, although were a bit vulgar for my tastes.Like its predecessor, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" (great title!) is bright, brash, colourful and flings laughs at you nineteen to the dozen. I preferred the more esoteric of them - the muso references to the Alan Parsons Project, for example, and if most of them are no more subtle than Benny Hill, hey, he was big in the 60's, 70's and 80's too. As for the new characters, Rob Lowe does a better Robert Wagner than the man himself, Heather Graham is the likable and attractive ""Powers Girl"" this time around as the swingingly named Felicity (should have been Modesty!) Shagwell while the war between Dr Evil's two sons, Scott and Mini-Me is a source of fun throughout. And if you think Felicity's moniker is close to the bone, get a load of Russian agent Ivan Humpalot, which of course takes us back to Fleming's barely less un-PC Plenty O'Toole and Pussy Galore!I'm not sure why Myers is so obsessed with the Scottish accent (going back to ""I Married An Axe-Murderer"" and taken on into his Shrek characterisation and I should be raging at his gross distortion of my native Scottish people with the ""Fat Bastard"" creation but in truth it hit home, if a little and I'll even give his accent pass-marks too! The title of worst Scottish accent is still up for grabs, my gold medallist being Johnny (""I Really Tried..."" in Depp in ""Finding Neverland"".

Many of the jokes are weak but there are just so many of them you never have to wait too long for one to make you laugh; and the sketch where Powers' nemesis, Dr. Evil, appears on the Jerry Springer show is inspired. Nonetheless, for me 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' was the weakest of the trilogy, there are two new villains, the excellent Mini-Me but also the awful Fat Bastard, who brings with him a lot of toilet humour that even in a film that exists, in part, to send up the awfulness of its own jokes, is more gross than funny.

There's never a bad performance and nearly every smutty joke is timed to perfection. Special credit to its writer/star Mike Myers who introduces yet another disgustingly wonderful character to his repartee - 'Fat B*****d' who, dare I sat the voice was a precursor to a famous green ogre he was later to voice.Dr Evil is again back to stop his ultra trendy nemesis Austin Powers from thwarting him by... well, who cares?

I did think it went out of the way to be overly complicated. The plot was far more convoluted and a lot less straight forward in comparison to the first Austin Powers. It's just that, at times, it felt like it was trying too hard to be bigger than its predecessor rather than being its own movie. The cast is stellar, with each member, old and new, fitting in effortlessly to this absurd, wacky universe. Mike Myers steals the show, of course, playing three characters this time around, with the likes of Heather Graham, Seth Green, Michael York and Verne Troyer shining in their respective roles. Ridiculous fun from beginning to end. Zany hilarity, I would certainly recommend Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me to anyone looking for a good comedy adventure.

38,The-Sarkologist,A better Austin Powers take off of James Bond,8,7 October 2011,"I must say that I was not too keen on seeing this movie considering that I was quite disappointed with the first movie, but after Kylie Rogers said that she saw it twice and loved it, I decided to give it a go: and I quite enjoyed it, though I am surprised that Kylie appreciated it, but then she is not your average, everyday woman. Basically, Dr Evil (Mike Myers) escaped in the last movie and returns to destroy Austin Powers (Mike Myers). He invents a time machine, goes back to 1969, and steals Austin's mojo. After learning this, Austin also goes back to stop him. Here he meets Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). After tracking down Fat Bastard, the guy who stole Austin's mojo, they find out where Dr Evil is and stop his diabolical plans, though he manages to escape. This is quite a funny movie and came off much better than the original. The main theme is that you are what you are, not what you have. Austin spends all of the movie trying to get his mojo back, believing that this is what makes him who he is, and when it is destroyed in front of him, Felicity says that he does not need his mojo because he never really lost it. I won't go much deeper into this movie because there isn't much depth to go into. It is basically a send up of James Bond movies with satire and toilet humor, as well as things that we simply do not expect. This movie is stupid and appeals to people who like stupid humour, which I do in some cases. My favourite character is Scott Evil, Dr Evil's son, who is far more intelligent than Dr Evil, and sensible, but as far as Dr Evil is concerned, he is not as evil. I think he is, but the thing is that Dr Evil is simply stupid, but then again so is Austin Powers.

40,tomgillespie2002,Lacks the sweetness of the original,5,22 August 2015,"It's surprising to think that the first Austin Powers movie underwhelmed at the box office back in 1997, only picking up a cult following after its VHS release, and soon enough you couldn't escape the sound of someone yelling ""yeah, baby!"" every 5 minutes. By the time it's sequel hit the cinema screens, the character, along with the super-spy's arch-nemesis Dr. Evil, had garnered a huge mainstream following, and the movie was a big hit. Yet the film, subtitled The Spy Who Shagged Me, suffers from the same problems as most comedy sequels, which is basically to re-tread the same successful jokes from the first movie, and forgetting what made the original so fresh and charming.Powers (Mike Myers) is a randy, free-love type-of-guy from the 60's. When he was re-awoken from his cryogenic state in the 90's, his out- of-date attitudes put him at odds with a society that had grown more stiff-upper-lipped. Crowds of screaming girls would no longer chase him down the street a la A Hard Day's Night (1964) and sexy girls wouldn't be willing to bed him at the drop of a hat. When Dr. Evil (also Myers) arrives back to Earth with a plan to steal Powers' mojo, the characters find themselves time-travelling again back to the 60's, where gorgeous super-agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) is ready and willing, but Powers lack the mojo to do anything about it. Most of what made the first movie so successful was that Powers was a man out of time, so by placing him back into his natural surroundings, the opportunity to create funny set- piece's are few and far between.The dentally-challenged Brit is instead lumped with a dull romance with Shagwell, which is a carbon-copy of the relationship between Powers and Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), only with the roles reversed. In fact, Powers seems to play second-fiddle to Dr. Evil, whose ridiculously outlandish plots and newly-created sidekick Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) annoy his estranged son Scott Evil (Seth Green) and provide the majority of the film's laughs. An early scene where Evil appears on Jerry Springer with his son is hilarious, and the film is at its most inspired when the focus is on the bad guys. The Spy Who Shagged Me is also more gross-out than it's predecessor, continuing a trend set by There's Something About Mary (1998) and re-establishment of the teen sex comedy set by American Pie (1999), so Myers introduces a vile character called Fat Bastard who speaks with a Scottish accent and is permanently covered with chicken bits, whose scenes tend to induce more cringes than laughs.

This time around, the action takes place in the ""groovy"" 1960s.Though the jokes are very similar (in some cases almost identical) to the original, a few key changes add in enough originality to keep things relatively fresh.The addition of Mini-Me (diminutive Verne Troyer) creates another classic character. Plus, just when you thought a female lead couldn't get any hotter than Elizabeth Hurley, they find Heather Graham (!).Essentially, this movie is a simple continuation of its predecessor, for better or worse. I thought it actually slightly eclipsed the first one due to less ""Bond spoofs' and more focus on the crazy character antics/humor.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
42,johnnyboyz,Overstays its welcome and cannot shed the minor majesty of the first in its attempt to go bigger and better.,5,24 September 2013,"Why might a spoof require a sequel? Spoofs are, by their very definition, subversive and deliberately comic in their attitudes towards popular generic convention. A characteristic of popular generic convention includes that of ""the sequel""; that of ""the franchise""; that of ""the series"" – when a spoof is produced, and it's as amusing as the first ""Austin Powers"" film was, it cannot be anything but both thoroughly shameful and wholly hypocritical to induce the continued adventures of its hero. Is it not wholly detrimental to the original notion and a complete anomaly? Was there a joke or a sight gag that was missed the first time round that the audience really ought to have seen? The answer is ""No"" - at least it is to the last of those three questions. For everything else, the response ought to come in the form of a mumbled agreement that Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is a bit of a waste of time and just not particularly funny.The 'spoof' in question in Austin Powers was that of the Bond franchise; something which was playfully mocked without ever really being thoroughly undermined anyway nastily. But hold on, for in spite of the evident references to Oddjob and the master villain stroking his white cat, what was it about the film that so evidently made it a Bond spoof? If it was at all, it was subtle; the references were dropped in around amusing scenes depicting Powers try to win at blackjack with a ""5"". The pastiche is here a hundred times more aggressive and, as a consequence, a hundred times less funny. True, one cannot help but chuckle at the opening ballad being belted out in the mould of a Shirley Bassey theme tune but a mere few of the references here go an awfully long way. You need not be anybody in particular to notice that ""International Man of Mystery"" was never intended to have a sequel. For our troubles of sitting through some of the less-bearable sequences in said 1997 feature, we get what is essentially a lazier; cruder and more infantile film than before which makes the golden error of thinking that because it's a comedy playing on something popular, and by definition things that are most popular in contemporary cinema are often crass and infantile, it thinks it has to provide us with a film that is as puerile and often as disgusting as The Spy Who Shagged Me is.Shamelessly defiling everything that made the first one the solid experience it was, we begin on the honeymoon of the titular Austin Powers (Myers) and his bride Vanessa Kensington and witness the film throw us a vicious curveball in revealing Hurley's character to have been a robotic imposter all along. I think we'd invested a certain amount of energy and time in these people, we witnessed them begin their relationship on contemptible grounds, as varied attitudes towards sex from different eras clashed, before seeing them come to quite like one another after a series of instances wherein Powers turns down the offer for sex from a drunk Kensington and they end up saving the world together.In spite of all that, how does Powers react to the revelation? Why, to celebrate. Myers' other creation, the hunched Dr. Evil whose appearance was always designed to call to mind the best of the Blofeld depictions in Donald Pleasance's is back. Where freezing oneself in time so as to be thawed in the future and wreak havoc in the era was the idea before, the notion of time travel is here ill-advisedly introduced into proceedings - one is reminded of that line from Michael Hanke's ""Funny Games"" when, upon observing a character in possession of a shotgun ideally used to quell the reign of terror being inflicted upon him, the primeval component of that film's antagonistic force merely grins and utters words along the lines of: ""Oh, you've brought us a new toy..."" What unfolds is essentially a reversing of the joke that was the whole point of ""International Man of Mystery"" in the first place; that is to say, removing people from the 1960's and placing them in the 90's for shock and amusement. The gag, of course, revolved around how sensible and chaste we all were in the modern world where, before, we couldn't keep out of one another's beds. The reality is actually the other way around, but the idea of this swinging 60's rouge from London being catapulted to modern Las Vegas worked to a basic degree. Here, Evil and Powers dart back to the 60's again; Evil to steal Powers' inherent sexual prowess while he's still frozen (prior to events from the first film) and Powers to ultimately stop him. Of course, the film realises how shallow all this is and by the end opts for a sub-narrative revolving around a giant laser Dr. Evil is to shoot from space to see it home.Where one was perhaps tempted to genuinely think Hurley's character might work for the government in the first film, and her resistance to Powers' initial advances saw her informed enough to batter each of them away, the female accomplice here is the opposite. Practically begging for sex from the off, Heather Graham's American agent Felicity Shagwell fulfils the role of what is essentially eye-candy to Hurley's (dare we say it?) actual characterisation. The dynamic of their relationship reads: where before, Kensington wouldn't take what Powers wanted to give he is now stuck not being able to receive what Shagwell is crying out to provide. For that to be your central joke, on top of everything else that's wrong with it, means that this is a messy entry indeed.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Yeah baby, yeah? No baby, no! The sequel to Myers' international hit, that relished in spoofing popularised spy films, is as groovy as a frequently used fembot. Equipped with the viscosity of toilet humour and the stickiness of overextended outdated gags. What may have been funny once, with its apparent timely comedy, no longer applies today. Austin's nemesis, the wonderfully wicked Dr. Evil, travels back in time to steal his ""mojo"" and plans to build a frickin' laser beam on the moon to decimate US cities.Ironically, Austin didn't lose his ""mojo"" back in 1969. It was 1999. When this was released. Because apparently mainstream audiences craved onscreen horniness and jokes of a sexual nature. Humour involving: intercourse, chastity, foreplay, anal and phallic synonyms. The latter admittedly was executed methodically by splicing dialogue mid-way through various conversations to create one long free-flowing (pardon the pun) gag about said penis. Oh, and a mildly entertaining scene involving shadows in a tent. And maybe I'll be generous enough to admit that the name Ivana Humpalot had me snigger.But crikey! Myers, you poor little bugger! Despite his energetic performance, this has not aged well in the slightest. The non-existent overwrought plot just to string along various unwelcomed jokes. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me breaking out a rendition of ""Just the Two Of Us""? Zip it. Fat Bastard consistently talking about his ""sexeh bodeh"" and erratic bowel movements? Suckle on my ""zipple"". The countless recycled jokes ranging from Scott's daddy issues to Mustafa's inability to die? Zip it real good! A penis-shaped rocket? Austin walking naked whilst the camera blocks his genitalia with phallic objects? I'm starting to think this film made me gay! And don't get me started on Austin drinking liquified excrement.

45,Anonymous_Maxine,The sequel that should never have been made.,3,6 November 2002,"First of all, I am not saying that a sequel to Austin Powers should never have been made just because this movie was so awful, but more because the first one is not really the kind of comedy that should be followed with a sequel. What you have in the original Austin Powers is a brilliant spoof of the cheesiness of the James Bond movies (a spoof that NEEDED to be made) that does a tremendous job at what it sets out to do and leaves virtually nothing for a sequel to accomplish, and that's exactly what this movie does - nothing.Yes, there are some laughs in the movie, Fat Bastard had his moments and even MiniMe was funny (for about three seconds). Heather Graham delivers hopefully the most boring performance of her career (if it gets any worse than THIS.), Elizabeth Hurley is back for a brief and only slightly embarrassing cameo at the beginning of the film, and Seth Green is back and on auto-pilot doing exactly the same thing he did in 1997. Therein lies the downfall of The Spy Who Shagged Me, it is probably the most blatant and shameless cash-in on the success of the original film of any sequel ever made.Fat Bastard and MiniMe are the only two original ideas in this entire film, and neither of them are very funny. It is painfully obvious that this is third grade humor because of the way that it tries to make us laugh at people with physical malformations - that's just not very good taste and is completely uncreative filmmaking. The whole film plods through thinly-disguised rehashes of the exact same jokes that we saw in the original, and the problem is that they are so obvious and so desperate that we are more likely to be embarrassed than to laugh.The brilliant spoof of the James Bond films that we saw in the original Austin Powers is traded in for a lot of trashy jokes and gross-out scenes such as the bedroom scene with Felicity Shagwell and Fat Bastard, and the result is that we are both disappointed with the movie and feel cheated because we just paid to basically see a bad version of what we saw two years ago.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Dr. Evil decides to travel back in time to 1969 to steal Austin's mojo and plans on destroying Washington, D.C.

On the other side, his nemesis Dr. Evil(also Mike Myers) is up to his tricks again. He develops a miniature clone of himself, hence Mini-Me(Verne Troyer) whom he loves dearly. His son Scott Evil(Seth Green), total feels resented by them. Dr. Evil always tells him to ""Zip it!"", whenever he tries to correct his not-so bright father. As for Austin, he feels so useless when Evil's foreign crony Fat Bastard(Myers) steals his ""mojo"". That tubby two-tone has the lowest self-esteem of all. He tries to eat Mini-Me, he gets kicked in the ""goolies"" by Felicity Shagwell(Heather Graham), and a loser in love. At least Austin help give him a bolster of confidence.

49,elshikh4,All of The Above (with Filth !),1,1 January 2011,"Some movie series are all about their original one; namely were better being unmade as series. (Austin Powers) is one of them, since everybody knows that the first is the best, and the rest is whether a repetition (The first sequel), or a chain of bad sex jokes (the second sequel).Everything and everyone in (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me - 1999) are recycled from (Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery - 1997). Even the gags. For instance, (Heather Graham) redoes the same role that (Elizabeth Hurley) did in the original, the romantic montage with (Burt Bacharach)'s music, a sequence where the lead walks sad in the streets, the lead's routine over a dead guard,.. etc etc. Bond movies have trademarks, but at least their action sequences differ every time. Now that parody thinks its comedy / in place of Bond's action; trademarks that must be all redone. Accordingly, this is not a decent spoof; it's just something that repeats itself!Add to that, a certain amount of filth, though I believe that filth and comedy don't work, rather filth kills comedy. The intro with the lead naked, having endless visual metaphors for his penis is shocking and ugly. (Fat Bastard) is one of the most repulsive and unfunny characters ever appeared on screen. Naturally, drinking the excrement is something to make some ones, I don't want to know, laugh for reasons that I hardly stand. In simple words: hell on earth means moments like this!(Robert Wagner), as (Number 2), is shamefully used. The smart scenes are anywhere but here. Yes, in this movie there is sincerity towards spoofing the 1960s and Bond, but in less freshness and abundance than its antecedent. In fact, all the memorable moments of Austin Powers' world are from that antecedent!Good points: stealing the Mojo as a start, (Seth Green) as (Scott Evil), (Will Ferrell)'s cameo, and the parody of (Will Smith)'s ""Just the two of us"". Generally, this is so little to distinguish a movie!The cold hard truth is that (Mike Myers) made a nice parody in 1997 that nobody saw unless on VHS. Then the producers, late as usual, noticed the strong potentials. So they asked (Myers) for another one, or a remake, and he responded by writing the first again, however with bigger money. He said that this one in hand needed more time to write due to the complications of the time travel; which didn't make a noticeable difference compared to the first, or more fun than it either.

However, at other times it was like this cat just got too much into the slapstick silly humor that ruins many films; which is definitely not my sort of bag baby. I do have to acknowledge Mr. Mike Myers for the immense diversity he brings in both the Austin and Dr. Evil characters. Speaking of our favorite evil medical school graduate, let me just say that Dr. Evil was hilarious. He was actually  more switched on than Austin in this film. Also the characters of Scott Evil, Fra Faubrisima, and Number Two continue to bring this series a very shagadelic supporting cast. The biggest or should I say smallest powerful debut was that of the crowd favorite Mini-me. Mini-me defintely provides big laughs.

This film by Jay Roach is more of a futuristic space ride story than a shaggy dog tale.One of the reasons why this film has somewhat failed to deliver its shares of laughs is due to the fact that a futile attempt has been made to make a spoof out of James Bond films.This has created a dismal artistic porridge of low comic and mystical intensity where spies seem to rub shoulders with all and sundry.It can also be felt that beautiful actresses have absolutely been wasted.This is the reason why Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham appear as mere pretty dolls who have been offered almost nothing but minor roles.An important information for the viewers is that veteran actor Michael York is the one person who really acts in this rather confused film.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
54,drqshadow-reviews,Average Follow-Up That Cites the Original Far Too Frequently,6,15 March 2012,"The second installment in Mike Myers's gentleman spy parody is something of an ugly duckling when compared to its siblings. Tossing away the more grounded themes and aspects of the first film, it dives headfirst into a sea of slapstick and never comes up for air. It's not a bad movie, nor is it unfunny; it merely dips into the well of recurring gags from the original too frequently and deals unfavorably with a tough set of growing pains. The reverse time traveling central plot is half-baked and doesn't work, a shortcoming which the movie itself acknowledges by literally telling the audience not to take things too seriously. That may make for a good standalone punchline, but it doesn't solve the problem and following in the footsteps of an excellently-written first film makes it tough not to expect more. New cast members Mini Me and Fat Bastard are brilliant additions who steal the spotlight every time they're on-screen, but Myers and flavor of the month Heather Graham never really connect as a duo.

56,slokes,The Man With The Golden Pun,6,20 October 2007,"The first Austin Powers movie was a shot-in-the-dark comedy Michael Myers pretty much made for himself and a few friends, little imagining the fuss it would spawn. This time, Myers and his alter egos set out to build a middle-brow entertainment franchise. At least they got the money part right.After spending the first movie adjusting to life in the 1990s, superspy Austin Powers (Myers) is pulled back into his native 1960s to save his mojo from the evil Dr. Evil (Myers), who has stolen it with the help of traitorous Scot Fat Bastard (Myers). Will Austin save his mojo, and not incidentally, the world?While not as satisfying or clever as the first Powers film, ""Spy Who Shagged Me"" does make you laugh, especially the first time you see it. Fat Bastard is a terrific new addition to the Powers tribe, a nasty self-worshipping slob who wears a metric ton and has an appetite that is boundless, morally as well as physically.""Listen up, Sonny Jim, I ate a baby!"" FB declares. ""Baby: The other, other white meat!""Also great is Verne Troyer as Dr. Evil's stunted replicant, Mini-Me. Troyer's tiny stature makes for a good initial guilty laugh, but Troyer throws himself into the role with the same kind of abandon and hidden talent Myers employed in the first film. Mini-Me's confrontations with Dr. Evil's biological son Scott (Seth Green) is an entertaining subplot throughout.Myers himself is a bit of a mix. As Fat Bastard, he is about as funny as he's ever been on screen. As Austin and Dr. Evil, he's a little too much too often. Dr. Evil seems to be after laughs from the MTV Music Awards crowd, mocking rap videos and repeating old gags like telling Scott to be quiet (this time with the catch phrase ""Zip it"" rather than ""Shh..."") Austin is a grab bag of catch phrases, interspersed with the occasional double entendre, like when his latest lady, Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), notices he activates his apartment lights by clapping his hands.""When did you get the clapper?"" she asks.""November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore leave,"" he replies.Graham is beautiful to look at but a bit of a damp noodle otherwise, which goes for much of ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" Sure, you have the clever set design, costumes, and music that the original ""Austin Powers"" had in spades, but the heart of the enterprise is missing here.

How obvious are the jokes?  How obvious is a pratfall?  (I think it would be funny if Dr. Evil had a pratfall about - now.  No, I was wrong.  It wasn't funny.)

The world's favorite swinging spy of the 60s is back and, since he's no fun unless he's single, his new wife Vanessa is dealt with before the opening credits ever roll. While Austin is wrapping up his marriage, Dr. Evil returns from the cold reaches of space with a new plan: he has developed a time machine and travels back in time to 1969, where Austin is still frozen, and steals his mojo. After weakening the super spy, Dr. Evil continues with his new plan for world domination. He has installed a massive laser on the moon (which he calls a ""Death Star"") and will hold the world hostage in 1969 for $100 billion dollars...or he will, if the President can stop laughing at the ludicrous ransom demand. Determined to regain his mojo and save the world, Austin teams up with an American CIA agent, the sexy Felicity Shagwell. With his time-traveling Volkswagen, Austin returns to his element for the best movie in Mike Myers' trilogy.Whereas the first movie came off as a solid spoof of the 60s spy genre, the new movie begins shifting into more outright zaniness. Some of the gags that got the biggest laughs in the first film return (e.g. the ""shh/zip it"" bit between Dr. Evil and Scott, Dr. Evil's love of ""frickin"" and finger quotes) and there are plenty of new ones to keep it fresh. The movie also introduces everyone's favorite gag characters: Fat Bastard and Mini-Me. More than ten years since this movie premiered, I'm still hearing people quote Fat Bastard and Vern Troyer will forever be known for his role as Dr. Evil's 1/8th size clone. It's not far enough in the series for the humor to get old, and the new elements make this my favorite AUSTIN POWERS. I saw it in theaters and never stopped laughing. There is the usual 007 spoof elements, with nods to YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and MOONRAKER and plenty more.Mike Myers ups the ante in this film, adding an extra character to his ensemble. Now, in addition to Powers and Evil, Myers is Fat Bastard. He hasn't lost his spark yet at this point and his characters are as fun as ever. Elizabeth Hurley returns for the film opening to tie up the loose ends as newly married Vanessa Powers, but the new blood here is Heather Graham as Agent Shagwell. We couldn't have an AUSTIN POWERS movie without Austin lusting after his fellow agent, so the marriage is overruled in a quick and easy deus ex machina moment. It's acceptable here for a fun pre-credits gag to keep the story moving, but Myers would go to ruin the end of GOLDMEMBER with the same method. The rest of the regular cast returns: Michael York, Mindy Sterling, and Seth Green. Seeing as how the film is set in 1969, Rob Lowe steps in to play a younger Number Two (great job, too...nailed a lot of Robert Wagner's mannerisms).

64,m-47826,A lot better than the first movie.,6,17 October 2020,"Just like everyone else said, it's one of those rare cases where the sequel is better than the original. It's nostalgic to both late 90s and what we imagine of what the 60s were. Mike Myers shines in the movie, that is extremely silly, but fun to watch. And laugh at all the stupid jokes. Heather Graham is a good female lead, even better than Elizabeth Hurley, in my opinion. And the rest of the colorful cast is hilarious in equal measures. True some of the humor is heavy-handed, but never off putting. And would be deemed so offensive these days, it's like it was green lit on a fluke. It's small scale blockbuster comedy, but still far superior to anything theaters/TV has to offer these days. Cool cameos and guest stars, by the way.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

66,KUAlum26,More inevitable cheekiness from Myers,8,21 April 2007,"The follow-up to 1997's Austin Powers:International Man of Mystery was probably not a certainty form the get-go:if I recall correctly,the first Austin Powers was NOT the smashing success of a box-office film that many involved initially imagined,and had it not been for a strong reaction from video and DVD renters,the franchise may've stopped at one. Since I happened to enjoy the first one(saw it on video BTW),I can honestly say that while the sequels seemed to have depreciating value,I'm still glad that Myers and company went ahead with the follow-ups.Now acclimated to the '90s,Austin(Myers,who else?)is about to settle into wedded bliss when he's attacked in his honeymoon suite by a legion of Fembots,given marching orders by a refugeed Dr.Evil(Myers,see previous ref). It seems that Evil's back trying to destroy the free world,this time with the aid of a time machine of his own making. Of course,the British secret service ALSO has a time machine(of course),and Austin races through time to stop Evil's plans,this time with the help of one Felicity Shagwell(Heather Graham,beautiful,sexy,game,and yet somehow out of her element here),an American NOC agent from the year 1969. A whole series,moving almost in waves,of sight-gags,verbal plays and yet more homages to Bond and Bond-type movies of the '60s,basically keeps the continuity of the original going seamlessly. Much of the cast from the last movie-- particularly Robert Wagner as the chief Hench,Seth Green as sullen son Scott Evil,Mindy Sterling as Frau FArbissima,Michael York as Basil Exposition and Will Ferrell as Mustafa the Assassin(who must be asked the same question THREE times in order to get information. One of my favorite gags from the movie)--are back,supplemented by Rob Lowe as the younger Number Two,Verne Troyer as Evil's identical clone,one-tenth his size and Myers again as Fat Bastard,a Scotish assassin with a violent temper who weighs a metric ton(I think I'm paraphrasing there),among others. Cameos by(among others) Burt Bacharach(as from the previous film)and Elvis Costello are added to give the film it's small slice of romanticism. Jay Roach returns to direct this one,and he,as usual,is near transparent in allowing Myers(not only star and co-producer but also screenwriter)to pretty much take this film as high,low,far,close,loud,soft and whatever as he fancies. While the original's flavor seems to be getting steadily diluted by the ""franchise effect"" of sequels(in other words,the effect that kind of makes a movie more of a ""product"" than a piece of entertainment),it still has the same sass,cheeky humor and fun to keep it quite enjoyable.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

It has all of the key ingredients for a good sequel. But unfortunately, The Spy who shagged me falls flat compared to International man of mystery. I have one huge problem with Austin Powers: The Spy who shagged me. But before I state the problem, let me state the good things about it. The Spy who shagged me has a few big laughs. Heather Grahm isn't quite as attractive as Elizabveth Hurley but I still liked her. Soem of the original cast returns. Now, the problem that I had with The Spy who shagged me is too immature for me. Some of the characters are gross. Fat Bastard wasn't even in James Bond and for some reason he's in this. Just looking at him is gross. There are fart jokes and crotch jokes occasionally. I think the film has some big laughs, but not as much as I was hoping for. Some parts in it are really funny. But most of the film seems like an immature attempt to recapture our interest. I liked Austin Powers: The spy who shagged me. It is the worst in the trilogy. I give it a mild recommendation despite it's immaturity.The Plot:Austin Powers returns for the second time. This time around, his mojo has been stolen from Fat Bastard, an assassin working for Dr. Evil.

72,jeremycrimsonfox,Austin Is Back And Is Raunchier Than Ever,8,7 December 2019,"The Spy Who Shagged Me is the second Austin Powers movie, and it shows the International Man Of Mystery is back and raunchier than ever. However, Dr. Evil is also back, and he plans to go back in time to steal our hero's mojo. Now shagless, Austin is going back to the 1960's to get it back, and stop Dr. Evil, who is joined by a midget clone pf him named Mini-Me.This film is a good example of how sequels should be. And it starts by taking the raunchy humor the original is known for up a notch. From the intro where Austin walks around a hotel naked. which leads to some sexual innuendos, you know they kept Austin true to the first film. Also, the film references some popular stuff at the time (like Dr. Evil appearing on The Jerry Springer Show and getting into a fight with another guest and even Jerry himself, which mirrors the controversy the talk show got into the year before with the guests fighting), However, it has a good story and lots of action and humor.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
73,Karl Self,The Movie That Bored Me,3,14 June 2005,"This is the type of sequel that does nothing for you except make you wish you were watching the original, and maybe also getting a refund. Not only -- to quote some IMDb heuristics -- is it no ""Citizen Kane"" or ""not quite as good as the International Man Of Mystery episode"", but rather it is very clearly inferior sequel in every aspect, as if they had used all the cutting-room-floor snippets from part one and strung them together with Jerry Springer and a Moon Base.Just for instance, in part one we had the father-son conflict between Dr. Evil and his disenfranchised offspring Scott, which was well acted and written, and which the viewer could generally relate to. In part two Dr. Evil acquires a midget clone and the two sing ""Just The Two Of Us"" together. Not only did I not find the whole skit funny, I simply had no idea what it was supposed to be about. It's a bit like someone starting a joke by saying ""You know how those Nigerians? How they always cycle around on blue bikes wearing woolen balaclavas whilst reciting the Gettysburg Address?"", and although you would dearly like to have a laugh at someone else's expense you have to break the spell by saying ""I'm sorry, what are talking about?"" (I later found out that it was supposed to be a reference to 'The Island Of Dr. Moreau', although I still don't understand what sense a parody of a bad film which hardly anyone has seen is supposed to make, or how it could possibly fit in with the whole Swinging Sixies-James Bond theme of Austin Powers). To make things worse, Mini-Me actor Verne Troyer can't act. Call me a stickler or even a new man, but just dressing a small person as Dr. Evil simply won't cut it with me in the humor department.But, saddest of all, Austin Powers' love interest. Here we are forced to witness Heather Graham being hopelessly outperformed by Elizabeth Hurley (Elizabeth Hurley, for Christ's sake!) who had that role in the first episode. Graham is, as many commentators in this forum have astutely noted, dishy and looks rather fetching in hot pants. But she comes across as so cold and bland that I, personally, would prefer to shack up with one of the fem-bots from part one. Or Frau Farbissina. Or that NORAD RADAR operator. Anyone.Ultimately ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" was intended to cash in on the success of ""International Man Of Mystery"" and it did just that, taking in more on its opening weekend than the original during its entire run. While that is to be expected, I am a bit taken aback by the fact that so many viewers seem to more than happy for not being given an even break for their ticket money -- it simply doesn't bode well for future Hollywood sequels (on the other hand, it would account for the astonishing run of the ""American Pie"" series).",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
74,Beta_Gallinger,"An inferior sequel, as usual, but overall, still reasonably funny",7,6 April 2009,"Back when I watched the three Austin Powers films as a teenager (after ""Goldmember"", the last one, had come into stores), I believe this one was my favourite. However, it's been six years since I first saw this Austin Powers sequel, and there are comedy films I found highly amusing at the time which I've found rather dull in recent years. Fortunately, this is not one of them. It has held up better than certain other silly comedies I saw around that time. My last couple viewings of this one certainly haven't lived up to my previous ones, as I have found it to be more of a hit-and-miss comedy than I did before, but at least I still found it funny enough for the most part.Dr. Evil has figured out how Austin Powers always succeeds in foiling his evil plansthe secret agent's mojo! So, the madman has created a time machine, which he uses to travel back to 1969, two years after Powers was frozen, to steal his mojo and continue his plans for world domination! While Austin Powers is still in 1999, unaware of his foe's time travel, his love-making session is cut short as he immediately knows what he has just lost! He is soon informed by Basil about what Dr. Evil has done, and sent back to 1969, where he is to try and retrieve his mojo and once again foil the evil doctor's plans to take over the world. After he arrives back in the 60's, he is soon joined by CIA agent Felicity Shagwell, who becomes his sidekick on this mission. Together, they must try and found out where Dr. Evil's hideout is, as the madman plans to blow up Washington D.C.! This sequel showed Mike Myers continuing in the roles of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, but he also introduced a new alter ego, Fat B%$#&*%, Dr. Evil's stereotypical Scottish henchmen, who weighs one metric ton, and adds quite a bit of toilet humour to the film. I was a fan of this character when I was a teenager, but no longer care much for his gross-out antics. Heather Graham's performance as Austin Powers' sidekick also brings this movie down. The way she says her lines is sometimes almost embarrassing. Fortunately, this sequel did introduce at least one amusing new character, Dr. Evil's miniature clone, Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer. Also, the original characters who returned in this film are still funny, if they were in the first place. We get more of the same antics from Myers' two previous alter egos, including more humorous conflict between Dr. Evil and his son. Like the original, this sequel has a number of comic highlights, such as Dr. Evil taunting Number Two while bouncing a big globe in his face, the crude shadow gag, Mini-Me's sudden attack on Austin Powers, and more.It seems ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is generally considered inferior to its predecessor (like most sequels), and I guess I'm now with the majority, which wasn't the case a few years ago, though I've definitely never been as disappointed by it as certain other fans of the original ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" have been. Some gags from the original Austin Powers movie from 1997 were rehashed for this 1999 sequel, but they tend to still be funny, and the film also introduced some new elements to the franchise, some good and some bad, as I've pointed out. With this first sequel to Myers' James Bond spoof, the comedian brought us more crude and sometimes juvenile humour (like he did again with the second sequel, ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"", in 2002), which some like and some obviously hate with a passion. Despite the flaws I've mentioned, I still think this is another decent Bond spoof overall, like the original, and unlike several other Bond spoofs I've seen.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
75,vip_ebriega,"Certified ""Shaggadelic"".",8,12 May 2008,"My Take: Just as funny, if not funnier, than the first.More financially successful than the first film, AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, the sequel to the successful and cleverly hilarious AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, continues the silly, spy-spoofing escapades of that horny 60's spy with bad teeth Austin Powers (Mike Myers), who once again comes across the ineptly sinister Dr. Evil (also by Myers), who is once again holding the world for ransom with a giant ""laser"" (he can't resist saying it without those quotation marks). Upon going back to the 60's after stealing Austin Powers' Mojo, with help from incredibly obese minion Fat Bastard (a third character played Myers), we are also introduced to a subplot concerning Evil's relationship with his son Scott (Seth Green) and a miniature clone he prefers to call his Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). After following Evil to the 60's to retrieve his Mojo, he is also involved with fellow agent Felicity Shaggwell (Heather Graham). While the first film is with an abundance of jokes that hit the right timing, this sequel specializes in providing abundance. One joke is quickly followed by another, and at least one is better than the last. Myers once again makes the best of his characters, making them funny, but his character as Fat Bastard is often unnecessary. Although that character is funny to the least, some are awfully too gross, perhaps giving only the chance to make the film more gross than the first.But the very few flaws this film has, it's a comedy and as a comedy, it works immensely. The jokes are in abundance and are all terrifically hilarious. There is are a number of jokes that exceed the PG-13 rating, but the film can find its right audience.

76,Stampsfightclub,Not as groovy as the first,7,25 July 2008,"Mike Myers (Shrek) writes and stars in this spy spoof sequel as Dr Evil travels back to the 60's to steal Austin's mojo in a plan to take over the world.International man of mystery was excellent, goofy yet sophisticated with daft humour and interesting characters and a real comedy take on the spy genre. This critically acclaimed sequel follows the same route with the same weird and wonderful central protagonist Austin Powers who has a new sidekick, Felicity Shagwell, played with some charm by Heather Graham.Myers also throws in an array of new characters, all comically arranged for extra humour, such as Mini Me, Fat B*****d and Robin Spitz Swallows, all interesting and crude in their own way, a useful technique in the spoof genre.Though lacking the sophistication and humour of the first, this sequel does have many giggles and a fairly gripping plot to keep you hooked, though inconsistent there are twists and turns as well as many jokes for the more adult viewer.Myers must be praised for his writing and his acting as all different characters. Though humour isn't on top form, he has spread diversity throughout the characters and does well in achieving the predictability in a comic light, with different techniques used for variety.The character of fat B*****d is obviously a spoof, and a very horrible and crude one at that, so horrible I couldn't even look at the screen when he was on.Others, who include Graham, Rob Lowe and Michael York are all average in their roles, and all could have done with perhaps more airtime to cement their roles into the plot.The cinematography and graphics are well used, and one of the final scenes involving Dr Evil and his shuttle is very funny. The writing is good, not great by Myers and in conclusion, the film is a watchable spoof, portraying the genre well but inconsistent with average performances from the supporting cast and doesn't have the build that the first had.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
77,Mister-6,"Shaken, not ""Shagged""....",7,30 November 1999,"I'll give ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" credit - it at least foregoes the story for the gags.Most people will tell you the story is the most important thing in a comedy. WRONG - the most important thing in a comedy is if you LAUGH.  And, here, I laughed.Meyers is not only back as our man Austin and his own nemesis Dr. Evil, but as evil henchman Fat Bastard (another Scot!  Who knew?).  And he knows how to milk the laughs.  There are still a few cliches of the spy genre that get a good rolling here (evading a barrage of death attempts, the introduction of ""the babe"", questioning the assassin, etc.)  But there are a few jabs you may not notice if you don't catch a lot of other movies.  For instance, this is without a doubt the only spy movie where you'll see visual and verbal references to ""Star Wars"", ""The Great Santini"", the Marlon Brando remake of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" and rap videos.  Maybe they could have exploited the time travel scenes for a few more laughs but they'll do.Graham plays Shagwell pretty blandly, Wagner is only here briefly, York returns only intermittently as Basil Exposition, Lowe does a decent enough imitation of Robert Wagner, Udenio manages to get a few more laughs this time around but the real treat is Troyer as Mini-Me.  Even if he does give off an ""Oompa-Loompa vibe"", he makes several scenes of the movie enjoyable (his and Meyers' fight scene is the stuff of legend.In fact, there are many choice comedy scenes here.  The ""stool sample scene"" (let's just call it that), could be seen coming down Main Street but for gross-out laughs, it does the trick (""Tastes kind of...nutty!""), and so do Fat Bastard's scenes - all of them reveling in the fact that he's fat and a... well, you know what I mean.  And that tent scene on Dr. Evil's Island has to be seen to be appreciated.  Mere words just can't do it justice.
It's no secret that the movie ends with the possibility of a sequel.  Will there be one?  That's the deal, you know - no less than two sequels for every hit movie in Hollywood nowadays.  And if they happen to be good sequels, all the better.""Shagged"" is about as good as can be expected.

The Spy who shagged me just copies too many of the jokes that were in International man of mystery. They are not precise replications, but the type of joke is just too similar. The only things (being shallow) that seem to have changed are the music (which is better), the story (not really) and the eye candy (which is younger, but does not portray her given character as well as Miss Hurley did / no offense Miss Graham). If I were you I'd not watch both films shortly after one another, for you might not enjoy it. Wait some time.

I just think that most of the time sequels to comedies are unnecessary since most of the humour and gags are recycled. Sure here too some of the gags are recycled but there are mostly new ones.Dr. Evil, defeated in the first film, wants to take revenge on Austin Powers stealing his Mojo and making him shagless (without erections anymore). So for most of the movie, with the help also of Heather Graham, he tries everything for having his Mojo back. In the meanwhile there are many vignettes with the supporting characters.The bottom line is that it's a good sequel. The plot is very original compared to the predecessor and all the actors, especially Myers with his various characterizations, are good. Even veterans Robert Wagner and Tim Robbins are hilarious in their small supporting roles. My only complaint about the movie is that at times the humour is not very kid-friendly (and I would think twice before showing it to kids under 12).

Felicity pulls weird things from a duffel bag while Austin bends over for some reason. The scene turns into some very funny material. Another hilarious sequence happens as Austin Powers and Dr. Evil's side kick  Mini-me have a combat in a spaceship.   ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is a mismatched comedy, one that could have been so much better if the filmmakers and director M. Jay Roach would have inserted less plot and fewer characters and added more slapstick/perverted humor. As it stands ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is a little above average, but not quite enough to recommend. 			 Brought to you by New Line Cinema",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
92,alice liddell,They didn't have to cross off 'better' in the posters.,8,3 August 1999,"It is often said of films which attempt to parody the James Bond ethos (eg Casino Royale) that it is impossible to spoof a spoof.  Bunkum.  Bond films are not spoofs.  They are deadly serious about their hero and the values he represents.  Neither he nor his antics are ever made risible.  He may be wry and humorous, but these are qualities of the macho power the films endorse, like his virility.  Bond films are brilliantly entertaining (except Roger Moore, obviously), but they are also reactionary, imperialist celebrations of a repressive code that deserves spoofing.AP2 - despite the seemingly freeform Airplane-style barrage of gags - is a rich example of the spoof genre, and immeasurably better than the happy accident of the original. Appropriately for a sequel, it is concerned with image, pastiche, reproduction (Dr Evil/Mini-me/Scott; Evil/Austin/Fat Scots person (we're not allowed cuss, are we?)/Mike Myers; Austin/Austin ten minutes ago, etc.), and the consequences of this.  A knowing post-modern artefact, the present of the film eerily mirrors at the end the 1960s of its inspiration.Austin, as a photographer in the David Bailey mode (right down to the foul teeth) should be an observer, yet is the main participant in the action - the boundaries between subject and object have broken down, there is no room for critical distance, and, hence, opposition.  Despite the bright kitsch fun (and it is supremely enjoyable), the characters are trapped in a tragic loop of conformity.  In this way, the movie owes much to that other 1960s photographer-in-peril classic, Blowup.This is fugured most prominently in Austin as the James Bond figure.  Unlike 007 (except Lazenby), Austin is a tragic character, he cannot master time and space, he is caught in a vortex where the rules of time and space are exploded.  The result of this is a crucial loss of virility and identity, the essence of the superspy.Dr Evil is the mirror image of this: unlike the typical, sterile  Bond villain, Evil is a family man, and it is his confusions over his progeny which fatally handicap his effectiveness, which, in Blofeld, depended on clear-cut certainty and aloof, unreproducable power.  The impossibility of one man taking over the world, when there are replica midgets and whiney teenage sons to undermine his authority, is here shown in tragic, domestic detail, truly a subject worthy of Jerry Springer.This all makes the film sound deadly serious.  It's a hoot riot - persistantly laugh-out-loud, fall-off-seat, even-the-longueurs-are-amusing, inventive stuff.  It seems remarkable that characters in a spoof on 60s relics should prove more sympathetic, likeable and moving than the cardboard cutouts in an epic like The Phantom Menace.  Mike Myers, like all the great comedians he plunders, balances ingenious comedy with unexpected pathos - his gift is wayward and breathtaking.  Heather Graham is a worthy sidekick, giving herself generously to a thankless stock role, and transcending it with her astonishing talent (and, um, yeah, she's quite pretty too).  It'll be fascinating to see how Myers tops this.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I really enjoyed this film, I thought Heather Graham was very good as well. The most interesting creation of this new Austin Powers flick is the character of Mini-Me.

Mini Me was the one I couldn't stand. He wasn't very funny and I liked it better when Dr. Evil was just with Scott. He was kind of funny when he was singing with Dr. Evil and when he kept yelling EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Oh and also of course, his height but for all that it doesn't really make him a funny character after all. Once again Dr. Evil was hilarious and Felicity Shagwell who was played by Heather Gragham was very hott, yes indeed. If I was Austin, I wouldn't care if I didn't have my mojo, I'd still so her.

98,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: annoying repeat of 1st film,4,4 April 2002,"For every sequel movie, a decision has to be made. How close do we keep it to the original? Too distant is quite a creative risk which might result in a financial failure. Too close will lack the spark of originality that drew people to the first film to begin with. For example, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was good but a little more gory and added dumb characters (the kid and the singer) who didn't do much. They then fixed those elements for the 3rd film and added the interesting father relationship, a risk but it made the 3rd film an equal of the first.Austin Powers 2 is perhaps the most risk-averse sequel I have ever seen. The film is so close to the original that each scene can be fitted to a gag in the first movie. I started to count the exact matches and gave up somewhere around 20. And -- in a fine tradition of Saturday Night Live -- typically the repeated jokes are not worth telling twice. Frankly I was shocked and disappointed given how original and compelling the 1st film was that they didn't take any risks with the 2nd. The failure is even worse than the failure of ""Wayne's World 2"" to live up to ""Wayne's World"", another Mike Myers film.To go from worse to worst, the cast did not seem to really be trying, especially ""Seth Green"" (Dr. Evil's son) whom I have recently forgiven due his role in the new movie ""Rat Race"". A parody can't get buy simply by chaotic lampooning -- there needs to be an underlying story and tension to the parody film.Who should see this film:-- nobody, but do go see the original if you haven'tI am forced to give ""Austin Powers 2"" a 4 out of 10. Skip it even if you feel obligated by the coolness of the first one.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
99,Aylmer,uggghhhh.... so how is this funny? It's depressing!,5,11 January 2000,"If I had merely 1/600th of the monstrous advertising budget of this film, I think even I could have made a better movie.Relentlessly annoying, badly written, unfunny movie stars Michael Myers (not the Halloween one) basically making an ass of himself the way he does best. There are a total of two funny moments in this film (one a lengthy reprisal of the Jerry Springer show, though overdone; and another involving a guard idiotically jumping into a pool of magma).  Other than that, the humor is moronic, repetitive, and obnoxious.  Many of the Myers's monologues seem as though he is coming up with his dialog on the spot, particularly in the case of fat bastard.  It's mind-boggling how even Will Farrel's cameos wasn't even funny.  Is this what cinematic entertainment is coming to?  Had it the micro-budget the script deserved, this film would have been forgotten long ago.Of course this movie made a lot of money, even though it was directed with all the stylistic panache' of Ed Wood and Bruno Mattei, though far less humorous than any of their efforts.One more thing - what was Michael York doing in this movie?  I felt sorry for such a great actor being reduced to such a minimal cameo, though Charles Napier was just as much a victim in this film.

100,departed07,Outdoes the first film with more laughs and more stars,8,24 May 2008,"The first Austin Powers flick called ""International Man of Mystery"" was a sleeper hit in 1997 where it became something of a classic in video rentals with a sequel being inevitable in the works.In ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" Austin Powers (Mike Myers) finds out that his first love Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) was a fem-bot (half female/half robot) while receiving an urgent message from Basil Exposition (Michael York) that Dr. Evil (Mike Myers in another role) is on the move from his spaceship and headed back to Earth.Dr. Evil has more plans of his own with his old gang where he invents a machine to make a duplicate of himself but 1/8 his size call Mini-Me along with having a time portal to go back to 1969 and hoping to kill Austin Powers while being frozen. Instead he takes away his mojo that makes him sexual arouse with the help of a vile Scottish soldier by the name of Fat Bastard (or Fat B. to the offended). In the real world (1999) Austin Powers feels less of a man until realizing that he can go back in time to save his mojo and meet up with super hot agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) to find Dr. Evil and save the world again.Austin Powers 2 provides more laughs that aren't subtle like the original where audience members will get the hint faster along with seeing Mike Myers doing more than two roles (he plays Fat B. in the film as well) where he takes his comedy level to a whole new game besides playing Wayne in Wayne's World or before doing the voice of Shrek. While his character of Austin Powers is very childish at some times, it's mostly about Dr. Evil where his screen presences makes you laugh the hardest and want you leaving for more. Heather Graham is the perfect choice to play the sex-kitten where after seeing her role in Boogie Nights, she's a qualified sex symbol.This one is the best from the Austin Powers films.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Well, I *did* like the first film, so I guess you can say I liked the sequel as well -- as I said, they're basically the same film. I especially liked the scenes with Dr Evil and Scott Evil (Seth Green) -- hilarious is all I have to say about that. Heather Graham unfortunately lacked any feeling for her role as Felicity Shagwell -- she was a bad choice for the part even though she looks like she belongs in those sixties' outfits.

So if you liked it the first time, you should like it the second time.",8,25 October 2001,"AP2 (as I like to call it) takes place only minutes after the first one ended. Dr. Evil returns again to try and take over the world, and it's up to our favorite swinger to save the day. From 1999 to 1969, Austin gets his mojo raised, and manages to save the world and get the girl once again. Don't worry too much about plots and things like that, that's not the main draw of AP2. You go to see why Mike Myers is one of the funniest men in movies today. This time he plays not one, not two, but three characters. From Austin himself, to the ever diabolical Dr. Evil, to the immense Fat Bastard. All three have their own quirks and foibles that make them unique and funny. I don't think there's much doubt that my favorite out of the three is Dr. Evil. From the Jerry Springer opening, to his rendition of Will Smith's, ""Just the Two of Us"", he had me rolling in the aisles. And his sidekick, MiniMe was perfect.  What I was afraid of when I went to see this movie, is that it would fall to the comedy sequel death that other movies have. Take Ace Ventura 2: When Nature Calls for instance. All they did there was take the things about the original that were funny, and wring them out for 90 minutes in a sequel. I thought part two was nowhere near as funny as the original because all the second one was, was a rehash of the first. There was no originality involved. However, in AP2, I think Myers realized that this might happen, and he managed to take what everyone loved about the first movie, and build on it with other original ideas for the second. The idea of MiniMe was hilarious, and Fat Bastard was disgusting as well as funny (he has the funniest part of any movie ever!!!) It's things like that that made this movie able to stand on it's own feet. And lest I forget the ever beautiful Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell. Oh Behave! I don't remember a time when a women looked so good in every scene of a movie. Every scene. Heather's role was pretty much the same as Elizabeth Hurley's in the original, basically wearing as little as possible and smiling a lot. Personally, I prefer Elizabeth over Heather, but shhh...So overall, Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me was a very funny movie. I can't say it was as funny as the first one, but that's to be expected. No one was ready when the first one came out, but everyone is ready for this one, and the expectations were high.

109,troyputland,Surprisingly better than the first!,8,30 April 2015,"The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers' 2nd installment, hits the funny bone a lot harder than International Man of Mystery. The story is easy going; Dr. Evil (Myers) wants to destroy the world, Austin Powers (Myers) wishes to save it. That's it. This time though, he must do it without his mojo; the Doc went back in time to the 60's and stole it from Austin's cryogenic form. It reverses its role from the previous outing. IMOM saw the hero and villain hit the future with naivety, TSWSM has them bringing the 90's back with them. It makes little sense, has no new gags, but its execution is better. The poo and dick jokes outweighs the flops, which comes down to two things; new faces and old. Heather Graham surpasses Hurley in looks and sensuality. She's the girl that likes to 'hop on the good foot and do the bad thing'. Evil is Myer's more intricate character, the relationship with his son Scott (Green) is a constant barrel of laughs, from their family dispute on Jerry Springer to father & son therapy. Myer's new addition Fat Bastard is a loose cannon who gets the worst (jokes) of the worst, but Verne Troyer's Mini Me adds discrimination to the fold. Same as before, fans of the first will love, but it's very unlikely that TSWSM will gain new ones.Check out my other film reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

111,Silverzero,"An inferior sequel, more successful, but lacking the dry wit of its predecessor.",4,7 February 2003,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe Spy Who Shagged Me is a muchly overrated and over-hyped sequel. International Man of Mystery came straight out of the blue. It was a lone star that few people had heard of. But it was stunningly original, had sophisticated humour and ample humour, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.OK I'll admit, the first time I saw this film I thought it was very funny, but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The acting was OK, but Heather Graham cannot act. Her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. Those characters who bloomed in the first one, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.) are thrown into the background hear and don't get many stand-alone scenes. The film is simply overrun with cameos.
In particular, I hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed off Vanessa at the start and had Basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along. What was the point of that? They killed off Number 2 in the first one, and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever. This is supposed to be a spy-spoof, I don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film. It just goes on a trail, further and further away from the point.The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole Mini-Me `make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for gross-out humour. In total there's about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM.If this were the first movie of the series then I'd probably be easier on it. But the series started on a note of dry wit and then plummeted down to a level of gross out humour. So I say, only watch this film if you haven't seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one ultimate disappointment.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

114,Brogan,Juggling.,5,11 June 1999,"Juggling is the word that helps me describe this film.  I feel that writer/star Mike Myers, and director Jay Roach were juggling the jokes in this film that would appeal to both adults and teens.  Some of the jokes are hilarious, others are redundant (we've seen it before), and the rest are horrible.  The jokes are just downright silly, that would make a ten year old boy laugh his head off. If you've been in a coma, or like this film, a time-warp, Austin Powers is the cleverest spoof of the wonderful James Bond series.  In this sequal, Austin Powers returns to do battle again with Dr. Evil (also played by Myers), except he has to go back into 1969 to save his ""mojo.""  Austin meets up and teams with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham, who's in almost every New Line film) to help him recover his missing ""mojo.""Like I said before, some of the jokes work, others don't.  And this is a film that relies on it's comedy.  I think a joke is funny the first time you hear it, but the third or fifth time it gets silly.  Like in both the original and this film, Austin makes cruel and dark jokes after killing someone.  Heather Graham isn't as fun or sexy as Elizabeth Hurly.  And from time to time, Dr. Evil gets annoying.  The bit where Dr. Evil sings ""Just the Two of Us"" is a horrible mistake that is really a major minus to the film. There are still some good scenes and bits.  The new characters are the ones who help the film.  First there's Mini-Me (Dr. Evil's miniture clone) who doesn't say anything, but steals almost every scene that he's in.  I'm sure by the end of the summer that more people will remember Mini-Me than Darth Maul. The other character that helps the movie is played by Myers and it's Fat Bastard(Myers).  He is disgusting, but he is fresh, new, and very funny.Overall this is an o.k. film, if you enjoyed the original, you might like this.  If you didn't, then you won't like this at all.  But as for a comedy, it's only so-so.  Is it the funniest movie of the year?  No, that title still goes to ""ANALYZE THIS."" Is it worth watching, ""yes, at least once.""  This is a movie that will sure to please the men ages 8-35, others will just shake their head.  This film will bring in the crowd that made THE WATERBOY make over +$100 million, the rowdy teenage boys. ***1/2 (out of *****)",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

The original Austin Powers movie, International Man of Mystery, was a surprise hit and spawned this sequel, The Spy Who Shagged Me. This movie is funny, but feels tired, which is difficult to understand as it is only the second movie of the franchise. I think the problem with this movie is that it takes Austin Powers back to the 1960s, where he is from. Time travel movies are fun, when the characters are taken to a new time period, not the one they are originally from. The funniest jokes in the first movie came from the fact Powers, and Dr. Evil, were fish-out-of-water, and those are taken away from the audience in this movie.

For a start, most of the 'actually' funny parts were shown in the previews.  Secondly, heaps was just retread from the original. Thirdly, it was a bit too disgusting.  Fat Bastard was really revolting and, I thought, an unwelcome addition to the sequel.  Mini Me was better, Dr Evils take on Wil Smith's just the two of us was hilarious, and Scott Evil was absolutely fantastic.  The problem was that a lot of the jokes were very similar in nature, and so after a while I just got bored.  The references to other films and music from the 80s and 90s was very hit and miss.  The Jerry Maguire take was a bit monotonous,but then so was the film.  The first one was heaps better, hire it instead of seeing the sequel which is the same thing done with about half the humor.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
120,michael_the_nermal,"Fair Spoof of James Bond, but Not as Good as the First",5,27 February 2008,"This movie is best known for introducing Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's pint-sized clone, to the world, and afterword launched a thousand pop culture references, which also included an incessant barrage of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil impersonations of wildly varying quality both on television and in everyday conversation with one's friends and acquaintances. After the mediocre ""Goldmember"" installment had left the theaters, Austinmania thankfully died down, and hopefully we've heard our last ""Groovy, baby!"" for a long time. It was a catchphrase more annoying than ""show me the money!"" Anyway, with all that said, is ""Austin Powers II"" really worth all of the extreme amount of hype and imitation it produced? Mike Myers has an unenviable job of playing three important roles at the same time. He proved he is a master of performing bizarre and hilarious characters during his tenure on the skit comedy show ""Saturday Night Live"". The problem is his wacky, off-the-wall characters do not hold up well for a feature-length movie. Asutin Powers, the character, is a rather odd parody of James Bond, a hybrid of Bond, a ""Swingin' Sixties"" Mod hipster, and Maxwell Smart (in his goofy ineptness). Powers' catchphrases and jokes wear out their welcome very quickly, as does the sexual humor and sight gags involving Powers (which also proliferated the first movie). These gags and catchphrases, as well as Power's playboy persona, bore rather than entertain. The writers run the gags into the ground, and insult the audience's intelligence with the assumption that a crude sex gag done millions of times will always be funny. They are trite and unoriginal, and are the movie's greatest hindrance. The Austin character, in spite of his fiery, lustful mannerisms, is the blandest of the three characters Myers performs. He just rams this trite stock character into the ground.Dr. Evil, on the other hand, is eccentric, silly, and over-the-top evil enough never to wear out his welcome. Like any comic character, bizarre, childlike and surreal characterizations are always more fun to watch than trite parodies of stock characters who rely on shock humor and boring catchphrases. Rather than do a straight parody of a maniacal supervillain, Myers makes Dr. Evil a very original and odd villain by making him as goofy and strange as possible. Evil's idiosyncrasies are what make him the star of the movie. The Dr. Evil moments are the funniest. Of the three characters, Evil is Myers's best.Dr. Evil's fat Scottish henchman (whose name cannot be mentioned because it is an obscenity) is simply a framework on which to tack on crude shock humor and fat jokes, which grow boring really quickly and insult the viewer's intelligence. Amplified grossness does not equal amplified humor, which is a lesson the filmmakers of the Austin Powers series do not take in stride. The Scotsman does have his humorous moments, such as his hilarious ""Sexy Man"" song to Felicity during an awkward scene, but mostly his goofy charm is lost in a scene of pre-programmed flatulence recordings and pastel-colored pig slop. He is the least interesting of Myers's characters.Some will apparently compare Mike Myers's triple performance to Peter Sellers's roles in ""Dr. Strangelove."" There is no comparison. Sellers was a master actor who brilliantly channeled his oddball characters in a dark, subdued and intelligent dark comedy with little, if any, toilet humor. Myers's strengths are performing goofy characters in ten minute skits; beyond that, he pushes his talents to their utmost limits. He performs wildly off-the-wall weirdos in a flashy, expensive, glossy parody filled to the brim with toilet humor. His efforts are uneven at best.And what of Mini-Me, the unsung, unknown legendary Verne Troyer? He does well as the mute, yet ravenous Dr. Evil clone, but chose to make Mini-Me a diabolical, sadistic henchman rather than a smaller version of Dr. Evil. He is very funny in this role, and is, after Myers, the star of this movie. He holds his own in this role, but I think the fame of the Mini-Me character far outshines anything in this otherwise fair comedy. It's not a classic of the genre, but it is an excellent example of hype and publicity gone amok to the point where pop culture icon status is given to something that doesn't really deserve it.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I rated the first AP a 6... begrudgingly. I guess I gave it the benefit of the doubt because it was creative, unique and had such good intentions, but I rarely laughed..This movie is very similar. I rated the first 60% as a 5.5 and the last 40% as a 7.5. The math on that is a 6.3. Still I fudged upward again - this time to a 7 (my cutoff point for acceptability or for adding to my 1,200 movie collection).It was pleasant enough to view and there were some good hearty laughs in the second half.

122,danielll_rs,Nothing but great fun!,7,9 October 1999,"May contain spoilers.The year of 1999 was very good for cinema. Many great films were released this year: ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Cruel Intentions"", ""Go"", ""Notting Hill"" and others that weren't released in Brazil yet (""American Beauty"", ""The Sixth Sense"" -opening October 22 here-, etc). But if you want a break, just a break, watch ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"".The first film was also very funny and humorous, even with a small budget. But I think this one was someway better.The sound track is just great (specially the songs ""Beautiful Stranger"" and ""American Woman""). The jokes and the satires are hilarious, and so are the characters. Austin is ugly and funny as always. Felicity Shagwell, played by Heather Graham -gorgeous-, is much better than Elizabeth Hurley's Vanessa Kensington. Dr. Evil is simply hilarious. Here he has a clone (well... almost a clone), called Mini-Me (also great). There is also Fat Bastard, disgusting and unusual.Mike Myers proves that he's much better than Jim Carrey. He plays three characters in this film - Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard.There are really funny scenes, as the opening one, with Mike and Elizabeth Hurley, and the one with Mike and Heather in tent (the best in my opinion).So turn your brain off and enjoy ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"".

It was as hilarious the second time 'round as it was the first. Few films make me laugh out loud, especially more than once, but this one did. Yes, much of the humour is juvenile, did anyone expect otherwise? This film shows that it's possible to be crass and hilarious all at the same time, without going too far overboard (though someone should shoot Mike Myers for some of those purposely horrid puns!).The cameos were great (Will Ferrell was fab), the Jerry Springer scenes are awesome, Seth Green is great as usual...and Heather Graham?

126,refinedsugar,Stuck in a moment,6,17 February 2000,"The sequel has better production values, a boatload of hype and the cast works, but I couldn't shake the feeling sitting in the theater I'd seen a lot of it before. The original established the flow and this sequel pretty much follows the same path. Naturally making it seem a whole lot less fresh the second time out. Well, at least to me. 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' definitely has some memorable bits, but it's nemesis is that overhanging feeling of sameness.If you've seen the first AP movie, you can rightfully assume what to expect in this sequel. Which is good or bad depending on your taste for this whimsical in-the-here-and-now style of comedy. People who love it will cheer and those that don't will groan.Crack a smile, whip a instantly recognizable Austin Powers quote. There is no denying the movie has it's own charm, Myers has found a memorable character to latch onto and these flicks will forever be a part of pop culture lexicon. Just how well they date is another topic altogether. When the original came out, the attraction was it's originality, it's timing, and Mike Myers wacky new role. Here in the sequel, the Austin Powers character isn't boring, but he doesn't present that same energy you can only get the first time around. They surround him (again) with an entourage of zany characters and madcap moments, but it's beginning to feel played out already.Mike Myers, front and center, gets the laughing crown. No surprise there. Isn't hard to do when you're playing three characters. Meanwhile Heather Graham provides a foil and delicious eye candy to Powers and Will Ferrell (of Saturday Night Live fame) has a memorable return as one of Dr. Evil's assassins. It's a movie, sequel, meant to be enjoyed with little in the way of real expectations. It's not great. It's not timeless.

Having travelled back in time and stolen his ""MOJO"" from when Austin was cryogenically frozen, Austin then has to travel back to the sixties in order to recover the missing MOJO.Travelling back Austin encounters the beautiful Penelope Shagwell and a younger number two, exquisitely played by Rob Lowe, who must have been Robert Wagner in a past life, what then occurs is one of the funniest films to hit the screens since ""Airplane"".In the first film we were treated to a gag-a-minute joke-fest that occasionally mis-fired, however for Austin Powers 2, the jokes are better, his character more likable and the extra character added of Mini-Me, is one of the greatest film creations of the past 20 years. Ask people who the terminator is they know, ask who Indiana Jones is, they know, ask who Mini-Me is, chances are they'll do the impersonation of Doctor Evil introducing him. Every scene with Mini-me is hilarious, from him being inserted into his chair and trying to eat his cat, to his scene on the piano which makes me cry with laughter every time I see it.Add to that an early brief appearance by Elizabeth Hurley and an excellent piece of work by Seth Green as Scott Evil and you have most definitely the best of the series.

From the very beginning, when you see classic Star Wars introduction (praising their summer of 1999 competitor at the box office), they're telling you: This is a silly film. And they're proud of it.Yeah it's true: It's not as funny as the original, and the Austin Powers routines start to get quite old, but ironically, the villain saves the day in this film. While the first movie was about Powers, this one is about his nemesis: Dr. Evil. This character (also performed by Myers) delivers the best lines of the movie. I could even dare to say that is worth watching just because of Dr. Evil. That good was he.On the other hand, the plot is not as fresh as the first. If you were a fan of the original's bathroom humor you won't be disappointed Overall, a good time at the movies, some good laughs and some very disgusting moments (almost to the point of getting disturbing).

This time there is one more character for Myers to play, Fat Bastard who's only purpose is for Myers to make fun of fat people and to try to show that he is very talented. The result is like a Doctor Strangelove type of performance, though nothing of that quality. He does well in all three roles, but I just found the Fat Bastard character to get annoying and disgusting after a while. Even though there is still fresh humor, it gets old and gross which is a bad sign. Things also get worse in the third movie. Heather Graham fills the shoes as Austin's partner, and she does a good job of her comedy and her appeal. Michael York has a smaller role then he did in the first movie, but he manages to keep it together as well. Jay Roach's direction is more energetic then the first one as he tries to put in more parodys and has a slower pace. He also adds in some very sixties tones, which all works out well. The final confrontation on the moon is quite funny and of course there's always the clip from Independence Day. Sometimes the characters try to be funny when they're just stupid, but most of the movie keeps it together well to recommend it.

He performs three characters but manages to make each one feel unique, the makeup especially makes it difficult to realise they're all played by the same guy, I noticed that Austin and Fat Bastard were both Myers on my first viewing but it only dawned on me after googling it who played Dr Evil that he was also Myers. The music goes really well with the visuals and we get some great moments of visual comedy, especially the opening credits. I know that I'll watch this film again and while I may be piling up the praise a bit too much, remember this is a spoof film, it is honestly one of my favourite comedies and something I'd easily recommend to anyone. 8/10.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Bringing in Mini-Me and Fat Bastard helped move the story along...they are interesting characters. I wish he had kept Vanessa on board as his wife...but I guess a married Austin Powers would have slowed things down a bit and turned a few folks off. The gags are just as corny, though a few of them are kind of gross. But, hey...this picture is not meant to be taken seriously...nor should anyone really expect it to make sense in any other milieu than screen logic. As Basil Exposition and Austin tell us--in a shameless breach of the fourth wall--we should just forget the plot and enjoy ourselves. And that is the key to the hilarity of the movies...the reckless comic abandon, the situations that don't work, the gags that bomb--but are funny anyway, partially because they do bomb--and the hilarity and frivolity of it all makes it a worthwhile watch. I am going to have to get this film on DVD-- I watch it fairly frequently on VHS, and it's bound to wear out at some future point due to repeated plays. But is is a fun movie...and the Austin Powers series is the best of its genre to come along in many years.

143,GuyCC,"More of the same, but it still has its moments.",6,15 June 1999,"I was really looking forward to the new Austin Powers movie, and I found what I was looking for....  Sort of.  The first Austin Powers seem to be driven by a more coherent script, where as this film tended to indulge its silliness a little too often.  I was really disappointed with how the character of Vanessa Kensington was handled.  It voided out the whole romantic element of the first movie, and made Austin seem really shallow in how he handles that situation.  There were way too many loopholes in the whole time-travel idea, that was simply dismissed in the movie as ""sit back and enjoy yourself"".  While that's a ""convenient"" way to cover up that story element, it doesn't make everything easily dismissable in the long run. My biggest problem with the film was its using almost every single joke from the first film repeatedly.  What was hilarious in the first film, gave me a feeling of ""I've seen this before"" this time around.  However, the film did have its shining moments.  The original comedy bits were more often than not hysterical, with heavy parodies of ""Star Wars"" and even ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"".  Mini-Me was definitely the most entertaining of the new characters, stealing more than a fair share of the scenes.  His little dance halfway through the film pushed the bizarre comedy element into overdrive. Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell was simply drop-dead sexy in the film, as she spent more time trying to rev Austin Power's mojo than subdue it. It should also be noted that Rob Lowe's impersonation of Robert Wagner's ""Number Two"" character was so incredibly dead on, it was almost eerie. Overall, it was a fun movie, but the plot loopholes and numerous jokes from the first film kept it from being what it truly should have been.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
144,paulo20,Lots of (uneven) laughs... but I still liked the 1st one better,6,20 June 1999,"To be sure, this sequel to Austin Powers had heaps of laughs, perhaps more than the first one. There were lots of humorous scenes with Dr. Evil in particular. But I nevertheless liked the original better. I appreciate its brand of humor a whole lot more. It was fun, original satire. It didn't seem to go out of it's way to offend anyone. And the jokes may have not come as fast and furious, but the humor kept a consistent tone throughout.By contrast, AP:TSWSM was uneven. It ranges from witty to uproarious to flat to extremely raunchy. Speaking of raunchy, there's enough bawdy and scatalogical humor here to make There's Something jealous and Dumb & Dumber jealous.Also, the pop culture references are heaped on a little too liberally. Admittedly, I found most (or at least some) of them funny, hilarious even, but I miss the subtlety of the first film. There wasn't an obvious attempt to endear itself to the pop-culture reference fans.TSWSM relies on mimicking its predecessor in several moments for plot support or filler; perhaps too many. The ""quotation mark"" gesture made by Dr. Evil (and his Mini-Me), in particular, started to get real old, real fast. The first film, did it a few times and that was it; it didn't bash the poor thing into the ground.Hurley is sultrier, sexier and just plain better looking (imo) than Heather Graham. Hurley is a goddess, where Graham is a mere nymph. Furthermore, Hurley (whose performance in the sequel was as delightful as in the original; all 6 minutes of it) knew she was in a goofy parody, and her acting was purposefully cheesy to suit the film; it made her all the more charming. By comparison, and I could be wrong here but, in retrospect, I think maybe sometimes Graham was acting as if she was taking it all more seriously than she should have - especially in those silly maudlin scenes with her and Austin expressing their love for each other (*retch*). Frankly, I found parts of her Boogie Nights performance more ironic. And her timing was off.Like I said, I thought much of TSPWSM funny, but other aspects I found tiresome and I don't think I'll be interested in a second Austin sequel; the franchise has just about already burnt itself out for me.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

With Austin Powers 2 we see the arrival of such characters as Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, who inevitably help steer the sequel way from completely recycling every joke used in the first film. However, there is still that overlap, so a lot of the humor comes off a bit stale and tacky. There is virtually no end to the plot holes, inconsistencies, and various irregularities, but that is often a big part of the humor of the Austin Powers movies - making direct fun of the spy genre, as well as themselves.And, on a personal note, Heather Graham is by far more attractive than Liz Hurley, and she flaunts it with great respect for us, the juvenile minded male audience. Overall, I'd consider this sequel about on par with the original, not in any specific details, but in all-around entertainment value.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
147,liammurphy1,Funny sequel - but..,8,13 August 2003,"This sequel to 1997's 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery' is funny at times - but the crude and vulgar humour get repetitive after a while. it seems the screenwriters including Myers himself got bored with the script after the first hour and just bombard the screen with tasteless jokes.While the first movie was James Bond-ish and had something resembling a plot,The sequel has a lame story, although pretty good directionMyers looks bored throughout much of the film. The permanently bland Heather Graham is almost a bad an actress as Elizabeth Hurley. The once great actors Michael York and Robert Wagner look embarrassed.The movie is funny but perhaps not as funny as it thinks it isI'd give 3/5",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
148,RunningFromSatan,"Even groovier than the first, baby!",9,12 June 1999,"I have worshipped Austin Powers since the movie came out two years ago, but man, has it gotten better! I had to wait in line 30 minutes to get into the movie, that's how jam-packed the theater was, but boy, was it worth the wait! The movie was SO HILARIOUS!  The new characters were very well thought out before putting them into the movie (e.g. Fat Bastard) and Dr. Evil was funnier than ever (a whole new thing with ""ZIP IT!"", his references to nineties movies when he was back in 1969, and, of course, the ""Just the Two of Us"" rap).  Dr. Evil's rocket was funnier than ever (just see the movie to find out!).  But the thing I didn't get were the references to many things between 1970 and the late 80s (I wasn't born until the mid-1980s), for example ""Moon Unit Zappa"" was a reference to some girl's name, and the reference to The Exorcist when Dr. Evil was spinning around in his chair in the movie.  I didn't get them until my older sister told me about them. Younger audiences: Make sure you look them up before seeing this movie!Anyway, the plotline is fairly simple. Austin loses his mojo and has to find it.  Dr. Evil wants it because it is ""the essence, the libido, the 'Right Stuff',"" and when he tastes the mojo, he goes shagadelic over Frau Farbissina!  Did I lose you right there?  Sorry.  Heather Graham was great as Felicity Shagwell! ""Shagwell by name, shag-VERY-well by reputation!""  I have to say, though, the movie is funny right from the beginning credits, all of the way to the VERY VERY end (you'll be glad you stayed until the VERY VERY end!). Hint Hint: The credit scenes reveal an interesting fact about Scott Evil!All I have to say about this movie is that:1.  It's better than Star Wars: Episode 12.  It's NOT A BIG LETDOWN like some people have said (what squares!)3.  You can't miss a minute of it4.  Dr. Evil's rap is unforgettable5.

150,MadBadMovieman,Glad I saw it in the theater. Won't rent the video.,6,26 June 1999,A visually entertaining comedy for most scenes.  Especially Heather Graham. Mike Myers is very versatile and not afraid to use any material or take on any character but he went too far in some scenes.  I would not want my kids to see this movie due to the probable influence for imitation of dialogue and behavior.  I think they could have kept it funny without the disgusting and crude stuff.,Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
151,Jimmy-128,Ugh.,2,19 June 2000,"Okay, maybe I have no sense of humor.  Maybe I'm a relatively young stick in the mud.  Or maybe, just maybe, I'm just unlucky enough to live through the fin of this siecle when decadence and debauchery are mistaken for creativity.  And maybe I just don't get why they keep giving Saturday Night Live people megabucks to do these movies, when Saturday Night Live has seriously sucked for the last decade.First off, Austin Powers breaks the first rule of comedy:  a joke is only funny three times.  After that, you're just laughing out of habit.  The double entendre sequence about Doctor Evil's rocket is no more than an example of what a good thesaurus can accomplish.  We don't need ten minutes of it the first time, and we don't need to hear it again (and again and again) later on.I'm glad that Mike Myers is comfortable enough with his body to do the scenes he does, but I could have lived a long and happy life without ever seeing his bare gut.  Again, the sequence in which numerous cutesy ways are employed to hide his ""naughty bits"" went on longer than it needed to.I have now seen Heather Graham in two movies, this and ""Bowfinger"".  The third time had better be the charm, but I can't imagine the word ""charm"" being applied to this graduate of the Alicia Silverstone School of Non-acting.  She is nothing short of dreadful in every scene she's in.As a spoof of spy movies, it falls far short of others of various genres (""Scream""'s tweaking of horror movies is a good example).  For gross-out humor, it lacks the wit and enjoyment of ""There's Something About Mary."" This is not a movie that's going to age well, and, ten years from now, don't be surprised if you look back at this and wonder, ""What were we thinking??""",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

This time they send him back to the 60's to defeat the evil Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and the disgusting Fat Bastard (Mike Myers). Mike is quite good, but enough is enough. Each joke, visual or verbal, is beaten to death. Get your laugh and move on. How many names for the male sex organ can you think of? Just about every one of them is here. It just goes on and on. Heather Graham is lovely as his love interest this time around. However, her line readings are sometimes wooden and amateurish. The music is the best part of the film. A super rendition of ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"" sung by Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello is wasted with a sparsely choreographed dance by Austin and Felicity (Graham). The title sequence just repeats the scenes from the first film where Austin's pubic area is creatively covered as he prances nudely through a hotel. Humorous the first time, less so the second time around. One plus, it was nice to see a comedy photographed in Panavision. The widescreen process and vivid colors definitely brighten up the proceedings.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Same jokes, same concept, nothing new at all. Let's put it this way - this is NOT a movie I have any desire to see twice. You could probably cut out the stupid parts, and have maybe ten minutes of actual comedy, which mainly consists of Dr. Evil battling with his son Scott. Best line - ""You're the Diet Coke of evil"" delivered on the Jerry Springer show. Other than that, mostly junk. Hopefully we will be spared an ""Austin Powers III"" .....",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
156,sethmlanders,My least favorite of the three but still enjoyable!,7,6 September 2014,"I'll admit, the story is nearly identical to the first. I'm in no denial of that but that doesn't make it a bad movie. They introduce new characters, like Fat Bastard and Mini Me, and it's still really funny to watch. In my opinion, Heather Graham is much sexier than Elizabeth Hurley, which is a definite plus.Austin Powers is back and this time, he's lost his mojo! Yeah, his mojo is in the form of liquid in a metal container that Dr. Evil now possesses. He goes back in time to stop Dr. Evil from taking over his mojo and redeems himself as the memorable hero we've all grown to love. When I was little, I was frustrated at the series because I didn't understand the sexual innuendos. Now that I'm an adult, the jokes are a lot funnier and I'm glad that Myers maintains our affection for him as the hero. Sure, he's dim-witted and sometimes over the top but the character has a lot of heart, which is why I think the franchise has been so successful.Personally, I enjoyed ""International Man of Mystery"" the most and I put ""Goldmember"" second. At the same time, this second one is still a lot of fun and Roach is very skillful with his direction. If you're a fan of the series, I'd say give it a watch and enjoy it for what it is!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
157,jeffy-3,Cannot Compare But Fun,6,3 January 2000,"It's unavoidable to compare a sequel to its predecessor so here goes. It's not as sharp, it's not as funny, it's a lot sloppier and lazier in its effort to get laughs, and spends a lot of the goodwill extended from fans of the first. The character of Austin is rarely funny in this effort, so thank God for Dr. Evil, who is still humorous, and for his new ""son"" Mini-Me, who has a few good scenes.  Scott Evil is wasted and the new fat slob character Fat Bastard is not all that amusing. Still, it moves pretty fast, Heather Graham looks fantastic, and the movie all-in-all coasts by on its cheerful good nature.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
158,Xophianic,Better than the first one!,8,12 February 2000,"Some people don't think AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY was worthy of a sequel. Some think there should be a large series of AUSTIN POWERS movies, like the infamous Bond movies. Trust me, I'm kinda sick of everyone doing impressions of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, (and I do one fine Dr. Evil if I do say so myself, even though both are easy to impersonate), but I thought AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME was even better than the first one. So if you asked me if there should be a series of AUSTIN POWERS movies, and I wasn't so sick of all those impersonations, I might say ""Yeah baby!""Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is sent back to 1969 by Basil Exposition (Michael York) to stop Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) who has stolen Austin Powers' ""mojo"" and plans to build a giant laser on the movie and destroy all major cities on Earth. In the sixties, Austin Powers meets Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), who is just as sexy and hip as Austin is. Scott Evil (Seth Green) is still trying to work out things with his father, even though Dr. Evil has turned his attention to his clone in 1/10 size, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). Number Two (Robert Wagner, then Rob Lowe), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) and Mustafa (Will Ferrell) all return to help Dr. Evil, in addition to Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), the disgusting, overweight, Scottish henchman.Let's face is, Austin Powers has never been about plot. Considering that this movie is basically a spoof of OUR MAN FLINT and the JAMES BOND movies, the plot is pretty entertaining and funny. The giant laser on the moon was great, obviously spoofing MOONRAKER, in addition to many other movies of its type.The acting in this movie is all very good. Mike Myers does a great job playing three very different characters. Heather Graham beats the crap out of Elizabeth Hurley (not literally in this movie, but how cool would that be) and is way sexier in my book. Seth Green and Mindy Sterling are great, especially when together. Will Ferrell was one of my favorite performers and characters in this movie. Robert Wagner is good, but his role is taken over by Rob Lowe after they go back in time. Lowe does an unbelievable job and is almost exactly like Wagner was as the character. Michael York does a fairly good job too. There are some great cameos by names like Clint Howard, Tim Robbins, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Kristen Johnston and Jerry Springer.Unlike in AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, there is great character development. This first AUSTIN POWERS movie did a good job laying a foundation for these characters, but this movie really set them off. Dr. Evil stole the show, which is great because he is obviously the best character. Austin Powers, Number Two and Basil are about the same as in the first one. Felicity is way more interesting and sexier than Hurley was. Frau is much more interesting in this movie, as is Scott who is still saying ""Why don't you just kill them?"" to his father. Mustafa, who you might not even remember from the first one, is hilarious in this movie. Mini-Me was fun, but in the next AUSTIN POWERS movie, it shouldn't revolve around him as much. Fat Bastard is my least favorite character and I hope he isn't in the next AUSTIN POWERS movie.Go see this one, you won't regret it. It sure won't win any Oscars, but it's one of the funniest movies of the year. Turn your brain off and enjoy it!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
159,ColeSear,More Laughs Than the Original,10,28 January 2002,Like in many comedy series the laughs increase in the second installment of the Austin Powers. The big difference in this case is that the story isn't becoming stale or contrived. Not only do we continue to enjoy the escapades and eccentricities of this crazed characters we still enjoy seeing them battle and it leaves us wanting more. Instead of stagnating the characters in this comedy become more fully developed and the story is that much more enjoyable for it. Watch Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me I guarantee you'll like it more than the first.,Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
160,tripwires,First one was bad enough,1,29 September 2001,"Its sequel is even worse. Thank goodness I saw it on HBO! I tried to sit through the entire thing, but had to switch my TV off because this movie is just too bad. The plot is inane, the characters are wooden, and it's not even funny! Oh wait, I guess if the size of your brain is equivalent to that of a pea, you might think it's hilarious. It's not even about the jokes being vulgar; the vulgarity is definitely there (and overdone), but the jokes are so lame, they're not funny. And the so-called ""plot"", little bits and pieces of a half-baked ""story"" that are supposed to resemble a storyline, is, like I said, so silly, you wonder why people even bother.
Mike Myers is annoying, Heather Graham can't act, Rob Lowe is wasted and Seth Green is irritating. All in all, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is a brilliant waste of money on a piece of junk that is better off left in the editing room. A must-see? Sure, if you like movies that insult your intelligence.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I'd just like to tell Mike Myers to please ease up on the grossness next time - you've done about as much with toilet humor as I care to see up on the big screen in my lifetime, thank you.  Also, while Heather Graham truly makes a spectacular looking 60's babe, she doesn't exactly have a light comic touch, and her come ons to Austin, just sort of fell dead on impact.  I missed Elizabeth Hurley's style and class. Otherwise, these are great characters you can hardly go wrong with and anybody with a sense of humor is bound to have a good time.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
162,MinorityReporter,Slightly better than the first,7,24 September 2005,"I believe that the general consensus is that the first Austin Powers movie is the best of the bunch. I happen to disagree (as you can probably tell from my one-line-summary). I feel that the second film actually improves on the first film by adding a few new characters and generally cutting loose on the humor making it even more bizarre and funny than in the first film. I don't expect people to agree but at least hear me out as to why I think the second film is better.As I said a few new characters have been added to the roster and we get to see some older characters in new and exiting ways. The best addition to the character rooster is Mini-Me, Doctor Evil's clone, played brilliantly by Verne Troyer. Not only is he hilariously funny but he also brings out a different side to Doctor Evil which I found to be extremely funny. On a related note I found Doctor Evil to be much more interesting as a character in the second film than in the first. Probably because the Austin character had to be established in the first film. Second there is the addition of Fat Bastard, played by Myers himself. A lot of people have responded negatively to Fat Bastard but I found him quite funny in a very weird way. Mike Myers definitely took a step up the weird ladder when he came up with him. Elizabeth Hurley is written out of the script very early in the film and instead Heather Graham is introduced as Felicity Shagwell. Heather Graham is not as strong as Hurley was as Austin's love interest but she remains nice as eye-candy and what can you expect more than that. Seth Green pretty much reprises his role from the first film. Nothing much to come after there. The supporting cast is pretty much the same as in the first film except this time we get to see Number Two in a young version played by Rob Lowe who does an uncanny imitation of Robert Wagner. Mindy Sterling and Michael York returns in their respective parts as well. There are also quite a few cameos in the film. Including Tim Robbins, Woody Harrelson, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and many more.The film still spoofs Bond obviously and the title in itself is of course a reference to The Spy Who Loved Me and once again I find that no-one does it better than Myers. After the success of the first I think they gave Myers free reigns because a lot of the stuff in this film is pretty far out. An example could be the hilarious fight between Austin and Mini-Me and an equally funny scene in a tent. I won't reveal any more than that. Another thing is that the overall effects seem much more polished this time around which is probably also caused by the success of the previous film.The story is pretty much non-existent which I found to be an improvement over the previous film which actually attempted to incorporate a story rather than just be all out fun.All in all I think it is a matter of taste. Either you prefer the first or you prefer the second but you should definitely give this film a try just for the heck of it.All in all 7/10",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
163,robsellke,"Some funny parts, but for the most part tries too hard",6,5 April 2000,"The sequel to the very successful ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" this movie tries to go too far on the reputation of Mike Myers and the previous movie.  Most of the jokes are used several times over or are completely unimaginative and immature.  And although Heather Graham is very pretty, her acting seems hollow and dull.  There is also obviously no chemistry between Myers and Graham, because their acting shows it.  Some things were funny, however, like some of the jokes and Mini Me.  Overall, I think the good things outweighed the bad, but it could've been a lot better.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
164,Jack_Yan,"You can keep your money and your mojo, and rent it",5,4 July 1999,"I called the original Austin Powers the best comedy film I saw this decade, and I'm sticking by it. The sequel doesn't do the original much justice, and I really wanted to like this film. I even brought along a dozen people.I don't mind repeating jokes - after all, this is part of the Austin Powers culture (or even the Wayne's World culture!). And who cares about the illogical plot? You don't see Austin Powers to learn about ""lasers"". But joke for joke, reference for reference, there are far fewer in the sequel. I laughed continuously last time. This time, there were plenty of areas which didn't even make it to funny. If you're doing a parody of spy flicks with a dose of pop culture thrown in, then I can't imagine it being tough to fill the movie up with decent gags - as Myers did in 1997.This is essentially the Austin Powers reinterpretation of the Roald Dahl screenplay of You Only Live Twice (its prequel being a mixture of the movie versions of Thunderball and Casino Royale): Dr Evil in a volcano hideout, surrounded by hot liquid mag-ma; with a bit of Matt Helm and Derek Flint thrown in. But not enough, for my liking. And for those who loved the 1960s pop culture, there are far fewer references to those great songs - only I'll Never Fall in Love Again and I'm a Believer. Austin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me is very 1990s and in some places, commercialism and an attempt to capture the teen market were evident.Good points? There are many: George Clinton's fabulous parody score, which repeats some cues from the original plus a lovely spoof of John Barry's Space March/Capsule in Space and You Only Live Twice themes, the latter used when Felicity and Austin arrive on the island with a volcano, both dressed like Honey Ryder in Dr No... The opening sequences are brilliant, as is Heather Graham's very natural and almost naïve manner, which I rate higher than Elizabeth Hurley's effort in the original. Most of us men, no doubt, had our eyes out on stalks when Miss Graham appeared... Myers' penchant for accents is shown once again. Rob Lowe is magnificent in his impersonation of Robert Wagner, down to his mannerisms and accent, although Wagner's own appearance is sadly limited. Finally: Starbucks, Springer and Seth: top marks.Bad points: aside from those mentioned, toilet humour ain't my sort of thing. Great if you like the thought of Austin accidentally drinking fæces instead of coffee. The sequences involving Fat Bastard were disgusting in parts - and I'm not exactly your most PC of people. Fat Bastard himself was not a good henchman - something stolen from Bond or Helm would have been better. The movie still felt incredibly low-budget.Finally, Mini-Me. You either love him or hate him. I think his presence in the film helped - but I was disappointed to see Mr Bigglesworth making what we call a ""guest appearance"" as a result.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

The script is only half written. The jokes aren't funny, but they get stretched on and on and on to fill in those gaping holes in the script.

171,bhicks56,Austin Powers: The Sequel that Gagged Me,1,23 November 1999,"AUSTIN POWERS: The Sequel that Gagged MeMike Myers isn't as funny as he would like to think he is. Sure, I liked the first Wayne's World movie, but after a second viewing I found the only two times I laughed were at Dana Carvey as Garth.The first Austin Powers was a comedic improvement, giving us a close enough funny send-up of British spy movies (not Bond exactly) of the 60s. He even made the 60s hip again! Sort of.But while that was clever (sort of), he takes all the jokes and puts them in this rehash sequel. He tries to add new things to ""laugh"" at but can only come up with the snore-causing joke of Fat Bastard (using his old SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER Scottish accent, slightly better than his English one) and Mini-Me, the best part of the whole movie. But Mini-Me is like the personification of one joke. He's a sight gag.Director Jay Roach takes too much advice from Myers and keeps on-and-on-going jokes in his movie that make you want to strangle somone (preferably Will Ferrel in a tedious skit that lasts longer and grows more stale than his burning-body bit in the first one). The jokes try to challenge SOUTH PARK and the Farrelley Bros. in grossing out, but it misses what the other two don't. Brains. Wit. And ultimately laughs. I'm sure some of the kiddies will enjoy this dreck, but they also enjoy ERNEST GOES TO CAMP, for God's sake. And hardcore fans will probably dismiss the whole thing as fun just to have the unneccessary franchise around.I dont even want to mention poor Heather Graham (who hasn't really acted since SWINGERS, TWO GUYS & A GIRL and her breakthrough BOOGIE NIGHTS) wasting her time in the middle of this mess. She plays a bimbo blond, whose only interest is, apparently, to have sex with god-awful ugly men. Her IQ is right at the level with the rest of the movie. It's a shame too, because at least the first one had Elizabeth Hurley (who gets snubbed here) pointing out how sexist and dated that is in the 90s. Apparently the cliche is back in effect again. They might as well have evil Russians and dim-witted Chinese characters here also.The first one was at least a hit-and-miss, but this thing, whatever you want to call it, is a miss-and-miss, unless, of course, the target is its foot.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

This movie should never have been made. That's all there is to it. The whole Austin Powers concept just should not be made into sequels. The initial shock value that we got from watching that rediculous world simply cannot be maintained by seeing it recreated on the screen over and over again.I felt the original was one of the most brilliant comedies of all time. It had a completely original concept, with its own style and even its own language at times. But I don't want to start growing used to that concept ! It inevitably will become dull after a while because the shock value will be gone.This movie has its own fun moments. But let's admit it folks, they could have come out with a sequel that had an even funnier script than the original, and we still would not have laughed as hard.The fact that the third one is coming out this summer is even more sad. They should have just left it alone and the name ""Austin Powers"" would be legendary today.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I hope I don't see this months from now and not laugh because I can't wait to see it again.

181,SRVHS,Anya says that this was a must see movie,10,17 September 1999,This summer I saw the movie Austin Powers the Spy Who Shagged Me. It was a good movie. It was really funny but very unrealistic. This had to have been one of my favorite movies.	One of the reasons it was such a good movie is that it was funny throughout the whole thing. Two really funny parts were when first Dr.Evil is drinking coffee and he gets foam on his nose. Second is when Dr.Evil's chair starts to go really fast in all directions. These are only two of the many funny scenes of this movie.	This movie is very unrealistic but it was still a good movie. Some examples of why it was unrealistic is that the characters are traveling through a time machine and that they are floating through space in some sort of rocket thing without needing to wear a space suit or helmets.These things would both probably never happen except maybe in the WAY future.	All in all I would really recommend this movie because I laughed throughout the majority of the movie and it had a good plot/script even though it was not realistic I still thought it was an awesome movie!,Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

The 60's spy movie is hilarious starring Mike Myers, International Man of Mystery. This cleaver movie is even better that the first one, made in 1997.	Austin Powers becomes single again and falls into another escapade involving Dr. Evil and his men who want to take over the world. Along with doing that, they also want to get rid of Austin Powers, by taking away his ""mojo,"" so he won't happen to spoil their plans.	This movie has all the belly laughs and sexual and cunning humor as the first one if not more. This movie helps explain the first one much better with the same kind of kicks. Between a man weighing ""One metric ton,"" and an exact duplicate of Dr. Evil, yet only 1/6th of his size this movie is meant for everyone. 		As Austin strolls back in time to sexy girls, go-go boots and belted mini skirts, he is right at home with his swinger crowd. Crude bathroom humor was never funnier. Politically incorrect and silly humor has won again and this movie is definitely worth buying a night ticket to see. The lines are funnier and the writers were more daring.

183,SRVHS,High School student says hilarious film,10,17 September 1999,"I really enjoyed the movie ""Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged me,"" because of its comedy and its originality. These are two great factors that led me to believe that Austin Powers was a great movie.In the movie Austin Powers, comedy was used through out the movie. There was the time where Scott Evil mimicked his father, Dr. Evil. He would also make fun of his father for trying to fit into the 90's. Although, Dr.evil was still stuck back in the 60's. I think that this was a comical point in the movie because it was making fun of the so called ""up tight squares."" The other reason that I believe that Austin Powers was comical because of Dr.Evil and his finger movement to his bottom lip. Through out the movie, Dr.Evil puts his pinkie on the right part of his lip. When Dr.Evil says ""right,"" it makes a comical heaven. It is because of these two facts that this movie is comical.Also, the movie is original because of the characters and the plot. The characters of the movie are hilarious. Take Austin Powers, the 60's swinger who was cryogenicly frozen until his return in the 90's. Take the other antagonist, Fat Bastard, his name says it all. He is an overweight Scotsmen guard and assistant to Dr. Evil. The other character is the mini 1/8 size clone of Dr.Evil. These are original characters that were well thought out. The plot of the story is like the original British spy movie. Austin Powers defeats the antagonist and gets the girl. Now that is very original.In conclusion, Austin Powers is a great film to see because of the comedy and originality. It is comical because of the way Scott mocks his father and Dr.Evils finger movements. It is original because of the plot and characters. So if you have some spare dollars, go see Austin Powers.Nick, San Ramon High student",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
184,SRVHS,austin powers is a very funny movie!,10,17 September 1999,"This summer I watched a movie called Austin Powers the Spy who Shagged Me. This was a very good movie, full of humor and Mike Myers own brand of action.  It was as funny (or funnyer) than the origonal.
Austin Powers was a very funny movie.  Minime was very cool.  He added alot off humor to the movie.  there is one scene where he is fighting with Austin Powers and even though it lookes realy fake it is realy funny.  Dr. Evil is also very funny, like when he sing a recreation of Will Smith's ""just the two of us,"" very funny!  the character ""Fat Bastered"" (also played by Mike Myers) is a fat, scottish guy that is in leage with Dr. Evil and eats every thing, and i mean every thing, in one scene he even proclames he has ""ate a baby.""The movie is also very action packed with a little comedy worked in to every fight scene.  When Austin Powers is trying to save the world and the girl he need a little help so he goes back and gets the Austin Powers from the past for a little help.  There is also a killer fight scene between Austin Powers and  Minime but I'm not going to tell you that one because i want you to laught when you see it for your self.Minime and Dr. Evil make the movie very funny.

185,SRVHS,It's shagadelic baby,10,17 September 1999,"This is one great movie. To me, to make a good comedy movie you need to make it very funny, and have a cast of lovable zany characters. If you have all that then you got a great comedic movie on your hands.A main thing you need is slapstick humor. In a scene from the movie Austin and his trusty sidekick Felicity Shagwell are in a tent being watched by Dr. Evil's guards. Austen is down on his hands and knees doing exercises while Felicity  is checking their inventory. Since there is a light in the tent it sends their shadows to the outside of the tent where it looks to Dr. Evil's guards that Felicity is reaching in and taking things out of Austin's derriere. The funniest part is when accidently sets of a smoke bomb (if you understand what they were trying to show). Meanwhile, any scene with Fat B@#$%&d is a laugh riot. Especially the scene where he explains that babies are the other other white meat.Another good aspect to a great comedy is a cast of crazy characters. Mike Meyers is great as the swingin' Austin Powers, The maniacal Dr. Evil, and as Fat B@#$%&d the one metric ton Scotsman. Other great characters in the movie include the pint-sized maniacal Mini-Me Dr. Evil's 1/8 sized clone, and Scott Evil the punk son of Dr. Evil. They all are incredibly cartoonish players who are great when they interact with each other.From this Frickin' rotating chair that I sit in I can definatly approve of this movie. They have fantastically funny jokes that leave you rolling in the aisles. Along with side-splitting off-the-wall characters. This movie has everything you could ever ask for. It's sp funny that you will want to see it as many times as you probobly saw Titanic.by, A.J SRHigh",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
186,Criz,"Austin, how could you do this to me?",4,11 June 1999,"First of all let me stress that I'm a HUGE Austin fan. When Mike Myers created the character in 1997, I was thrilled, discovering to my great relief that ""one can have bad teeth and still be a sex symbol."" (Do I make you horny, baby?) Although it was also incredibly hilarious, the first Austin flick was so much fun because it was genuinely lovable--the innocence and naivete of our hero made for a winning combination.Now Powers is back, in the same hideous lenses on loan from Lisa Loeb. Unfortunately, Austin has lost much of the friendliness and charm that made the 1997 movie so terrific. The storyline has degenerated into a non-stop parade of penis sight gags and double entendres. (Granted, there were some similar jokes in the first film, but ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" has gone completely overboard, substituting groin-oriented humour for creative plot development.) It's sad to see Mike Myers so enthusiastically embracing the ""style"" of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, since Myers is the far more talented comedian.There are a couple of high points: Dr. Evil skewers a number of deserving targets, such as Will Smith's nauseating ballad ""Just the Two of Us"" and the 1996 ridicuflick ""Jerry Maguire"". And Heather Graham--sadly without her roller skates--manages to upstage her leading man in an enjoyable role as a sexy swinger. Overall, though, this latest Austin is a letdown, even for Powers loyalists like yours truly. Hopefully the next installment in the franchise (I can't believe I just said that) gets a better effort from Myers and his writers.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Rob Lowe did a good young Number 2, and I was glad Dr. Evil got more scenes in this then Austin Powers, Dr. Evil is probably more funnier. I liked Seth Green in the first one, he gets on my nerves in this one.All and all, I gave this film a 7. It had it's funny moments, some parts were just lame but a funny scene happened right after.

191,Starks,"Definitely not as good as the 1st, but still enjoyable",7,24 June 1999,"I was looking forward to the return of Austin Powers for a while now.  I thought the first one was very inventive and original.  Mike Meyers spoof of 60's style and James Bond movies were right on the mark.  It was a great premise bringing the swingin Powers and Dr. Evil into the 90's world.  The sequel, while funny, has lost some of its original punch and flavor. What made Austin truly funny in the original, was the fact that he was this freak from the 60's set loose in the 90's.  In the sequel this is lost.  And it is almost as if Meyers and company said to hell with James Bond, we'll tell toilet jokes.  No scene in this new Austin Powers comes close to equaling the humor of Austin Powers set loose in a modern day Las Vegas casino (both poking fun at the James Bond mythology and making fun of Austin's retro feel).  If anything Austin should be out and about in exotic 90's locales like club med, a Carnival cruise ship or a snowboard park battling bad guys but instead they choose to keep him in London.  BORING!!  Hopefully next time, Meyers will get back to poking fun at the Bond movies (exotic locales, shaggin' girls).  Don't get me wrong there were many things I liked Dr. Evil, mini me, Scott... But with a bigger budget, Meyers missed the mark. I hope he gets it right next time.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
192,nutz4n64,Good for a sequel,7,30 December 1999,"This one was kind of a letdown for me.  The first Austin Powers was a brilliant movie.  This, as many sequels, seems to forget what made the original so funny.  In the first, Austin is shown in the '60s as a swinger who has women falling all over him.  As stated by Mrs. Kensington, ""Women want him, and men want to be him.""  When he's shown in the 90's, he's the same, but people don't react to his lines and body language the way they're supposed to.  That's what made his character so funny.  Now, in this movie, he spends most of his time in the 60's, where everyone reacts the right way. Plus, even in the opening in the 90's, everyone reacts to him the right way, like he fits in.  Honestly, Austin had about 2 scenes that were really funny.  Those were the Mini Me vs. Austin and the tent scenes.The movie does, however, have a huge redeeming quality.  That is Dr. Evil and his gang.  They were hilarious in the first and also great in the second.  Dr. Evil on Jerry Springer, in bed with Frau, and taking off into space (almost p***ed myself with this chain of jokes) were classics.  Dr. Evil definitely steals the show.Another downside, however, is Fat Bastard.  I don't know what Mike was thinking with this one, but I hardly ever laughed at anything he did except for singing the Chili's Baby Back Ribs song.  Overall, he was pretty sick. I gave this one a 7.  Although Austin's character was kind of wasted, Dr. Evil more than makes up for it.  Recommendable, but see the first one first.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
193,JamieClay,A good film for the study of bad film making.,1,3 January 2000,"First of, I did enjoy the first AP film, so it's not like this didn't have the potential to entertain me. When this film was in the theaters, I was warned by a friend as to how bad it was and for that reason I waited until the video release to see the film. I'm soooo glad I did.Instead of getting a continuance of the whimsical original film (Like the Wayne's World Series), out dumped a sad display of bloated, poorly edited and tired adolescent humor.  The original film only had a couple of gags that ran too long (like the evil laughing scene) but in this visit to the world of AP, almost EVERY gag goes on for too long and dips way too DEEP into the toilet to try and be funny.There were no genuine surprises of creativity in this film. Almost every joke is predictable and flogged to death. (read that they might have been improved with more aggressive editing)  The only moment the movie produced a good laugh for me was when they did the cut to: sequence where various people are spotting Dr. Evil's rocket in the sky. (but even that was just a old joke dusted off, but done well) Of course, to stay true to form of beating a dead horse, they had to DO IT AGAIN at the end of the film. (sigh)One of the few good moments of the film are the few where Rob Lowe is doing his Robert Wagner impersonation, but that is hardly reason enough to view this film.If you want a reason to watch this film, consider it a good lesson in bad editing, comedy timing and over merchandising. The blatant product placement and plugs may have been a poke at the Bond films but it smelled more like the real thing than parody.I would ONLY suggest you watch this AP entry if you like to study bad films (like I do).-survivor.ps: It scares me to think of the box office this film did, only because it will no doubt inspire others to produce more crap like this.

It has great lines, sight gags, and a simple comic premise that works.Alas, the same cannot be said of Austin Powers' bloated sequel, which, like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch, takes what was once fresh and funny and runs it into the ground - and how!  Aside from the general unfunniness of the film (aside from a few sparks of brilliance - notably ""Mini-me""), what struck me particularily was how crude and mean-spirited it was.  I mean, toilet humour is funny to a point (as illustrated by ""There's Something About Mary""), but once you pass that point... oh, god, it's sickening.  As well, Mike Myers' once-funny characters began to irritate me and became tiresome.   ""Yeah, baby, yeah"" seems to have been over-used in recent pop cultural references, and it's sadly fitting that even Mike Myers can not rise to his former glory.Anyways, as the crowded theatre displayed, I am probably in the minority here.  Austin Powers 2 seems to be a crowd pleaser, and it'll go on to make a load of cash.  But it just didn't cut it for me.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
196,Eelco_1977,A bit of a disappointment!,7,3 October 1999,"This was, next to Star Wars: Episode I, the film I really wanted to see this year. I liked the first Austin Powers film but after having seen this sequel I was a bit disappointed. Let me first sum up the positive things about the movie:1) Dr. Evil was very funny! 2) Fat Bastard was great (what a filthy person)! 3) Some jokes were really good (about 20 different words for the word penis, the scenes in the tent with Austin and Felicity, the opening with Austin running through the hotel naked etc.) 4) The Jerry Springer show 5) The special effects and how the film looked were excellent! 6) A ridiculous story!The negative things about the film:1) The film went on too fast! A lot of times I had the feeling that there were just too many ideas for jokes put in a 1h 35m during film. 2) Some jokes weren't well done or weren't funny at all! 3) Mini-Me should have spoken! But than again, he was a bit annoying! 4) Felicity Shagwell's (Heather Graham) character wasn't as well developed as Vanessa Kensington's in the first film (in just a flash Felicity was Austin Powers' girlfriend). 5) If there's going to be a next film, more No. 2, Basil Exposition, Scot Evil and Frau Farbissima and Ivana Humpalot. 6) Robin Swallows' role wasn't necessary and very weird. 7) The scene with Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach wasn't well executed (suddenly they were there on the streets in London). 8) Austin Powers wasn't that funny as in the first film (except the scene with Ivana Humpalot, that was a great oneliner)Overall, the film is despite these negative points very watchable and entertaining but it doesn't deserve more than a 6,5 / 7 out of 10, it was too chaotic.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

199,rookie-8,Great Comedy,10,12 June 1999,"I just saw Austin II last night and I have to say, as inprobable as I thought it would be, I liked this movie more than the original. From begining to end, from the very first scene to the very last, I laughed harder than I almost ever have at any other movie. Some of the gags were taken from the original, but many were new and just as inventive. It seemed to me as if Myers expanded on the old gags because he didn't have time to put them into the old one and then added the new gags, which were even more inventive. The gag about the ""penis"" is hysterical.(you'll know what I mean when you see the movie)Myers, as usual, is amazingly diverse, playing three characters this time; Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard. The script is wonderfully written, andthere is quite honestly never a dull moment. Rob Lowe does a very good job as the young Number 2, and the actor who plays Scotty, Dr. Evil's son, has a much bigger role in this movie and plays it to perfection.Heather Graham is amazing. Liz Hurley is one of the most beautiful women in the world, but Heather, with her sensual looks and actions, has her beat in this movie. Everytime she looked at Austin with that "" Lets go and Shag"" look I found myself wanting to be the bad tooth English spy more and more. She would have been one of the best Bond girls ever, if she ever went that route, but I would much rather see her with Austin.Overall, the movie is honestly non stop laughs. Everytime I found myself thinking I was laughed out, Myers would plug something into the story that make me erupt, with the rest of the audience, again. This movie is going to have a lot of second and third comers because the audience is so loud at times, and because you will be laughing so loud at times, I am sure there were many jokes that I missed. Myers has solidified himself as maybe the best comic out there right now with this movie.Go to the movies. See this film. So far, with Star Wars and now this, it has been a DAMN GOOD YEAR for films. It's about time there were movies out there that leave you feeling great when you the theatre. This one will leave laughing long after you leave the theatre.

201,BuddyBoy1961,"For Mike's sake, thank goodness for bathroom walls",6,12 July 2000,"Only in America could a one-and-a-half joke premise be stretched out over two barely amusing movies. It's difficult to ponder how a rough draft-quality script like this could generate over $200 million in domestic ticket sales. It's also sad to think that the only two jokes I laughed at in the entire picture were probably made up on the spot. Considerably better-mounted than it's frugal predecessor, the second ""Austin Powers"" movie is still a pallid parody of 60's spy films, tolerable only for Mike Myers' irresistible characterizations of Powers and his arch-nemesis, Dr. Evil. Myers' talents as a performer are inestimable, to be sure, but one can live off the drippings of luck for only so long before people demand something substantive. In ""Powers II"" (and ""I"", as well), the scenario is barely held together by a string of frequently tasteless bathroom humor; you'd think with his Scottish ancestry, Mr. Myers could elect to take the high road once in a while.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
202,BTM-2,More outrageous Mike Myers fare,8,10 October 1999,"Austin Powers is back to again battle his nemesis Dr.Evil in this sequel. Myers once again does a fine job as both hero and villain,and even manages to pull off a third role,the Fat Bastard,but Heather Graham leaves much to be desired. Verne Troyer is hysterical as Mini-Me,and the Jerry Springer scenes were to die for. Not as good as the first,though. Many elements that made the first one great are thrown in here. This film also holds the dubious distinction of having the single most disgusting scene in all of cinema history(those who have seen it know what I mean!) Nevertheless,it's harmless fun,and I look forward to another of Mr.Powers' escapades....hopefully without the 'nutty' coffee....

203,Stroheim-3,How funny?,7,11 June 1999,"Under normal circumstances when a movie is filled with plot holes, it deserves to be ridiculed and torn apart.  In this, the (first?) sequel to Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, plot holes are part of the fun. Who cares if continuity does not really exist in this film?  After all, it is a parody.  Mike Meyer's comic genius shines once again in this movie filled with obscure references to '80s musical groups, '60s spy films, and children of rock stars, not to mention a little known sci-fi film called Star Wars (or something of the sort). The grooving soundtrack (as with the original) makes the audience want to get up and dance with our snaggle-toothed hero.  It also captures the essence of the cheezy spy films made in that era. The cast is terrific.  Robert Wagner returns as Number Two (although slightly burned) and Rob Lowe enters the fray as his younger counterpart. Seth Green remains the rebellious, disrespectful, and not-quite-evil son of Dr. Evil.  Heather Graham is shagadelic as the Powers chick, and Mike Meyers is brilliant as three characters.  The real star of the movie, though is Mini-me - an Island of Dr. Moreau-esque dwarf clone of Dr. Evil who is truly hilarious.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
204,hamburgerman,"not as funny as the first, but still great!",8,25 June 1999,"I personally don't think ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" was as good as the first Austin Powers, but I still really enjoyed it.  I don't think the 90s influences brought back to the 60s worked as well as the 60s coming to the 90s did in the first one.  Elizabeth Hurley had more chemistry than Heather Graham did with Michael Myers.I recommend this movie.  And if you haven't seen the first, please check it out!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

206,JonB-2,"The Sequel that Shagged Us, Baby...",4,10 July 1999,"Simply put, this film is a load of crap; a studio rush job, more interested in getting those Virgin Shaglantic/Heinekin product placements set up than in getting an actual script written.  The original ""Austin Powers"" was a sleeper hit because it was actually funny, snuck in small and hit big on video.  This film is an overly calcuated mess -- a typical example of ""let's do market studies to figure out why the last one worked, then get out the cookie cutters..."" and then botch it all, anyway.I won't even go into describing the plot, because it all makes no sense. (Even ""AP I"" gave a nod to having a coherent story.)  Suffice it to say that the filmmakers set up a time travel device, then ignore era from that point on; parts of this film could take place in 1999 or 1969, but it makes no difference.  This is a shame, because they could have really mined the differences between the Swingin' 60s and the Stuckup 90s in two directions (as ""AP I"" did so wonderfully in one direction); instead, any semblance of character, reality, consistency or the like is sacrificed for a really bad one-liner.The only high points of the film: there's an extended ""They almost said a naughty word but not really"" bit near the end that's hilarious -- but it's repeated, and therefore diluted.  Beyond that, Verne Troyer is amazing as Mini-Me, turning in a compelling performance without a word (when oh when will Hollywood cast a little person in a ""real"" role?); Rob Lowe does an amazing Robert Wagner impersonation; Mindy Sterling, as always, is a true gem as Frau Farbissina (and she should be working more in film, dammit) and Seth Green is just, well... yumm-i-luscious (although whoever decided to cover up his great natural red hair with black dye was an idiot).  But, if you want to see most of these people giving their best, just rent ""AP I.""Anyway, none of the above really matters, because it feels like the film was shot from a bad, rushed first draft, and the principals just didn't give a damn during shooting.  They saw a cash cow in the making, but didn't bother to recapture what it was that made the first film so good.  Just more proof that there's no secret formula to ""formula.""  It works when you're not trying, but falls apart as soon as everything you do is just another excuse for a bit of product placement...",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
207,spinin,Predictable and Annoying,5,3 January 2000,"I like good films, but I also enjoy stupid comedies. However, comedy sequels rushed just to make money usually suck. This was the case with ""Ace Ventura 2: When Nature Calls."" When I went to see ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" I expected the same disappointment and I got it.There is very little plot in this film. Dr. Evil goes back in time in order to steal the hero's mojo and rob him of his flawless and charming abilities. Austin Powers decides to follow him in order to steal his mojo back. Along the way he meets Felicity Shagwell, an American spy played by the hot Heather Graham. Together they try to defeat Dr. Evil and his henchmen.Let's take a look at what is wrong with this film. First of all, the nature of ""Austin Powers 2"" is flawed. While the first Austin Powers movie mostly satirized James Bond, this one either makes fun of itself or nothing at all. Second, the characters in the sequel are very annoying. It seems that Dr. Evil has become the hero now. He is supposed to be cute, lovable, funny, and tough. He is everything and he probably has more screen time than Austin Powers himself. In reality, he is simply annoying. Mini-Me does not steal the show, Frau Farbissina screams every few minutes, and the jokes revolve around these annoying figures. Finally, the main thing that is wrong with this movie is the repetition of jokes from the previous Austin Powers. I counted about 20 jokes or joke sequences in ""Austin Powers 2"" that were first in the original. In addition, they were often used more than once in the sequel. I didn't like it when Dr. Evil did the ol' ""zip it"" routine to Scott Evil (twice), because I've seen it before. I didn't like it when Dr. Evil quoted common things from the 90s as if no one knew what he was talking about, because I've seen that before as well. I didn't like it when Mustafa (Will Ferrell) fell down the cliff and complained about being hurt, but not dead, because I have seen that before. And how many times will Dr. Evil make mistakes with monetary values before it stops being funny. I think doing this twice in the original was enough. C'mon Mike Myers, you're a funny guy, let's get some new jokes.Now it's time to briefly talk about the good things in this movie. Between the annoying and repetitious jokes and the constant shameless product placements, there were a few decent moments. Although most of his dialogue is the same as before, Austin Powers has a some new funny lines. Heather Graham's acting is weak as she just can't seem to take that smirk off her face for a longer period. But on the good side, she is fun to look at. Fat Bastard is probably the funniest character, but he is just another costume Mike Myers got into. Finally, there are a few good jokes in the film. A montage of penis jokes stands out the most, even though it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.This film is simply an expected disappointment. An annoying repetition of the elements that made the first Austin Powers film so good. This time they are not clever, surprising, or funny. I thought about giving this film a 6 out of 10 after I saw it in the movies because it had me laughing at times, but then I watched it again on tape and I don't think I laughed once. Watch the original one instead which does everything so much better and has you laughing each time you watch it. It is one of the best comedies of the 90s. ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" ruins everything. Overall, a 5 out of 10.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
208,C.S.Wood,Better than the Original,7,15 June 1999,"The original was cheaper but still hit its marks. This one had a bigger budget, but a lot of the end jokes fell short. The build-up was better than the end product. All and all, 3 out of 4 stars.Dr. Evil and Mini-Me were the funniest. I'd like to see them return in the next one (because I know there'll be a 3rd) but a new villian would be nice; maybe joining up with Dr. Evil, I don't know.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
209,Wayner50,Even worse and more obvious than the first,1,4 June 2006,"This is even more stupid, filthy and disgusting than the first Austin Powers movie. Michael York would be better off working the midnight shift at the 7-11, selling pencils on the corner or holding a ""Will work for food"" sign, it's more dignified than trying to inject any talent or class into this cesspool of a movie. Mike Myers, please use your considerable talent in something other than this crap. You've been great in ""Wayne's World"" and ""Shrek"". Mike will do anything for a laugh, whether he gets one or not, and here he gets none. The brainless, obvious, dirty and disgusting puns are matched only by the scene in which Powers drinks liquid sewage. That pretty much describes the whole sorry mess.

210,microbonnie,"Very creative, if over the top at times",7,12 June 1999,"I wasn't very surprised at my impression of this movie.  It was pretty predictable and basic plot wise, but I believe that's probably the point. A lot of the humor was quite creative, I was impressed with some of the originality and inventiveness involved with it.  Other parts, of course, were just too much.  I, personally am not too big on ""bathroom"" humor, for one.  Fat Bastard said approximately one line that I laughed at.  But I loved Dr. Evil, as always, and Mini Me was awesome, they really played that up well.  Scott is my personal favorite, I just love the idea of the ""quasi-evil"" son who always points out how stupid his father's plans are. This movie introduces interesting things such as time travel, and the weird concepts of two or three Austins at one time, and you really rethink the first one after seeing it.  The ""mojo"" thing is kind of lame.  Felicity Shagwell was okay, but left me unimpressed, except with her hair.  I mean, it is really funny, and you should definitely watch it.

Frankly disappointing.If the best part of a film involves a silhouetted character seemingly inserting and removing objects from/into the bottom of another you have to accept that you have not witnessed a great film.

To me it's weaker than the original, not as funny, and it's no longer different than anything I have seen. It's pretty much the same joke as the first movie.

I thought it was hilarious for the first hour or so, and then became rather boring towards the end.  This film, however, was monotonous and un-exciting throughout.  Even it's funniest scene (a Jerry Springer episode with Dr. Evil and his son) was uninspired and unoriginal.God help us if there are going to be two more sequels to this film.  One might think there would have been some fresh jokes in here, but it was the usual ""Yeah Baby,"" and ""Do I make you horny?"".I think the main problem with this movie is it's premise.  Whereas the first film mocked Austin Powers and was a bit of a satire, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" embraces this wretched character and stops poking fun at him, which is what made the first film (or the first half anyway) work so well.

216,aalmhs,impossibly smashing,10,7 July 1999,"While many people were hyped for Phantom Menace, I was gunning for ""AP2"". Ironically enough, I saw Star Wars before AP2 (albeit, two hours before). Anyway, people had been spewing out of the cinemas saying that it was better than the first (I saw it the second night it opened here and half the people I knew saw it on the opening night) and I was quite bewildered because nothing could've been as good as the first - I mean, I have the damn movie on VCD and I watch it all the time. So I went into the cinema not quite sure what to expect because we'd lined up for nearly an hour only to have our session sold out so we hung around for another 2hrs for the next session and then we had to line up to get IN to the theatre... the point of this story is - it was fantastic! It really was better than the first. The humour was more daring (quite a few movie allusions in there), the grossness more than hairy chests and snaggle teeth... to this day, coffee and homing devices make me cringe.Dr. Evil, by far the best character, is more developed, as is his 'clan' of evil-doers. All of the hilarious moments involved Dr Evil - like the Jerry Springer appearance, mini-me, 'Just the Two of Us' and the page to the White House, his obscene shaped rocket, his seduction of Frau Farbissina etc. Austin was still Austin but Felicity Shagwell wasn't as good a 'sidekick' (shag?) as Agent Kensington. Too bad about the gunpowder jubblies. Thing about Ms Shagwell was that she had eyes like golf balls and strange hair - NB: Liz Hurley, much better.All the innuendoes were still there, as was the cool car (the Shaguar) and the VW of a time machine, the clever nudity scenes (how's the opening credits for a dance scene to match AP1?) and that shadow thing in the tent. Fat Bastard was cringeworthy - ""get in my belly!"" but they played with him quite well in the end. This is the first movie I've had to line up for and the first where everyone clapped when it ended.

I saw this movie with an audience of kids 9 to 10, and they howled throughout, catching all double entendres, loving the naughty words, etc. And certainly much of the humor was on this level. Yes, lots of humor involving bodily parts and functions, and non too subtle either.On the other hand, there's lots of stuff for the over 12 audience too. Witty lines and references are scattered throughout. I wish I had seen various Bond movies (there came a point where I couldn't watch them) just to catch all the references. Dr. Evil was magnificently idiotic and evil, and the only sane person in the movie was his son, who, while giving an honest appraisal of the good Doctor's plans, makes it all the more hilarious.Don't even look for a plot. If you do, you've missed the  point. Go for a cleverly written fab picture.

Fat Bastard, except for his predilection for baby flesh, was just awful and something I could have done without.  Unfortunately, many of the gags are re-treads from the first film.

The title sequence where Austin dances through a Hotel naked is pure genius.  Dr. Evil steals the show once again with the biggest laughs, but even he wears thin after a while.  And I guess that's the biggest problem with the movie.  After a hilarious beginning it just slowly loses steam until there is little left.Still, The Spy Who Shagged Me is not a bad movie by any means, but I hope if another sequel is ever made, the filmmakers will try to capture the humor of the original rather than relying on what Kevin Smith calls ""dick and fart jokes.""",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

And while very few sequels outrank their originals, the main reason this one does not is money: too much! Granted, the product placement running gag is terrific (I half expected to see Howard Schultz himself behind Dr. Evil's Starbucks counter!), it indicates just how much Myers and crew had to work with, while the main charm of ""AP:IMOM"" was its limited budget, which worked in great tandem with its originality to make it the camp-classic it is.Myers is our most talented screen comic both in front of the camera and in front of his P.C. (the pop culture allusions are amusing again; how perfect that Dr. Evil's globe demonstration echoes Chaplin's ""Great Dictator,"" no less!). Yet it's clear New Line (i.e., Time Warner) knew they had a demographic smash on their hands. If you are: a) a 12-year-old boy; b) were a 12-year-old boy between the years 1974 and 1979; c) are ""b"" AND are the father of a 12-year-old boy, ""AP:TSWSM"" is YOUR HAPPENING, BABY, and IT WILL FREAK YOU OUT!!! If not -- or if you don't have a relationship with either a, b and/or c -- go rent the first flick again, which is what ""AP:TSWSM"" makes me want to do most. Your movie 'mojo' will be back in no time, baby!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
236,brvhrt-4,Nice Blend of Old and New,7,8 June 1999,"Bigger and better than the original.  Myers knows what worked in the first installment, and satisfies your want to see it again.  Happily, though, he also knows when to build on it with new stuff.  This one was much more fun to watch, mainly because everyone knows what to expect.  (I'll admit, the first time I saw the original, I didn't really get what Myers was going for. Neither did the other six people in the theatre.)  Lots of cameos by people you know.  Lots of 90s references and tie-ins.  Lots of fun.  Just make sure you stay for the credits... all of them.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

It was inevitable that, as a sequel, it would have a self-conscious, contrived feeling, in contrast to the freshness of the first.  Some hilarious bits interspersed with dead spots and among the most disgusting toilet humor imaginable.  This, on the whole, detracts from the movie.  Mini-Me was a good new character, though I would have made even more of his rivalry with Scott.  And Frau Farbissina's girlfriend, Unibrow, (""I met her on the LPGA tour"") had a lot of potential.

The movie has already added new expressions into the vernacular - ""I got the hood, I got the hood!"", Zip It!, ""You're the Diet Coke of Evil! Just one calorie! Not evil enough!"", ""I can't let my feelings for you interfere with my taking over the world"", and ... ""it got weird"".Best Part:   The ""music"", particularly - i) Felicity Shagwell entering to American Woman, ii) Shagwell and Powers dancing to Costello & Bacharach, and iii) Dr. Evil rapping ""Just the Two of Us"" to Mini-Me",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
243,Curtize,"Not as good as ""So I Married An Axe Murderer.""",6,28 August 1999,"Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged Me  -  **1/2The bottom line is this:  If you enjoyed the first film, you will enjoy this one.  If you disliked the first film, you will probably dislike the sequel. In other words, it is simply more of the same.The plot... such as it is... goes a little something like this:  Dr. Evil (Mike Myers,) banished to space in the first Austin Powers adventure, returns to earth and creates a time machine.  He then travels back to 1969 in an attempt to steal Austin's mojo.  Meanwhile, in 1999, Austin (Mike Myers) learns that his new bride Vanessa Kensington ( Elizabeth Hurley) is really a FemmeBot.  Austin reluctantly dispatches the evil machine before traveling back to the swinging 60s himself to foil Dr. Evil's nefarious plot.  Dr. Evil and his son Scott (Seth Green) still do not get along.  Even an appearance on the Jerry Springer show fails to bring them together.  So Dr. Evil creates a clone that is identical to himself, only 1/8 the size. This character (Verne Troyer) is dubbed ""Mini-Me"" by his creator.  Once he arrives in 1969, Austin joins forces with CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham.)  Together they travel to the volcanic island which serves as Dr. Evil's stronghold and attempt to foil his scheme: destroying the earth by firing a giant laser cannon located on the moon.Who are we kidding, here?  The plot of this film could not be less important.  What is important is the yuk-yuks.  Are they fast and frequent? Yes and no.  The film certainly features moments of hilarity, as when Dr. Evil and Mini-Me engage in a performance of ""Just the Two of Us,"" when Dr. Evil begins quoting The Exorcist after his electronic chair begins to malfunction, or when Scott Evil argues with his father about he proper way to capture and kill Austin.  But all too often the gags run on and on, wearing out their welcome.  Prime examples are the tent scene, where Dr. Evil's henchmen believe they see Felicity removing all manner of strange objects from Austin's... uh, private regions.  And then there are the two (not one, but two!) scenes in which various passers-by note Dr. Evil's spacecraft in the sky and comment upon its unique appearance, which resembles... uh, more private parts.That brings us to another flaw in the film.  It is obsessed with pre-pubescent toilet humor.  Don't get me wrong.  I love low-brow comedy as much as the next male.  But this film reveled inordinately in it.  Aside from the scenes noted above, consider the following:  (a) The character of Fat Bastard (Mike Myers,) whose sole purpose is to disgust the audience, (b) Austin's accidental drinking of a substance he THOUGHT was coffee, and (c) The opening sequence in which Austin prances nude around a hotel, cleverly (so we are supposed to think) obscured by mirrors, babies, titles, etc. (Never mind that this exact gag appeared in the first film!)  The comedic element which works best is Dr. Evil.  His relationships with Scott and Mini-Me are both funny in their own way (and neither one involves jokes with bodily fluids.)  Finally, Rob Lowe is fantastic as the young Number Two, essentially delivering a perfect imitation of Robert Wagner.In some ways this film is funnier than the original.  The inclusion of Mini-Me is a particularly good addition.  But the film suffers because it repeats many of the jokes from the prequel, which causes them to seem old and tired.  When you add to this the film's practice of dragging out every joke to the point of annoyance, one can see why this film is a moderately funny comedy of two hours, instead of the hilarious comedy of ninety minutes which it should have been.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
244,Mac60,One good comedy bit and the rest is ZZZzzzzzz....,4,8 September 1999,"I hadn't seen the first Austin Powers movie and I was talked into seeing this one by a friend. Or is that ex-friend? ""It's hilarious, you've got to see it."" I wish I hadn't taken her advice.  It's mostly dullish potty humour you can find in any juvenile comedy film these days. Don't get me wrong, a good potty joke can be a really good thing but ninety minutes of them, well, maybe not. Heather Graham is the highlight of the film. She can act, aside from being drop dead gorgeous, and is the sole reason to see this film.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
245,Tim Gomersall,"This was a good movie, but I'd hoped for more.",7,10 August 1999,"Ultra-minor spoilers included, nothing plot-orientated. Besides, this is NOT a plot movie.It was funny, definitely. But throughout the film I sat there wanting to laugh a lot more than it let me. It got the audience in the mood with the very amusing opening credits, and then seemed to rely too much on its 60's cool atmosphere and not enough on fresh jokes- exactly how many were exhumed from the last movie I don't know; it wasn't worth trying to count. Some of these re-used jokes were funnier 2nd time round (Zip it..) but most fell flat; Mustafa's cries for help when we think he's dead were nowhere near as amusing as they were when they were fresh and unexpected in the first movie.So it's tempting to accuse Myers of over-confidence in his product, and trying to get away with too little, but somehow that's not how it came across; if I was writing this film's school report I'd come up with something along the lines of 'tried very hard, but must try harder', which would probably be a first, but hey, that's what happens when you write report cards for movies, I guess.See this film by all means, but expect only a B(+).",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Most of the really good jokes in the first one be prepared to see them again in this one. But the funniest thing in this one is the third character played by Mike Myers. Fat B******. He has one hilarious scene with Heather Graham.

256,duke33,Complete 180 Turn From the Original,1,22 October 2001,"I thought the first Austin Powers was one of the funniest movies i have seen in ages.  An intelligent satire of the whole James Bond motif, with several take-offs that were direct pot shots at the bond movies.
But, when the sequel came out, I just had a nagging feeling that there was no way it could be half as good as the original.  And, boy oh boy, did they really miss the mark on this one.  My first feeling when watching this movie was that Mike Myers had a bunch of jokes in his head, and he wrote them down.  Then, they tried to tie them together with a loosely knit storyline.  The result is that most of the jokes are not funny, and the story seems to wander quite a bit.  Also, all sense of james bond satire is gone, save for a few scenes at the end.Overall, i was very disappointed in this one.  I sincerely doubt i'll shell out the money to see AP3 when it comes out, after this debacle.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I only watched about 20 minutes of it, so I can't comment on rumors that it does get kinda funny during the last ten minutes or so.It's amazing how something that could work so well the first time around, i.e. the parody of the sixties superspy genre, could fail so miserably the second time. Maybe it's because the first time around, you're reminded of the movie ""Goldfinger"", where the second time, you're reminded of the first Austin Powers movie. That is, the first A.P. movie was given creative inspiration by something external, where the second A.P. movie was nothing more than a self-absorbed tribute to the first movie, an inside joke reduced to the level of sickening cliche.An amazing amount of time is wasted on pseudo-scenes where our former hero simply mugs the camera and dances around, as if he's making the first appearance in the movie. I couldn't believe how self-indulgent it was. What are we supposed to do when all of a sudden in the middle of the movie, we hear that disco beat again, and there's the main character's face filling the screen in front of a psychedelic background, mugging for one snapshot after another as if to say ""Here I am, baby!"".

The movie had all of the same jokes from the first film without any of the wit, and Mike Myers somehow managed to run(well, hammer) the already tired bits of AP1 even farther into the ground.  He also managed to over-saturate the film with sub-juvenile bathroom humor--an extremely overweight character's bowel movement simply isn't funny.Though the first movie had its moments, the sequel came across like a joke that wasn't terribly funny the first time you heard it, only you've heard it 15 times since and this time it comes from someone who doesn't know how to tell it.  Unfortunately, I fear we'll be given a third installment in which the same old gags don't work yet again.Give us a break, Mike.  Write something creative.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I especially enjoyed the scenes involving the Jerry Springer show.  This material is the best parody to some of the original James Bond films -- such as ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Thunderball"".On the critical side I think this film took the potty humor thing a little too far (referring to the coffee pot scene).  You don't have to be that gross to be funny.  This scene reminded me of the beer drinking scene from ""Dumb and Dumber"".  In my opinion, the former was barely passable and the latter went too far.

For those of you who haven't seen either, it's ""tastefully"" covered up with objects.

It was the first DVD I owned so don't get me wrong when I rake this one over the coals.  Basically they took the first movie, made note of all the good jokes, and used them over and over and over and over in this one.  Fat Bastard is hilarious.  This character saved me from having to give a rating of less then 5, but he doesn't save the movie.  Shagwell is awful, Dr. Evil, my favorite character from IMOM, is annoying at best, AP isn't funny and Mini Me was a wasted idea as was the theft of AP's Mojo.  I do plan to see it again (likely on video) and will give it an honest second chance, it may be a movie that I had high expectations for and when it didn't meet them I felt let down.

Overall I liked Vanessa better than Felicity Shagwell, because Felicity's actress (played by Heather Graham) was, well, pretty bad. Also, thought Fat Bastard was pretty disgusting.

266,Sterling52,All About Shagging!!!,6,1 September 2008,"In Austin Powers- The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) travels back in time to 1969 to steal Austin Powers (Mike Myers) mojo while he is cryogenically frozen. Powers' starts to notice that he is having trouble in the womanizing area, and decides to follow Dr. Evil and get his mojo back. Powers hooks up with the American spygirl, CIA Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), and together they go on a hunt for Powers' mojo. Powers also has to stop Dr. Evil from destroying the planet with his ""Alan Parsons Project"", a giant laser. Dr. Evil's clone, Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), is an exact replica of Evil, only 1/8 of his size. Mini-Me soon replaces Evil's son, Scott Evil (Seth Green), to become the high-light of Evil's life. The pint sized Evil is a barrel of laughs. Added to this sequel is also Fat Bastard (suprise! also played by Myers). This name is very fitting to the grotesque character. If you enjoy disgusting body gestures, then Fat Bastard is a character you will like. Myers won the American Comedy Award in 2000 for funniest actor in a motion picture. This award was well deserved by Myers, because of his versatillity. This comedy, directed by Jay Roach is perfect for viewers who enjoy crude remarks, grotesque comedy, and too many references to phallicism. This color film has an awesome soundtrack. Dr. Evil singing ""Just the Two of Us"" to his new little buddy is hysterically funny! I rated this film a 3, because I am not a big fan of grotesque comedy.

But it wasn't nearly as funny as the original! The ""bad"" scenes outnumber the good. Most of the scenes in the movie just seem to last too long, and I sometimes had to ask myself, ""Was I suppose to laugh at that?"". Scenes would end with those music cues that just serve to tell you that they(the filmmakers) weren't confident in their ability to make you laugh at that scene. Bad sign. Mike Myers' performance as all three of his characters was pretty impressive in its own right. He is definitely a comedic genius. For a movie that is suppose to be ""the"" comedy of the year, the theater in which I saw it was pretty silent for most of the film. I've been at movies that were booming with laughter, and this one just didn't do it for me and for many others. Many have said that if you like the first, you'll like this one too.

273,Thalberg,"Funny -- Tasteless, But Funny",6,12 June 1999,"The second Austin Powers film had quite a few moments that were as funny as the first one.  Unfortunately, it had a lot of scatalogical humor which the first film did not have.  One or two scenes were downright sickening. IMHO, Mike Myers should stick to the penis jokes and leave the poopie jokes to lesser filmmakers.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
274,Rioter,Maybe BETTER than the first?,9,13 June 1999,"Since I never saw International Man of Mystery in the theater, it's hard to compare the two without the same experience. Heather Graham was brilliant as felicity Shagwell; she did a far better job than ""Vanessa"" from the original. Myers was hilarious as usual, and the movie did a great job reproducing scenes from Bond's ""Doctor No"". The parts I found the most amusing were Dr. Evil's attempts to take credit for things from the future (Alan Parsons project). They may have gone overboard with the lowbrow Fat Bastard humor, and I didn't think Mini-Me was as funny as the pre-movie hype. For me, the high points were Graham's preformance as the (beautiful) CIA agent Shagwell and Ethan Embry's role as estranged son Scott. I'd give it an enthusiastic 9 of 10.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
275,Brad-61,"Occasionally funny, but more often slapdash",4,13 June 1999,"I almost didn't want to see this film, because it was so aggressively hyped (the product tie-ins with Heineken and Virgin Atlantic, among others, was especially obnoxious) but I went because of Heather Graham, and she does look good. But this script has few laugh-out loud lines. Mostly it's a collection of very old gags and gross-out stuff (that doesn't have the Farrelly Brothers wit). Myers has an energy that almost carries it, but there are so many times that the movie stops dead in its tracks. A tighter editing job and fresher gags would have made it better.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Plus they seem determined to nauseate you at any cost. Dr. Evil/Mini Me was funny, and Heather Graham is completely Shagadelic, but was Fat Bastard and the jokes involving his bowels really necessary? The best sequence was probably the Springer episode early in the movie.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Unlike the first movie, Austin Powers is on the screen for about 10 minutes total.  Dr. Evil takes up most of the screen time, since he proved to be more popular than Austin after the first film was produced.This movie reminded me more of the TV Show ""Family Guy"" than the first movie.

Few have gone so far with a concept that no one would ever have dared put on film before.On the downside, the idiocy of the character ""Fat Bastard"" and similar dumb excrement etc humor. It's been all done before and not necessarily better, but still .....at times ones' skin crawls at having to live through this tastelessness.

You just cant help but laugh at the funny antics of Mini-me and Dr. Evil. They are without a doubt the best part of this movie, you can't not think this movie is hilarious. Funny is funny, I don't care how stupid it is. And funny is especially funny if it is done by Mike Meyers in a ridiculous movie about a spy from the seventies stuck in the nineties, who steals his own mojo from himself, planning to destroy himself, with the help of a cute little midget 1/8 his size.      ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is the funniest film of the year, you shouldn't miss it. I have one thing to say to anyone who wants to trash this movie, ""Sht!

The first movie was a parody while this one is strictly situational humor.  Is a lot of it toilet humor?  Yes, indeed.  And the problem with that is...?  Mike Myers is a genius at sight gags, and this movie shows of that talent.  He also has a great team working with him: Mindy Sterling is a superior comedienne in her own right, Rob Lowe's Robert Wagner is uncanny, and the talented Seth Green is perfect as Dr. Evil's rebellious son.  When you see this movie don't expect it to be just like the first one.  Mike Myers has given us something different and just as funny.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
283,Rockford_6,Dreadful.,2,10 September 2008,"Having enjoyed Mike Myers previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. It became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as puerile and unfunny as possible. I swit ched off after ten minutes. I watched it the other day a second time to see whether I had been unfair the first time. I switched it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve year-old boy could find this funny. The dialogue is an e mbarrassment, Myers is painful to watch (as is Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Fat Bastard makes matters even worse. Apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I personally recommend you avoid this like the plague, though several friends of mine enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).º",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
284,Plisko-52,"Great, but not as good as the first",8,11 June 1999,"Austin Powers 2 is a classic. It's the funniest movie since Austin Powers 1 (Funnier than Something About Mary)but does not exceed the humor, characters, or story of Myers' original. There are hardly any new swingin' lines from Austin, instead they're all again. Characters from the first such as Number 2, and Vanessa Kensington are given cameos, and don't exactly explain themselves. I thought number 2 was dead, and in this one he is alive and well, and his survival is not even mentioned. I know I'm sounding as though I'm disappointed with this film, but believe me, it is really good. Mini-Me is classic. Felicity Shagwell is so hot. The story and humor also plays out well. Go see it again and again!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
285,Chris-448,Mike Myers Mark II,4,29 July 1999,"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me does for badly-made sequels what the original Austin Powers did for spoofs on James Bond. The jokes in Austin Powers 2 are merely rehashed creations of the original - the movie is littered with the same old gags of Dr. Evil's ""zip it,"" lines such as, ""Yeah baby, yeah!"" and a newer, updated version of Dr Evil's Big Boy space hideout, now in the shape of a phallic penis. There were, of course, some hilarious scenes, mostly involving the new characters of Scottish henchman Fat Bastard and his stool. This movie made $54m in its first week of US release, as audiences quickly snapped up tickets in the mistaken belief that it would be even funnier than the original, but as soon as they realised that in fact, this movie was less funny than, to quote Powers, ""Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day,"" it soon bombed out of the charts. Still, the film will go down in history as a roaring success, and though it does have more appeal to Americans than to me, a Brit, I still don't see how any person would pay to see funny one-only jokes retold to them over and over again. Anyway, Myers should be happy - the money generated from commercial plugs from the movie (Starbucks Coffee & Virgin Atlantic) should alone tide him over for years to come. And I fear that that was the whole point in this movie - unlike the first, it was made to make money, not to make people laugh. I will have one fond memory of this movie though - the sight of an Austin-sponsored Virgin ""Shagatlantic"" billboard on a recent trip to New York. It read, ""London to New York. Five times a day baby, yeah!""",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
286,paulbrec,Childish,2,3 June 2002,"Childish, senseless humor. Just not funny. ""Yeah, baby"" got annoying after the third time. The character Fat Bastard was offensive.

288,loz-1,Oh come ON people....,4,24 April 2003,"I am totally baffled by the revelation that most people I know hated the first Austin Powers movie and loved the second. For a start, in the original you could feel sympathy with our hero who was hopelessly out of place in modern society, but that's just gone in this catastrophically disappointing sequel. Secondly, these 'hilarious gags' that were supposedly abundant in this film WERE TAKEN FROM THE FIRST! Wake up people! Now, I'm not going to diss this film completely as there were a couple of scenes that made me laugh out loud - the silhouetted tent scene and the Powers / Mini me punch up. However, a certain other new creation, Fat B*****d, is probably the least funny character ever to appear on our cinema screens. Oh, and I know I'm in the minority here, but Liz Hurley was infinitely preferable to Heather Graham as Powers' sidekick. In summary, an awful follow up to a superb movie that just scrapes 4/10 for the two scenes mentioned herein.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

But still, it can't compete with the first one, which was more of a satire and worth a second and third look etc. The second Austin is a movie which gets a bit worse every time you see it. When I saw the movie the first time in cinema I laughed my ass off in some scenes, which aren't that funny the second time. I can still recommend this movie to all Austin and comedy fans, it has some good music and funny moments in it, but do not expect a masterpiece. 7/10",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

But as a stand alone movie, AP:TSWSM is a good movie that did not confuse those who haven't catch the original. The story is adequate.Myers is a pure genius in this movie by playing 3 different characters. Austin Powers was cool, but Dr. Evil was more interesting and hilarious. Every scene involving him is great. A definite candidate for the best villain ever (among Darth Vader and the Joker)!! While as that disgusting Scottish thug that literally weighs a tonne he is very good, although he will be remembered for his disgusting behaviour only.Liz Hurley's cameo appearance at the start was great, and she made a superb Powers girl. Felicity Shagwell was so beautiful that I noticed some people drooled on her. But to me she's a so-so character, otherwise forgettable if not for her sexy outfits.Many of the gags were hilarious, while others were silly or too long that some audience don't get it at all.All in all, it was fun to watch this movie. I have to admit that watching AP:TSWSM is one of the best cinematic experience I've had this year along with 'SW1:Phantom Menace' and 'The Matrix'.

It is a series of Mike Myers skits held together with not much of a plot.  ""So what"" you say.  Well, what made the original so good was that it was funny at the same time as making fun of James Bond movies by use of clever little moments in the plot.  This one is not clever and the sophisticated humour of the original is sacrificed for obvious, often gross, adolescent humour.  Don't get me wrong, I haven't laughed so much for a long time.  But I left the theatre with a bad feeling.  Oh, and Fat Bastard is a terrible addition to the group.  Whereas Random Task was a great spoof of Bond movies, Fat Bastard is completely out of left field.

Austin let me down in more ways than one.

And for good measure, bring a date who is in an equally goofy, cheap-humor kind of mood.

I can cope with sitting there for 90 minutes, trying to give this film a chance whilst constantly letting my line of sight drift off the TV every three seconds because there's more entertainment looking out of the window, and I can even cope with the bad acting and the bad selection of actors, (well, just Mike Myers - Heather Graham played a good part in Boogie nights) OK, films with bad humour unfortunately do exist, and they can even sometimes be enjoyable; but I do end up not classing them as comedies. An example is the Monthy Python films. However, The Spy Who Shagged was somewhat different, and, to be honest, it was insulting. It seems the' hole of a director was only interested in making money and not a good film along with it. So what really annoyed me...where to begin.Boring, made the bond film 'The spy who loved me' (which I'm guessing is the film the spy who shagged me is trying to make a fool out of) look like it should have never been made, when the bond films as a whole are very good. Bad acting, and I mean bad. You know what I mean when someone cracks a joke, and no one laughs, the comedy is like that, but it continues on and on and on. Example. we see Heather Graham in a bikini - the camera slowly moving further up from toe to head, and then the same to Mike Myers - where we see he has a ridiculous amount of body hair, (HILARIOUS ...I think not), and the ""YEH baby YEH"" and the ""Shag pad"" lines are even worse - I now feel like hitting Mike Myers. I had the similar scenario with the actor Jim Carrey, but he annoys me a lot less, and has actually demonstrated he can act, as seen in Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind - an excellent film, I must add.I have to say though, Gold member was a huge improvement, but again, made the bond film 'Gold finger' look bad, plus, as a whole, it was still terrible.

The new sight gags had me rolling on the floor.  But the best thing about the new movie was its budget.  The bigger budget allowed the filmmakers to take production design, costume design, cinematography, makeup, SFX, etc. to new heights.I thought the new script left me a little disappointed, however.  They tried to pack a 100-minute story in a film already loaded with sight gags.  I thought Felicity Shagwell should have had more purpose in the film, rather than just being Austin's source of motivation.  (Heather Graham really is a hottie!)

""Yes, Austin ... we knew it all along,"" says Basil Exposition).Finally, in AP: IMOM, -that- Austin would not have called himself a ""sexy bitch"" over and over and over. Yeah, it was amusing the first time, but the other four or five lost their luster FAST. This guy is waaayyy too much into himself and shows us nothing of the vulnerable yet cool AP from the first film.The film's laughs were huge (Frau spraying Mini Me with the water was a huge hit with me), but not as witty or constant as in the first film of this franchise.I work at movie theatre, so I can see this film for free until my eyes bleed... but I'll only go to it again because I don't have to pay.Let's send good wishes (and a few prayers!) to Myers and Roach before they get started on AP3.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Dr. Evil seemed more appealing, even, gasp, more likable. Fat Bastard was just a dumb excuse for Mike Myers to use his Scottish accent.

He is even better as the evil villain, Dr. Evil.  The funniest parts are, in fact, Dr. Evil's relationship with his son ""Zip it!"" and his appearance on the Jerry Springer show.  Myers is at his worst with the gross character, Fat Bastard, who is disgusting and not that funny.  There are too many jokes about feces and stuff like that which detract from the movie.  The movie is a bit slow towards the end.  But, it is quite funny and merits at least a 7.  Heather Graham, a native Milwaukean, is a beautiful and excellent ""Bond-like"" girl in this movie and is brimming with optimism and charm.  Mini-me and Dr. Evil singing ""What if God Were One of Us?"" were also highlights.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
313,Sarjenka,"Oh, behave!!!",8,5 September 1999,"Very funny!!! I had a really good laugh when I saw the movie on the big screen. Especially when Mini-me appeared, with cat, I almost lost it!I don't think that Mike Myers should make a third Austin Powers, though. It would be too much.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
314,mic check,Mr. Mojo rising,7,11 May 2000,"Austin Powers is one of those movies that has become MORE popular as time wears on. Austin's slang has worked its way into the lexicon and everything from the redhot video to the Austin Powers Penis Enlarger is on sale and raking in meeeeeelions. When news of a sequel hit the streets, fans freaked. It's safe to say that AP2 is rivaled only by The Phantom Menace as 1999's must see.The wait is over.The second-most anticipated movie of 1999 finally comes to theaters. We're ecstatic to report that AP is a friggin' laugh riot, as Myers and crew have strung together another brilliant collection of one-liners and over the top, sometimes horribly disgusting, sight gags. The follow-up to 1997's video hit has Austin heading back to the 60s to track down his mojo, stolen by one of Dr. Evil's comically evil hapless henchmen. What's mojo? A multi-colored, stringy looking mess that makes Austin irresistible to the ladies. But the plot isn't so important. This is the Austin you know and love, only this time he's even more raw and hardcore.It's clear that Myers was given a much larger budget to bring his vision to the screen after the runaway success of Austin Powers on video. The sets in Spy are much more vibrant and huge, the effects (yes, effects) are top-notch, and the pacing is completely nonstop. I had a perma-grin stuck on my face through the whole thing and will need to see it again just because the audience drowned out some lines with laughter.
Here Kitty Kitty Kitty Spy picks up with Austin taking a trip in a time machine back to the smashing 60s where, as we all know, he is a sexual dynamo. The time travel bits can get confusing, but as Basil Exposition of British Intelligence says, ""Just sit back and enjoy yourself."" Back in the 60s, Austin quickly draws the attention of his nemesis Dr. Evil. The hilarity begins as a patchwork parade of moronic henchmen attempt to wipe out Austin.Still, the best reason to shell out your cash is that AP2 is clearly Dr. Evil's movie. If he's your favorite, you're in luck. Most important, we see him get some.
The film does lean a bit too heavily on gags from the first flick and some of the ""Yeah, baby"" schtick grows old fast. (When your Mammy starts saying ""Yeah, baby,"" it's clearly tired, right?) Still, fans of the original will feel right at home with the budget destructo devices, the horrid teeth, and the clumsy bumblings of Austin himself. In a summer full of high concepts and big budget, AP2 is just the ticket.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
315,Trainor,Funnier then the original!,8,14 June 1999,"For once I had the opportunity to see a sequel of a comedy that was actually funnier then the original.  True, Heather Graham could take some acting lessons, and it's also true that there are a few slow spots in the film.  But, when this movie is on, it is on!  There are several scenes that had the entire theatre laughing out loud.  I know that I for one will have to see it again to get the parts I missed due to all of the laughing. It was a completely entertaining movie and I promise that if you can bear with it's few down times the movie will more then make up for it in the end.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
316,JAKick,I have seen better.,1,22 June 1999,"This movie is fast rising on my WORST movie of all time list.  Every character in this film was bad.  Fat Bastard was done so much better by Mike Meyers as the Dad in "" So I Married an Axe Murderer"" or even as the owner of If Its Not Scottish Its Crap on "" SNL."" Austin Powers (the character) was boring.  He didn't have one funny line, or gesture.  The only good character was Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell.  Great eye candy, but only good as an character. As for the humor, I didn't even crack a smile, let alone laugh.  I almost walked out.  I can not recommend this movie.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
317,jam-35,One laugh after the other,8,27 December 1999,"This was just a good as the first one.  It was one laugh after the next. As you well know, this movie introduces Mini-me and Fat Bastard.  These are two of the funniest characters I've seen in a movie in a long time.  After watching this movie, you will be saying one of the catch phases over and over again.  Heather Graham is just smoking in this movie as in all of her others.  I would guess by the box office receipts, there will be a third movie.  Hopefully it will be just as good as the first two.  I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
318,CaterpillarEffect,Light-hearted spoof to watch with friends,6,18 July 2010,"I was quite sceptical when it came to watching this, but I was pleasantly surprised with a decent James Bond spoof. The main thing was the fact that the makers used the main parts of what makes the James Bond movies – the women, the sex, the indestructibility of the hero – and successfully transferred them into the spoof. James Bond is all those things, but things such as his lack of respect for women are quite implicit, whilst Austin Powers makes them very obvious and brings out the true nature of Bond. I enjoyed seeing Mike Myers in a variety of different roles, and the rest of the cast do a nice job, but it is the costume department that impressed me most with the 60s style clothing. Some of the humour is quite shallow and simple, and at times stupid. It's not 'clever', it's jokes and gags used over and over again in many other films. I think it might be the fact that I don't find silly humour satisfying enough that didn't bring me to enjoy the film thoroughly, but I still quote some of Austin's lines to this day. Verdict? Fun, light-hearted watch, but the some of the silly jokes didn't cut it for me, making me raise an eyebrow. It's a fun film to watch with a group of friends instead of on your own, since you could end up over analysing the film, whilst with friends you are more likely to enjoy it.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
319,Schmee,"Takes off and lands, but the in flight movie sucks",6,18 June 1999,"I compare Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me to an airplane trip (and I don't mean a spaceship that looks like a...) When you get into the plane it's exciting. Then there is the take off which I enjoy. All this takes about 30 minutes until you are simply cruising at a fixed altitude and becoming pretty bored. There are perks, a couple drinks and maybe a package of pretzels from the flight attendants (""Bring on the sexy stews, baby, yeah"") but really I'm looking forward to the landing. The landing was smooth and just as cool as the take off, but by then I'd been sitting for an hour listening to conversations that I wish I could have blocked out.Like that, Austin starts out really hilariously and has a great deal of quick jokes. But after the initial get-go (a go go) I felt it didn't have the speed it needed to keep the energy level high. The main problem was the new characters. Before I say the bad characters, though, I'd like to say that Rob Lowe did a fantastic job of acting like a young Number 2. The other positive new character was ""mini-me"" which had his moments, small as they were.But then there was ""Fat Bastard"" which nobody seemed to think was very funny at all. This character was added solely for ""gross-out"" humor, but it wasn't very funny. Even Fat Bastard's last scene was flat and not all that interesting. In my opinion, though, the worst new character was Falicity Shagwell whom had no character at all. The character was poorly written and equally poorly acted by Heather Graham. Perhaps Mike was making fun of all those hallow women in the James Bond films?The strongest points of the new film were those that were in the original. I loved the continuation of Scott (Dr. Evil's Son) and his relationship with his father. This took them to the Jerry Springer show and through time. Sadly, even this relationship was not as interesting as it was in the first movie.The joke style was still the same. Several shots which would normally cut away which instead show us the real person behind Austin Powers or Dr. Evil. Several jokes were taken as far as they could go (and some even further into the credits). My favorite character from the original that made a return in Will Farrell's Mustafa (he's not even on screen for most of his role).In the end, I did laugh at the picture but was disappointed that it could not live up to the original. I give it 2 1/2 stars out of 4.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
320,nutinpersonal,Never Laughed So Hard,10,14 June 1999,"I honestly don't think I have ever laughed so hard at a movie.  And that goes for everyone that was sitting around us.  Boy, do we ever need more films like this.  He's naughty, but there is such a sweetness to him. Even Dr. Evil.  I'm going to see this one again before it leaves the theatres. You're not going to feel like going out and annihilating the world after this film.  Make love, not war, Baby!  Any way you look at it you feel good after seeing Mike Myers characters.  Healthy for you and healthy for society. I can't wait for Austin Powers III",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
321,Bruce-39,Recycled the humor but not the humanity,6,21 June 1999,"I didn't expect Austin Powers II to be as good as the original, but I was still hoping for more than this. Most of the good jokes from the first film are here again, but they're funny this time as well, so that isn't a fault. But apart from the ""rocket shape"" jokes and the Jerry Springer bits, there wasn't anything new that should have been there. What was new and shouldn't have been there were the Fat Bastard character and the fecal stuff. Once you get into nauseatingly gross, you fall out of humor. When a comedy has me looking away from the screen, it is doing something wrong. The greatest flaw in the film was the elimination of the two elements that made the characters in Austin Powers I people we cared about. In the first, Austin constantly had to cope with the problems of a man out of his own time. This gave him a lost aura that audiences could feel for themselves. Elizabeth Hurley gave a charming performance as Vanessa, playing an opposite character and foil for Austin. Her replacement in the sequel was played competently, but was one-dimensional and had none of the conflicts with Austin that made the Austin-Vanessa relationship compelling. The other relationship element that was lost was the humorously pathetic attempts by Dr. Evil to bond with his son. This time we got nothing but mutual derision between the two. Mini-me was supposed to be a replacement for this, but again there was no conflict between the two, so again, little interest. In sum--good humor, excessively gross, and no depth. Go to a bargain show or wait for video.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
322,mjukr,Austin Powers: The Spy Who Swindled Me,3,21 June 1999,"I admit, some parts of this film were hilarious (i.e. the Jerry Springer sequence, and...uh...hmmm). Beyond Evil's mauling of guests on the Jerry Springer show; however, the film became more annoying than anything else. Does Mike Meyers really believe that he can buy our laughter with tired gags reminiscent of the first film?  Let's see...Dr. Evil's ""shhhh"" skit was changed into a ""zip it"" sequence, which was just plain depressing; instead of falling into Dr. Evil's fire trap and screaming for help, Mustafa falls off a cliff and screams for help; Ivana Humpalot sequence=Alotta Fagina sequence; Burt Bacharach sequence=Burt Bacharach sequence; Austin makes bad puns after a guard dies=Austin makes bad puns after a guard dies; and on and on and on.  Even more regurgitation from the first film: Okay, we get it--Frau likes to yell, enough already.  Did anyone really find Dr. Evil's outburst of ghetto speak in front of the president funny?  And of course let's not forget the lame, already tired catch phrases like ""yeah, baby"" and ""shagadelic."" Not even Mini-Me or Fat Bastard (the only non-recycled goods in this film) could save the movie.  Yes, Austin Powers, who originally was intended to be a parody of 60's spies and ""Casino Royale"" culture, has sadly become a parody of even himself.  A big disappointment.

324,Jarvis-6,I give it an 8.2,8,25 June 1999,"After seeing the movie and reading an interview with Mike Meyers, I got the impression that he approached this film with a ""go to work and have fun"" kind of attitude. That's not to say that he didn't have fun in the first movie, it just seems as if the energy was a bit more focused the first time around. I found this movie utterly hilarious at times, revolting at others (drinking diahorrea), but consistently lighthearted and fun for the duration. If you liked the first Austin Powers, chances are pretty good that you'll enjoy this one. I've read a few negative and convoluted comments on this film, and the only thing I have to say is this: Any attempt to analyze this movie on a level other than a unique brand of comedic fun is futile.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I had to look away a few times, because it was just too gross.  Come on, was that coffee scene really necessary?  I think at times the movie tried to be too funny.  I mean, yeah, Dr. Evil's ""Just the Two of Us"" song was funny, but what was the point of it?  I think they could've focused more on certain characters too; like Scott Evil and Mr. Bigglesworth (sorry, but I think Scott and the cat added humor to the first movie).

Mike Myers is a comic genius, and in my opinion has taken over from actors such as Robin Williams, Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler as Hollywood's funniest person. Although Austin was the main character, Dr Evil and Mini Me really made the movie so great. Heather Graham is a babe and was great as Felicity Shagwell. Fat Bastard was not my favourite character, but he showcased Mike Myers' comic ability more than anyone. I went to the cinema to see this movie three times, and I would go three more times. It was simply hilarious. Hail Mike Myers!!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Shameless/pointless/tactless (take your pick) plugs and references permeate every scene, there's so much material that it has no focus, there's too much recycled and overused material from the first movie, it has poor scripting, poor editing, loose ends, hacked-up scenes and continuity, lame plot devices, and Myers simply can't do Austin like he used to. And why did they resort to bathroom humor and Jerry Springer? They got so carried away with the success of the first that they forgot what made it so great: subtlety. Like Wayne's World 2, Austin Powers 2 is contrived, slapstick comedy. High points? Rob Lowe's impersonation of Robert Wagner is dead on, and Heather Graham is fascinating as she straddles the boundary between wholesome and naughty.

And the commercials for Coke, Heineken and Starbuck's were a bit annoying.The 'user ratings' show that women like this film more than men.

Sweep up the editing room floor and see what you can find to make it longer!"" Hence, the jokes that might have been funnier as throw-aways get played and replayed to death. Dr. Evil's ""Just the Two of Us"" rap should have been left on the soundtrack, for example. Highlights: the ongoing dysfunctional relationship between Scotty and Dr. Evil; Heather Graham's wardrobe.

335,tash-8,Hilarious but nowhere near the original,4,14 June 1999,"What is obvious about the sequel is that Myers spent most of his time developing the Dr. Evil character, while pretty much ignoring Austin Powers altogether.  Dr. Evil is so fully defined now, that nearly all of his scenes come off beautifully.  His two henchmen, Mini Me and Fat Bastard are inspired creations. As for Austin Powers, what were they thinking?  The character is unforgivably short-changed, being forced to drink liquid feces in one of the film's several low points.  While Dr. Evil has two great partners, Powers is stuck with obnoxious Heather Graham, a far cry from the oh-so-talented and beautiful Elizabeth Hurley (who is tastelessly disposed of within the film's first few minutes).  In addition, he's forced to repeat nearly every previously funny joke from the first film. The naive, clumsy, endearing charm of the original is largely replaced with sick, mean humor, along the lines of the cut-and-paste humor of the Farrelly Brothers or Adam Sandler.  While the film is at times extremely funny, it doesn't warrent repeat viewings, as did the first. Besides, Mr. Bigglesworth only has ONE SCENE!!!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
336,Ray-107,Disappointment,4,12 June 1999,"Being an enormous fan of the first movie, I was expecting great things from this one. But honestly, this movie was terrible. I don't know where to start.1. The movie assumes its own hilarity. The first movie was a classic because it didn't come with any pretensions. Obviously, this film thinks its the greatest thing in the world before it even starts. It takes more than costumes and catch phrases to make great comedy. You need a great script, this movie doesn't have one.2. The character of Felecity Shagwell is devoid of all mystery and tension. The whole concept of the female counterpart spy is supposed to be a woman who keeps the lead at arms lengths for a time and sexual tension develops. Felecity wants to shag Austin from the first time their eyes meet.3. The scenes involving Fat Bastard aren't funny, they are repulsive. And since when is being fat funny, or being a midget for that matter?4. The film is rife with unfunny and strained moments.5. The film has too many arcane references. Most of the target teen to early 20s audience is not going to get the Alan Parsons Project and Great Santini references.6. The shameless and UNFUNNY corporate spots. (Heineken, Chilis, etc.)The first film was a classic because it had first rate comedic material and didn't make assumptions of greatness. With Part 2 I came into the theater psyched and ready to bust my side laughing. In truth I had a hard time staying awake. Total laugh out loud count: 5. Next time, Mike, concentrate on writing a great script, and don't assume your audience is going to laugh just because you give us a ""yeah baby""",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

341,Crane_94,More Powers To Ya!,6,15 September 2008,"This is the second of three Austin Powers movies that have been released. It's basically a parody of the James Bond and Our Man Flint movies. If you've seen either or both of the other Powers movies, you know the storyline to this one: Austin (Mike Myers) is a secret agent (!) working to rid the world of its megalomaniacal nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers), who has various bizarre world domination machinations and is aided by Bond-style gizmos, a round table of dopey assistants, and other evil-doing secret agents (also Myers). Just think of a simple-minded Bond storyline and throw in '60s slang, haute couture, and bad teeth, with a heaping helping of potty jokes and double entendres, and a cast with the looks of the United Nations of Circus Freaks (with the thankful exception of the sexy female secret agents Powers partners with). Without the babes (Heather Graham, here--is it me, or do those eyes make her look like a doll? She makes me randy, baby. Yeah!... Oh, and there's a way-too-brief cameo by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in this one.) and Dr. Evil's ever-changing schemes, these movies would be totally repetitious. Basically, since there's so little variation in these movies, this review could apply to all. I recently purchased this and after watching it (and having seen it at the theatre) I noticed how many jokes have been recycled throughout this series. If you've only seen the latest, Goldmember, you've seen many of the same jokes as the first two. Which is not all bad, but it does become somewhat predictable and tedious. Although, each of the movies does have its share of original jokes, many of which are downright hilarious and make the movies worthwhile. Kudos has to be given to Myers for his effort. He's hilarious and has an under-appreciated talent in playing so many distinct characters in the series. The Dr. Evil character, especially, is the one in which the actor disappears. He created the characters and has made a fortune from it. If you liked the others, you'll like this one. If you haven't seen the others and you like dumb plots, silly costumes and makeup, silly dancing, silly humour, double entendres, and potty jokes, (or if you're a 12 year old boy) you'll like this.

With his confusion over the decades (money-wise) and his ""compassionate & sincere"" duets with Mini-Me, he definitely made the movie worth seeing.

Oh brother!).  There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before.  OK - so maybe I laughed once or twice at the beginning, but a film that relies on so few (weak) jokes, over and over, is an insult to those watching it.It's supposed to be a parody of the bond films - but this is perhaps the vital error.  Bond films, by their very nature, never take themselves seriously - parodying a parody just doesn't work!I don't mind admitting that if it wasn't for Heather Graham's 'breathtaking performance' I could have comfortably slept through the whole thing.

A few new characters, Fat Bastard and Mini-Me, are hysterical.  Fat Bastard is so disgusting, again played by Mike Myers, and Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer, Dr Evils 1/8th size clone, stole the screen every time.  Some bad acting at times, by Heather Graham, a horrible actor in this movie in my opinion.9 out of 10 stars.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Well, I guess Hollywood found out that making silly themed movies to the 14 to 21 year old audience really worked. If you take a look and see how many new ""youth movies"" are coming out you get the idea. They all go to the movies on weekends and they represent a large group of moviegoers. I think they should've left Austin Powers back in the 60's.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

AP is funny, but hes annoying, esp. with the girls climbing all over him... Dr. Evil on the other hand is hilarius.  Every Scene with him in it is funny... I think Mike Myers should drop the AP bit and exclusivly do Dr. Evil in a new Dr. Evil movie... now that would def. be funny.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
351,lancekoz55-1,Seems to be made for a whole different audience...maybe,3,15 January 2014,"This sequel is absolutely no more than a tenth as amusing as the original. The lighthearted charm of spoofing the early Bond movies is not nearly as evident here. Instead, it is full of disgusting body 'humor', made up of showing and implying the ugliness of obesity and all matters concerning what goes in or may come out of the anus. Short visuals that might generate a laugh are on screen way too long. Even the 'mini-Me', a cute concept, just becomes a dreary, hyperactive ass joke at one point. All of which makes me wonder, who is the audience for this? The humor is slanted toward maybe 12 yr old boys, who would be way too young to care about the concept of a Bond James spoof in the first place. And imho, it's way too filthy and sexually oriented for them.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
352,Slanky-2,So many areas of bad...,1,21 December 1999,"I would like to preface this by saying that I loved the first.  In fact, I own three versions of it on video.  This, however, will not enjoy such esteem.  When I first saw this movie, I thought of two outcomes:  Either Meyers would do what he did in the first and produce another masterpiece or he would try to force success and fail miserably.  Unfortunately, Meyers went the business route and failed miserably.  In the first, the humor was subtle and witty.  In the second, the humor revolved around the toilet. The first was about Austin.  The second was about Dr. Evil.  It even seemed that Dr. Evil was done differently in the second!  Mini-me was a terrible, terrible addition (not really as a result of the acting choice, mind you) for more reasons than his being totally unrelated to the plot, and let's face it:  Shagwell was just a pretty, ditzy, face.  This movie was less a sequel than a horrid spoof of a decent movie.  Instead of relying on the original humor of the movie and continuing to the next logical level, Meyers forced himself (and, to a degree, the other actors) to exactly play the part he did in the last movie so it comes off forced and stale.  Not to mention the utterly disgusting Fat Bastard.  I mean, he was so totally revolting that even the younger members of the audience were grossed-out.  The central flaw with this movie was that it was obviously made to make money, not for fun.  Meyers knew that he had a winning formula and rather than take it to the next level and risk losing audience (which wouldn't have happened--Meyers is too talented), he played it safe and went for business. This meant more gross-out humor (something totally lacking in the first, thankfully) and more, more, much much more product placement.  Gee.... I wonder how much VW payed to have a Bug be the time machine, rather than a strange vortex like Dr. Evil's?  The saddest part about that is how hypocritical it was of him to do that, especially after parodying it so well in Wayne's World.  I guess my hope for any other sequels is that Meyers will return to being himself, talented, funny, and original.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
353,sonvolt,A huge disappointment,1,12 June 1999,"All I can say is that this film is just not funny. I loved the first, but the sequel does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as International Man of Mystery. It is ridiculously repetitive, and the jokes that are used constantly throughout the movie aren't even funny to begin with. Looking back on it, I can't think of one moment of the film that I found even remotely amusing. Most of the time, I found myself cringing at the horribly inept attempts at humor. Worst of all are the numerous sequences which meander on for minutes with no direction whatsoever, as if the actors are making it all up as they go along (I think they probably did). Elvis Costello should sue someone for being associated with such an embarrassment.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

But Mike Myers comes through again with a goofy but fun performance that has you laughing out loud in spite of yourself.  The accompanying cast is strong, with Rob Lowe giving a striking performance as a young version of Robert Wagner's ""No. 2"" character.  His mannerisms of Wagner are dead-on.  Heather Graham may be the Goldie Hawn for the 2000s: Funny, delightful, sexy, delicious.  Verne Troyer gives a nice performance as ""Mini-Me,"" Dr. Evil's clone.

I was one on the 19 billion people waiting for this movie ever since I heard that it was going to open. But, like most movies that I have gotten to love and taken to religious levels, I found this movie to be a tad disappointing.  Although, if it was anything less then the best movie that I have ever seen in my life, it would have somewhat been a disappointment.There are two things that I must give mad props to in this movie: Mike Myers scottish voice.  I have loved it in some of the previous movies that he has done!  His ability to have it changed from nice and kind to mean as all hell!  It is great for comedic relief.  The other was that little dude we like to call ""Mini-me"".  He was ""the bomb"" and he made it a very big success.Can I have a hug?",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I am sure I missed a lot more of the funny lines because I was laughing so hard!!  Mike Myers sure loves to be naked in his movies as proven by the hysterical opening sequence.  Mini Me, Scott Evil and references to pivate parts make this movie so much fun.  Some of the jokes that were in the first are back in this and are still as funny. It's not ""shh"", it's ""zip it"" in a great scene with Dr., Evil and he son. The Jerry Springer part is perfect for this film!  Enjoy it!  I did!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

The same general storyline is used, but there is alot of creativity to liven it up. The new characters are wonderful and all of them gets at least a few laughs all through the film. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me are the most memorable and my favorites, Felicity Shagwell is a nice alternative to Vanessa Kensington and Austin is still the same Austin, played wonderfully, but in a way, overshadowed by Dr, Evil and his associated characters, but all of them are portrayed the way they are meant to be and there is a kind of humor for everyone.

Filled from end to end with poor (sexual) innuendo and very little humour of any other kind. The only problem being that it (carry on humour) just isn't funny anymore.The acting performances were only average.

364,SonNLaw,A spoof of a spoof.,2,13 June 1999,"I never had the opportunity to see the original Austin Powers in the theater, but bought it based on recommendation when it hit DVD.  I must say, the original is one of my favorite movies, and I have been anticipating the release of the sequel for a while.  I must say, I am a bit let down, as this film is more of a spoof of the original than a continuation of the story. There are some scenes in the sequel which are far funnier than anything in the original, but as a whole...something is majorly lacking.  It seems that Myers and company tried to determine what made the original funny, and stuffed this one full of nothing but rip-offs and re-hashes of those aspects.  Whereas we got some great lines to quote from the original, (""Yeah, Baby!"", or ""Throw me a friggin' bone here"") nothing really stands out in this one, because all that we get is an endless string of such lines. Austin lacks the humanity that he had in the original, and simply stands as a caricature of the character we grew to love in the first film.  Although this movie picks up minutes after the first one, Austin has somehow fully adjusted to 90's life, and seems to be an entirely different person.  He was kinda like your uncle's bad impression of Austin Powers...running around yelling ""Yeah, Baby,""and ""Randy,"" and, ""Do I make you horny?"" constantly, instead of every once in a while.Overall, a funny film...but nowhere NEAR the original.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
365,Foeth,Austin goes where Austin has been before.,6,14 June 1999,"The sequel to Austin Powers has a few good laughs in it, but I found most jokes to be a repeating of part I. Some jokes were actually the very same jokes. Come to think of it, most jokes were exactly the same ones as in part one, and some even in the same section of the movie as in part I.This I found a bit disappointing, and combining that with a story that doesn't lift off makes it a bit dull. Dr Evil (Who is by far the most entertaining character)'s sidekick, mini-me quickly becomes very predictable, and the final battlescene between Austin and Mini-me isn't that much of a show.The scenes with the oddly shaped rocket isn't all that bad, but even that joke gets repeated, within the film itself! Sure, throw another minute of the same thing at the viewer.If you haven't seen part one, I suppose it's a very amusing film, but if you have, the nice jokes and gags are spare.But, one thing remains to said, the appearance of Dr Evil and his son, Seth, on Jerry Springer Show is hilarious.Because I liked part I so much: 6/10",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I for one ignored all (if that many at all) negative comments about the movie because I knew that if the first one ""got my mojo running"" then the second would do wonders.  AND I WAS RIGHT!Not many movies move me to go see them twice, but this was a must do-again film.  I agree with those who say it's better than the first--and that's how it should be.  Not like those movies where the funny plot is established but the energy lacks, SPY WHO SHAGGED ME was outrageously funny and kept me laughing for many days after I saw it.

This one had a worse plot than the first but was even more funnier.Austin traveled back to the 60's and learns that Dr. Evil is hiding. He steels his mojo, from his frozen body. Austin takes pictures of himself, and while admiring himself he realized that he's lost his mojo. Sexually hurt, he gets help from Filicity Shagwell.You have to love Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's clone.

All that's left is MM as Dr. Evil in some of the best lines with Tim Robbins as the President.  To believe my 10 year old cousin liked this over the first.

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of funny parts to it, but with Dr. Evil having just as much (if not more) screen time as Austin Powers, it seems as though Mike Myers and Jay Roach forgot something. Sometimes I wondered whether they knew if they were making a comedy or not. The satire is gone, but at least the characters are all still here in their familiar form.

But they never lose their appeal.I think people have forgotten just how funny the first one was and it far out-weighs any recent comedies. So if its comparably funny then it also must be a comedy classic.

376,Keena Films,"Entertaining, but not a patch on the original",5,8 August 1999,"The Phantom Menace was hyped up beyond any sane person's realistic expectations. Consequently, anybody who didn't get swept away by the ridiculous merchandising and press hysteria got to see a rather fun and very well-made film.Austin Powers 2 has also been hyped up a lot, with reviews shouting how it's as good, IF NOT BETTER!, than the original. With these seemingly sensible opinions of the film, I had high hopes for the sequel, seeing as the original Austin Powers is one of my favourite comedies (along with Myers' other creation, Wayne's World).However, AP2 was rather disappointing. The vast majority of the film's jokes were simply lifted straight out of the original, with no variation. The rest relied entirely on the viewer's knowledge of pop culture. Depending on how clued in your are to Myers' take on the latter half of the 20th century dictates how much you will get out of the film. The original included parodies and sly references in a subtle and very clever way; The Spy Who Shagged Me shoves them in your face.More worrying is the fact that Myers seems to have forgotten how to play Austin. Whereas before he came across as a slightly off- centre semi-hippy, stuck in the '90s which he couldn't quite figure out, this time round he just seems like a boring old fart who is trying desperately to hold on to memories of the '60s.His portrayal of Dr Evil was very good, although we got to see perhaps a little too much of him.

381,mdeuser,Save your money and go rent the original,6,24 July 1999,"Well, the summary line pretty much says it all.This movie has received a great deal of praise, but generally more from viewers than from critics.  There is a quite good reason for this.It isn't that good.Austin Powers 2 pales in comparison to its predecessor.  Where the first Powers was fresh and clever, both in its now famous catch-lines and its satirical humor, the second one profoundly disappoints.  In general, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" represents a low-brow pandering to a mass audience, which can be only expected from a movie whose main character shamelessly hawks everything from online services to beer.  Many of the once-spontaneous and original catch lines injected into the pop culture mainstream by the first installment come off here as both hackneyed and forced.  Also, in place of the fish-out-of-water humor of that made the original great are attempts at belly laughter in the There's Something About Mary style that unfortunately fall far short of the 1998 smash-hit comedy's example.  And, despite her attractiveness, Heather Graham is no Elizabeth Hurley; Graham's acting is plastic, and as a result, the love relationship between her and Myers comes off as unbelievable and irrelevant.For all of these reasons, AP2 is unworthy of its namesake -- it shamelessly runs into the ground the one-liners of the first, and at the same time makes a departure from the type of humor that made the first one so great.

This wore thin very fast.  Not to mention that 95% of the humor now deals with bodily functions or phallic jokes, aiming at the kiddie audience.The first movie was a breath of fresh air, this one was the same air recycled and now quite stale.  Pass on this one, don't give into the hype. You will be much more satisfied popping in the video of the first movie for another spin.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Austin II contains a better mix of raunchy, smart, subtle, obvious, high brow, low brow, physical, and dialogue initiated humor.  In the first Austin, I found myself forcing laughter.

However, my faith in the International Man of Mystery, couple with my desire to see Heather Graham in a variety of short skirts, won out in the end.And I'm glad it did.  While there are no laughs as pants peeing hard as those in the first movie (""Who does Number Two work for?""), the humour of the first movie that has lasted through repeated viewings is present here as well.  I loved the further exploration of the relationship between Dr. Evil and Scott Evil, and Fat Bastard's tag line (""I'm dead sexy!"") is likely to be the big phrase from this show.  Also, of course, Heather Graham has her own mojo.The only things that detract from this movie (besides the bathroom humour, which I frankly enjoyed) are a few pieces that were carried over from AP1 that don't quite fit here.  You'll know them when you see them, and they can certainly be excused, given the overwhelming success of the lines in the first outing.Overall, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one.

For this movie, it seemed that Mike Myers ran out of jokes so he tried to be as disgusting as possible in an effort to make the audience laugh.  Some of those scenes were funny, but most of them were just disgusting.What really gets my goat about this film though is its' no-holds barred attitude about commercialism.  The film seems to say: ""Thanks for paying $9 to see this movie...here's a bunch of commercials for you to see!""  I mean, if I wanted to watch commercials, I'd have stayed home and watch TV for free.  Don't get me wrong, a commercial here or there in a film is fine but this was just too much.On the other hand, I really liked the actor who played ""Mini-me"" in the film.

Don't get me wrong, I didn't think it was wreched, but I was disappointed. The biggest downfall was the removal of 'Vanessa' for 'Felicity'. Graham came of as being flaky, and didn't seem to really get into her part. If you're looking for a good movie with Myers check out the first Austin Powers movie! It was WAY better!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
390,Malooly,A hilarious installment- go see ASAP before someone spoils it,7,11 June 1999,"I was looking forward to this movie for a long time, and when I heard about a sneak preview, I decided I couldn't wait another day for the official release.  I was NOT disappointed and now I'll just have to deal with waiting months, if not a year, to buy it on DVD.  It was pretty consistently hilarious, but there are definitely a few parts that will be either highlights or lowlights depending on the audience.  They go unnecessarily far with some bits of toilet humor, to the point that ushers will be finding half-finished bags of popcorn nationwide for as long as this movie is in theaters.  However, it is impossible for any disgusting parts stuck into the movie to ruin the overall effect, and I especially appreciated the increased Bond references in this one, beyond that of Austin Powers himself.As with most comedies, there are failed jokes and jokes that just don't live up to their potential, and just like every other movie, they should have run it past me before making the final cut.  However, they didn't, but I have found that movies are much more enjoyable if you look past the flaws, ignore those jokes that don't work, and laugh that much harder at the ones that do. This movie has plenty, and whatever you do, don't go in expecting a sequel, just go in to see the second installment in the Austin Powers series.  The premise is built for a series of movies- it's not like Die Hard, with Bruce Willis repeatedly getting stuck killing a bunch of terrorists against all odds- each Austin Powers movie will just be one 90-minute piece of the over three-decade opposition of Austin and Dr. Evil.  This whole movie is packed with energy, and it is abundantly clear that everyone, even celebrities in cameos that pop up throughout the film, is having a great time and that makes it that much more fun for the audience.  After only two movies, and two years, we already have many classic lines and several classic characters.  The success I predict for this movie after seeing it myself guarantees a third movie and hopefully they won't abandon the series if the next one isn't as well-received.  I am sure that these movies will only seem better with age, even with the many contemporary references that occasionally form the basis of the plots.  The best movie series' are the ones that are planned for, and Mike Myers has always talked about Austin Powers as a character instead of a movie, and has offhandedly mentioned possible plots for other movies since the first one.This movie starts out very funny, drops off a bit with a synchronized swimming part that goes on too long, then goes through the roof shortly after and only drifts significantly down occasionally.  I don't want to even mention characters or situations now that will be quoted from for at least the next decade, so that everyone can see them for themselves.  I advise you to see it as soon as possible for the minimum amount of spoilage.  That really goes for every movie, but especially this one- only Star Wars was a greater threat for those who didn't see it in the first week.""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is a rare movie that I actually immediately felt that I couldn't wait to go see again.  You can never match the feeling of the first viewing, but then again, that first time you don't have that knowing anticipation that you get with repeated viewings.  It's a tradeoff that can also be applied in a way to this sequel- try to value the fact that you usually know how Austin and Dr. Evil will react to certain situations or lines, instead of complaining about it.  If this were a string of deleted scenes or some sort of bonus feature for the first movie, people would be in heaven, but since it stands by itself for now, a lot of people will be very ready to sigh in lament.  Ignore the reviews- go see the movie and stay through the last credit.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
391,michaelo-3,Cannot be compared to the first Austin Power. Very weak.,2,13 June 1999,"I thought that this sequel fell in with all the others that have played on the success of the first move.  I thought it did have its funny parts, but few and far between.  I thought the addition of Fat Bastard was a real stretch.  No reason to have the character.  Most of the content was not appropriate for the rating.  This is the first of Michael's movies I have not been pleased with.  I get the feeling that he sold out just to get it to market fast.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

The only thing that I didnt like about this movie is why wasnt it Rated R, I wanted to see more of Heather Graham after all of those sexy outfits she wore or they were barely outfits.  Dr.Evil is the funniest thing of the whole movie, his dorky attitude and when he tries to be all hip.  Mini-me is my favorite character.  Fat Bastard was the most disguisting thing I had ever seen.

Seriously though this is pure camp and was just as good as the first one. I loved the misplaced references to pop culture including the Alan Parsons Project and Moon Units Alpha and Zappa. Some of the one liners from the movie have become ingrained in pop culture even today: ""Magma"", ""Mini Me"", ""One trillion dollars"" (with the hooked thumb). It is a fun movie but they could have done without recycling some of the older jokes and inserted some new stuff.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
397,Code_Green,This is Better Then the Original!,9,27 July 2002,"I thought that the original Austin Powers movie was pretty great, so I figured like most sequels, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" would end up being worse then the original, but I was wrong. It was by far, funnier then ""International Man of Mystery.""The cast was great. In the original, the actors and actresses seemed a bit uptight about their roles and by this movie they really loosened up and we got to see the characters as they were meant to be seen. There were a few good cameos in it. Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) was fantastic. She was almost like a female Austin Powers whereas Vanessa Kensington (Austin's girlfriend/wife from ""International Man of Mystery"") was so uptight. I also loved the opening where it turns out that Vanessa had been a fembot the whole time. It was great. ""Machine gun jubblies? How did I miss those baby?""Also, just recently I saw the newest Austin Powers sequel, ""Goldmember"" and I still think that this one was the best movie of the three. ""Goldmember"" was close to being as good as this though. I would recommend anyone see this movie. It might seem better if you see the first one though to get an idea of the characters. If the first one seems a bit dull, I would still recommend someone see the second one anyway just because it is a lot better then the original. If you enjoy this one and the second one, I would also recommend seeing ""Goldmember"" in theatres. Or if you'd prefer, just rent itwhen it comes to video.I rate this movie, 9 out of 10 stars.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
398,Wolfman316,One of the best movies of all time,10,17 July 2005,"AUSTIN POWERS THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is one of the best movies of all time. Very Entertaining, laugh-out-loud comedy and groovy baby!!! The Spy who shagged me is the best film out of the three Austin Powers films. This is a film, Mike Myers should be very proud of. In THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, Austin time-travels to the year 1969, where Dr. Evil has stolen Austin's body-fluid ""Mojo"" which makes Austin attract the opposite sex, without his Mojo, Austin is left powerless. Teaming up with a sexy CIA agent named Felicity Shagwell, Austin sets out to stop Dr. Evil who is holding Washington DC for ransom, and he plans to wipe out Washington DC with a laser gun on the moon, if the President does not pay the ransom. I laughed every minute throughout the movie. The moment where Dr. Evil is on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW and gets into a fight with Jerry Springer made me wet myself with laughter and especially when Mini-Me beats the s*** out Austin. What makes THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME such a great film is all the hilarious moments, music and action. Heather Graham was extremely sexy as Felicity and i think Felicity Shagwell deserves to have her own spin-off feature film, Verne Troyer did a good supporting role as Mini-Me and he makes the character very lovable, The hilarious moments with Dr. Evil are comic classics, and the scene where Heather is in the bikini which is a tribute to Dr. No is a moment not to forget. THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is one of my all-time favorite movies. I think it deserves a score of 10 out of 10",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
399,imdb-9163,"Better than it should be, but not as good as it could have been",7,19 March 2011,"Mike Myers (who is currently going through Eddie Murphy syndrome - massive talent that seems to have vanished somewhere in Hollywood) indulges himself but it just about works. The sheer originality of the first film is lost here because of the recycling - but, ironically, this tends to make many of the sequences much funnier as a result. Indeed it's all too evident in that the weakest parts of the film are the new characters - Mini-Me is just about tolerable, but Fat Bastard simply doesn't work - whereas the best bits - like the Jerry Springer sequences - are magnificent precisely because of the trouble taken to build on the characters we already knew. And some of the ideas are inspired - like casting Rob Lowe as Number 2,, figuring out how to use Liz Hurley, and the Time Machine gags - and that more than makes up for the misfires - most of the rest of the Moonbase stuff for instance. More than a decade later, it's still funny. But I doubt it will bear another viewing for me - at least not for another decade, anyway.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
400,neb-3,Not that good,6,11 June 1999,"I really didn't enjoy this movie. It was funny at parts but its mainly the 1st movie. The most of the jokes were really bad and the plot was so predictable. Did anyone else notice all the advertising in this movie besides me. The VW bug, Virgin Alantic, Starbucks, Heineken, and it goes on. All the jokes were also geared for one certain generation. Not everyone knows ""Just the Two of Us"" by Will Smith, so they miss out on that whole joke. The only thing I enjoyed was the midget, Mini-Me. He was pretty funny. The rest of the movie was pretty lame.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

The experience was full of belly-aching laughter and near suffocation.  Thus it was my fault from the beginning to expect something of the similar relation.  Yet the movie had its moments...quite a few and Mike Myers portrayal of everyone's favourtie spy hit the dot.  I do have one warning though; comedy sequels are never meant to be any good. They live off quirks and little humorous bits from the original; a basic spin-off if you will.  Drama is easier to sequelize, yet AP II had its own magic in its way with its unrestrained attitude.  I suggest all those who haven't seen the first one, to see it before viewing AP II.  But I give it an overall 7 and a very strong ""yeah baby"".",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

This movie was everything I wanted it to be and more.  Rob Lowe does a really good Robert Wagner impression and Mike Myers is, well, Mike Myers.  Nobody can bring that many characters to life, with the possible exception of Eddie Murphy, the way that Myers does.  All three of his characters have a distinct feel to them.On the negative side, I would have to say that this movie is very environmentally friendly - about 90% recycled.  Most of the jokes in Austin II are the same as the ones in Austin I, they are just delivered differently.

Austin Powers has to go back to the 60s to retrieve his mojo (kinda like ""the Force"") from Dr. Evil, who becomes ""weird"" when he drinks it.  Anyway, this movie is wonderful, with funny music (that little pipe tune), characters (Mustafa is back, yay Will Ferrel!), and of course, Dr. Evil.

Well, I am about savage this one: It was awful.Maybe my problem is that I went in with high hopes. I really liked the first movie, ""Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery."" Being a James Bond fan, I fully appreciated all of the references. While by no means a masterpiece of the cinema, the first Austin Powers was witty, clever, and overall very funny.They should have stopped there.I suppose if you have not seen ""International Man of Mystery,"" ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" might not be so bad. After all, most of the jokes are taken straight out of the first movie, and the first movie is pretty good. The second movie would still be funny to people who have never seen the first one. There is some new material, however, and most of that material is wretched. It is not clever or funny. It does not even have the potentially saving grace of being controversial or truly obscene. It is just disgusting. My friends and I literally found a couple sections of this movie unwatchable. (We actually looked away.) When it was over, we left feeling somewhat sick to our stomachs. There are a couple of new things that are funny, but they were so few and far between it does not help.
On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 2. See the first movie, a 7 in my book. Skip the second. If you must see it, wait till you have a lot of people, and split the cost of a rental as many ways as you can.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Austin Powers is again the coolest geezer, mainly because he doesn't care when his wife explodes. The humor is very good but i don't think it is as good as the original. this is probably because it had a lot to live up to and the original was just a low budget film that wasn't expected to do anything. i think that the most funny part was when scott goes onto Jerry Springer at the beginning of the film called ""my dad wants to rule the world"" and Dr. Evil beats everybody up including Jerry Springer himself.

424,jonathansumner,Much better than Goldmember,7,10 September 2009,"I would like to start off by saying I have not seen this movie completely. I have only seen parts of it on You Tube. But I've seen enough of it to be able to form an opinion about it. When I first saw it I thought it was weak and dull although I still thought it had some good stuff in it. I thought that some of the scenes were dull and slow and that there wasn't enough actionBUT!!!! after watching Goldmember I realized how good the Spy Who Shagged Me is. I'm not saying this is a great movie. But I think it is wonderful compared to Goldmember. There are some really exiting scenes in this movie. Examples of that include the part when Austin and Felicity are taken to the volcano lair and then Dr. Evil and Mini Me leave for the moon. that part of the movie is one of the best scenes in the whole Austin Powers series. The other memorable scenes were the scenes in Dr Evil's moon base. Those scenes were so good that it makes Moonraker look like Barney. And that puts Moonraker to shame. I also thought that Felicity was an excellent character in the story. She is way cooler than Vanessa or Foxy. The other character I really like is Mini Me. He is SO CUTE. I like how he fights Austin. There was one scene at the end which I did not like. That was the scene when Fat Bastard comes to kill Austin and Felicity and he ends up crying, whining, and complaining about himself. (""I'm a big fat slob"" and I can't stop eating, I eat because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy because I eat"") That scene was unnecessary, unpleasant, and disgusting,and should have been excluded from the movie. I will now state my final comments which will conclude this review. The spy who shagged me isn't a great movie but it is so much better than Goldmember. It has a fair share of action and excitement and a fair share of bad stuff too. But I think the majority of the film is good, but it is NOT the best movie out there.I think that if you want to own an Austin Powers movie then this is the one to put into your collection. It is the best one of the series. I think that they should have ended the series with this one since Goldmember was so bad by comparison.

Will Ferrell as Mustafa pulls in a ton of laughs, and you can literally HEAR Robert Wagner's voice coming out of Rob Lowe. Dr. Evil is possibly funnier in this sequel than in the original, encouraging the sniping of his mini-me and son, a competition that is film-stealing as well as fun to watch.

429,Keebler,Don't get suckered,3,14 June 1999,"Boy did I get suckered into seeing this one.  The occasional funny moments in Austin Powers 2 are completely over shadowed by tasteless, out of date jokes about obesity, and absolutely inappropriate jokes about blacks. Making matters even worse there were parents who thought this movie would be ok to bring their 8 year old to...no way.  When is Hollywood going to realize that jokes about fat people are no longer funny or in good taste? And if that wasn't enough, Myers thought it would be funny for a movie without one black actor to repeatedly make fun of black musical artists, particularly ""gangsta"" rap artists.  Heather Grahams character was pathetic, Rob Lowe's talent was completely wasted.  There were funny parts in this film, but I left with a lingering bad taste in my mouth thinking about AP drinking feces.  Do yourself and favor and don't waste the money on this one.  I give it a 3.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
430,wickman,As great as Austin Powers was....this is even FUNNIER!!!,10,16 June 1999,"I have rarely laughed so hard at a movie in my life!  The Spy Who Shagged Me is even funnier than the first.  If you can check your brain at the door...you will enjoy this movie big time.  I cannot wait to own this on DVD because there is just so much funny stuff going on it's hard to take it all in with one viewing.  As Dr. Evil would say, ""Try this movie......it's breathtaking!""",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
431,black,Shagadellicly Hysterical,9,12 June 1999,I don't know when I've laughed so hard and so deeply.  This movie was just the sort of therapy I was in need of.

432,gatsby-3,The best comedy since Airplane!,9,9 June 1999,"I could not have laughed any more.  I nearly stopped breathing it was so funny. This movie is packed with sight gags and great jokes, parodies of old movies and sort of a knowing look at movies like this and Airplane!  I was excited about this film and have worried since last fall that this movie would not live up to expectations.  Let me tell you this: this is twice the movie the original is and probably the only movie I have ever seen that I would recommend over Airplane! or Star Wars. I imagine I will be watching this film until my very last breath.There are a number of characters introduced in this film that improve on the series.  The plot devices used are great, taking us through Austin Powers past and many of the jokes from the first movie are back like an old friend.  If you can't stand slightly naughty jokes, you may want to miss this film.  Otherwise, see this as soon as possible.  Or, if you can't make it, cover your ears.  This will be a summer of laughter like none you have ever heard!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Instead I got a completely unoriginal, a little funny trailer. IT'S NOT A MOVIE! It has absolutely no plot whatsoever, NONE! I know people will say these movies aren't supposed to have one. But they need to have something to base the comedy on! Dont get me wrong some of it was funny, this was not! They did the same gags over and over again finally you just said enough! People in the theater laughed at some parts because they really wanterd to and ended up making themselves laugh. This doesn't deserve the name Austin Powers, Mr. Myers I thought you were one of the most talented and funny men in Hollywood, now I see this movie which is just created to steal my 8 bucks, you let me down Mr. Myers!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

But I don't remember ever regretting watching a movie this much!The whole movie is filled with lame jokes and unfunny physical comedy. And after a while, seeing Mike Myers play EVERY character is just unbelievably annoying. Dr. Evil is even more irritating than the first time - if that's even possible.

Mike Meyers is back in a triple role; Dr. Evil, Austin Powers, and the obese Scottish assassin Fat Bastard. Numerous Star Wars jokes make this priceless.  Some of the visual gags surpass the first by far.  Most of the original characters are back.  Rob Lowe as the young #2 is brilliant.  Can't rave enough.

442,Fenric-3,Mike needs to learn to quit when he's ahead...,1,17 June 1999,"I must admit I came to Austin Powers II with a great sense of hope for the film and for Mike Myers.  I argued long and hard that AP was one of the best comedies to come out of the 1990s, and I hoped that AP2 would be superior. The early word on the film was that it was enjoyable and even funnier than the first incarnation.  The early word was wrong.  Instead of a ""real"" caricature of the swinging sixties, we are subjected to a long series of bad jokes that don't know when to quit.  Austin is wholly ridiculous, and any ""conflict"" that might exist between Felicity and Austin, Dr. Evil and Austin, Fat Bastard and Austin, or really any one character and another is ultimately irrelevant.  The knowing look at the audience before Austin goes back in time as Basil and he discuss the confusion of time travel is almost a knowing joke on the audience:  ""Yeah, so what if it's asinine... but we talk about poop!""  Har-har... the genius, the wit, and the humanity in the original are lost.  Myers takes the good sequences from the original and ruins them, blundering blindly as he breaks continuity like it's going out of fashion as quickly as the rocket sight gag.  The Austin in this film is completely unlike the Austin we came to care for in the first film. Austin is callous, uncaring, and unsophisticated.  The cool outside that was used to hide an inner nervous boy in the first film is lost (compare the scene with Alotta versus the scene with Ivana)... Austin has no respect, no concern, and no idea of how uncool he has become in the hands of his deluded creator.  The extended music videos might have been nice cut scenes for the DVD, but they really had no place in the film.  One gets the feeling that one is watching a big budget SNL skit, complete with ""guest appearances"" and funnies that aren't, just like SNL.  The movie ends up being a film that elicits only a few chuckles and an empty feeling at the end...  The whole story was for naught, because Austin really didn't need to do anything... The fact that so many audience members LOVE this film is no proof of its merit... People loved The Waterboy.  Thus, these two films stand as testaments to the dumbing-down of America.  Mike Myers proves again that he can come up with a good idea and still find a way to ruin it with a sequel. To think there's going to be a third... let's hope Mike decides to go back to his roots and re-evaluate his bastardization of one of the more interesting comic characters in memory.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

This is a great movie with a ton of laugh outloud moments.  The theatre was on the floor half of the time while the other half was waiting to see the newest villains, Mini Me and Fat Bastard, both of which are hilarious.

445,Z$,"Cheap gags, juvenile humor, pure fun",10,11 June 1999,"Those who weren't fans of the first Austin Powers need not attend this movie, it's AP: International Man of Mystery squared.  Potty humor runs rampant, but in at least 3 scenes made me short of breath I was laughing so hard.  Like Empire Strikes Back, this film spends more time on the Dark Side and the viewer and is thus more interesting than its predecessor.  Let's face it, Dr. Evil is the real scene stealer in the first movie, and Mike Myers delivered more of him and added some terrific sidekicks.  Mini-Me was the PERFECT addition to Dr. Evil's army, and Fat Bastard had the highest ratio of laughs to minutes on-screen in the movie.On the light side, Austin Powers himself got a little boring at times, but no fear, Felicity Shagwell was there to save the day.  Heather Graham not only looked phenomenal in the part, she was truly hilarious - it's only too bad they'll probably have to get rid of her for the next movie.The only part I found really unnecessary was the scene with Ivana Humpalot. Was it just me, or was that not even funny?All in all, if you're a fan at all of Mike Myers, do yourself a favor and see this movie.  I laughed harder than I did at the first movie, and how often can you say that about a sequel?",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

There is a segment with Scott and Dr. Evil on the Jerry Springer show. This movie re-uses a lot of the styles of jokes from the first Austin Powers movie.  So, if you enjoyed Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, this is a must-see.  Even if you haven't seen Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, you'll enjoy this, because this is one of the funniest films ever.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

452,Darth C,Nothing Original,3,12 June 1999,"Comparing ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" to the first movie is like comparing the two Ace Ventura Movies.  Both the originals and sequels were funny, but the second installments of the two series had something lacking. Don't get me wrong, I laughed out loud several times and it is almost worth the ticket price to see Jerry Springer's Cameo, but most of the humor was either not funny, the same jokes as in the first story, or ripped off from another movie.  While the first 15 minutes were utterly hilarious, it pained me to watch the rest of the movie.  Austin was his same horny self, but Dr. Evil, mini-me, and number 2 were lame.  On the other hand Scott Evil and Felicity Shagwell made the movie somewhat bareable.  Overall, the story sucked and unless you are a die-hard Austin Powers fan or looking for a good make out movie, go rent the original again.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

But me and my friends finally got our chance to see it at midnight, so I guess technically I didn't see it on opening day. Oh well close enough.My rating of the movie. STUPID! So stupid that it's going on my personal top ten list. So stupid that I'm giving Mike Meyers' latest flick a perfect 10. You have to see it. It's just as good as the first, maybe even better.Favorite character besides Austin: Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's clone was hilarious with his silent act and produced some of the movie's funniest parts.

I must say I enjoyed Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard the most, plus the running gags were hilarious.  The only problem I had was the way the wrote off Vanessa (Elizebeth Hurley).  It was the only disappointment I had, but the rest of the movie, more than made up for it.  Hopefully they will bring her back for the third movie, if there is one (Please) :).Overall I give it a 9 out of 10",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

Yawn! Heather Graham looked great! The music was good (Steppenwolf! ... Some of my favorite 60's music!) Dr. Evil is quirkily funny and Mini-Me makes an interesting ""shadow.""

457,Mobius-7,A wonderful but misunderstood movie,10,27 June 1999,"The main thing I have to say is that The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I can't wait to go see it for the third time.  It's more than worth the ticket price.  Many people criticize it for its use of gags from the first movie, but what they don't seem to get is the fact that that is what makes it so funny.  The jokes are reused word for word on purpose.  It's not trying to be inventive, it's just trying to be funny.  The film makes fun of itself.  They could have used new jokes and made the movie funny, but by incorporating the jokes from the original, it ignites that spark of recognition in anyone who has seen the movie and makes it hilarious.  You need to just enjoy this movie and not try to analyze it as some great piece of art.  I think we've lost sight of what movies are supposed to be about.  They are designed to be entertaining. They are supposed to be fun.  Austin Powers more than fulfills this requirement and earns a perfect ten from me.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I'll bet on that.  Once again Mike Myers has succeeded in getting our hopes up for a hilarious sequel (Wayne's World?), only to chop them down in the first fifteen minutes.  I have never been more disappointed sitting in a movie theater.  At first, I thought it was de ja vu - the strategic placement of fruit and other objects in front of various private parts, the over-exaggerated laughter of Dr. Evil and his cronies at the end of a scene, and the constant attempts of Dr. Evil himself to shut Scott up w/ shh, double shh... - whatever, you get my point. I recall two or three original jokes in this movie, and 'fat bastard' doesn't count - he was just disgusting!  After almost two years, I would expect some new jokes and catch phrases from Austin.  I know the English have more slang than just 'shagedelic', Mike.  Lastly, I'm happy that Myers was able to rake in all the advertising dough before the premier, but please, please, please, keep it out of the movie!  Ugh, I feel sick.  The original was perhaps the funniest movie I have ever seen.  And the movie I most definitely have seen the most times.

Everyone rants and raves about how great this movie is, but it's absolutely pathetic. If I'd have paid less than £3 to watch it I would have left. Mike Myers was worse than the last one and even worse than he was in So I married an axe murderer. Heather Graham should stick to films like Boogie Nights and License to Drive, but keep away from the comedies and Sci-Fi's. She was as nearly as bad in this as Lost in Space.

Mike Myers was fantastic as Wayne, so I was expecting something close to (or even better than) Wayne's World. Looking the film up in this database added to my expectations, since I generally trust the ratings, and the film had received an average rating grater than the two Wayne's World films. After watching the film, I have to say this:Are you people out of your minds? HOW can this film be better that Wayne's World? It's been about three years since I saw Wayne's World I and II, and I can remember almost all of it (and still laugh). Only three hours have passed and my mind is trying to erase this painful experience. I haven't seen the first Austin Powers movie, but if it is in any way similar to this one, I honestly doubt I will risk exposing myself to such a torture again.For the record, I gave this film a 4, just because of the `behind the tent' scene (which was indeed hilarious, an oasis in a film where laughs are scarcer than water in the Sahara). Also for the record, I gave Wayne's World I and II a 9 and a 8 respectively.All Wayne's World fans, stay away from this.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

It was funny then, it's not funnny to see the same thing again. Plus, the old jokes, and the few new ones, go on way too long, just to fill the running time with something, I guess. I couldn't tell you what the story is, I don't think anyone involved even cared. The new characters, Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, aren't funny.

Even though I had seen a lot of the funny parts in the millions of commercials that they had (Master card spoof was brilliant by the way) I still loved the movie enough to go back again opening night and then a third time a week later. I will admit that the Austin segments were a little under developed and used quite a few of the old jokes with a twist but no one can convince me that the Dr. Evil segments more than made up for Austin's short comings. The Jerry Springer appearance was amazing, Mimi Me was much more entertaining than I had thought and all of the movie references were hilarious! Felicity never quite found her niche however and that also disappointed me a little. Unfortunately we don't have a Chili's in Canada so I was the only one laughing at Fat Bastard's song.

It looks like it was edited by some film student and the storyline was so full of holes I just thought to myself, ""what the hell were they thinking"".Dr. Evil gets Austin's ""MoJo"", but does nothing with it.  They never even attempt to explain what ""MoJo"" is or what the heck that gizmo that Fat Bastard was.  Dr. Evil goes off on all sorts of tangents, this is never explained.  Vanessa was a fem-bot, Basil knew all along, but this is never explained.I'm just wholly offended that no one involved in this project even made an attempt to explain these things.  It's so in your face, ""we don't care, we don't have to explain anything, just shut up and buy our stuff!"".It would have been so simple to spend a few screen minutes explaining that Dr. Evil was trying to enhance his MoJo by watching MTV, etc, (thus all the stupid little skits), but he decides just to steal Austin's instead.

(Not an original idea, but nicely done in that movie.)  When you transport the same swinger back to his own time, the reason for the movie disappears.  In ""The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" the movie, lacking a coherent center, dissolves into a series of disconnected gags.  Occasionally they hit their mark, but they never come together to form a coherent whole.

491,Binned,"Good Stuff, But Commercialism Evident....",8,22 June 1999,"I read somewhere recently that Mike Myers has signed up to do 5 AP movies. That's good, but by AP5 will audiences be tired of the jokes?. It's hard to say, in AP2 : TSWSM, the theme is similar, some jokes are repeated, but in subtly refreshing way. Mike Myers has to be Woody Allen of toilet humour, yet to pigeon-hole him to something as seemingly narrow as that would be unfair. The guy is a comic genious, full stop (or ""period"" depending where you come from). AP2, I enjoyed a lot, but there was too much of the ""bubble gum"" entertainment element, possibly...There's something about the first film that's rawer - it makes more of an indelible impression on you. Like 'El Mariachi', to a certain extent, the fact that it was made on a shoestring budget made it even more appealing. AP2 is just overloaded with jokes & you're actively encouraged to not  think about the story or the characters really. The jokes are extremely funny & clever & have the effect of making you not think or care about the story, however AP1 has that something...Some might call it MOJO, others in France, for example might call it ""I don't know what"". I just like to call it ""something"".In summary, I have a gut feeling that NewLine (the film company behind this venture) are pushing this AP series too hard into the mainstream. The amount of hype & advertising surrounding AP2 was too much to bare. It spoiled it for me & many others I know. I'd heard of all the characters & script outline well before the film came out. Commercialism within the Hollywood movie industry is parasitic. Philistines rule what goes & what doesn't - it makes me sick & even though they don't have smell accompanying movies yet, I can detect a faint stench of film company commercialism off this flick. It's an excellent sequel, but?.....The title of the next in the series should be ""AP3 - Make or Break Me Baby"".",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

They could have come up with a better/funnier idea > Anyway, the best thing about the movie was Mini-Me. He is an example of movie perfection. He's funny, cute, and incredibly evil. I guarantee, at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards, the award for best on-screen couple will go to: Dr. Evil and Mini-Me. He's just that cool!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

But then a friend insisted that I watch it again and upon the second viewing I found it much funnier.  The 3rd and 4th times I watched it I found it even funnier still.  So I looked foward to the release of this film and it didn't let me down.  While it failed to capture much of the humor of the orignal it still had me laughing out loud at times.  Granted Austin Powers isn't much more than a series of interconnected sketches, but some of the scenes in this film are absolutly classic.  While I don't see any lines becoming part of pop culture like ""shh"", some lines are still extremely funny.  Such as the line Austin delivers when supposedly driving in the English country side, ""Funny how the English Country side looks nothing at all like Southern California."" or their handling of the time travel issues.  The music is the strongest point of the film.  The sight of Dr. Evil singing ""Just the 2 of Us"" is worth the price of admission alone.

497,zepp-3,FAR better than the first one!!!,9,9 April 2000,"It seems like this is a backlash review site---most of the reviewers seem to hate this movie. Well, as popular as it was, there must be some people who loved it, and I'm one of them. I thought the first Austin Powers movie was OK, and there were definitely some very funny bits, but it seemed to be more geared around bathroom humor, and beating the same joke to death. However, it did establish the characters and situation, and these are developed further and very cleverly in The Spy Who Shagged Me. Contrary to some earlier posts, I thought the additions of Mini Me and Fat Bastard were classic for Mike Myers' style of humor, and good slapstick in general. The key to the movie, though, was Dr. Evil. Every single scene he is involved in is hilarious, because he initially appears to be an all-powerful evil leader (like most James Bond villains), but actually turns out to be just as frail, flawed, and human, as anyone else. The humor comes when he acts like a ""regular guy"" (or a troubled father), with dialogue, facial expressions, and body english like you might see in a local bowling league. Unfortunately, the character of Austin Powers seems to have been developed about as far as he can, and he exists now just as a vehicle for Dr. Evil scenes. I thought the movie was funny the first time I saw it, but I have watched it four more times on video since then, and as I continue to notice some of the subtle points, I actually appreciate it more. Oddly enough, the jokes haven't gotten old yet, and I've noticed that there really aren't too many slow points like the first one had (it's hard to keep a movie funny from start to finish). I think the people who dislike the movie either don't like gross/bathroom humor, which is understandable, or they are trying to overanalyze it instead of just sit back and laugh. Myers wasn't trying to make ""The Godfather"", just a good, funny film. I, for one, think he succeeded. By the way, I'm not 13; I'm 36.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
498,quikfuse,amazed at how high the ratings reached,3,7 August 1999,"This film was pretty pathetic.  The jokes were crude and sophomoric, and unfortunately they are all that the movie has going for it.  The humor ranges from disgusting to unfunny to recycled (from the first austin powers movie no less!).  There is little to no coherence between jokes and there is no development in characters or plot at all.  Only Myers gives a worthy acting job, but it is still nothing special.  The new female role is played by a terribly flat and dull acting model who should not have been even considered for the role.

500,swagger,James Bond meets a long and dragged out SNL skit.,4,14 June 1999,"This movie unfortunately depends heavily on the success of its predecessor. It is a hodgepodge of semi-humorous skits with that are stitched together by the Austin Powers gimmick. The repetitive jokes are lifted directly from the first movie and have not been improved upon.

501,Tusca-2,"Boring and dumbed down, with rare cases of true laughter",4,14 June 1999,"""The Spy Who Shagged Me"", was a huge disappointment. Don't get me wrong there were a few scenes that were hilarious, but overall those scenes are few. Most of the movie is spent trying to survive the re-hashed, ripped-off, and gross-out humor to get to the good scenes. It seemed that Mike Myers wasn't really sure of what he wanted to do with this movie, he had a few good ideas that were funny, and then thought well, nobody went and saw ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"", I'll just steal some material from there, and thow in the classic bits from the first movie, OK now we have the new script. I really wanted to like this movie. I love all of Mike's other films. But, when Fat Bastard came out all I could think was he ripped-off his own movie. (He lifted the father from ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" and added 700 pounds to him, A much better movie by the way) This film also tries to get into the gross out comedy category, and cater to this currently popular movie type. Why? WHy? WHY???? This is a 007 spoof... I don't want you to think I hated the whole movie, I did like some scenes. The theme song brilliant parody of the ""Goldfinger"" theme song. The Dr. Evil rocket scenes were very funny. The Jerry Springer scenes also funny. All the Scott Evil scenes were very funny. The Mini-Me scenes had they're moments, but other than that the movie seemed unfocused and catered to try and please everyone. The original Austin Powers was well thought out, Mike knew what he wanted when he made the first movie and put a hilariously funny movie on the screen. However this episode misses the mark. If he would have written the movie to appeal to the audience that embraced the original film , and not have tried to please everyone, this would have been a much better movie.

513,traveler-25,Another dose of Mojo...,8,12 June 1999,"Okay folks.  Here is my right-on-the-money review. A concise breakdown of the main characters follows but may act as a spoiler, so read carefully.'The Spy Who Shagged Me' is fun.  The gags do repeat themselves a bit (from the first film), but still maintain the lunatic charm that made Austin such a hit on video.  You'll find more bowel and sex humor here, than in the first Austin, and an increase in the music-dance sequences.Main Characters (may contain spoilers):Austin is Austin.  If you liked this dentally-challenged spy in the first flick, you'll enjoy the update.Dr. Evil is back, albeit a bit softened in spots, for dramatic (as if) pause.  In this second go-round, you'll learn more of his relationship to his son and the mojo-enhanced circumstances that drove his libido to procreate.Vanessa is not back, but she is back, but she's not back.  It's a shame that she was replaced by a piece of wood (Felicity Shagwell).  An amazingly beautiful, super-shagadelic piece of wood, but wood nonetheless.Mini-Me seems a distraction at first, but works nicely into the plot, as Dr. Evil's diminutive duplicate, as the film progresses.   Mr. Bigilsworth (both of them) should have had more time onscreen.Fat Bastard (yes, that's his name; played by Mike Myers in a fat-suit) is revolting and amusing as the fart-enhanced henchman, but a little long in the tooth (that's an Austin Powers' pun) near the end of the film.Along with the regular players (most of whom, appear in this second installment), there are also a number of cameos by celebs.  Spot 'em all, win a fem-bot.Bottomline:  If you enjoyed the first Austin, go enjoy this latest.

Should I have laughed at the midget thrown into a steel pole,  the unhappy fat man, the predictable sexual jokes, or Austin's stool sample drinking prowess?The kid in front me (the one picking his nose) seemed to think the entire movie was hilarious.

I officially voted on here as a 7- more conventionally, I give the second helping of Austin 3 stars ***By the way, coming out of the theater after seeing the first film, I thought of a pretty good gag if they ever made a sequel. That would be to have a completely different actor playing Austin Powers- a la James Bond movies.  I don't think that would take for a whole movie but getting Dana Carvey or someone of equal or greater value to do a cameo as Austin would be a funny opening sequence.

All the jokes are recycled, and became kind of old (e.g., Austin keeps saying ""Yeah, Baby..."", which after awhile gets kind of annoying)  The new character of ""Fat Bastard"" is just so disgusting and not very funny.  The plot is almost non-existing and doesn't make sense (e.g., How can Vanessa possibly be a fembot?).  At least the original movie's plot is somewhat coherent.  The whole movie is probably made in one month, without any serious effort put into it.  Two thumbs down.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

I mean it was funny and I found myself laughing at quite a few scenes but it was also sort of a let-down. It would've helped if it had a few more scenes of original material. Most of the jokes were just rehashes of what was in the first one, except of course for a few funny bits involving Jerry Springer and Mini-Me. Anyway, I enjoyed it, I just expected a little bit more. Kind of reminds me of another popular series installment. Hmmmmm",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
521,zoran-7,C**p,1,18 June 1999,"The movie has an unbelievable stupid plot. All interesting things you have already seen in enormous number of TV commercials. Austin Powers 2 is probably the most promoted movie ever. Total lack of any intelligent fun, infinitely repeating of same or very similar jokes. The movie is perfect for kids from 1 to 3 years old . A kid will laugh every time you show him/her a toy if you are already laughing. That is not a reaction because the toy is funny but because the kid doesn't have an opinion about the toy and accepts the opinion of the environment. That's exactly how this movie works. Millions of dollars spent in promotion try to build your opinion even before you see the movie.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
522,SleepyBr,the first movie with distasteful fat jokes,1,16 June 1999,"This movie was much like its predecessor.  In fact, most of the good jokes had already been done in the first, or were then taken to lengthy extreme. There was some good stuff in it, but only in a about a third of the movie.In addition, the film was completely ruined for me by one, ongoing, offensive fat joke. Austin Powers II, The Spy That Knows Just How Disgusting And Unhappy All Fat People Really Are.  I take it that Mike Myers never really liked his SNL co-worker, Chris Farley.  Featured is a fake fat Irish man who is portrayed as completely disgusting in every way, and all through the film.  If you are offended by fat jokes, you may wish to avoid this sequel like the plague.  (The dwarf humor was grand in comparison.)",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
523,Dale-50,Silly movie for the indiscriminating viewer,1,29 June 1999,This low budget film seems excessively foolish and apparently geared to the younger or teen generation. Those who enjoy this movie are obviously very easy to entertain.,Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
524,SnoGurl3,A superb summer movie!!!!!,9,24 June 1999,"I saw this movie with three friends of mine, and we laughed just about the whole way through.  The first ""Austin Powers"" and its new sequel are two totally different movies.  The second related to the first with it's catchy phrases and concepts, but took on a whole new level by having Austin travel back in time to locate his ""mojo.""  Different charactors were introduced whom added several twists to the humorous plot.  Mike Myers did a wonderful job of taking on the roles of ""Austin Powers"", ""Dr. Evil"", and the grotesque ""Fat Bastard.""  ""Scott Evil,"" played by Seth Green, was as hot and hilarious as ever. The character's antagonist in this movie was still his father, but mostly the little mini evil himself, ""MiniMe.""  The clone of Dr. Evil was a great addition to this movie.  ""Felicity Shagwell,"" Austin's love interest this time around, was pretty good but I don't think that she was better than ""Vanessa Kensington,"" played by Elizabeth Hurley, of the first movie. I can't give away too much so you'll just have to go and see this movie yourself.  Out of ten, I give this movie a nine!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
525,DrEvil82,Very Positive!,10,2 July 1999,I loved this movie to death.  It's one of the best sequels I have ever seen. This wonderfully continues a great saga between good and evil's battle in a troubled world.  Great work Mike Myers!,Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
526,Tanker99,"The best comedy of the decade, hands down.",10,14 July 1999,"Mike Myers is hilarious in this film.  If you are thinking about seeing it, ask yourself if you like to laugh.  If you said yes, then go see it. You'll thank yourself.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
527,Gym-boy1,A Totally shagadelic sequel baby Yeah!,10,25 July 1999,"The movie of the year.(This may contain spoilers) Austin Powers 2 is the best movie of the year in my opinion.Although it may not be better than the first movie it is still really groovy.The one flaw in the movie was that they used similar gags from the first movie.Like the guard who fell in to the fire in Dr.Evils lair the first movie falls down a cliff in this and both times they were going ""I`m very badly injured""and so on. That was the only thing that made it not as good (or better) as the first one.I advise you to go see it as it is a great movie.10\10",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
528,Bill N,Getting too old for potty humor.,1,13 July 1999,"I have finally reached middle age. I went to Austin Powers 2 with high hopes. (I did not see the first movie, but loved the commercials, etc.).The sex jokes in this flick (OK, I realize now that IS the movie) were in such bad taste I couldn't stand it and walked out 10 minutes before the end. This is the very first time I have ever done this. The potty humor and sexual innuendoes did not strike me as funny.I have enjoyed other ""dumb"" comedies (""Dumb and Dumber"" come to mind) but the endless sexual jokes got old in a hurry. How anyone could get a laugh at someone drinking feces is beyond me. I also could not believe this movie was rated PG-13. There is no way I would let my 12 to 14 year old see this movie. The scene in the tent was the last straw for me.I usually don't take the time to comment, but I had to. I have nothing against Mike Myers. I enjoyed him even before SNL, but I certainly am NOT looking forward to the third installment.I know I should have gone to Star Wars for the second time. Oh well....",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
529,Wafc,Shagadelic,9,30 July 1999,"Yes it was silly, yes it was vulgar and non-PC but who cares this film was highly amusing. In fact, the Powers series are probably the funniest since the Python films. The only negative was Shagwell, Liz Hurley was a far superior Powers girl.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
530,PanamaCi,Disappointing,1,4 August 1999,"As a Mike Myers fan,who loved the first AP movie,I was absolutely disappointed with this montage of potty jokes.They aimed for the bottom and succeeded.The sequence on penis euphemisms was the only comedic bright spot in this effort.But then,what do I know...",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
531,ovi-2,Stay away!,1,19 August 1999,"The sad truth up front: there is more of this crap to be seen on the silver screen in the next couple of years regarding the commercial success and the open ending of the movie! This film is an insult to all intelligent life on earth and even one day later I can hardly remember more than 1 or 2 scenes in the movie that could be called ""funny"". After ""Naked gun 1 - 150"" and ""Something about Mary"", which all saw me laughing even hours after leaving the cinema, I thought I was prepared for ""The Spy who shagged me"". I was terribly wrong. This movie lacks even what I would call a basic story, the actors´ performances are frightening and the gags are older than the movie industry.If you want to see ugly people go and see ""Hair"" or ""Wayne´s world"". If you want to hear funny British accents rent a British movie. For German accents see ""Die hard"" or ""Top Secret"". If you want to see the oldest gags in the world get a Charlie Chaplin or Jerry Lewis video. If you want to see  all that cut down to a minimum in one movie then ""Austin Powers 2"" is a must. If you´re determined to spend $ 10 on 90 minutes of mind-numbness be prepared for the worst. Powers by name - Powerless by reputation!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
532,evelien-3,do not go and see this film!!,1,25 August 1999,"This must be the worst film I've seen in years. A lot of people say they considered walking out - well, I did. I would never have chosen to see this film (I saw it at a sneak preview), and my prejudice against this film turned out to be justified. I kept on waiting for it to become funny, until I could take no more. There are only slightly funny jokes in it, the characters are so stupid that it's bloody annoying and the story is mildly amusing but worked out so badly that it's not interesting at all. Some of the 60s sets look quite good, I'll give 'em that. I saw Notting Hill about a month ago (at the sneak preview as well) and thought that that was a prime example of a bad comedy, but compared to AP2, Notting Hill is brilliant!!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
533,Stuve,Shockingly disappointing re-hash of the brilliant first film,2,29 August 1999,"I can't believe that this film is getting high acclaim.  It's the only film I have got close to walking out of half-way through. After enjoying the first Austin Powers film so much my stomach ached for days after, this pathetic copy was nothing but a stream of badly-timed, misjudged and extremely flat jokes. The only bits that worked were lifted from the first film, the rest was appalling.  A thorough disappointment.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
534,Aten-2,The biggest stinking pile I've seen in some time...,1,6 September 1999,"I'm having trouble remembering the last time I saw a movie this awful. The original Powers had a few good laughs, and a few decent moments of parody. They weren't as funny when they showed up again repeatedly in this film. The ""humor"" was nothing more than scatological references and lame pop culture parodies.   ""Oh look, the disgustingly obese guy thinks he's sexy- irony!  It's funny!!""  What was Mike Myers doing when he was supposed to have been writing this?  Laughing all the way to the bank, I'm sure.  I waited to see this at the dollar house and still felt cheated.  Be sure and stay the hell away from this one if you're older than twelve and have half a brain, ""baby"".",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
535,CaCaN 18,Laugh untill you drop...,10,19 November 2001,"If you don't, the first three times you see this film, when Dr. evil interrupts his son (the ""zip it"" comments) laugh untill you lay on the floor crying your eyes out, there is something seriously wrong with you. I saw this movie before the first, and was rather disappointed with it's predecessor. I doubt that this film would be as hilarious without the undoubtable acting skills of Mike Myers.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
536,DrJohn-3,"Oh, no...",2,23 October 1999,"I really enjoyed Austin Powers I, but this movie is just bad. Although I was in a really good mood when I saw this film, I did not laugh more than 2 or 3 times. Much too few for a comedy, methinks. :( If you want some good jokes or maybe some black humour, try ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", but avoid this film.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
537,ckrupp,WOW!! look at that really long commercial,4,27 October 1999,"I'll start off by saying, Austin Powers II wasn't the worst movie I ever wasted my time on.  I found that there were very few original jokes in this sequel.  With the exception of the introduction of a few new characters it was the just about the same movie.  To top it all off the plugging of numerous different products really bothered me.  I understand that movies are very costly to create and it doesn't bother me that they promote products in movies.  However when it is so grossly apparent that they are filling the movie up with camera shots and dialogue for this, that, or the next thing I am disgusted with what I am watching.  In Austin Powers II there were several instances in which they basically stopped the movie to tell us about beer, waffles, coffee, cars, and pizza wraps.  It is really to bad when a great first film is ruined by a poorly done sequel because todays society always needs to see something more.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
538,Harrigan,Great fun! Gutter humour.,9,26 October 1999,Brilliant farce!Everyone needs a bit of filth now and then.The trick to enjoying this movie is not to expect a serious plot at all. I really enjoyed Myers' quick wit and would not be surprised to hear that some of the dialogue was not rehearsed at all...Heather Graham adds a gorgeous element! You simply don't often find women with this amount of sex appeal who can carry off a comedic part with such aplomb.Myers is brilliant in his three roles.Forget this movie if you only enjoy serious/realistic movies.,Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
539,kingofjacs,One of the Greatest Comedies of All Time!,10,11 November 1999,"All I heard from the time this movie came out was that it couldn't touch the original.  I expected this, because most sequels are nowhere near as good as the original.  I wasn't even going to see it, but a good friend of mine talked me into going.  It was a good thing he did.  This movie almost put the first one to shame.  All the acting was better, the addition of characters added to the film, and it was overall more humorous than the original.  If there was ever a sequel that was better than the original, this is the one that was.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
540,lucyspace,This one was better than the last,9,28 November 1999,"I liked this one somewhat better than the last. Austin Powers himself isn't as developed in this film as much as Dr. Evil and Mini-me are...  Vanessa being a fembot kind of ruined the first one.  I also didn't like Felicity Shagwell as much as I liked Vanessa Kensington. The only thing that made it better was Dr. Evil, Mini-me, and Fat Bastard. (""Get in my belly!"")",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
541,gbremset,Horrible comments... dont read!,2,3 January 2000,"I have never seen a worse movie than this.. Except Starwars EP1.

542,zhijajic,Funny Stuff,7,11 July 2020,So exaggerated that you will laughThen there are the nubile super thin chicks in minis and boots SCHWING!!!!!!! LOVE!!!!!!!,Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
543,skivkung,Elizabeth Hurley not major character?,8,20 November 2006,"Why in the world did Hurley quit doing Kensington? She had an amazing body and is a fantastic actress. I just couldn't understand why they put Heather Graham in. Personally i thought she was a little too up front vs. Hurley, but offing her that early in the film was pointless. The whole movie was still great though with the usual and great jokes by Mike Meyers and backup by Seth Green as Scott. The whole ""machine gun jubblies"" thing was priceless on Hurley and the ""foreplay"" joke, but I still don't see why she wouldn't go all the way. I may be answering my own question, but Austin Powers is a swinging swinger from swing London from the swinging '60s. I recommend anyone to watch this movie if they have any amount of humor. Some may disagree, but it is a hilarious movie start to finish.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
544,PsycadelicFreakAttack,"Comedy, Romance, and Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!",6,6 January 2002,"This sequel to Austin Powers is funny and amusing. There are parts that kind of confuse you as you watch but in the end you'll pick up. I would recommend watching the first movie before you get to the second. With well put together cast, we all wonder the outcome for Goldmember as it hits the big-screen.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
545,iamasbjorn,Completely laughless,2,3 January 2006,"It's easy to see how some jokes might look good on paper but end up completely unfunny. Like ""That looks like a big..."", camera switches to a couple of Australians: ""...Willie, could you pass the ketchup"". This was actually the funniest joke in the whole movie - so it was repeated five times. And later on five more times.I did enjoy the first Austin Powers a little, but this just isn't funny at all. Making a movie with the only premise being an unsexy guy being considered super hot by everyone is not enough to fill a whole movie.I gave it a 2 for Heather Graham and for the colourful sixties. The sixties never looked so good in real life...",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
546,curthar2000,Ruined by poop jokes,6,20 June 2002,"Two things ruined this movie for me the first time I saw it: 1) in the row behind me there was a screechy teenaged girl that would yell ""He's SO CUTE!"" every time Mini Me was on the screen, which I can't help but remember every time I see this movie, and 2) the remarkably unfunny, disgusting character of Fat Bastard. Mike Myers is a funny guy, I would be tempted to use the term ""comic genius"", though it's a term that's used far too often these days. Why he thought he would need to resort to toilet humour(sic, I'm Canadian) of this sort is beyond me.",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
547,coyotewitch,Mike Myers is totally brilliant and a complete genius.,7,13 January 2004,"This is the best Austin powers movie I have seen, I love Dr Evil and Mini me.

It is 1 of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Why? Because of Mini- Me. Mini-Me is the cutest thing I have seen. Especially while humping something. This movie is just great. Besides, with the new characters, Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, the moon, 1969, and Felicity Shagwell. With all this. I made me look forward to it in 1999. I love Austin Powers. It is one of the funniest movies in the world. Like this one. What is scary is that my 5 year old sister says, this is my favorite movie in the whole wide world. So i have to agree with her. That is why I give this movie a 10. Shaggadelic baby!",Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
