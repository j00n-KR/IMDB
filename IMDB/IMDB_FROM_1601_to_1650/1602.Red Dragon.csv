0,TheLittleSongbird,One of those rare instances where the remake is almost on the same level as the original,8,7 June 2015,"Of the Hannibal Lecter films, the best will always be The Silence of the Lambs to me, a masterful film and one of the best of its genre. Red Dragon is a remake of the 1986 Michael Mann-directed adaptation Manhunter and also a much more literal adaptation of the book, and again from personal opinion both are very good films, Red Dragon being one of the rare instances where the remake is almost on the same level as the original(though the two have components that are both better and worse than the other). All three films are vastly superior to Hannibal and Hannibal Rising, both of which were disappointing.Manhunter has some things that are done better than in Red Dragon. It is generally grittier, more menacing and more atmospheric and the performances of Will Graham and Jack Crawford are superior. I personally didn't care for Edward Norton, who had the potential to be every bit as dark and haunted as William Peterson, but this was a rather ordinary and phoned-in performance which unusual for a great actor like Norton. Harvey Keitel is another talented actor but doesn't play Jack with anywhere near the same amount of heart as Dennis Farina did and seemed out of place.Red Dragon on the other hand also does things that are superior to Manhunter. I am actually of the opinion that Manhunter is still a well-made and directed film, but the budget was noticeably bigger in Red Dragon meaning it has a more expansive cinematic feel and a slicker look. It may lack the wonderfully grim look of Silence of the Lambs, but it didn't look that clean to me. Danny Elfman's music score, while not anywhere near among his best, fits very well and is very haunting and energised, much improved over the rather dated and often out of place and intrusive music in Manhunter(my only problem with that film). Dollarhyde's also better developed here(though a little less frightening), giving the character some poignancy while not ever forgetting how much of a monster he is, with the relationship between him and Rena beautifully done and played.Brett Ratner's direction is surprisingly good here, have never thought of it particularly highly as a director before but he brings suspense and palpable tension to the very engrossing and chillingly atmospheric story without letting the visual style get in the way. Performances are fine apart from Norton and Keitel. Anthony Hopkins reprises his most iconic role as Lecter and has the right amount of creepiness, nuance, sophistication and twisted hamminess without falling into cartoonish caricature. Emily Watson's Rena is superb and very touching, far more memorable than Joan Allen for Manhunter, and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann is amusing. Ralph Fiennes, despite reservations initially about him being too handsome and not imposing enough, is every bit as frightening as Tom Noonan, if not as much as a monster, and gives an emotional unstability that comes over in a way that allows one to sort of sympathise with him.Other than Norton and Keitel, my only other complaints are the ending and some of the script. Not all of the script is problematic, most of it is tightly structured, makes sense and very respectful to the style of the book's writing, also managing to be dynamic and thought-provoking, not ceasing to be suspenseful or entertaining. The film definitely could have done more with Graham's character, who lacked the colour and dimension that went visibly into Lecter and Dollarhyde, Graham was too dull, too ordinary and too clinical to me here. More of a problem is that it starts a little too heavy in the exposition, some of it being written in a sloppy and over-explanatory way, as well as going for blunt maximum drama and throwing subtlety out the window. With the ending, the climax is rushed and ridiculously over-the-top and the end twist to me felt very tacked on and reeked of studio executive interference.In summary, Red Dragon is a more than worthy remake to Manhunter and is a very good film in its own right. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Red Dragon
1,Leofwine_draca,Stupidly entertaining,7,1 February 2013,"RED DRAGON is a prequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal 'the Cannibal' in a supporting role. It was made ten years after SILENCE and boy, does Hopkins look a lot older (and bigger) despite the best efforts to disguise it.If you can get over this bizarre turn of events, then you might just find yourself enjoying RED DRAGON, which is a damn sight better than Ridley Scott's over-the-top slice of Grand Guignol sequel, HANNIBAL. I should mention that Thomas Harris' novel was already adapted back in the 1980s as MANHUNTER, a much different adaptation. I'd say that both are equally entertaining with their own merits and detractions.RED DRAGON benefits from a typically intense and dedicated turn from Edward Norton as the criminologist hunting down a serial killer, played with eerie relish by Ralph Fiennes (much more effective than he was as Voldemort). Hopkins is unusually subdued and relegated to the sidelines, except in the outstanding opening sequence which makes little sense but really works as a piece of cinematic spectacle.The format of the movie follows that of a typical police procedural for the most part, with a particular emphasis on the psychology of murder. There are also a handful of stand-out set-pieces, including a ferocious bit involving a wheelchair which has to be seen to be believed. Things build to an appropriately frenetic climax and as a whole RED DRAGON is a success.",Red Dragon
2,SnoopyStyle,well made but a small step down,7,7 September 2015,"FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) is working on a profile of a cannibal serial killer with renown psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). As Will starts to piece the case together, Hannibal attacks him and he barely overpowers. Hannibal is imprisoned while Will retires with wife (Mary-Louise Parker) and his son. His old boss Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) pulls him back in for a killer nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy"". Freddy Lounds (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an annoying tabloid reporter. Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) is trying to transform himself into the Red Dragon and falls in love with blind co-worker Reba McClane (Emily Watson).Director Brett Ratner is workmanlike. Edward Norton is a solid lead. Hopkins returns as Hannibal in this prequel to 'Silence of the Lambs' (1991) but the movie doesn't have quite the same shock value. It's possible that Hopkins could never shock the audience ever in the same way again. All I know is that Ratner is unable to do more with the character. As for a comparison to 'Manhunter', I wouldn't argue which is more faithful to books and it doesn't matter to me. Michael Mann just has more style and he was able to amp up the intensity. This is a perfectly fine crime drama. On a minor point, this movie needs to lay out the fact that this is a prequel to Silence much more forcefully. It would help the audience to place Hannibal more solidly in his timeline.",Red Dragon
3,Prismark10,Red Dragon,5,27 March 2021,"Red Dragon has to be compared to two films.The critically lambasted original version, Manhunter by Michael Mann released in 1986. It flopped at the box officer but was later evaluated in a more positive light by the critics.Then there is The Silence of the Lambs. The film adaptation of Thomas Harris's sequel to the novel Red Dragon. Released in 1991. So far it remains the last film to win the big 5 Oscars.It also catapulted Anthony Hopkins iconic performance as Hannibal Lecter to the stratosphere.Will Graham (Edward Norton) is the burnt out FBI profiler who was severely injured after catching Hannibal the Cannibal.Now he has been coaxed out by his old boss Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) to find The Tooth Fairy. A killer who is slaughtering entire families during the full moon.However Graham finds his family is at risk when he goes to see Hannibal Lecter. The Tooth Fairy gets into contact with Lecter as well.The biggest issue with Red Dragon is director Brett Ratner. He cut his teeth with action comedies and this was a big step up.Jonathan Demme won a best director Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs. He started out making low budget horror for Roger Corman.Michael Mann became a successful auteur who could get Robert de Niro and Al Pacino to team up for the first time which he did in Heat. He turned Daniel Day Lewis into an action hero in The Last of the Mohicans.Then there is Ridley Scott who directed the sequel Hannibal known for his visionary movies such as Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator.Ratner's vision is hemmed in as this is an official prequel to The Silence of the Lambs. So it had to follow the production design of Lecter's prison cell for example.Ratner has made an efficient thriller. That is not good enough. It had to be much better and Ratner has reached his creative ceiling.Not helped that Hopkins is clearly too old and fat to play Lecter for the prequel. I just can't help comparing his performance with fellow Celt, Brian Cox who played him in Manhunter.Cox as Hannibal was lean and mean. He made the most of his brief time.Hopkins being paid very handsomely to reprise Lecter for the third time overbalanced the film. I think he is in it longer that he was in The Silence of the Lambs. Some scenes with him were just unnecessary.To me Ralph Fiennes was miscast as Francis Dolarhyde. Tom Noonan was genuinely scary, that was big boots to fill.Even Norton just seems to be going through the motions. Like he is slumming it for the pay cheque. Just compare his performance in this movie to his more comic roles in Birdland or the movies he makes for Wes Anderson.",Red Dragon
4,claudio_carvalho,Michael Mann's Manhunter was better and better,7,28 July 2003,"Will Graham (Edward Norton) is a retired FBI agent invited to participate in the chase of a serial killer named 'The Tooth Fairy'. He asks Hannibal Lecter to help him to develop the profile of the killer and foreseen the next crime. The original story of ""Red Dragon"" was terrific: Michael Mann's Manhunter is a violent and scary low paced movie, with well-constructed characters. William Petersen is great in this movie. This remake, with a greater participation of the character of Hannibal Lecter, famous actors and actress, and a different beginning and end is not bad. But the original movie is better and better. Therefore, why the remake? My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Dragão Vermelho"" (""Red Dragon"")",Red Dragon
5,classicsoncall,"""Think to yourself that every day is your last.""",9,31 December 2018,"This was a taut, psychological thriller made as a prequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs"", even though it came out a decade later. Reading some of the other reviews here, I'm now aware that the story was filmed before with the title ""Manhunter"", but not having seen it, I can't make a judgment. There are those that think this one was a lot better and others who say it was a lot worse. Without Anthony Hopkins though, who's portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is ingrained in everyone's memory, I don't see how you do a Hannibal inspired story without him. This one is directed by Brett Ratner with no plot holes that I could discern, and the principal players all deliver fine performances. I especially thought Emily Watson was superb as the blind woman who's relationship with Francis Dolarhyde/The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) could have been disastrous for her. It was fitting that she had a hand in finishing off Dolarhyde as the story neared it's conclusion. I also liked the very last scene when the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter was informed of an FBI agent waiting to see him, a reference to the off screen presence of Clarice Starling, who would consult with Lecter the way Will Graham (Edward Norton) did, to catch yet another monstrous serial killer in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".",Red Dragon
6,lee_eisenberg,"Yes, what is her name?",7,31 August 2006,"Obviously, ""Red Dragon"" only got made because of ""Hannibal""'s success, but there seems to be more of an element of fear here than in the latter (which focused more on gut-wrenching violence). Once again, the famous cannibal (Anthony Hopkins) has to help a detective (Edward Norton) find a killer (Ralph Fiennes). As you may imagine, there are some pretty nasty scenes throughout the movie. If the movie has any problem, it's director Brett Ratner. It's just a little hard to take a suspense thriller seriously when it's directed by the man responsible for the ""Rush Hour"" movies.But other than that, there's a really intense surprise in this movie. You're sure to like it. Also starring Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anthony Heald and Ken Leung.Oh, and one more thing: there's something REALLY interesting at the very end.",Red Dragon
7,jboothmillard,Red Dragon,5,4 March 2008,"Apparently this is a remake of the Michael Mann/Hannibal film Manhunter, and it is the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, from director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour). The film obviously opens with Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins, reprising his Oscar winning role a third time) attempting a brutal murder after detective Will Graham (Edward Norton) realises he is behind some cannibalistic murders. Years later he is brought out of early retirement by detective Jack Crawford (Harvey Kietel) to help catch another killer, known to authorities as 'The Tooth Fairy'. Will tries to get clues to finding this killer from the man he put away and made him retire, Lecter. What the cops don't know is that 'The Tooth Fairy', or Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) has been getting inside information about Will and his family secretly from Lecter. When we do eventually see who 'The Tooth Fairy' is, we also see the ""Red Dragon"", a large tattoo on his back, based on a piece of art. Also it appears he might be wanting to let go of his evil personality because of blind love interest Reba McClane (Emily Watson). In the end Dolarhyde is killed by Will, and Lecter has got away with his part, and of course, it ends at the moment he is informed a female investigator wants to see him, he asks ""what's her name?"", and that's when it ends (it's obvious it's Clarice Starling). Also starring Mary-Louise Parker as Molly Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddy Lounds, The Silence of the Lambs' Anthony Heald as Dr. Frederick Chilton, Frankie Faison as Barney Matthews, Tyler Patrick Jones as Josh Graham, Lalo Schifrin as the Conductor, Saw's Ken Leung as Lloyd Bowman and Home Alone 3's Christopher Curry as Mr. Fisk. Not much effort has been made with make up to make Hopkins and Heald look the age they do in 1991, the gore is good, but that's pretty much it, I thought Hannibal was more interesting to watch. Worth watching!",Red Dragon
8,ccthemovieman-1,Good Re-Make Of 'Lecter Film',8,1 August 2006,"This is a very good ""remake"" of Manhunter"" which was the first Hannibal Lecter movie but didn't get the press the others did because it didn't have Anthony Hopkins as the famous criminal. After ""Silence of the Lambs"" became so popular, and the sequel, ""Hannibal,"" it was decided to re-do that first film and this time obtain Hopkins' services.It worked because not only do you have the incomparable Hopkins at Dr. Lecter but you have one this generations best actors, Edward Norton, as the leading character ""Will Graham."" Norton, as always, gives a solid performance. And - look at the backup cast: Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Mary Louise Parker and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Not bad.This is one of those movies that gets better and better with each viewing. On my first look, I was disappointed Hopkins didn't have a bigger role but, after I knew what to expect, subsequent viewings made me appreciate the film's effort as a whole, and it's an underrated flick and a fine addition to the ""Lecter"" series.",Red Dragon

10,dbdumonteil,"I can't understand the high popularity rating for ""Red Dragon""",3,18 July 2004,"The title of my review says it all: I can't understand the high popularity rating for ""Red Dragon"". When the movie was broadcast on French TV, I went on IMDb to check the mark: 7,4 out 10! This made me want to watch this film and the story reminded me of ""the silence of the lambs""'.At first sight, ""Red Dragon"" seems to be a promising movie: 1 mysterious serial killer nicknamed ""the tooth fairy"" (Ralph Fiennes) slaughters families every full moon. As a consequence, a FBI agent (Edward Norton) is required to track him down. Only one man can help him in his investigation: the doctor Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). A difficult task for Norton in the way he arrested this doctor a long time ago because he found out his terrible secret: Lecter is very fond of human flesh... From there, ""Red Dragon"" has all the elements to become a first class thriller in the tradition of ""Silence of the lambs"".But here, nothing arouses the interest. Where does the disappointment comes from? From several embarrassing points that handicap the film. First, Edward Norton who can't make forget Jodie Foster as an ambitious cop and his performance has got nothing stunning. Then, unlike Brett Ratner unlike Jonathan Demme is unable to create a constant climate of tension. As a result, you progressively lose interest in the plot.Given that the shortcomings override the assets, there's nothing left but one hope to save this thriller: Anthony Hopkins. Alas! Dashed hope once again. If his threatening and penetrating countenance contributed to the success of ""Silence Of The Lambs"", here in ""Red Dragon"" his firm and somewhat mocking face doesn't impress the audience. This last handicap finishes tarnishing the movie that you can consider as a pale copy of Demme's movie.A lifeless and tedious thriller. If ""Silence of the Lambs keeps on haunting me a long time after I watched it, I have very little memories from ""Red Dragon"". If you haven't watched it, you don't miss anything, really.",Red Dragon
11,Quinoa1984,The best horror film in recent years...,8,4 October 2002,"...in terms of pure macabre atmosphere.  Director Brett Ratner (known usually for directing comedies) brings a perfect atmosphere to the scenes with Lecter and the scenes with Dolarhyde, and there is always a sense of carefully guided suspense in the works.In this first installment of the Thomas Harris trilogy (which is strange considering this is the third performance of Lecter by Hopkins and much makeup was needed to make him look younger than he did in Lambs), Lecter is captured by Will Graham (Edward Norton, dependable as always) and is soon asked by Graham for help in catching a killer dubbed the tooth fairy, played by Fiennes.  Hopkins, of course, never dissapoints and here he is the usual devlish self of Dr. Lecter, right on target with his suave, diabolical motives.  Fiennes though, could be counted as being as compelling as Hopkins, as we look into his character with even handed sympathy and amazement (amazement that a man can be so mentally disturbed).  This marks for Hopkins and Fiennes two of their best performances, although for Hopkins, his Lecter has been his best character to date.Bottom line to all the people thinking this one will be weak, it's not. >From the first scene, elegant and frightening, to the eye-opening climax, Red Dragon is definitely a must see this film season.  Grade: A (a strong A)",Red Dragon
12,sunwarrior13,A Prequel That Matches The Greatness Of Silence Of The Lambs,10,14 October 2011,"It is a prequel to The Silence of the Lambs.It was the better version of Michael Mann's Manhunter,a movie based on the Thomas Harris' novel featuring psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Finally,the first novel was adapted into the big screen that started it all about Lecter.The Red Dragon,the title of Harris' novel with the same title,stars Edward Norton as FBI agent Will Graham and Anthony Hopkins as Lecter, a role he had, by then, played twice before in The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal; and Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dolarhyde.Also included in the cast are Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Mary-Louise Parker, Emily Watson and Harvey Keitel. The film is directed by Brett Ratner.The story is about FBI Agent Will Graham.He has been called out of early retirement to catch a serial killer Francis Dolarhyde,known by authorities as ""The Tooth Fairy"". He asks for the help of his arch- nemesis, Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter,who is serving a prison term so that he can be able to catch ""The Tooth Fairy"" and bring him to justice. The only problem is that the wanted murderer has contact with Dr. Lecter and he is planning to kill Graham himself.The movie is definitely a lot better than Michael Mann's Manhunter. The performances of the actors were great namely: Norton as Graham,Hopkins as Lecter and Fiennes as the Tooth Fairy.Special mention should also be given to Seymour Hoffman,Watson and Keitel.Their performances were great that they totally captured the characters they played with. The movie was also interesting from start to finish as the suspense and mystery of the plot were always suspenseful and never superficial.

13,hitchcockthelegend,"I am not a man. I began as one, but now I am becoming more than a man, as you will witness.",7,8 August 2010,"Red Dragon is based on the novel of the same name written by Thomas Harris and is directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. It stars Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Mary-Louise Parker & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Dante Spinotti is on cinematography and Danny Elfman scores the music.Red Dragon is a prequel to the hugely successful Silence of the Lambs. The story had already been filmed as Manhunter in 1986 directed by Michael Mann. The signs weren't particularly good for Red Dragon. The previous year had seen Ridley Scott tackle Silence Of The Lambs follow up, Hannibal, with tepid results. While at the helm here was the director of such fodder as Rush Hour 1&2, and of course Mann's take on the story is viewed as a grainy and skin itching cult classic. Nice to report then that even tho it's hardly in the same class as ""Lambs,"" it's a willing entertainer that genuinely manages to unease.Firstly one has to get past the Hannibal Lecter factor to fully enjoy (and dampen expectations) the movie on its own terms. Lecter (Hopkins enjoying himself but going thru the motions) is a secondary character. Important? Yes! But still secondary to Norton's troubled but gifted FBI agent Will Graham and Fiennes bonkers serial killer Francis Dolarhyde (AKA:The Tooth Fairy). Red Dragon is first and foremost a ripping good old detective story, with Ratner and Tally wisely using the bits that made Harris' novel such a page turning success. They have added their own bits of course {the pre-credit sequence involving Lecter & Graham sets things up perfectly}, but ultimately it's a loyal enough telling of a gripping and goose flesh inducing story.The makers have wisely filled the film out with quality performers. Norton underplays Graham nicely, a character unable to stay away from the job that threatens his family, he becomes an easy guy to root for as things start to get troubling. Fiennes too doesn't go over the top, in great physical shape and with piercing blue eyes, he exudes menace without resorting to being a cackling caricature. Hoffman was a shoe in for a weasel reporter since he does it so well, while Keitel, tho not having to stretch himself, offers up a stoic turn as Jack Crawford. But the main performance, and sadly unheralded, comes from Emily Watson as the blind Reba. With Reba acting as both a romantic and redemptive foil to Dolarhyde's split-personality, Watson gets the tough gig, and comes up trumps with an affecting turn featuring the right amounts of spunk, sadness and needy tenderness.It's a bit too polished to be a nerve shredder, with Ratner unable to give the film an atmospheric feel befitting the darkness at its core. But it does deliver on the promise of not only that opening segment, but also on Harris' fine procedural narrative. 7/10",Red Dragon
14,Theo Robertson,A Money Making Excersise,5,26 November 2012,"One of the problems of Hollywood is one of hubris . They make a good film then milk it for everything . SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was a mega hit and made a household name out of Hannibal Lector so Hollyloot filmed Thomas Harris's sequel HANNIBAL . Hollyloot obviously couldn't get enough of Thomas Harris's man eating anti-hero and decided to film the first book in the Hannibal novel series . The fact that it'd already been filmed in the mid 1980s by relatively unknown director Michael Mann didn't stop them . Hey I mean this is Hollyloot where dreams come true and a Hollyloot audience is born every minute . It's not like everyone has seen MANHUNTER but everyone has heard of ... what's his name , the guy who eats people with a nice Chianti and is played by that Welsh guy who was in ... oh what's it called ? That's the problem with RED DRAGON . Everyone who has seen MANHUNTER will be comparing the minimalist 80s style of Michael Mann with the ripped off style of Jonathan Demme by Brett Ratner . Why would anyone want to copy Demme anyway since he effectively disappeared after SILENCE ? One thing that didn't disappear was the effect Lector had on pop culture in the early 1990s , no sketch show , no advert , no B grade thriller was complete without a post modernist reference to Hannibal the cannibal so much so that by the time Ridley Scott made HANNIBAL the joke had worn thin and Hopkins was playing a parody of himself This hurts RED DRAGON as much of the film focuses on Lector rather than Francis Dolarhyde . Compare the differences between MANHUNTER and RED DRAGON where in the former where Brian Cox gives an understated performance in a film where Lector appears in a handful of scenes . In RED DRAGON Hopkins and the rest of the crew know who the star turn is and Hopkins plays it up to all he is worth . He's more camp than a row of pink tents . Not even Ralph Fiennes gets a look in as Hopkins eats up the scenery , regurgitates it then eats it again . The best justice in this film is not Will Graham tracking down Dolarhyde but Sir Anthony Hopkins following Jonathan Demme in to the cinematic wilderness",Red Dragon
15,jotix100,Green Tattoo,6,30 October 2002,"Brett Ratner's interpretation of this story is very bland.
When are the Hollywood wheelers and dealers going to wake up and start making films that are original? This trend to remake things that were better made before has to stop. It's such a waste of energy and money. No wonder, with the inflated prices of stars salaries these days, everyone resorts to the easy thing.I certainly hope that Anthony Hopkins go back to his quality films. If he would take a glance at The Good Father now, he would be horrified to see how low he has fallen in hamming it up on the big screen.Some of the things in this film don't make sense, even though the actors try very hard to do a great job. The story, at times, is very confusing. I wonder if it was done that way intentionally, or was it just a few of us that thought so.The cast is excellent. Anything with Edward Norton in it, can't be that bad. He is an intelligent actor who never gives a bad performance. Ralph Finnes is very effective also. The character he plays is a total enigma. We never really know what made him become the monster. Of course, we have all the impression his own unhappy home life turned him into the man he turned out to be. With that said, one wishes to have seen Phillip Seymour Hoffman more time on screen. He's always interesting to watch, but he has a nothing part here, made even shorter, no doubt, being in the wrong film. Also Harvey Keitel and Emily Watson don't have much to do, which is a shame.Enough of Hannibal already! Please give us another type of creek we could love!",Red Dragon
16,LeonLouisRicci,Equally as Good as Manhunter (1986)Stylish and Scary,8,25 November 2014,"Sure, Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" (1986) is a Fine Film with a Fine Cast and Brett Ratner's Remake is a Fine Film too with a Fine Cast. It is a Bigger Budget Movie with Bigger named Stars and is a Glossy and Gruesome Gala.Comparing the two Movies seems to be all the rage and Manhunter is given a lot of Respect and Deservedly so. But some of the Contempt for this Remake may Reside in the Fact that the Original is a somewhat Unknown beginning to the Hannibal Story that Remains in the Shadows Darkened in Obscurity despite its Craftsmanship by the Overrated and Highly Awarded ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991).This is a Better than Average Remake helped along by the stellar Cast, the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes in an edgy portrayal) and Emily Watson as the Blind Girl are Remarkable.The Movie is Polished and presented in a Palette of Saturated Colors and is Faithful to Manhunter, not trying to be much more than an Update. The Dialog and Story are virtually the Same and the Homage is Recognizable.The Thing that makes this one of the Better Remakes is its Competency and Collective Entourage of well Known Actors (Edward Norton is more than fine) and a Powerful Score (although the original with synthesizer is also creepy) from Danny Elfman who makes it greatly Different than the Usual Stuff in His seemingly Endless Contributions that mostly Sound too Similar. Overall, without demoting the Film because of its Similarity to the Original that seems to be its Curse, this is a Highly Recommended Remake and is a Solid Entry in the Series.",Red Dragon
17,poolandrews,Rather dull serial killer thriller.,5,14 March 2010,"Red Dragon starts in 1980 as FBI serial killer profiler Will Graham (Edward Norton) realises that the killer he is currently after is the same Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) who has been helping him make the profile, Graham manages to capture Lector & he is sentenced to life in an insane asylum. Several years later & Graham has retired to Florida after being traumatised by the Lector incident where he gets a visit from FBI director Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) who wants Graham's help on profiling & catching another serial killer nicknamed The Tooth Fairy who has already brutally murdered two families, at first Graham is reluctant but finally agrees & eventually decides to ask Lector for help in tracking down The Tooth Fairy. Graham works with what Lector tells him & together with the forensic clues tries to uncover the identity of The Tooth Fairy before he kills again...This American German co-production was directed by Brett Ratner & is a prequel to the hugely successful five times Oscar winning thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991), personally I didn't find Red Dragon anything special & is a strong contender for the worst film to feature Hannibal Lector. The script is an adaptation of Thomas Harris' second novel (the first to feature Hannibal Lector) of the same name that had earlier been made into a film called Manhunter (1986) & is fairly faithful to a point as since Hannibal Lector become some sort of cult figure after the success of The Silence of the Lambs the script here increases his presence in the film to virtually the star whereas in the original Red Dragon novel he only appeared in two scenes. If I am being honest I felt Red Dragon was a fairly average serial killer thriller that has little going for it apart from the presence of Hopkins as Lector & even then he doesn't get to do that much. The meetings between Graham & Lector have little spark to them & Lector just talks in annoying riddles anyway. The killer here The Tooth Fairy isn't seen for the first forty minutes but then after that he dominates the film & is given a romantic sub-plot which I didn't like since his girlfriend was blind. Now I have nothing against blind people as I might be one soon (I have recently lost the sight in my right eye through disease & my left eye isn't looking great right now) but I hate when I see a blind person on screen as I hate being reminded, just a personal thing but worth mentioning as if you do end up liking the character's then the chances are you will like Red Dragon more than I did. At nearly two hours Red Dragon feels like it goes on forever, there's not that much actual detective work, not many twists or revelations & it just feels all to straight forward like the makers didn't want to take any risks.There's no real action or suspense & only two people are killed on screen. Although the second to last Hannibal film to be made Red Dragon is chronologically the second in terms of plot time line with the first being Hannibal Rising (2007), then Red Dragon, then The Silence of the Lambs & finally Hannibal (2001) which rounds Lector's story so far off. There's the usual clichéd stuff about The Tooth Fairy killer having been abused as a child & he has this tattoo on his back for some reason but it's all fairly forgettable stuff & doesn't really delve into his psyche that much.With a supposed $90,000,000 budget this looks good as so it should but there's nothing that memorable here in terms of production design that I could see. The acting is OK, Anthony Hopkins is confined to the asylum for the majority of the film while Edward Norton seems a little flat in the lead role. Ralph Fiennes is good as is Emily Watson while Harvey Keitel is always watchable.Red Dragon is an average serial killer thriller as far as I am concerned with nothing more than an extended cameo from Hannibal Lector for interest. Not a terrible film by any means but one that I didn't really enjoy overall.",Red Dragon
18,CinemaSerf,"Gripping, and gory, murder drama.",7,20 July 2020,"Retired FBI man ""Will Graham"" (Ed Norton) finds himself back working with ""Hannibal Lecter"" (Sir Anthony Hopkins) at whose hands, years earlier, he only narrowly escaped death - this time on the hunt for the elusive ""Tooth Fairy"" (Ralph Fiennes) who is running amok in downtown Baltimore using each full moon as an excuse to slaughter two - seemingly unconnected - families. Norton is great in the role; he treads the line between emotionally embattled agent and dedicated, almost obsessed, detective with considerable skill. Hopkins features less frequently, but still exudes menace as only he can and Fiennes, too, has a look of madness and evil about him that, alongside Ted Tally's adept adaptation of Robert Harris' novel, creates a wonderfully tense, suspenseful couple of hours of drama. It hasn't the style, or pace of it's 1991 sequel - but perhaps that's because we have had ten years to absorb just how potent these original characterisations actually were; but this is still is good watch combining horror and wickedness in an, at times, edge of the seat story.",Red Dragon
19,zardoz-13,"Not even Anthony Hopkins can breath enough fire into ""Red Dragon.""",5,11 July 2007,"The best parts of director Brett Ratner's latest movie ""Red Dragon"" show Oscar-winning actor Anthony Hopkins as the diabolical Dr. Lector savoring every syllable of his succulent dialogue. Unfortunately, when the world's most wicked serial killer isn't carving somebody up for supper, this mediocre prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) seems pretty boring. Despite its impressive name-dropping cast featuring Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, and Harvey Keitel, ""Red Dragon"" lacks the artistry, atmosphere, and action of director Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" (1986) of which it qualifies as a second-rate remake. Aside from Hopkins' overindulgent performance, ""Red Dragon"" not only fails to eclipse ""Manhunter,"" but also it never generates the visceral intensity of Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal."" Why producer Dino De Laurentiis remade ""Red Dragon"" instead of starting afresh and going back before author Thomas Harris's first Lector novel is anybody's guess. Indeed, audiences wanted more of Hannibal after ""Hannibal,"" but sadly they wind up with less of the charismatic cannibal in this dreary remake with badly miscast actors and a plot suffering from deja vu. The biggest departure ""Red Dragon"" makes from ""Manhunter"" is how it alters the ending and dramatizes expository dialogue passages about Lector from the Mann movie so we can watch Hopkins emote. The opening scene of ""Red Dragon"" is a more tasteful but less gruesome version of the ""Hannibal"" scene where Dr. Lector lobotomized a bad guy and fed that character his own gray matter. In ""Red Dragon,"" Lector has killed an inferior flautist from a symphony orchestra and fed him to the symphony's board of directors. Afterward, as Hannibal cleans up after his guests, FBI Agent Will Graham (William Norton of ""Fight Club"") drops in unexpectedly to consult with him about a murder case and discovers to his surprise that Hannibal is homicidal. A struggle ensues. Hannibal stabs Graham, but Graham guns down Hannibal. Hannibal winds up behind bars, while Graham quits the Bureau and takes his wife Molly (Mary-Louise Parker of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"") and son Josh (Tyler Patrick Jones of ""Minority Report"") to faraway Florida where he repairs boat engines. Meanwhile, another serial killer nicknamed 'the Tooth Fairy' (Ralph Fiennes of ""Schindler's List"") has massacred two families, each during a full moon, and is searching for his next victims. In desperation, FBI Chief Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel of ""Pulp Fiction"") persuades Graham to help the Bureau track down this deranged maniac.Director Brett Ratner, who helmed both ""Rush Hour"" movies and ""The Family Man,"" has cranked out a straightforward but predictable potboiler. Mind you, if you missed ""Manhunter,"" you will be more amenable to ""Red Dragon."" Nevertheless, entire passages of scenarist Ted Talley's script have been lifted from Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" screenplay. Essentially, as in ""Silence,"" Hannibal plays a supporting character, while the Tooth Fairy is the main villain, as was Buffalo Bill in ""Silence."" ""Red Dragon"" stirs up occasional moments of suspense, but William Norton's FBI agent isn't as convincing as William L. Petersen was in ""Manhunter.""Ultimately, not even Anthony Hopkins can breath enough fire into ""Red Dragon.""",Red Dragon

22,Boba_Fett1138,It comes close at times but nowhere does this movie reach a level of true greatness.,7,12 February 2006,"""Red Dragon"" certainly is no bad movie but it most certainly isn't great either. On every level, the movie is nothing more than an above average one.Main problem with ""Red Dragon"" is that the movie is too formulaic made. It's has all the typical Hollywood aspects in it. Nothing in the movie comes as a real surprise and everything is build up too simple. It's a average thriller that certainly satisfies but never really impresses. It feels as the movie comes one step too short with everything. It comes really close at times to a level of greatness but it never fully reaches it, the movie is too averagely constructed for that. I think man to blame for this is director Brett Ratner. He made the movie casually but without much style or flair.Yes, it's still a worthy addition to the series of Hannibal Lecter movies and like I said before the movie is certainly an above average one. One reason for this is thanks to the good cast of the movie. Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, although his role isn't as big as in the other movies. Ralph Fiennes plays the real 'psycho' in this one and he does this very well. Other fine roles are being played by Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Duke and Frank Whaley. The movie never really becomes truly scary or tense, the style and atmosphere is too lacking for that but still the story fascinates enough. The movie begins well but after that it loses some of it's realism and credibility due to the way of storytelling. Still so, the presence of Hannibal Lecter in this movie certainly is reason enough on its own to make this movie a recommendable one. Yes, I still could recommend this movie to you simply because it's still a better movie than 75% of the thrillers released present day.Fans of the thriller genre will not be disappointed by the movie and its story but it's too formulaic and forced to make this movie a truly memorable one.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Red Dragon
23,ferguson-6,some new ideas for thrillers,8,7 October 2002,"Greetings again from the darkness.  After ""Hannibal"" , I was ready for this franchise to be laid to rest.  ""Red Dragon"" makes me glad they didn't.  Yes the story line is almost identical to Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" from 1986, but Dragon offers up some new touches for thrillers.  The world's greatest character actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman, has a scene in a wheelchair that is worth the admission!  Sparkling cast top to bottom.  Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal with more of an edge, he seems quite angry this time around.  Still the best on screen bad guy in history.  His elegance offset by his violence. Ralph Fiennes plays Dolarhyde, ""The Tooth Fairy"".  He successfully captures the pain and confusion of a mentally unstable type, who at times, seems ready to break free from his past.  Extremely talented Emily Watson delivers again - Wonderful casting!  Harvey Keitel and Mary-Louise Parker are fine, and Anthony Heald (""Boston Public"") recreates his role as the asylum psychiatrist, who dreams of fame as the one who solves a big case.  As with many in his profession, this doctor wants the home run - book and movie, rather than the rut of working with patients.  For Seinfeld affeciandos, be sure to catch Brenda Strong in the dinner party scene.  She was Sue Ellen Mishkie in a few Seinfeld episodes.  Overall this is a fine thriller, and I questioned the selection of Brett Ratner as director.  After all, what did a couple of light-hearted ""Rush Hour"" movies and the equally light fare, ""The Family Man"" do to qualify him for this?  Ratner comes through with some nice work in the intimate scenes.  Still too many close-ups of Hopkins, Fiennes and Norton, but for the most part, it works.  Edward Norton portrays Graham as a slightly reluctant expert crime solver.  Underplayed in some scenes, Norton was a nice pick for the William Peterson role.

It is said to be a prequel to the film and a remake of Manhunter. Edward Norton plays an F.B.I. agent who captures Hannibal Lector at the cost of an injury. He quits police work but is eventually approached regarding the deaths of two families where mirrors are smashed and shards placed in the eyes of the victims. He is sent seeking answers from an imprisoned Lector, and a pursuit of a disturbed individual who calls himself Red Dragon. Graphic and violent with an ending I predicted long before it happened. Interesting directing choice for Brett Ratner after directing Family Man and Rush Hour. Anthony Hopkins is doing nothing different as Lector. He gives the advice and recites the psychotic nature to a lesser effect. Norton is reciting Jodie Foster's role from The Silence of the Lambs. Ralph Fiennes recites the villain played by Ted Levine. Emily Watson as a blind woman is the one interesting performance particularly watching her dealing with her condition. He hoots and howls to the point where I was surprised that large animals didn't arrive to mate. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a sleazy journalist who ends up dying.

However now I feel that I have to take a side once and for all. You hold this against ""Manhunter"" and Brian Cox's brilliant performance wins hands down (Hopkins being a rather close second). With that out of the way, so this Lecter isn't as good. Hopefully the story is enthralling. Well no, not really the story never really gets off the ground. And although the acting is great by all involved, it just felt like the characters were doing what was needed and nothing more to get from point A to B to C.The film IS a big step up from the horrid ""Hannibal"", just not anything I'd watch again soon.

27,The_Void,"Nothing on Silence of the Lambs and the novel it's based on, but a decent thriller in it's own right.",7,20 January 2008,"After the return of the infamous Hannibal Lecter to our screens in 2001 with Ridley Scott's film version of the best novel in Thomas Harris's Lecter trilogy, it's not surprising that a new version of the first novel in the series got an update a year later considering that it's previous screen version, Michael Mann's Manhunter, doesn't fit in with the other two films in the series. I do have to say that this version is both more true to Harris' novel and an overall better film than Manhunter; though it does have numerous shortfalls and has nothing on the masterpiece 'Silence of the Lambs'. The plot is quite similar to the one in Silence of the Lambs, and features a cop on the hunt of a serial killer and receiving help from the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter. FBI Agent Will Graham, the captor of Hannibal Lecter, is called out of retirement to help catch a serial killer dubbed ""The Tooth Fairy"" by the media. The killer has already slaughtered two families and the FBI believes that another one is soon to join them; meaning that Will Graham has no choice but to ask Hannibal Lecter for help with the case.The casting is one of the things that many critics pick up on, and that's not surprising. Anthony Hopkins effortlessly slips back into the role that he will always be associated with; although he's far more comical here than in previous Lecter films. As anyone who has read the book will tell you, Edward Norton is completely wrong for the role of Will Graham as the role needed a grittier actor. Harvey Keitel is a great actor, but Scott Glenn from Silence of the Lambs fit the role of Jack Crawford much better. There's nothing wrong with the rest of the supporting cast, however, with Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman all fit into their respective roles well. There's not a great deal wrong with the plot pacing, although the film is a little slow at times and the book is much more exciting on the whole. Certain parts of the plot could have been cut out to streamline the film for the screen, although Ted Tally's screenplay is good in that it does encompass most of the important parts of the book. Obviously this film is always going to come under criticism for not being as great as Silence of the Lambs and it does have nothing on the book, but overall Red Dragon is a decent enough thriller in it's own right and I cant say I dislike it.",Red Dragon

The ending of Man Hunter is a lot better; Red Dragon show's how Hannibel is captured, and more details of the Tooth Fairy.  If you watch both films, many identical lines, and scenes, while other have slight variations.  I never read the book, but I hear Red Dragon is closer to the book.

Dr. Hannibal Lecter and his list of stories are no less than extra-ordinary in my opinion.

31,JamesHitchcock,Kill Not for Pleasure of Killing,6,5 November 2008,"I think that part of the reason for our fascination with serial killers is that they have violated a taboo even more fundamental than a simple ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"", a taboo so ancient that Kipling included it as one of his Laws of the Jungle: ""Kill not for pleasure of killing!"" We can, at some level, understand murder committed as a means to an end, be that end hatred, anger, fear, lust, greed, revenge, ambition or the pursuit of some criminal scheme or political goal. Murder committed as an end in itself, with no motivation save an irrational urge to kill, is something far more alien and incomprehensible.Hannibal Lecter, brilliant criminal psychiatrist and cannibalistic murderer, is perhaps the most famous fictional serial killer. (His closest rival is probably Hitchcock's Norman Bates). He has become a figure recognisable to those who have neither seen the films nor read the novels on which they are based. He has appeared in five films, of which ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is by far the best-known. Whereas ""Hannibal"", which came out in 2001, is a sequel to ""The Silence.."", ""Red Dragon"" from the following year is a prequel, telling the story of Will Graham, the FBI investigator who originally trapped Lecter. (The same novel was used for the basis of the 1986 film, ""Manhunter"").At the beginning of the film, Lecter (still a free man) and Graham are collaborating on an investigation into a series of killings in the Baltimore area, killings for which Lecter himself was responsible. Realising that his colleague is beginning to suspect him, Lecter stabs Graham in an attempt to kill him, before Graham resists and subdues him. Lecter is sentenced to life imprisonment in an institution for the criminally insane while Graham, traumatised by the experience, retires from the FBI and moves to Florida. Several years later, the FBI ask Graham to assist them with an investigation into another serial killer who has been nicknamed the ""Tooth Fairy"". Graham reluctantly agrees, but realises that he needs Lecter's expert psychiatric knowledge to help him track the killer down.The film stars several very talented actors, notably Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes. This was Hopkins' third outing as Lecter. Most real-life serial killers, although they may have a high IQ, are not well educated and often hold menial jobs. Lecter is very different. He is not only highly intelligent but also seems to be highly cultivated; he is a lover of good food and classical music. Hopkins is not quite as chilling here as he was in his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but he is nevertheless very good, able to suggest both Lecter's intellectual brilliance and his capacity for evil. He can seem most frightening not when he is angry but when he is speaking calmly, with an outward display of good manners.Norton's Graham is, in a sense, Lecter's alter ego, although he is loving family man and a law-abiding citizen with no criminal record. He has been traumatised not only by the physical injuries he suffered at Lecter's hands but also by the realisation that his success in tracking down serial killers is due to an ability to empathise with them, to feel his way (by intuition rather than any rational thought processes) into their twisted minds. He is troubled by this ability and begins to wonder what the difference is between himself and the men he helps to catch.Ralph Fiennes plays Francis Dolarhyde, aka the Tooth Fairy, although he prefers to think of himself as the Great Red Dragon (hence the film's title). This name derives from William Blake's ""The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in the Sun"", a painting with which he has become obsessed and which he has tattooed upon his back. His crimes are explained in terms of his unhappy childhood, when he was harshly brought up by his unloving grandmother. To compensate for his resulting feelings of low self-esteem, he has retreated into a fantasy world in which he is a quasi-supernatural being with immense power over others. Fiennes can make an excellent villain, as in ""Schindler's List"" or more recently in ""The Duchess"", and he is very good as the haunted, demonic Dolarhyde. Nevertheless, I felt that the explanation given of his crimes was a little too pat; many serial killers were not abused as children, and most abused children do not grow up into serial killers.Another thing I did not like was the ending; a final twist where a villain believed to be dead suddenly reappears to threaten the hero, and has to be killed for a second time, has become an overworked cliché in the thriller genre. Another problem with serial killer movies is that they can degenerate into little more than gruesome intellectual puzzles, concocted for our routine entertainment. This was certainly the case with ""The Bone Collector"" and, to some extent, with ""Se7en"". ""Red Dragon"" does not escape this trap entirely, and it is never as gripping as ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but it is always watchable, largely because of the high standard of acting. 6/10",Red Dragon

34,MovieAddict2016,"Returns to the Roots of the ""Lambs""...",10,7 May 2003,"Prequels are messy things. Sequels can be, too, but with a sequel, the filmmakers are creating new ground. In a prequel, the filmmakers are treading into pre-recorded territory, and if they're not careful, they can make the audience feel cheated. But with ""Red Dragon,"" prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal,"" the audience doesn't feel cheated at all. In fact, it is handled extremely well, and is not only a gripping thriller, but a superbly-performed one, also.It stars Edward Norton as forensic specialist Will Graham, the man responsible for putting Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter, as seen in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" behind bars in the 1980s. The film fades in somewhere in the mid-1980s, where Graham starts to suspect that Hannibal may have something to do with the disappearance of a musician. Will confronts Hannibal, who stabs him in the gut and slowly rips open his stomach. Graham fights back, pushing an arrow from Hannibal's study/den through Hannibal's chest and shooting him some two or three times with a handgun. Hannibal is arrested and thrown in jail. Graham is left in critical condition.Flash-forward ""a few years later"" to Graham living somewhere in Florida with his wife (Mary-Louise Parker) and son. Graham still carries the scar from his last meeting with Hannibal, and it has forever reminded him of his job and just how careful he must be. But then comes along Jack (Harvey Keitel), who asks Graham to take on a new case...There is a serial killer on the loose who attacks every full moon. He cuts his victims with shards of glass, then takes the glass and puts the pieces in their eye sockets. He also does some other things too grisly to mention in a family review. Graham, the best-of-the-best forensic specialist, agrees to take on the case, and becomes more intrigued by it and makes it his personal agenda to bring down the killer, known as ""The Tooth Fairy,"" or the ""Red Dragon"" (hence the title), who is played by Ralph Fiennes. But as the case becomes more misleading and confusing, Will finds himself seeking the advice of Hannibal the Cannibal on his particular case. And as Will faces his greatest fear, the clock ticks until the next strike by the Red Dragon.Fans will be pleased to know that Hannibal has lost none of his creepiness since ""Silence of the Lambs."" Fans will also be pleased to know that after the ""Hannibal"" flop, ""Red Dragon"" returns to the roots of the original. I thought that ""Hannibal"" was proof the series' creepiness had outstayed its welcome. Hannibal's persona only works once, apparently...well, if you think that, you're wrong. Because ""Red Dragon"" is equally as frightening as ""Silence of the Lambs,"" if a bit more unrealistic at times. And it's also a bit more typical for its genre in some respects than ""Silence..."", but it's still very thrilling. In fact, the ending could be considered predictable, but it's not for two reasons. 1. Unlike other horror films where you just KNOW the killer's still alive, ""Red Dragon"" really makes you think the killer is dead, but the surprise is...can you guess?2. In most of the horror films out there, when the killer is supposedly dead, there is a moment of happiness and the film seems as though it is over, but you know there's just something wrong with the abrupt end to the thrills. It shows the family at home, extremely happy, until...the kid who went inside to get food hasn't returned. The parent goes in to look for him, and the answering machine clicks on. A cop at the station says, ""He's not dead! Get outta the house!"" Big surprise: The killer's upstairs with the kid, holding a knife to his throat.All this happens in ""Red Dragon"" one way or another, but you don't feel as cheated as you do watching other thrillers of the same kind. If anything, ""Red Dragon"" follows a lot of the typical horror/psychological thriller routines, but it's hard to notice. ""Red Dragon"" does jump through all the hoops of its kind, but if anything, it comes across fresh and thrilling, and this is all I ask for in a thriller.",Red Dragon
35,lasttimeisaw,Red Dragon - 6/10,6,15 July 2007,"When Hannibal loses all his charisma, a Dr. Hannibal Lector movie will inevitably end miserable. But thanks to Ralph Fiennes & Emily Watson, still some interesting chemical reaction we can taste.The first time I saw this movie is almost 5 years ago, and I can't nearly recall anything so I decide to watch it again. The cast is so appealing which is irresistible for me. But I also know it's a Hollywood blockbuster, so I didn't expect too much of the acting. Fortunately, it's quite enjoyable to watch although I hate the typical ""twisted ending"".Anthony Hopkins made a wise decision to do not perform Dr. Hannibal Lector anymore after this film. ""The Silence of The Lambs"" is a classic, no one can surpass the charming but grim role of Hannibal even Anthony Hopkins himself. So in this movie Hannibal's role occupied only a quite small on screen time (compared to ""Hannibal"" of course). The sparkle between Edward Norton and Anthony Hopkins is also dim which is a major defect for me.However, Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson someway saved this movie by their role as the demon ""Red Dragon"" and the blind girl who loved the demon respectively. Their performances are powerful and intense, makes the movie more watchable. Edward Norton did a decent job as the righteous detective, nothing special, for him it's a waste of talent. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a small role in this film and leaves a deep impression as usual.No one is born to be a demon, don't let the beast come out of your deep inside in any case.",Red Dragon

37,OllieSuave-007,Better than Hannibal.,7,2 April 2014,"The third film in the Hannibal Lector series but a prequel to Silence of the Lambs, FBI Agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) comes out of early retirement to catch the mysterious serial killer ""The Tooth Fairy."" Graham seeks the assistance of arch-nemesis Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is also providing inside information on Graham to ""The Tooth Fairy."" This movie is a notch up from the previous film (Hannibal) in suspense and mystery; it is somewhat of an exciting feature that kept me glued to the TV. The beginning starts with some intense drama and scuffles between Graham and Lecter, then delving into the mysterious background of the melancholy Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes). This movie also cleverly makes some references to Silence of the Lambs, as you will see if you watch it in its entirety. Fiennes and Hopkins in their mysteriousness make up for some boring filler scenes, and just above-average Norton added to the story, but this is overall an intriguing movie that is much better than its predecessor.Grade B-",Red Dragon
38,sddavis63,"A Worthy ""Prequel""",7,11 August 2003,"This ""prequel"" to ""Silence of the Lambs"" is far superior to what I thought was the weak sequel to ""Silence ..."" - ""Hannibal."" This movie avoids for the most part the gratuitous violence and semi-cartoonish quality (i.e. Mason Verger) that characterized ""Hannibal"" and which made that movie quite unpleasant to me and seeks to recapture the psychological tautness that had characterized the earlier film, and which had made it so successful. In fact, had this been released before ""Silence ..."" I would at least consider ranking this ahead of ""Silence ..."" As it is, coming after (although set before) it seems to lack something in originality (and, yes, I know that there was an earlier version made long before ""Silence ..."", but I'm thinking here of the movies starring Anthony Hopkins.) Hopkins does a masterful job of recreating Hannibal Lecter, giving him back that eerie and frightening presence that made him such a wonderful character. And, this being a prequel, the absence of Jodie Foster doesn't grate, as it did in ""Hannibal.""Beginning with a scene that will capture your interest right away, the basic story is almost identical to ""Silence ..."" Locked in a prison cell, Lecter is enlisted by an FBI agent - Will Graham (Edward Norton) - to help catch a serial killer, known as ""The Tooth Fairy."" Lecter plays many of the same mind games that we became familiar with in the course of the earlier ""Silence ..."" The relationship between Lecter and Graham never intrigued me as much as the one between Lecter and Starling, though, and I'm not convinced that Norton was the best choice for the part of Graham. Somehow, Norton came across to me as too innocent and youthful for the kind of role he was playing. I also could have personally done without the tabloid journalism subtext that played throughout the movie. I didn't think it added much (although the burning wheelchair scene was great!) Weaknesses, though, were compensated for by a marvelous performance from Ralph Fiennes as the killer. Fiennes captured Dolarhyde's mindset perfectly. In a more limited role, Emily Watson did a good job as Reba, the blind love interest of Dolarhyde.This is almost the equal of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and definitely a major improvement on ""Hannibal."" 7/10",Red Dragon
39,thesar-2,Watch TV Instead,4,19 May 2013,"With all this viewing of the Hannibal TV series I've been doing since it premiered this year (2013,) I've been tempted, and finally gave in, to revisit the horribly miscast Red Dragon remake from 2002. I'm sorry I did.Aside from how fantastic the updated TV series is and how closely the perfectly cast show is to the original publication, this remake of Manhunter is anything but spot on. As mentioned, every single character is incredibly wrong from what Thomas Harris envisioned from his original Hannibal Lecter novel, Red Dragon. I used to be an Edward Norton fan until I saw this and then later, his Bruce Banner take in The Incredible Hulk sealed his fate for me. He was ABSOLUTELY nothing like the fantastic character Will Graham is.Also, ""The Tooth Fairy"" played by Ralph Fiennes could not have been further off the mark. Even in this movie alone, they mention how ""disfigured"" he considers himself when he's anything but.I haven't even gotten to how they overplayed Hannibal's presence in this movie vs. the original story. Of about 400 pages, Hannibal appears in roughly 4-5 pages. Yes, I understand their only concern was to milk Anthony Hopkins' iconic role, but to physically alter the original source just to make a few bucks is disgraceful. Hell, he got top billing and takes about half the poster. Shame.Now, the movie's not a complete waste. Perhaps one should NOT read the book to appreciate this film. For, it does have one of the best scores I've heard from a movie. It does have genuinely suspenseful scenes. And despite Hannibal's over presence, he was interesting when he was on screen.FBI Special Agent Graham is called back into duty after two families are butchered and he's needed to put the pieces together and catch the ""tooth fairy/red dragon.""Really, that's the basic plot, but it is interesting to watch Will's journey and who he calls on to get help. ButIt's not as interesting as the TV show. Or the original Manhunter movie. Or the actual sequel, The Silence of the Lambs. In fact, it's a throwaway movie that you should actually do just that. Stick with Silence, barely watch the sequel, Hannibal, and pay attention to the TV series. That's all you need to see.",Red Dragon
40,FeastMode,my notes,8,1 July 2019,Great movie with an awesome story and numerous memorable scenes. great acting and an awesome villain. intriguing throughout. loved the directing. this movie is pretty much perfect (2 viewings),Red Dragon
41,lesleyharris30,"Terrific Performances, but Tight on Thrills,",6,24 January 2016,"Red Dragon is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a very talented cast. It has some enjoyable moments, the few scenes that Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton share were terrific, and Ralph Fiennes certainly delights in his performance of a complete psychopath, his characterisation was perfect, every cast member was very dedicated to their roles. It's underwhelming, the film is short on real thrills, it never took me away the same way Silence of the Lambs did in practically every scene, it felt like the story was just going through the motions and wasn't genuinely trying to make its audience feel the suspense. The plot is also very messy, it jumps around from different characters far too often, I felt like it should have just focused on Norton the same way they did with Jodie Foster in Lambs, giving the villains solo scenes is obviously necessary, but not when you're following them for so long they become the lead role. It does improve in certain aspects from Hannibal and the performances are top notch, but Red Dragon is another Hannibal Lecter film that will forever live in Silence of the Lambs shadow, certainly do not go out of your way to watch this. An FBI profiler has to capture a serial killer with the help of the monstrous Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Best Performance: Edward Norton",Red Dragon
42,secondtake,Solid but unexceptional--too indebted to Silence of the Lambs to work on its own,6,29 April 2011,"Red Dragon (2002)Well, if you liked ""Silence of the Lambs"" for its inventiveness, for the large and changing role of Anthony Hopkins, for the individual presence of Jodie Foster, for the terrific filming, and for the really insidiously evil main villain--all good things to like--you won't find any of that here. None. What the prequel ""Red Dragon"" has is mostly a continuation, and repetition, of some of the best elements of that more famous film. The star is still Anthony Hopkins, in his familiar cell with the heavy plexi wall instead of bars. And the cast, without Jodie Foster, is pumped up with celebrities--Edward Norton in a kind of restrained role that doesn't suit him, Harvey Keitel as himself (very much what he needs to be), Emily Watson playing a blind woman working in a photographic lab (in the dark, with huge blue eyes), and the evil man in this turn of the screw, Ralph Fiennes (who isn't even slightly evil enough). The dragon tattoo makes its appearance (and calls to mind the more recent tattoo and movie, which is better for different reasons), and the familiar role of Hannibal as adviser to the FBI occurs with some tepid success.I'm surprised at the high rating of the film, and I'm guessing it has to do with the general appeal of the famous characters and plot. This isn't a bad movie at all, and after the first twenty minutes of set-up it starts to take on a life of its own. The process of figuring out who might be the bad guy is a little unsuspenseful, but there are a couple of twists that give you a good scare, especially the one near the end, which some of you will see coming.Taken for what it is, on its own, this doesn't go very far. Director Brett Ratner has never quite taken hold as a serious director (he did a bunch of Mariah Carey videos), and he's certainly no match for Jonathan Demme, who directed the famous one eleven years earlier. For completists, there is a second film, a proper sequel, starring Anthony Hopkins, made just the year before (and it has the uneven Ridley Scott directing). The first Hannibal Lecter film is actually before any of these, and doesn't star Hopkins, is the 1986 ""Manhunter,"" which gets good reviews even if it has been lost in the shuffle since Demme's version.",Red Dragon

44,Bored_Dragon,Manhunter renewed,7,18 November 2016,"After ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"", it was logical to do a remake of ""Manhunter"" to complete the trilogy with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal in all parts. Too much time has passed since I watched the original movie for me to be able to remember all the details, but it seems to me that ""Red Dragon"" is an almost exact copy of ""Manhunter"". Production is better and no one is better Hannibal than Hopkins, but the rest is pretty much the same. Cast in ""Manhunter"" may be better though. For real fans of this trilogy and/or Hopkins this is mandatory, but for all the rest who already saw ""Manhunter"", this movie is unnecessary. During the whole first watching, I had a feeling like I'm watching it again, and as it is a thriller and I knew what's next all of the time it was pretty much boring to watch. Don't get me wrong, the movie is good, and those who did not see ""Manhunter"" will surely enjoy it, but it is pretty much pointless to watch them both.7/10",Red Dragon
45,jacobjohntaylor1,one of the scariest movies you will ever see,10,4 June 2015,This is very movie. This is best on the first novel Thomas Harris wrote about the character Hannibal L.e.c.t.e.r. It take please in the 80's which is when the book is written. People think it is a prequel to Silence of the lambs. Really in is a remake. There was an 80's version of Red dragon titled Man hunter. Silence of the lambs based on the second Hannibal book is a sequel. And not a very good sequel. The best thing about Silence of the lambs and Hannibal is that they are precursors to this film. Silence of the lambs is just overrated crap. Hannibal is just overrated crap. Now this movie is one of the scariest movies you will ever see. This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has get acting. It has a lot of suspense. It also has great special effects. It is one of the best horror movies ever. It is a must see.,Red Dragon
46,zkonedog,What If This Would Have Been The Original?,7,8 March 2017,"After following up the incredible ""Silence of the Lambs"" with a very-lacking ""Hannibal"", the Hannibal Lecter series of films goes back to its origins with ""Red Dragon"". The results are much more enjoyable (if a bit repetitive), making one wonder what might have happened had THIS been the original?For a basic plot summary, ""Red Dragon"" takes place before the events of ""Lambs"". Brilliant young FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) finally captures the mysterious Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins), but sustains wounds both psychological and physical in the process. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and Graham must revisit Lecter in order to solve the gruesome ""Tooth Fairy"" (Ralph Fiennes) murders.Clearly, director Brett Ratner studied the faults of ""Hannibal"" and made sure not to include them in this third installment. This time, the plot takes the same basic form as the original, only with a new killer and agent. This results in a much better overall narrative and interesting movie. Basically, if you enjoyed ""Lambs"" then this one will give you a similar experience.Why isn't this film regarded as more of a classic, then? Well, frankly it is because it already WAS done before in ""Lambs""! In effect, its greatest strength is also what prevents it from being a true classic. It is (almost quite literally) a ""Cut, Copy, Paste"" of the original format. This is good in comparison to ""Hannibal"", but by definition it just can't quite attain the success of ""Lambs"", since the original is always the original.Overall, then, ""Red Dragon"" is a solid movie that, truth be told, probably resurrected the Hannibal series of movies and gave it some hope for a future. It completely goes back to its roots to tell an interesting story, and it succeeds in utilizing Hopkins to his fullest. It just won't go on your ""best of"" list because ""Lambs"" is already there. One has to wonder, though, what could have happened if this plot would have been the original...?",Red Dragon
47,johnnyboyz,Effective and wonderfully unravelled thriller that sees the Lecter cannon gem we all know of accompanied by another supremely competent effort.,8,24 June 2010,"Brett Ratner's wonderful 2002 Lecter-canon thriller Red Dragon begins in the early 1980s with Lecter on the loose, in the years before any kind of incarceration, and at large still continuing his lifestyle driven by a triple threat combined of murders, mayhem and meals wrapped up into one. The series' previous film, Ridley Scott's 2001 film Hannibal, did not have a particularly positive critical consensus; a film that rather jumped ship in having Lecter out and about around Italy and America doing what he did and evading capture, rather than indoors and creating a film revolving around a particular case that just happened to have a devilishly intriguing supporting character tossed in for measure. In beginning Red Dragon with Lecter at large, before having the film's lead figure him out in a moment of near-fatal ingenuity, Ratner addresses what perhaps he and most certainly the critical contingent saw wrong with said 2001 piece and includes an epilogue in which Lecter is at large; caught and then placed (back) in his cell. It's an event that sees both us and him have respective senses wash over us of odd nostalgia and sheer frustration at being caught.Red Dragon certainly leans more towards Demme's awesome 1991 thriller The Silence of the Lambs than Hannibal did, but rather than use said example to feed off of and create nothing more than a by-the-numbers templatelike thriller, Red Dragon feels original enough and ends up weaving a tale that's close to all but just as fascinating and just as gripping. The film's lead is indeed a certain Will Graham (Norton), an experienced and well endowed professional FBI agent with an unnatural gift for tracking serial killers and solving homicide cases. At one point in Red Dragon, Graham states something along the lines of deducing the killer kills because of a God-like feeling it gives him. When asking a female colleague if she'd give up ""feeling like God"", she lets off a disgusted look at the thought of being invited to think like the killer or share his viewpoint; thus further emphasising Graham's ability to shut everything off and get inside the minds of these people whilst highlighting a degree of superiority he has over his coworkers.In rendering Graham of this ilk, the necessity for the sorts of development on show in The Silence of the Lambs regarding Jodie Foster's character is unnecessary. Rather, and quite possibly again in response of prior criticisms from the 1990s aimed at the character of Buffalo Bill from groups of a specific sexual orientation, this spare time and these items are replaced with a burrowing into the life and mentality of the film's antagonist; a fleshing out, if you will, of a man you'd be quick to label a freak. The character in question is a part-time film stock lab worker and additional family-targeting serial killer known as Francis Dolarhyde (Fiennes), and just as The Silence of the Lambs was a title that linked itself to the lead and her plight with Hannibal gearing more towards Lecter, Red Dragon is a title more orientated towards the enemy of this particular piece.Dolarhyde inhabits a house and has rather a few characteristics that are quite clearly indebted to 1960's Psycho; in that his tall, old, decrepit and isolated multiple storey house is reminiscent of Norman Bates' house-on-the-hill; the one which neighboured his motel. His childhood relationship with his grandmother is akin to Norman's with his own mother and the split personality item is additionally most certainly prominent in the pair of them. Dolarhyde will additionally go on to strike up a friendship with blind girl Reba (Watson); her total inability to see anything at all enabling Francis to succeed in doing the opposite and see exactly what he is as feelings resonate and attitudes threaten to change. In his ongoing battle with Graham and the F.B.I, something born out of the fact he has killed two families, he shares a characteristic with Graham in that his unnatural attraction to specific texts is what keeps him going in this relatively sordid existence. For Graham, the ability to be talked out of retirement despite a grotesque tragic past-happening and then allow the case of Dollarhyde to seduce him into getting heavily involved. This, as Dollarhyde's own obsession with a William Blake painting known as 'The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun' consumes him before, to some extent and somewhat unfortunately, he returns the favour to said piece.Suspense and tension are kept at a reasonably high level throughout, in that Dollarhyde's targets are families of which are grossly similar to the sort Graham himself has, something that combines with the fact they're so far away from one another and are vulnerable, which acts as a persistent and uncomfortable back-burning item. Later on, when the discovery that lunar eclipses are linked to the killings, a certain installation of suspense is captured and a race against time scenario until the next one becomes additional to proceedings. The film knows Lecter is the would-be star of the series, and despite Graham's expertise; the film shoots his slow trudging up the corridor towards Lecter's cell with the same nervous energy given to most whom we have witnessed venture up there. Lecter is rendered a threat, but he is at what most perceive to be his most effective whilst behind bars and bantering with an agent on a job; in the case of his relationship with Graham, a vastly shifted dynamic is in place in that he is a male and responsible for Lecter's incarceration rather than of Clarice Starling's younger; female and less experienced ilk. Red Dragon hits the mark for neat, taut and exhilarating investigative-infused thrills, running on excellent attention to character and premise. Ratner is by no means one of my favourite directors, but in being given the right amount of weighty and substantial initial material, he has certainly created one fine thriller.",Red Dragon
48,filipemanuelneto,A more discreet and positive sequel,6,1 August 2016,"This film is a sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and has a very similar story: with a new serial killer around, the FBI will again request the help of the dangerous and manipulative Hannibal Lecter, the most famous cannibal ever. Directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally, this film has a cast headed by Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes.It's a good movie, but there is no comparison with the film that gave rise to it. The script is good, but it misses on two fundamental points: the first is to immediately tell the killer's identity, albeit discretely, removing some interest to the narrative; the other is to tell a story that is almost identical to ""Silence of the Lambs."" Both films have very similar plots, which gives the audience a sense that this film is more of the same. One difference, however, is the level of violence: this movie, even though it contains scenes of great action, has so many shocking scenes as their predecessors. Nevertheless, it is a movie with quality and entertains. The actors were up to expectations, particularly Ralph Fiennes, who plays the killer and managed to give the character a real aura of madness. Anthony Hopkins, again in cannibal paper was able to be perfectly equal to the expected. The special visual and sound effects, although discrete, are competent.

49,digitalbeachbum,Forgettable,1,9 June 2020,"I've watched this twice and only two scenes I remember, the beginning and the end.Anthony Hopkins isn't scary. He isn't a serial killer. Why people keep thinking that his performances are Oscar worthy is ridiculous. I like him other roles but not this one. Ed Norton is good, but this isn't his best performance. Harvey Keitel is miscast, Ralph Fiennes is actually a better serial killer than Hopkins.The script sucks, the direction sucks. There are some individual scenes which are acceptable. Hollowood fails again. Manhunter was better.I'll point out that the technique used by Hannibal would not have worked during this period and I believe with the security precautions given to Hannibal would have been more controlled. The phone he used even to call his lawyer would not have been handled this way and the line would never be given access to the outside world. It would have been a direct line to his lawyers office, and I'm betting they would have been listening in on his conversation.The other problem I had was the toilet paper message they would have given him, and the bribery to the janitor. The effort to do such a task would be not plausible. The toilet paper would have been checked before they gave it to him rather than let the janitor handle it in such a way. Did you notice the janitor left the bucket of water close to the cell of the other sick inmates/ Did you notice how close he was to the bars when he was moping?

51,jzappa,"What Is Brett Ratner Doing With Such Sensitive, Complex and Strong Material As a Hannibal Lecter Prequel?!",7,28 October 2008,"Red Dragon opens with the enjoyment of seeing Hannibal Lecter, again the skilled Anthony Hopkins, as he was before being first captured. The camera swoops above a symphony orchestra and down into its audience, and we catch sight of Lecter almost before the camera closes in on him tightly enough, observing a mediocre flautist with discontent.The opening, with Hannibal still in civilian life, sets aside a taut prologue in which Hannibal greets a late-night visitor, a zealous FBI golden boy played by Edward Norton, after a sophisticated dinner party. Norton has been aided by Lecter in probing a string of murders which, he has just realized, relate to cannibalism. I won't reveal the rest of the scene, because really, it's the most entertaining part of the film. It is down hill from here.The premise is that another serial killer appears. Called the Tooth Fairy, he follows and murders apparently indiscriminate families. Unsatisfied with his present team of new agents, Harvey Keitel's special agent finds Ed Norton and begs for his help. Norton's character, oh goodness, feeling the death of another family to be an insufferable burden on his conscience, is portrayed as selflessly and reluctantly agreeing. Phfft.The director is Brett Ratner, having previously brought us such milestone achievements as Money Talks, the Rush Hour films and The Family Man. Um, I'm sorry, what is he doing here? How does he obtain the respect and privilege that he's gotten? Perhaps I shouldn't ask, because The Silence of the Lambs was directed by Jonathan Demme in 1991, when Demme basically had Something Wild, Married to the Mob and a handful of rockumentaries to his credit. But there was feeling and nuance to Demme's work despite whatever it was. I still look back fondly at Wild and Mob, both 1980s romantic comedies with an odd twist of violence. He makes a movie look good and feel as tight as it can be, even in his lesser post-Lambs work. Ratner seems like the kind of guy who is reminded after a film is completed, ""Oh! Dammit, nuance! I'm always forgetting that! OK, next time, I swear I'll remember it.""And that is just how this movie feels. I suppose one could say he hit the right notes with the said first scene, but has no idea how to draw out an actor's full potential, or that of a shot, or a cut. This is quite a long fall from Demme's work, which was a masterpiece of all three departments and then some.As the Tooth Fairy, Ralph Fiennes comes as close as one ever could to creating a sympathetic monster. What he does is revolting. What has been done to him is revolting, and unspeakably sad. He himself is dismayed by what he finds himself capable of, and the always interesting Emily Watson's character of the blind girl is presumably a means that permits him to ask just how far he is equipped to go, but it does not come off that way. Really, it seems more a device, something that neither of the previous Hannibal films have had.As far as the film is concerned on the whole, we are given hollow scenery characters like Harvey Keitel, the exceedingly talented Mary Louise Parker's token Worried and Doubtful Wife, the hugely compelling Philip Seymour Hoffman's sleazy tabloid journalist, and frankly, Ed Norton's character, too. This is not even in the same ballpark with what one should expect from a Hannibal Lecter film. The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal both, whether the latter lived up to the former or not, thoroughly developed and defined its each and every character. Each one of them had a feeling of weakness no matter in what position they were.Norton bluffs Lecter, walks away from him, none of which is true to the personality of Lecter, who we all know, even those of you who are fans of this film, has the forethought of a genius like one of the great poets or composers who who live like recluses, having risen so far above the collective conscious that he can scarcely be troubled by the comparatively negligent and inactive view of the ordinary person, even a famously brilliant FBI psychological profiler like Norton's character. I think Edward Norton is a fine actor, but nowhere in him is the capability to have the upper hand in any kind of exchange with Dr. Hannibal Lecter.",Red Dragon
52,videorama-759-859391,The Dragon still roars in much entertaining remake.,8,13 August 2014,"Okay, again I believe this film deserves no less than an 8, this film superseded by the original, Manhunter which when re released, it came out as Red Dragon. A bit of trivia there. This follows pretty much along the same path as Manhunter with of couple of neat changes. As that's the thing with this one, there's something too neat about it. But sometimes there's nothing wrong with neat. What's wrong here, amazingly was the casting, when compared to the original Manhunter. Ball scratching Norton, an actor I much admire, here is terrible. See William Petersen in Manhunter and you'll see why. So too was amazing actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman as sleazy reporter Freddie Lounds, who honestly, didn't even seem to be trying with his lazy voice. Keitel is solid as Agent Jack Crawford, though Scott Glenn was the best in the role. Fiennes is interesting as the killer, but shows a lot of try, which he half turned what was a good and scary performance, but was really skating on thin ice, where besides the brilliant Hopkins of course, Emily Watson was fantastic as the blind woman, infatuated with the introverted Fiennes. Red Dragon starts off interestingly enough, and does have a twist of ending which I liked, as too, a bit of flashback with Fienne's character as a kid, diving a little bit of more insight into his murderous and psychotic behavior. His tattoo sported on his back of half man half dragon with striking bull horns, used as a the movie placard I thought, had paralyzing appeal. Though this is something the movie doesn't always have, as too it won't have on it's audience, where too seeing the unique Mann original won't help. Apart from some striking violence and some quick disturbing images, One moment that jolted me was when Hopkins lunged forward at Norton, entertainingly in that gym room, where Hannibal's arms were restrained, tied above to a railing. I liked some comedy stuff in it too, Hannibal taking the p..s out of Dr Chilton (original, great character actor Heald) when fine dining in his cell to some classical music, a scene way out of the realm of reality. Like the three others that came before this, Red Dragon, will still entertain greatly, and will fulfill expectations for most fans of the series, and as a last line of question, asked by Hopkins, it's a killer. It's hard to believe when seeing that scene, it was a prequel moment to the one in 'Lambs' where Foster first meets Hopkins.

If you are even remotely interested in that field, love a really good suspense drama, horror, or just a good mind game, then these movies are definitely worth having a look-see. When I watch them, I watch ""Red Dragon,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and then ""Hannibal."" In that order. I normally detest prequels, and resent being dragged back to the beginning of a series to catch up on things which were only eluded to in the original, but this is the exception. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this production, its execution and the presentational marketing it experienced.Edward Norton Jr exhibits high talent in this attempt; far more talent than we were shown in Robin Williams's ""Death to Smoochy,"" in which he was stiff and appeared to be a pure novice. I must also comment on his striking physical resemblance to Haley Joel Osment. He would be exquisitely cast as the child's father in some future endeavor. Just a note. If you work in casting and are reading this, perhaps you should file that away for later.These movies, this one in particular, are far darker than to be described as merely ""disturbing."" The fact that the ""dragon"" chooses a blind woman as his love interest demonstrates the deep psychological research done on the part of Thomas Harris, the original author of this work. Someone with the deep-seeded self-hatred his character exhibits would be romantically comfortable only with a woman who cannot see him, his deformity, what he considers his monstrosity. His murders are not monstrosities to him. They are the epitome of his superiority; his intelligence; his power. But, Lecter being Lecter, as he ""helps"" Agent Graham develop the true profile of the ""dragon,"" he also feeds the ""dragon"" with personal information concerning Graham's family; their whereabouts and their lives. Burning the proverbial candle at both ends, in an attempt to create his own game of cat and mouse, wherein he is the eternal voyeur, rather than an actual participant. He is the maestro of the orchestra of mayhem which he conjures and creates. Through careful and skilled manipulation, he cultivates and shapes the ""Tooth Fairy,"" lends him direction and guidance along his path. Lecter refers to him at one point as his ""pilgrim,"" meaning one who is on a religious journey to enlightenment. But he does not realize just how clever is Agent Graham. ""Our scars have the power to remind us that our past was real."" Hannibal Lecter.This movie rates a 9.89/10 from...the Fiend :.",Red Dragon
55,jadavix,Does not stand up to further viewings,5,6 April 2021,"Having just read the (also underwhelming) novel that this was based on, I suppose I am obliged to compare the two, but I think I would rather contrast it with ""Silence of the Lambs"", its sequel. You see, therein lies a certain clue as to the real difference between a pretty good movie and a great one.Let me explain. I first saw ""Red Dragon"" back in '02. I knew it wasn't a perfect movie then, nor as good as its forebear, but I was still impressed and enjoyed it a lot. Now, rewatching it an unbelievable almost twenty years later, I just never really got into it, was put off by the silliness and artifice of it, and was particularly bothered by the Mickey-Mousing on the soundtrack from the great, yet misused, composer Danny Elfman.Elfman is most famous for his collaborations with Tim Burton, one of the consummate masters of the urban fairytale. His work here just highlights the movie's lack of realism. The ""Silence"" soundtrack was one of the brilliant soundtracks you don't notice, and shouldn't. Here the score merely distracts.Although the book managed a genuine shock with the re-appearance of the bad guy, here that is wasted and it doesn't land. Nor were there really any tense or scary parts.Dolarhyde was a fascinating character in the book with a tragic backstory, but here the movie seems to ladle on information about how he became a killer too thick and fast. All big budget serial killer fare features a moody detective piecing together the murderer's damaged psyche with scintilla like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. If Dolarhyde were a jigsaw puzzle, I realised, he would be one of those ones with over a thousand pieces.The big screen really laid bare some of the silly aspects of the novel. I guess Ratner was no Johnathan Demme, and now he's been #MeToo'd, he may never be.",Red Dragon
56,freemantle_uk,"Average Thriller, nothing compared to Manhunter",6,17 September 2009,"The Hannibal has proved to be very successful over the years. Manhunter, the first film became a cult classic, Silence of the Lambs won Oscars and Hannibal was one of the most successful R-rated films. Because of the success of Hannibal, a prequel was commissioned, hoping to capitalize on the success and interest in Thomas Harris series.Red Dragon is a prequel to Silence of the Lambs, it was the first novel written by Thomas Harris and a remake to the Michael Mann version of the book. This tells the story of the FBI's hunt for the serial killer the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes). He is a man who killed 2 families in Atlanta and Birmingham. The FBI senior officer is stubbed, so convicts expert former officer Will Graham (Ed Norton) out of retirement. He has the uncanny nack to know what a killer thinks and he is the man who cause Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). After Will Graham hopes the FBI find the evidence, he is asked to go and see Hannibal for help. The hunt is on for the killer who worships William Blake and Hannibal before he kills again on the next full moon.After Hannibal divided fans and critics, some hating the film (I personally liked it), the studio decided to play it safe, making Red Dragon similar to Silence of the Lambs. The original directorial choice by the studio was Michael Bay, but he refused (personally I would have loved to have seen what he would have done just to see how bad it would be). Universal and MGM ended up hiring Brett Ratner, a hack famous for making buddy comedies and being the director you get when no one else is available. He is to studios a safe pair of hands who offers no imagination or challenging the producers. Ratner shoots Red Dragon much like Jonathan Demme did with Silence of the Lambs, but without the tension or flair. Many scenes were just copied from Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs. He is a weak director and average is the best he can achieve. Ratner can not compete with directors like Michael Mann, Demme and Ridley Scott.Red Dragon attached a good cast, Ed Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker and Philip Seymore Hoffman. That sounds very good on paper. However, Ed Norton was miscasted, he seemed to young to play a senior FBI agent with a sixth sense about killers. He was not troubled like William Petersen was in Manhunter. Michael Mann exposed the theme that Will Graham nearly lost his sanity, but this was not touched on in this film. Emily Watson is normally a good actress, but here she was a bit wooden. I think she was trying so hard to a play a blind person convincingly that she wasn't able to add an depth to her character. Mary-Louise Parker was totally underused, which is a real shame because she is an excellent actress. Anthony Hopkins' performance was lazy, Ratner was hardly ever going to question him. The best performers were Keitel, who is normally good, Hoffman, again very good but was not hundred percent, and Ralph Fiennes who even plays a clichéd character well. The best scene in the film involved the Tooth Fairy torturing the excellent Philip Seymore Hoffman in a real acting class between the two.They are problems with the film. Some include the pre-title sequence which was over done. The title sequence using newspaper relieved too much. I think the film was also trying to make you emphasis too much with the Tooth Fairy, with the voice-over involving his abusive childhood and trying to make him human. A Hannibal film is not the type of film to make a serial killer human. The Tooth Fairy was more effective and sinister in Manhunter because you don't know anything about him. I also felt he was made into a clichéd psychopath. Ratner was trying too hard to be like Demme with some of his scenes. Some of the scenes like shooting were over done and the same when with a scene involving Hannibal's exercise, not adding to the film, taking away any realism. Ratner is no more then an action director at best. Another little criticism is one involving Emily Watson in the Tooth Fairy's house and give him a blowjob, taking away the idea of romantic love between the two. Also for a film set in the 1980s most of the characters have very modern dress sense.There are some good scenes in the scene, like the torture sequence. As a thriller it decent, but as a horror film it doesn't work.Manhunter, Silence and Hannibal are better then Red Dragon, but it is Brett Ratner's best film. Just imagine what a director like David Yates could have done with this material.",Red Dragon
57,ackstasis,A Terrific Thriller!,8,6 October 2006,"On paper, it looked a bit uncertain. The long-awaited prequel to 'The Silence of the Lambs' and 'Hannibal' was to be directed by Brett Ratner, most famous for the two 'Rush Hour' movies (1998, 2001).However, the final result is pleasantly surprising. 'Red Dragon' opens with a wonderfully suspenseful prologue detailing the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) capture, and the unbearable tension rarely lets up for the remainder of the film.Lecter's capturer, Will Graham (Edward Norton), is coaxed out of retirement by Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) to help track down a ruthless serial killer nicknamed the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), who is murdering seemingly-random families in their sleep. Graham believes that Lecter may hold the key to capturing this killer, and, in order to prevent any further murders, he must revisit his old demons.The acting performances are first-rate. Hopkins is good (as always) as the cold, calculating serial killer Lecter. Norton handles a demanding role exceedingly well. Throughout his career, Fiennes has excelled at portraying loathsome villains (i.e. Amon Goeth in 'Schindler's List,' 1993), and here he turns in perhaps his greatest performance. The facially-disfigured, mentally-unstable Francis Dolarhyde is shown not to be an inherently evil killing machine, but an emotionally-troubled young man who is still battling the overwhelming demons of an abusive childhood.Strong supporting performances from Emily Watson ('The Proposition,' 2005), Harvey Keitel ('Pulp Fiction,' 1994) and Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Capote,' 2005) round off a terrific thriller, and one for which widespread recognition is long overdue.",Red Dragon
58,JoeB131,More Hannibal- and more explosions!,9,4 December 2010,"They already made this book into a movie, but that was before bit player Hannibal Lecter was made into a household word by ""The Silence of the Lambs"". So of course, they had to remake the movie with HOpkins in the role in a more prominent position.Overall, this is a pretty good adaptation, made with a much bigger budget than 1986's ""Manhunter"". They put in a scene only hinted at earlier of how Lecter was caught. The ending of the book is closer to the original novel as well.The scenes with Grahmm are quite good, and Edward Norton does a much better job rounding out the character than William Petersen of CSI fame did. Hopkins in his third outing as Lecter continues to play the character with a sense of menace.Oh, one more point. In the 1986 version, they had a right out sex scene between the killer and the blind girl. In this one, they had the old implied they had sex bit, but didn't actually show it. Again, another example of how the prudes in the MPAA are good with violence but just stuffy on sex.",Red Dragon
59,drqshadow-reviews,"Appropriately Dark, Gory and Violent, It Also Feels Strangely Empty and Trivial",6,18 February 2015,"A very loyal, by-the-numbers adaptation of the first Hannibal Lecter novel, strangely saved for last in the Anthony Hopkins trilogy. It's about as direct a cut from page to screen as I've seen, which is refreshing, but something about the mood doesn't feel right. This is more of a procedural thriller than a psychological one, and that's fine if the screenplay is able to adjust appropriately. Instead, it keeps trying to push both sets of buttons, which makes this feel like two different movies under the same marquee. The lead casting is regrettable - Ed Norton feels flat and babyfaced as troubled ex-detective Will Graham and Harvey Keitel is terribly misplaced as Jack Crawford, his stiff supervisor - and even the more dependable act isn't completely up to snuff. Hopkins is a mild disappointment in his final turn as Lecter, over-enhancing many of the nuances that had always made him so harrowing in the role, and it's a reach to buy this as a prequel when he's so visibly aged in the interim. Ralph Fiennes is excellent as the madman Francis Dolarhyde, though, and Philip Seymour Hoffman nails his small role as a smarmy, mouth-breathing tabloid reporter. The film is mostly played for fan service, honestly, and at that it's generally very successful. It's far from essential, though, which is a shame. This could've been so much more with a better director and a few alternate casting decisions.",Red Dragon
60,XweAponX,A Francis Dolarhyde with more depth,10,17 October 2019,"As much as I was a fan of ""Manhunter"" with William Peterson and Tom Noonan, this film elevates the character of Francis Dolarhyde (Ray Fiennes) to a level of depth and humanity that he lacked in the first Version of this film.There are several remarkable things about this film including an origin story showing one of the incidents that was described in silence of the lambs, namely the flute player Benjamin Raspail and how he was dealt with by Hannibal Lecter.It also shows FBI agent Will Graham ( Edward Norton) figuring out exactly what Lecter had been doing.You have yet another version of Jack Crawford, this time played by Harvey Keitel. But the humanizing of Francis Dolarhyde was pushed further by showing his relationship with colleague Reba McLane (Emily Watson), which shows us the possibility that Dollarhide wasn't a black and white character he was a human and he even had second thoughts about what he was doing. This is in stark contrast to the way Tom Noonan play the same character, as strictly evil.There are plenty of Brett Ratner's favorite actors in this, he always uses them in his movies, such as Ken Leung, Brenda Strong and Bill Duke as well as another actor who always shows up, William Lucking.All the old favorites are back, we have Barney, we have Dr. Chilton, played by Frankie Faison and Anthony Heald ( Anthony plays a psychiatrist similar to Dr. Chilton in the X-Men three film, also directed by Ratner.This film basically takes a lot of the scenes from Manhunter and develops them a little further and in some cases doing exact homages to them, but it is the added depth and the expanded Hannibal Lecter storyline that makes it interesting and plants this film directly into the Hannibal Lecter franchise as a film of some importance.There was a woman in one of the scenes where the FBI agents are discussing things and I recognized her as being Elizabeth Dennehy, who helped beat the Borg in Star Trek the next generation. Also the sister of another Dennehy. Finally take notice of the conductor at the scene at the beginning that is none other but Lalo Schifrin, The composer of the original mission impossible theme.",Red Dragon
61,Chris_Docker,"Overall, a worthy prequel",7,7 October 2002,"Silence of the Lambs was generally regarded as an excellent and scary movie. The follow up was laughably below par. Lots of good material out there though  what about a prequel? It will have to be good! Enter, stage left, Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson. With that amount of actor talent rising to the challenge you could be forgiven for thinking it could hardly fail and, in this case, you would be right. Whilst not quite on a par with Lambs', this new version of the Red Dragon / Tooth Fairy story comes complete with plenty of excellent shocks, both of the predictable and of the less-predictable, edge-of-seat-white-knuckle variety.FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) seeks the help of Dr. Hannibal The Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to help solve a series of gruesome serial killings. Hopkins turns in the adequate performance that he has perfected beforehand  sufficient for this Saturday-night shock-fest even if it's not up to the standard of his greatest work  the sensitive nuances of Shadowlands, the multi-faceted and memorable characterisation of Amistad, or the sheer newness of the present character from Lambs'. His performance is nicely served up, but we know that it is one he has made earlier', and forgive him for over-acting it with such glee. Edward Norton is less hammy as the thoughtful detective who never overestimates his own abilities. Harvey Keitel is effortlessly laid back as his police boss, helping to add a touch of realism and believability that too easily gets lost in American movie police roles. Ralph Fiennes plays the demented serial killer, casting up a persona he has polished a little earlier for the rather lacklustre Cronenberg movie, Spider. He is a slimy, screwed up, repulsive character  the sort of person you want to shrink away from. Someone has to interact with him to give him depth though  so we have the blind working girl, played by Emily Watson, who falls for the monster that no one understands. Poor girl!  this time the Beast doesn't turn into a prince! A further element of counterpoint is provided by a superb supporting role filled by Philip Seymour Hoffman as the spineless, lecherous and unethical reporter who gets in too deep and still manages to make us feel sorry for him. The fine acting from Hoffman, Keitel, Norton and (most of the time) Watson, throw into sharp relief the caricatures provided by Hopkins and Fiennes. The overall concoction is a very acceptable thriller, better than you would have anticipated perhaps. A solid  if rather less than thought-provoking  piece of entertainment.",Red Dragon
62,MaxBorg89,A very good prequel indeed...,8,22 October 2005,"Before 1991's The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lecter also appeared in Michael Mann's Manhunter(1986), based on the first novel of the Lecter trilogy.This movie is the remake, starring once again Anthony Hopkins as the man-eating psychiatrist and Edward Norton as Will Graham, the FBI-agent who caught Lecter and ends up asking him for help when a new serial killer, the Tooth Fairy(Ralph Fiennes), or Red Dragon, as the killer himself likes to say, starts causing trouble...From the beginning, the tone of the movie is set:no gore and black humor as in Ridley Scott's Hannibal, just pure, simple, nerve-wracking suspense.It's so unsettling you can't help feeling uneasy, although you know, being this a prequel, that Hannibal ain't gonna escape this time.Even if the ending is (slightly) less tragic than in the book, the dread never really leaves you alone.As in 1991, one of the best things is of course the acting:the scenes with Hopkins and Norton are awesome(expect the usual witty one-liners coming out of Lecter's mouth), while Fiennes is pretty scary as the weird, lonely mass-murderer.The Silence of the Lambs remains a 100% masterpiece, but Red Dragon deserves as much mentioning.It's really, really great.Just don't watch it alone if you're easily scared...Enjoy your meal.",Red Dragon
63,smatysia,Must-see for Lecter fans,8,1 March 2004,"I read Thomas Harris' novel ""Red Dragon"" when it came out, so it was a long time ago. To the best of my recollection, this film stays fairly true to the book. (I never saw ""Manhunter,"" by the way.) I wondered who this Ed Norton guy was until it finally came to me. He was the abused kid in ""Primal Fear"". He's all grown up now, but still seems just a bit too young to be Will Graham. Of course, Anthony Hopkins IS Hannibal Lecter. This is supposed to take place about 8 years before the events in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" but of course that makes Hopkins and the guy who played Dr. Chilton about 15 years too old. Well, one can't have everything, and I'd rather them look too old than to recast the parts.

65,NateWatchesCoolMovies,not the strongest Lecter film,6,4 December 2016,"Brett Ratner's Red Dragon, although pretty darn stylish, is just cursed with being the least engaging and unique Hannibal Lecter film out there. It's not that it's a bad flick, but when you have Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal and the far superior Manhunter to compete with, you're trucking down a rocky road. The strongest element this film has going for it is Ralph Fiennes, who plays the hell out of the role of Francis Dolarhyde, the disturbed serial killer also known as the Tooth Fairy. Previously played by an introverted and terrifying Tom Noonan, Fiennes gives him a more rabid, haunted vibe and steals the show, but then he always does. Edward Norton is a bit underwhelming as FBI behavioural specialist Will Graham, sandwiched between William L. Peterson and Hugh Dancy's modern day, definitive take on the character. Graham has the tact and luck to ensnare notorious cannibalistic murderer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins purrs his way through a hat trick in the role), whose help he subsequently needs in pursuing Dolarhyde. Harvey Keitel clocks in as rock jawed Jack Crawford, Graham's boss and mentor, solidly filling in for far mor memorable turns from Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Farina and Scott Glenn. All the scenes with Dolarhyde fare best, given some truly impressive rural cinematography that sets the mood for the killer's twisted mindset nicely. The cerebral jousting between Graham and Lecter only half works here, dulled in comparison to the crackling exchanges that Jodie Foster masterfully handled with Hopkins, who was far, far scarier back then. Emily Watson lends her doe eyed presence to the blind girl that brings out the only traces of humanity still left in Dolarhyde, Philip Seymour Hoffman shows up as bottom feeding tabloid reporter Freddy Lounds, and Mary Louise Parker, grounded as always, plays Graham's wife. You could do worse in terms of films like this, but in the Lecter franchise it falls pretty far short of any of the other entries, save for the few inspired moments involving Fiennes",Red Dragon

Which the killer kills a family each month on a full moon.Directed by Brett Rather (Rush Hour 1 & 2, The Family Man, Money Talks) made a surprisingly effective suspense thriller. Which is a change of pace for Rather from directing successful comedies. This is a remake of the Micheal Mann underrated thriller-Manhunter (1986). Hopkins reprise his famous role in a supporting role (Which in the original, it was played by Scottish actor:Brian Cox). Norton is good as Graham but he lacks William L. Petersen's intensity performance from the 1986 film. What made Manhunter a memorable terrific film. Finnes is also good as Deranged Killer-Francis Dolarhyde (Tom Noohan was much more creepy and scarier as Dolarhyde in the original). Emily Watson, Mary Louise Parker & Philip Seymour Huffman have good supporting roles.Producer Dino De Laurentiis also produced the original film and Cinematographer Dante Spinotti did the camera work for this film also .Actor Frankie Faison (Which Faison appear in all adaption of Lector's series).

70,rbverhoef,The fun is back,8,29 September 2004,"'Red Dragon' is another movie starring serial killer Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) that is based on the novel by Thomas Harris. It is a prequel to the masterpiece 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991) and the pretty standard 'Hannibal' (2001). The novel was adapted in 1986 as well. The movie then was 'Manhunter' with Brian Cox as Hannibal in a much smaller part than Hopkins has in 'Red Dragon'. 'Manhunter' also starred William L. Petersen as Will Graham and Dennis Farina as Jack Crawford. In 'Red Dragon' Graham is played by Edward Norton and Crawford by Harvey Keitel.Graham is searching for a serial killer nicknamed the Tooth Fairy and, as in 'The Silence of the Lambs', Dr. Hannibal Lecter might know something about him. The Tooth Fairy, who is actually named Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) and who is dating a blind girl named Reba (Emily Watson), goes on with his killings. Every time the moon is full we have another victim. He is ordered by 'the dragon' to do these killings. What this means we learn in the movie. Subplots involve a reporter named Freddy Lounds (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a millionaire who once was a victim of Hannibal and is now obsessed with him.'Red Dragon' is a better movie than 'Hannibal'. Where 'Hannibal' tried to keep the attention of the audience with simple shocks that didn't work that well (despite Ridley Scott being the director), 'Red Dragon' trusts its story and even more the interesting characters. The creepy moments are not created through violence and gore (although there is some) but through a certain atmosphere and scenes well acted and directed. The quiet Norton, the sympathetic Watson, the almost sympathetic serial killer Fiennes, and the calm and funny (and therefore very creepy) Hopkins know how to play their scenes to give the effect we want to see. Especially Hopkins gives us some kind of evidence that the fun, which was not really present in 'Hannibal', is back.In my opinion it is also better than 'Manhunter'. Although that was a good movie, slow but with a lot of suspense, 'Red Dragon' has some advantages. It has a bigger budget, better actors (of course with Hopkins as Dr. Lecter) and a script written by Ted Tally who also adapted Harris' 'The Silence of the Lambs'. Since 'Lambs' was one of the masterpieces created in the nineties and 'Red Dragon' at times feels like that one Tally seemed to be the perfect choice to adapt the novel. 'Manhunter' was directed by a better director, Michael Mann, but admittedly 'Red Dragon'-director Brett Ratner (known from the 'Rush Hour'-movies) did a terrific job and it seems he is capable to do a lot more good things.",Red Dragon
71,onepotato2,flat,2,5 January 2009,"Red Dragon is the kind of movie that comes out in 2002, and you have no difficulty waiting until 2009 to rent it. I knew I'd get around to it eventually. The movie didn't generate much buzz from either new fans (who hadn't seen Manhunter) or hostility from devotees of the Michael Mann movie. Every frame of it reminded me of the style (excessive & superficial) in the previous version (Advantage; neither), and every structural development was rendered shapeless by someone who can't tell a story very well (Advantage; Manhunter)This is a lethargic production. Every characterization was stronger in the original. Even William Peterson (rather grating in the original) is better than the comatose Edward Norton. He's about as exciting as a wet towel. The only place this version is better is in the prologue and the Red Dragon story arc, which was omitted from Manhunter, and which, readers will inform you, provided some very vivid, weird scenes in the novel. Norton has a seriously slim range. The skein of Will inhabiting the minds of his prey is largely gone. Hopkins as usual plays Lector like a major ham. Also bad is Fiennes as Dolarhyde. The killer living in an abandoned nursing home is the sort of ridiculous provenance usually reserved for villains in comic books.People piled on Ratner and I'm with them. I've gotten used to dismissing the former movies achievements, but Red Dragon made me aware of how rousing the developments in the original were, by squandering every one of them. Ratner is not a very imaginative director. His version of all these scenes is always the lesser of the two. He avoids specificity like the plague and chooses generic shots, line readings, editing over and over. He cannot make a development exciting to save his life. The movie is also ugly to look at it, putting things you don't really want to see up on screen; including Phillip Seymour Hoffman's pink, tubby body.",Red Dragon

73,rosscinema,Not bad but nothing special,6,13 October 2002,"You can't help but to keep thinking of Manhunter and I went into this film thinking what did they have to offer that the first version didn't already do on another level? Well, it is more faithful to the book. There's no denying that. But Manhunter is clearly a much more superior film. Lecter's role is of course expanded and thats okay but lets compare the rest of the film. Edward Norton and William Petersen. Petersen's Will Graham is a very complex person with psychological problems and his family also suffers because of it. Norton's version has none of that, he's just dutiful to his job. Mary Louise Parker as his wife just sits there and nods her head! Where was the development of her character? The biggest flaw for me was Ralph Fiennes as Dolarhyde. Fiennes is really not very tall. In fact when he stands next to the wee Emily Watson he's not that much taller. Tom Noonan was a much better Dolarhyde. He stands like 6'7"" or something, a real monstrous presence. Fiennes is maybe 5'9"", MAYBE!! And now to Brett Ratner. He does a decent job here but does this film have any real style or vision? Not really, and we all know Michael Mann is a genius with his visionary style. Noonan's character was a real monster. Fiennes seems to come off as just a kook. While I didn't dislike this film, it just seems to be made by the numbers. It looks good, has great actors and is faithful to the original story. But where is the heart and vision? Manhunter had all of that, and more.",Red Dragon
74,raulfaust,The end of an era,7,8 June 2012,"Well, after three successful movies, ""Red Dragon"" closes the (original) franchise with style. Ralph Fiennes plays the last villain of this saga, and thought being the less bizarre out of the three, has the best performance. He shows he's really a good actor, giving true life to an improbable character who isn't that insane after all-- when comparing to Lecter and Jame Gumb. Brett Ratner delivers a perfect directing, making this movie hugely entertaining and intriguing; most scenes are tense and the background sound makes the movie becomes more and more thrilling. My only problem is with writing; I find it irritating the fact Norton's character is always finding things out from nowhere, he looks more like a seer than a detective. Such things remove film's credibility, but if you don't pay attention in details you won't feel cheated as I did in those scenes. However, the movie as a whole is GOOD and most people will truly enjoy it, so I recommend it to everyone and congratulate the director for the good job!",Red Dragon
75,Easygoer10,Ridiculous,5,30 January 2020,"This film was released 1 year after ""Hannibal"". Even though it is supposed to be a prequel, I believe it is idiotic to make either film when you already have the brilliant ""Silence of The Lambs"" (1991) and the excellent Michael Mann directed film ""Manhunter"" (1986). As such, it is (both literally and figuratively) ""overkill""; no pun intended.",Red Dragon
76,winner55,Who needs imagination when you got Hollywood!,2,10 August 2007,"when you make a remake of a classic suspense thriller, you had better bring something to it that wasn't there before, but that remains consistent with what was. Not even the great Alfred Hitchcock got this right when he remade ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" from a darkly comic commentary on cops and anarchists to a star-vehicle for a wimpy Doris Day and a wimpier Jimmy Stewart. There was nothing wimpy about any of the characters in the original.And there was certainly nothing wimpy about Michael Mann's coolly naturalistic exploration of the maybe-not-so-distant relationship between an obsessed FBI agent and a self-tortured, self-aggrandizing serial killer, ""Manhunter"". It's truly amazing, in retrospect, how little real violence there is in that film (until the end), because Mann keeps us aware that at any moment something terrible - or, bizarrely, wonderful - might happen to the characters - and to us.The definitive difference between that film and this remake is emphasized in the moment in each film when ""Mr. D."" takes his blind girlfriend to the zoo to pet a tiger under sedation. Mann's version is one of the great set-pieces of American film history - gorgeously filmed, profoundly and unsettlingly sensuous, agonizingly exquisite in pacing, rich in all sorts of undertones and overtones - whew!, I get emotionally exhausted even thinking of it.In the same episode as portrayed in ""Red Draqon"" the blind girl - pets the cat; and Mr. D. may or may not be having an orgasm, but who cares.""Red Dragon"" looks like a film a bunch of snotty frat boys might make in retaliation for having to live in a world too complex for their ""proud I'm unedjicated!"" vanity. ""Hey, I didn't get that 'Manhunter' film, why don't we make it simple, like the Simpsons?"" ""Doughnuts and beer?"" ""Sure; we'll just make sure the actors don't act and nothing special happens, and we'll toss in references to 'Psycho'-"" ""I didn't get 'Psycho' either."" ""Yeah, well we don't gotta be smart we just gotta look it - And we'll toss in Anthony Hopkins with some CGI instead of make-up - imagine the hype! Imagine the kids who don't know and don't want any better! Imagine the millions of bucks!"" ""Hey, I don't got no 'magination."" ""Who needs imagination when you got Hollywood!"" Who, indeed. Apparently nobody connected with this film. Even Harvey Keitel, one of my favorite actors, lets me down. He looks like he needs a few cups of coffee so he can get up energy to read some decent scripts for a change. And who the hell thought that a flat faced Edward Norton could compete with William Petersen's Sherlock-Holmes-on-too-much-cocaine performance as the obsessed FBI guy? And the original film's pre-climax turning-point line - about wanting to become god - suddenly turns up at the very beginning as a throwaway - like opening a performance of 'Hamlet' with Hamlet running across stage mumbling ""to be or not to be or something like that - "" - curtains. silence. audience quietly slinks out covering faces in embarrassment.",Red Dragon

In this film, a serial killer known as ""The Tooth Fairy"" is killing families before the full moon. Once again, an agent. This time, Agent Will Graham is assaigned to the case after taking a 3 year break after being severally injured but capturing Dr. Hannibal Lecture.This film is good, but is a bit ""out there"".

78,philip_vanderveken,Hannibal Lecter is back in business,8,3 June 2005,"I'm a big fan of the movie ""Silence of the Lambs"" and when I saw the sequel ""Hannibal"" I even wrote that it is a modern classic, the kind of movie we don't get to see enough. But also the kind of movie that should be left alone and that needs no sequel or prequel. Well, I guess I was a bit wrong that time. I now saw the prequel and I must admit that they did a very nice job with it.""Red Dragon"" is a prequel and therefor ends where ""Silence of the Lambs"" started. Everything that comes before it is recognizable, but new. This is how the story goes: Agent Will Graham retired three years ago from the FBI because he was almost killed by Hannibal Lecter, who was helping him to catch the 'Chesapeake Ripper', only to reveal it was Hannibal himself. Now he has been called out of early retirement to catch another serial killer, known by the authorities as 'The Tooth Fairy', only because he has an ability to get into the minds of criminals like no other agent can. The past two full moons a family has been slaughtered and they only have 3 weeks until the next full moon to find the madman. They are quickly running out of time and Will Graham, still emotionally and psychologically scarred by what happened a few years earlier, sees no other option but to go to Dr. Hannibal Lecter to ask for help once again...What I liked so much about this movie was that it looked pretty much the same like the movie ""Silence of the Lambs"", but without copying it. The story, the acting, the characters,... all look familiar, but are original (except for Dr. Hannibal Lecter of course). This time there wasn't that much gore, no replacement actors for familiar roles like for instance Julianne Moore instead of Jodie Foster as Clarice in ""Hannibal"". No, this time we got a movie that felt very familiar in every way, but that offered enough new and original things to make it more than just worth a watch. The actors all did a wonderful job. Not that this is such a big surprise. We know for instance how excellent Anthony Hopkins is portraying Dr. Hannibal Lecter and I've always considered Harvey Keitel and Edward Norton as marvelous actors. But the man who probably surprised me most was Ralph Fiennes. The way he plays Francis Dolarhyde, better known as 'The Tooth Fairy' is sober and powerful. It's so easy to make a serial killer look ridiculous and unrealistic, but in this movie he certainly isn't. He's creepy and scary, exactly the way such a person should look like in the movies.As a conclusion I just want to add that I was once wrong by saying that the movie ""Silence of the Lambs"" needed no sequel or prequel. I'm still convinced that the sequel was pretty awful, but I admit that the prequel certainly wasn't. I loved it and give it a score somewhere in between 7.5/10 and 8/10.",Red Dragon

There are some bloody scenes but the film promises many plots and twists. It is a great horror thriller with suspense. You will enjoy it but fasten your seat belt until the end for the big showdown. You won´t be disappointed. RED DRAGON is a very good remake of the first part MANHUNTER.  I mean the director made attention to plenty details in this one and it seems just perfect for the thrill. I loved also the very good picture. RED DRAGON is even better than the last one HANNIBAL.It is definitely a must see that I will add to my best of dvd collection.

Emily Watson is doing all right, but Edward Norton is making one of his probably endless future Edward Norton characters. He ought to make more ambitious performances. There isn't very much seen of Hannibal Lecter in this film. He was always present in the first two, although not always photographed. In ""The Red Dragon"" he isn't really the main character.

81,tomsview,A great becoming,8,5 September 2014,"There have been two really good movies made from Thomas Harris's novel, ""Red Dragon"" – Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" and Brett Radners's ""Red Dragon"".There was room for another film version; Radner's movie is more a re-interpretation of the novel than a remake of ""Manhunter"". In many ways, it sticks closer to the novel, but adds a lot more Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).The basics are the same in both films, FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) is coaxed out of retirement to hunt down a serial killer, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes), nicknamed The Tooth Fairy. He does this with the questionable help of Hannibal Lecter.Eerily, Dolarhyde believes that the murders he has committed herald his great 'becoming'. As Graham closes in on Dolarhyde, Dolarhyde closes in on him – and his family. The tension ramps up to a powerful ending.Most of the plot and much of the dialogue in both movies is drawn from Harris' darkly brilliant novel; you can't help but be impressed with an imagination that could create such vivid, believable characters. ""Manhunter"" didn't make too much of William Blake's painting, but in ""Red Dragon"" it becomes the fabulous, scary tattoo on Ralph Fiennes' back, which was only vaguely described in the novel.Tom Noonan played Dolarhyde in ""Manhunter"" and he is just as disturbing as Ralph Fiennes, but in a tall, unsettling kind of way. Similarly Brian Cox made an effective Hannibal Lecter, but obviously didn't make the impression Anthony Hopkins did five years later.As in ""Silence of the Lambs"", the central figure in ""Red Dragon"" is an FBI agent hunting a serial Killer. Edward Norton's Will Graham (William Petersen in Manhunter) captures the spirit of the detective who although damaged psychologically by past experiences, is driven by a sense of responsibility to hunt down sadistic killers. As Graham tells his wife Molly in Harris' novel, ""I have a knack with the monsters"".""Manhunter"" was notable for it's look; shot manly at eye level with an emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. ""Red Dragon"" has a sumptuous look but is less stylised.""Manhunter"" featured a Vangelis score – unfortunately nothing dates a movie like a Vangelis score unless it's a Gorgio Moroder score. On the other hand ""Red Dragon"" received ominous themes from Danny Elfman, a modern master who unlike Vangelis has great range. Elfman's score gives the film a definite pulse.If I have one criticism of ""Red Dragon"" it is the pre-credit sequence where Hannibal Lecter attacks Will Graham. No doubt the temptation to use Anthony Hopkins was too great, however the sequence works better treated as memory as it is in the novel and in ""Manhunter"".Neither movie follows the exact ending of the book, but this version is closer, and it's a good one. All that aside, this is a brilliant thriller in its own right.",Red Dragon

Although this has a similar plot line, this film certainly differs enough to ensure a different movie experience.Red Dragon is focused more on the Serial killer, than the FBI agent and it is less psychological than Silence of the lambs, and somehow is a little more suspenseful throughout the movie, unlike 'Silence' where the suspense is broken up into moments.I still prefer Silence of the Lambs, but i think thats because it was made first, and i saw it first, no other reason, their both great movies.8/10",Red Dragon
83,saadgkhan,Hannibal legacy Continues,8,25 August 2010,"RED DRAGON - CATCH IT ( A- ) Red Dragon is an intriguing prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. The story and serial killer (Red Dragon) in the movie is really intriguing and thrilling. Hannibal Lecter is such an iconic character that we always wanted to see how he got caught and who did it. There is very interesting relationship and chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton's characters. Though, its nothing as compare to Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster's chemistry but still much better then what was between Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins was Outstanding as Hannibal Lecter as always, it's astonishing to see that with how much ease and relaxation Anthony Portrays Hannibal Lecter. He is scary and captivating & when he is on screen you just can't take your eyes off him. Edward Norton did a fantastic job by standing next to him. But this movie completely belongs to Ralph Fiennes, he was incredibly creepy and brilliant. Watching him in Red Dragon is simply great; I don't think there is anyone else who could have portrayed Red Dragon. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Emma Watson is captivating and one of the best parts of the movie. Emma Watson as a blind woman did a incredible job. Mary-Louise Parker & Philippe Seymour Hoffman did a respectable job. Director Brett Ratner presented the movie in very intriguing and captivating way. It's nice to see a director doing completely different from its famous genre. the only flaw in the movie I found was the Cliché and quick ending of Red Dragon's character, I think it could have been little innovative and mind boggling. Nonetheless great movie, which bind a spell while watching it!",Red Dragon
84,sme_no_densetsu,"A passable thriller but nothing more, despite the excellent cast",6,1 September 2008,"""Red Dragon"", based on Thomas Harris' first novel featuring Hannibal Lector, had already been made once before as ""Manhunter"" under Michael Mann's direction. Here Brett Ratner and an all-star cast try to recapture the magic of the series after the previous year's ""Hannibal"" failed to live up to its famed predecessor, ""Silence of the Lambs"".The cast is star studded but it doesn't seem to me like much attention was paid to casting actors who were actually right for the parts. Edward Norton is a talented actor but I don't think he's suited to his part at all. Emily Watson also seems out of place and Harvey Keitel seems like he's sleepwalking through his role half of the time. Perhaps those who are unfamiliar with the novel won't see any problems with these portrayals, though.The story isn't bad but it suffers from being condensed down to a couple of hours. One unfortunate side effect of this condensation is the lack of character development. On the other hand, the ending is actually a slight improvement over the novel since there it felt telegraphed and tacked on. Nevertheless, I still believe that leaving out the lame 'twist' ending would have improved the overall story immensely.The direction by Brett Ratner is little more than competent. From a technical standpoint there's nothing worth remarking upon as the visual and aural presentation is strictly average, nothing more.Thriller fans will probably enjoy this insubstantial offering but it can't hold a candle to ""Silence of the Lambs"" nor is it worth watching for any kind of artistic merit.

85,blumdeluxe,Excellence in its genre,9,13 December 2016,"""Red Dragon"" is a movie for all those that want to know the story behind one of the most popular villains in modern cinema. It matches the tone of its elder brother, benefiting from the ongoing portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter by Anthony Hopkins. It works very well for fans of his universe and provides some further background to gain an impression of how this fragile cooperation initiated in the first place.What impresses me more is that it also works well for people that don't know the older movie at the time of viewing. Of course it is always easier to place a second movie before the first, trying to make it accessible as easily as possible. And of course the movie loses some layers if you don't get the plot between the lines. But apart from all that, what we see enrolling here is nothing else than an exceptional thriller.To me, creating such is always quite a task. It sometimes feels like we've seen everything in this genre, and very rarely a movie really stands out of the flood of solid thriller movies that are ongoing produced year after another. ""Red dragon"" achieves so in providing more. An additional side story, brilliant acting, a believable villain and the result that bad and evil are not always contrary but sometimes share a body.While this is not a creative movie in terms of presenting anything never seen before or after it clearly holds its promises.

Red Dragon, directed by Brett Ratner, the director of Rush hour(?) is actually good. As good as Silencce of the lambs? Hell no. But still pretty good. Red Dragon is a remake of an 80's film called Manhunter(which I liked also). This one stars Edward Norton as a retired cop named Will Grahm who needs from criminal mastermind Hannibal Lecter(The great Anthony Hopkins) who tried to eat him years ago. Will put him away. Will needs his help tracking down The Tooth fairy(Played by Ralph Feinnes) who works at a dog shelter and falls in love with a blind woman(Emily Watson).The Tooth fairy, like Buffalo Bill, is a Psycho. He cuts out a family's eyes and put them inside of dolls. What a sick bastard. Lecter doesn't really serve that big of a purpose in this one. He is only in it so then they can call it a Hannibal movie.I appreciated Red Dragon because it wasn't all gore like Hannibal. I liked that movie also. I am not quite sure whether or not Ralph Feinnes is more evil than Buffalo Bill. They are both sick bastards though. As I said earlier, this movie isn't as good as The Silence of the lambs. That Hannibal Lecter really must come in handy when it comes to finding a murderer. Where was he in The X-files: I want to believe. He might of came in a bit handy there.

It wasn't that much of a problem that the movie slowed down a bit on more than one occasion... The main problem I had with this film (aside from Antony Hopkins not doing much in it) was Ralph Fiennes as a psycho-killer: An insecure nerd going *weep* and *whine* all the time...? Come on, he just wasn't menacing enough (but he really was very well cast in Cronenberg's ""Spider"", giving an excellent performance - so no bad word out of me on his acting abilities). And he was supposed to have a lot of strength and all? Come on, he looked like a skinny office-clerk. I just don't like these type of villains (Robin Williams in ""One Hour Photo"" also comes to mind). I want them intelligent, menacing, confident and preferably totally crazy (well, uhm, if not, a mongoloid slasher works fine too). And another thing: The reason why he was doing these killings (his psychological motives, if you please)...? Let me just say that ""Frailty"" is a 10 times better movie! I liked the little set-up to ""Silence Of The Lambs"" at the end, though... And well, the twist after the house got burned down was nice too. Like I said, the film itself isn't bad.

So this movie is the prequel to Silence Of The Lambs, just so you know. Anthony Hopkins' role is certainly beefed up from the Manhunter movie (which was played by another actor). Thats OK, Hopkins can play menacing a lot better. Problem is, Edward Norton is not William Petersen, who had such an intensity and believability in the role in Manhunter (he also had the 80's wardrobe) Also, Emily Watson sort of acts acts acts as the blind person (Joan Allen was so good in the original).

Other than that, the movie just jumbles around the storyline of Manhunter word for word.  Even worse, most of the actors did a half a** acting job. Using huge bankable stars like they did in Red Dragon defeated any believability that it may have had.  Will Graham's family is almost an afterthought.Ed Norton was horribly miscast.  He plays certain types of guys.  Will Graham is not one of those characters.Sticking Anthony Hopkins in the movie was like duh.  But Brian Cox was a more hateable character.  It's hard not to like Anthony.Harvey Keitel was a fairly good choice.  And perhaps the only character properly filled.  Everyone else though looked like emotionless drab.  They were making it too obvious that they'd seen Manhunter several times over and seemed to act like drones.Ralph Fiennes was a laugh.  Emily Watson's talent was totally wasted.In the end, this movie is no match for Manhunter.  The original movie had tons of suspense.  The remake seems to want to be a horror movie.

While Hannibal and Manhunter are both equally good in their own right, Red Dragon almost tops TSOTL. The film opens up with the capture of Lector and from then on grabs you and doesn't let. The time around Hopkins is more in vein with the Lector from Silence not the wise cracker in Hannibal. Edward Norton gives another Oscar Worthy performance as Will Graham. The scenes shared between Norton and Hopkins displays a good chemisty and an intesting battle of wits between two of the screen's finest actors. Ralph Finnes steals scenes with his chilling performace as the Dragon and the rest of the supporting cast is equally good.

93,one9eighty,"A better sequel, even if it's a prequel",8,13 August 2018,"This 2002 film is the prequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs"", and a re-boot of ""Manhunter"". Leading FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) has a gift for psychoanalysis and criminology, allowing him to see things from the criminal's point of view; he's been working with Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to stop the 'Chesapeake Ripper"". The film opens with a scene showing how Graham manages to crack the case and subsequently arrest Lecter for the crimes (subsequently starting the setup for ""TSOTL""). Due to injuries sustained Graham retires, but is soon brought back into role when agent Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) asks for help with ""The Toothfairy"" (Ralph Fiennes), a killer who strikes on the full moon and has an issue with mirrors. With 3 weeks till the next full moon Graham works with Crawford to try and put a stop to the killing spree, using any means possible - from feeding the press (Philip Seymour Hoffman) false information, to interviewing the man who nearly ended Graham's life, Dr Lecter. Meanwhile the ""Red Dragon"" is rising.This is a great re-boot of ""Manhunt"", which was a decent film it lacked some style and class, stopping me from engaging and suspending disbelief with it properly. This film actually sticks more to the book than ""Manhunt"" did, only deviating by adding more Lecter/Graham interviews. Red Dragon, for me, is actually better than ""Hannibal"", the sequel to ""TSOTL"" because it is fast paced and has a lot of thrills and tension - which is more in line with what ""TSOTL"" built. The acting in this is good, I was dubious about Norton and Keitel when I read the pre-release information, but I think they did well with their performances. The book seemed to indicate that the Graham character would be grittier than what Norton gave, but it still worked well for the film, a darker performance may have made the film less accessible. My concerns with Keitel were just that Scott Glenn played what I expected from Jack Crawford in ""TSOTL"", stiffer and less connectable - Keitel softens Crawford a little but not enough to make me feel it was a poor performance. Fiennes as the villain worked particularly well - he played intense and creepy really well, he actually surprised me with this role. All in all I was surprised and delighted with this. I didn't expect the director of ""Rush Hour"" and ""Rush Hour 2"" (Brett Ratner) to bring to screen something so tense and gripping. This is a great post-prequel to ""TSOTL"", better than ""Hannibal"" and ""Manhunter"", and even in its own right, if you haven't seen the other films - it still stands up as a great film. 8 out of 10.",Red Dragon
94,jhclues,"Be Prepared, This One is Going to Stay With You... (10/10)",10,3 November 2002,"One of the screens most delectable villains is back and better than ever, to help bring yet another cinematic miscreant of social de-evolution to justice, in `Red Dragon,' a taut suspense/thriller directed by Brett Ratner, featuring an all star cast that includes Anthony Hopkins once again reprising his role of Dr. `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lecter.  Those who have seen `Silence of the Lambs' and/or `Hannibal' will know what to expect here (and will not be disappointed); the uninitiated, however, should be forewarned, as this film will take you into the darkest recesses of the human psyche, and afterwards will not allow you to go gently into that dark night that waits beyond the secure confines of the theater or the safety (?) of your own front door.  Indeed, this is one that will be with you for some time, so be prepared.In the Deep South, two entire families have been ritualistically slaughtered, and though they are located hundreds of miles from one another, there are similarities that lead the F.B.I. to believe they are connected. The killings occurred nearly a month apart, each during the full moon, and though agents have sifted through the crime scenes with a fine-toothed comb, they've come up empty.  They are looking, but not `seeing' anything.  And they're running out of time; it's three weeks until the next full moon, when they believe the killer will strike again.This leads Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel), the agent heading up the investigation, to call in former agent Will Graham (Edward Norton), the profiling specialist who captured Lecter, to take a look at the crimes and offer any suggestions he may have.  But Graham quickly realizes that to solve a case of this magnitude, and quickly, it will necessitate getting into the killer's mind; and as time is of the essence, it leads him to seek the assistance of his old nemesis, Hannibal Lecter.  And so, with no time to spare, the games begin.And into the mind of the killer is exactly where director Ratner takes you, and he does it on a number of levels that range from the subtle and implied, to the undiscriminating.  Working from a tightly written, intelligent screenplay by Ted Tally (from the novel by Thomas Harris), Ratner finesses the horror at the heart of the story to the surface, initially offering only glimpses, visually, of the heinous crimes.  Instead, he plants and builds a picture of what happened in your imagination, routing the information through Graham's investigation, so that you know, at first, only what he knows; then, with Lecter's assistance, along with Graham you begin to get an idea of the man behind the madness as his portrait emerges. 
But Ratner soon transcends the usual parameters of the genre, as he makes you privy to the madman himself, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes), whom the F.B.I. has dubbed the `Tooth Fairy,' in reference to one of the more obvious peccadilloes displayed during the manifestations of his insanity.  It is here that Ratner objectively explores the possible cause and effect of Dolarhyde's demented mind by proffering glimpses into his past, but without suggesting it as an excuse for his actions in any way.  Ratner, in fact, must be acknowledged for his careful and effective handling of this material, which had to be a challenge for the director who previously gave us the lighter `Rush Hour' and `Rush Hour 2,' as well as the insightful `The Family Man.'  In this film Ratner covers all the bases, and he covers them quite well, with an imaginative presentation that incorporates a concise understanding of human nature and the human condition.Ratner, of course, had a cast that would be any director's dream with which to bring his story to life, beginning with Hopkins, who eases back into Lecter's skin seemingly without effort, as if he'd never left (Hmmmm.  Will anyone who knows the REAL Anthony Hopkins please step forward, to perhaps shed some light on this?).  And in visiting with Dr. Lecter again, it's easy to understand why Hopkins was awarded the Oscar for his initial portrayal of Hannibal in `The Silence of the Lambs.'  He conveys a natural eeriness in his countenance, and in the coldness of his eyes there is more menace than any deranged mask-wearing villain with a chainsaw could ever hope for.Edward Norton, meanwhile, provides the perfect counterpoint to the abhorrent Lecter/Dolarhyde personas, with a subtle and understated performance that is so inherently honest and convincing that the credibility of the entire film is established by his character alone.  There is a precision in the unfettered nuance of his portrayal that few actors have the talent or ability to achieve.  His strength is in his reserve, and Norton's intuitive presentation of Graham lends the character a ring of absolute truth. Ironically, the meticulousness of Norton's performance will probably deny him the acclaim he so richly deserves for it; in a kind of catch-22, he is SO good, and his portrayal is structured so economically and efficiently, that it will be perceived as too easy and natural.  Yet it is precisely when the actor does not appear to be `acting' that he is decidedly at his best. And Norton certainly is here.  With the exception of his Amon Goeth in `Schindler's List,' the role of Dolarhyde is something of a departure for Fiennes, who usually gravitates toward more romantic, or at least amiable (if often moody or complex) characters, and he takes on his character with relish.  He gives a strong, solid performance through which he manages to evoke empathy without any accompanying undue or misplaced sympathy.  He successfully conveys the definitive disfigurement of the character-- that which lies within, beneath Dolarhyde's obvious physical deformity-- and therein lies the true strength of his portrayal.  Also turning in performances of note are Emily Watson, as the vulnerable Reba; Mary-Louise Parker (Molly); and Philip Seymour Hoffman (Freddy), all of whom add to the considerable impact and overall success of `Red Dragon.' 10/10.",Red Dragon
95,tim-764-291856,Very Decent prequel to The Silence of the Lambs,8,25 January 2013,"Ably directed by Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) Red Dragon certainly cranks up the tension and malice with Edward Norton as the FBI agent investigating homicides carried out by the 'Tooth Fairy', a chilling and disturbing Ralph Fiennes, whose distinctive tattoo covers his entire back, which he shows us often - as well as his naked other parts...One of my favourite actresses, Emily Watson superbly plays the blind woman who tentatively - and rather tenderly - seduces the monster - it is us knowing what may come and when, when she is so trusting greatly enhances this movie and whilst some might say that these scenes slow the pace and water down the action, I think it a big plus.Lechter, of course, Hopkins (who else?) is giving advice and red- herrings by the bucketful as clues, from his high-level secure cell - it's Norton's FBI agent who does the Agent Starling work in subsequent films, here.With some great names as well, such as Harvey Keitel, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mary Louise Parker this brilliant movie is only overshadowed by great The Silence of the Lambs itself.",Red Dragon
96,aciessi,Eat Your Heart Out,6,9 October 2018,"The new millennium, star-studded, Anthony Hopkins edition of the film Manhunter, which was based on the book, Red Dragon. For it's namesake, you'd figure this would be the perfected Red Dragon. But what it takes in a tremendously cool and creepy thriller classic, it replaces with a sort of B-Movie, early 2000's jump scare fare, that mimics Silence of the Lambs in sections intermittently. Yet, as you expect, Brett Ratner can't get out of it's own way. Overindulgent is the word that comes to mind. Norton is just fine here, so is Keitel, Hoffman, Watson and Parker. Hopkins is the most notable improvement from Manhunter, as his Hannibal Lector proved to be more terrifying. What downgrades, ever so slightly is Ralph Finnes as the Tooth Fairy. He's devastatingly creepy and disgusting to witness, but gone is the mystique and subtlety that made Tom Noonan's portrayal in Manhunter so unforgettable. Think of the kidnapping scene in the original, what you didn't see versus what you se here. It's more gratuitous and gruesome, but far less horrifying. Less is more, people. But there's something admirable about it's excess. It actually captures a bygone era of slasher thrillers, while still stylistically deviating from the original 80's classic.",Red Dragon

This really is a good , scary horror/thriller that in my opinion is better than Silence of the Lambs but not quite as good as Hannibal. At no stage of this film do you drift from the plot or lose concentration from what is happening and all the way through the film you are trying to guess what will happen next , ebeit , not with difficulty which in a way leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction when you do guess what happens next. Hopkins is at his brilliant best as Lecter and it would be a great shame if , as he says , this is he last Hannibal film. I love the final scene too , a real treat.A chilling and thrilling 8 out of 10.",Red Dragon
98,KnightsofNi11,A fun addition to the franchise,7,10 July 2011,"After The Silence of the Lambs it was evident that the Hannibal Lecter story had some serious potential in the film industry. And after Ridley Scott's Hannibal it was time to re-adapt the first book of the Lecter saga, Red Dragon. Michael Mann had done it with Manhunter in the 80's but an adaptation that was more fitting to the style of the Anthony Hopkins Lecter films was necessary considering audiences wanted to get the most out of Hopkins' incredible portrayal of the maneating psychopath.Red Dragon is the prequel to Silence of the Lambs and it follows former FBI agent Will Graham, the man responsible of the capture of Hannibal Lecter. But now Graham must seek the aid of Lecter in order to track down a new serial killer the media has nicknamed the Tooth Fairy. However, this hunt opens up some dark memories for Graham that he must face in order to go through with the case. Red Dragon is a dark and harrowing film that is constructed in a much different style than Mann's Manhunter. It's a style that is slightly more watered down, but much more in tune with the atmosphere's of the two previous Lecter films with Hopkins as Lecter. It's a film that satisfies my never ending taste for great serial killer films.The thing that was most on my mind while watching it were the similarities and differences between this and Manhunter. Having watched Manhunter only a few days ago kept it fresh on my mind so I was able to pick up on a lot of different things. Truly the only place where the two films are similar are in their storyline, and even those differ greatly towards the end. The two films have immensely different looks and feels to them. Even the acting styles are different. Brian Cox's portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is much smoother and more sarcastic psychopath. Anthony Hopkins is much more sinister and something leads me to feel so much more threatened by him than Cox. Of course after The Silence of the Lambs Hopkins is one of the most threatening and evil villains ever to grace the silver screen.Red Dragon has a much different feel than Manhunter. It is more of a thriller drama than a mind bending crime film. It is a film with stern sincerity and a visceral yet quiet undertone. The film is simple in a way, yet disturbing. Things are explained much more clearly and blatantly in this film than in Manhunter and I'm not sure if thats a good thing. Manhunter was a smarter film while Red Dragon is a little more stable than the offbeat style of Manhunter. I could basically draw up a nice big pros and cons list comparing and contrasting the two films, but that would be pointless. I'm here to judge the film Red Dragon as it stands on its own. And so on its own it is still an good film.Red Dragon is full of great performances, it tells a fascinating and disturbing tale, and it is a film with a lot of life. What it lacks is distinct style. It is a fairly watered down film that lacks any sort of specific stylistic atmosphere to set it apart from other Lecter films. The film still succeeds well as a dark crime thriller, but it does nothing to stand on its own. It's great because it tells a good story with intriguing characters that are played by great actors. I still thoroughly enjoyed this film but only because I love serial killer movies. Red Dragon is no masterpiece but it is still a film worth watching.",Red Dragon
99,Holt344,"Red Dragon is a great crime-mystery film that met my expectations, it's also a prequel to Silence of the Lambs",8,18 February 2021,"Red Dragon is the prequel to the critical acclaimed The Silence of the Lambs, a film many critics believe is one of the best, so it's hard to top that but I feel they did a great job at making a prequel. It was a box office but was met with mixed reviews.
Hannibal TV series and enjoyed it a lot, loved it even. So I think my expectations of these three films will hold. I don't know if I did the right thing in starting with Red Dragon, but I normally start a franchise in chronological order and this franchise probably works perfectly that way.Red Dragon is directed by Brett Ratner with a screenplay by Ted Tally. The directing is perfect and so is the visual storytelling, the atmosphere and tone of the film is the same, everything is stylish and elegant
The story sees FBI agent Will Graham enlisting the help of serial killer Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal he helped put behind bar, to track down another serial killer with the name ""The Tooth Fairy"".
It's an engaging and suspenseful story with fantastic acting throughout the whole movie, thanks to the cast with A list actors.
Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel and Emily Watson. Their performances made the film worth watching. Edward Norton captures the essence of the character and does an incredible job, truly making the research needed for a role like that and it comes off fascinating and interesting to watch. The same is true for Anthony Hopkins and Ralph Fiennes, I'll talk more about Anthony Hopkins' performance as the iconic villain in my next review, but Ralph Fiennes captured the role perfectly and you could easily say that it's a memorable villain and performance.The production design is impressive and so is the cinematography, Dante Spinotti served as the cinematographer and his work continues to amaze me.
Danny Elfman's musical score is mysterious, suspenseful and overall incredible. Fitting the genre perfectly.Red Dragon is a crime film that has everything to be great, I found the script to be weak though which drags the movie down to an eight, otherwise I might have given it a nine. It was a box office hit, rightfully so. I liked it a lot and can't wait for The Silence of the Lambs.",Red Dragon
100,carbuff,Chilling and Disturbing Horror/Thriller Which Feels Slightly Dated and Predictable,7,26 December 2020,"I would actually say that the prequel ""Red Dragon"" is more intense and disturbing than ""Silence of the Lambs"", at least as far as my memory of the latter goes. There's no way a film made nearly two decades ago won't feel a bit dated, and, at heart, this film basically follows along the well-trodden path of countless older police procedurals.On the other hand, the production values are so high, and the tortured criminal mastermind is so especially convincing (probably actually too calculatingly insane relative to real life serial killers, or at least I hope so) that the plot holds your attention right to the end. There are plenty of twists throughout even though the story strikes one as pretty conventional, much like a really well-done, made-for-TV movie that had it's game stepped up a notch or two. If you're into this kind of movie, ""Red Dragon"" is an excellent prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and introduces the Hannibal Lecter character very effectively. Maybe I'll have to rewatch ""Silence of the Lambs"" and see if I wasn't paying close enough attention.",Red Dragon

102,eminkl,This could've been so much more,6,18 April 2020,"A very loyal, by-the-numbers adaptation of the first Hannibal Lecter novel, strangely saved for last in the Anthony Hopkins trilogy. It's about as direct a cut from page to screen as I've seen, which is refreshing, but something about the mood doesn't feel right. This is more of a procedural thriller than a psychological one, and that's fine if the screenplay is able to adjust appropriately. Instead, it keeps trying to push both sets of buttons, which makes this feel like two different movies under the same marquee. The lead casting is regrettable - Ed Norton feels flat and babyfaced as troubled ex-detective Will Graham and Harvey Keitel is terribly misplaced as Jack Crawford, his stiff supervisor - and even the more dependable act isn't completely up to snuff. Hopkins is a mild disappointment in his final turn as Lecter, over-enhancing many of the nuances that had always made him so harrowing in the role, and it's a reach to buy this as a prequel when he's so visibly aged in the interim. Ralph Fiennes is excellent as the madman Francis Dolarhyde, though, and Philip Seymour Hoffman nails his small role as a smarmy, mouth-breathing tabloid reporter. The film is mostly played for fan service, honestly, and at that it's generally very successful. It's far from essential, though, which is a shame. This could've been so much more with a better director and a few alternate casting decisions.",Red Dragon
103,SmileysWorld,The terror continues.,7,12 October 2002,"Anthony Hopkins takes us on another journey of terror in Red Dragon.You have here,basically the same plot outline from Silence of the Lambs,but with several differences.This story takes place before Silence,as Will Graham(played by Edward Norton),returns to face his infamous capture, Dr.Hannibal Lecter,to gain some insight and theories into the mindset of an infamous killer known as the ""Tooth Fairy"",or ""Red Dragon"".In this film,we explore the killer's life a little more deeply,delving into his past and discovering what led to him becoming what he is.While it in no way,surpasses Silence of the Lambs,it indeed is an improvement over the second installment,Hannibal.There is less focus on the Lecter character here,almost pushing him to the point of supporting character. It is always a thrill to watch Hopkins engross himself in the persona of Lecter,but I do hope this is the last time we will see him play it, otherwise,I fear that he will become a comical parody of himself,much like Jason and Freddy Kreuger have become.While Silence of the Lambs remains the best of this trilogy,Red Dragon is indeed worth a look.",Red Dragon
104,fernandoschiavi,"Brett Ratner's work is a film that respects the 1991 classic, adds new layers to Hannibal Lecter and the end result is an above-average thriller",7,12 October 2021,"Red Dragon was the first, released in 1981, followed by The Silence of the Lambs (1988, filmed in 91) and Hannibal (1999, filmed in 2001). The first book was originally filmed by Michael Mann in 1986 as Manhunter, where actor Brian Cox played the role of Lecter, but the film did not stand out, remaining somewhat lost in many other similar productions. With the success of The Silence of the Lambs directed by Jonathan Demme, a film that won several Oscar awards, the writer Harris re-released his work Red Dragon, but with a new prologue and changes in the story, culminating in the film directed by Brett Ratner.Just like in the movie whose events follow this one, the killer is shown, even while the FBI doesn't know who he is. This takes some of the mystery out of this case, but it makes room for the very interesting psychological development of an individual like Francis Dolarhyde, or ""Tooth Fairy"", as the serial killer is called by the press. Here too, Hanibal has no problem with murdering people, to eat them or use them for some other purpose he approves of, just as he has no problem with doing this with animals. Lecter is much fiercer here than in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" and develops a relationship that suggests resentment toward Will Graham, a desire for revenge, as well as affection. In relation to Clarice, a character in the following film, according to the chronology of the stories, the psychoanalyst has great affection. He also looks older than in the first film, whose events are later than this story, except for the excellent prologue set in the eighties. He is portrayed more as a madman, who takes great pleasure in his murders, while in the first film he is something more like an extremely intelligent man with different philosophies, considered cruel by those around him.The problem, then, is that the film, which is supposed to explain Lecter's origins, or else show his first interaction with Will, gives way to a smaller copy of Silence of the Lambs. The argument used for Hannibal to help Will is the admiration for the policeman who arrested him forever. But this argument is thrown away for being the second time the doctor helps the police. All the suspense that could be created by the novelty is wasted because it is not the first time. Where is the origin of evil from this principle? In the ten-minute scene at the beginning of the movie? It's not even Brett's fault, as the book is exactly like that, but simply Red Dragon is totally out of place from the other films that preceded it.As is common in productions inspired by the literary universe of Thomas Harris, important points in art history gain connections with the development of the plot and here, we have a parallel with The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Dressed in the Sun, painting by William Blake that allegorizes passages from the Apocalypse, closing book of the Holy Bible. With a screenplay by Ted Tally, the playwright who conceived the script for The Silence of the Lambs, the film features an extraordinary cast, complemented by Philipe Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson, figures who can support the dialogues of frontline members, ie, the protagonists. Still on the killer, the ""monster"" in this version doesn't connect with Ed Gein's way of customizing fur clothes, nor does he put his victims in a well or abandon them in a river. Here, the criminal bites his victims using his grandmother's dentures, a deceased lady, castrator and malevolent item in the formation of the boy's character, disturbed by the presence of the woman who insists on appearing in his moments of hallucination.An interesting point of Tally's script, something properly managed by Ratner's direction, is to think that just like in the first film, Red Dragon chooses to leave the excess and obviousness aside, introducing us to her grandmother through an excellent sound work, without the flashbacks that explain things too much. Regarding the psychopath's mode of operation, before killing the humans on his list, the killer has the habit of decimating the family's pets, in addition to putting pieces of mirrors in the victims' eyes, in order to make them appear alive. All very ritualistic and macabre, coming from a disturbed mind. One of the turning points is the Chinese symbol that reminds us of the film's title, left on the tree of one of the murdered families, the fruit of a murderer who is proud of what he does. It is a signature, equivalent to the insect, the moth of death, left in the victims' throats in The Silence of the Lambs. Still on symbology, the mirrors symbolically represent ill omen, one of the many significant elements exposed on stage to compose the philosophy proposed by the film.Addressing both the investigation and the title's villain, the story has an interesting balance between the conflicting fronts of good and evil. The Red Dragon is composed between the grotesque of his actions - shocking crimes that attract the reader of the police narrative in general - and a psychological scope that justifies the actions of this man who lived his childhood with an aggressive mother. Both the cop-versus-assassin battle unfold and the relationship between Will and Hannibal, an apparent monster that moves between the two poles, helping the police while communicating with the villain, an assumed fan of Lecter's feats.Red Dragon is also a luxury movie. With a meticulous work of art, the cell where Hannibal is held is identical to the one in Silence of the Lambs (a slight difference in lighting, a result of the teams' different styles). To this end, the film has sets and exteriors, which, if not the same, are replicas, with the hiring of the same actor to play the director of the prison where Hannibal was held, and the script, written by the same screenwriter. In the direction of photography, veteran Dante Spinotti, efficient in the choices we see on screen, composes pictures that range from the magnitude of more open and explanatory planes to more claustrophobic moments, aimed at the process of inserting thematic anguish into filmic visuality. Danny Elfman, a renowned professional in the industry, delivers a soundtrack with three or four moments of inspiration, but the rest is not very engaging and can never quite match the textures of Howard Shore and Hans Zimmer for the predecessor productions.Dragão Vermelho also addresses issues such as media interference in the resolution of police cases in the sociological arena (and the character Freddy Lounds pays a high price for meddling in the wrong place and time) and also the issue of social abandonment (the murderer is the result of abandonment of the mother and the abuse of the grandmother). And it's not just the traumatized psychopath who represents this repressed instinct side. Hannibal is part of this process, a monster compared to the bogeyman, to the dark archetypes of classic folktales, a contemporary ogre that frightens and, at the same time, in a paradox of humanity, fascinates by representing the dark side of our lives.Brett Ratner's work is a film that respects the 1991 classic, adds new layers to Hannibal Lecter and the end result is an above-average suspense, with an engaging script and a surprising conclusion that makes fans of the original finish with a smile on her face and wanting to see The Silence of the Lambs again right away. Kristi Zea, in production design, returns to take over the composition of the spaces, in a work as interesting as the one carried out in The Silence of the Lambs, always focused on details and on the construction of meanings for each prop put on stage. The opening scene in Dr. Lecter's office was inspired by Freud's intellectual production space, a setting that briefly mentions the insect from the first film, a timely tribute list, but also thematic connections between the plots that encompass the Hannibal universe.Brett Ratner's direction maintains the Jonathan Demme style, an attempt to simulate the claustrophic setting of The Silence of the Lambs. The weakest point in the plot is perhaps its most famous character. Onstage, Anthony Hopkins does not maintain a well composed presence as in the story released in 1991. His character seems too affected, with a more exaggerated prosody than the previous composition and without the same shine, as if he felt uncomfortable in some way beyond the character. The supposedly rejuvenating makeup doesn't work and seems to limit the actor, as if he avoided facial expressions so as not to mark his advanced age. Perhaps, with current technology - which rejuvenated Michael Douglas in an impressive way in Ant-Man -, a more refined interpretation would be possible, which would later correct any old age marks on his face. Still, Lecter's ambiguous elegance is intact in his interpretation.Unfortunately, Red Dragon failed to achieve Silence of the Lambs. But still, it manages to be an excellent film and one that managed to achieve justice to the Hannibal saga. Is there room for improvement? For sure. And yet it achieved very high quality.",Red Dragon
105,Ruskington,The prequel comfortably outranks the sequel,7,23 August 2020,"As with Hannibal, I really wish this film had not been made and that Silence of the Lambs could stand untouched as one of the all-time greats. However, unlike Hannibal, this is actually a pretty good film. In many ways it's a fairly bog-standard murder mystery with an unusually strong cast. Hopkins steals the show as expected but Norton and Fiennes are both brilliant. Many aspects of the story are unnecessarily far-fetched and Fiennes' character is a bit paint-by-numbers for this type of narrative but the writing and direction make for a gripping and highly enjoyable thriller.",Red Dragon
106,FilmOtaku,"Overall, not horrid",5,22 September 2003,"Having actually tolerated Hannibal not for the story, but for its production values, I was willing to give Red Dragon a shot despite some general bad feedback.  I came away from this film feeling fairly ambivalent, but there are certain elements that were impressive enough to not blatantly despise it.  Red Dragon acts as a prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, where Lecter is finally caught after years of acting out in his sociopath manner.  The FBI agent who brought him down then asked to help track down the `Tooth Fairy', a serial killer who is preying on families and has a bizarre enough M.O. to be a profiler's wet dream.  The agent (Norton) asks Lecter to assist him in his investigation before another family is targeted.  While the film has some intensely bad plot holes and a deplorable ending that gave me a headache because I was rolling my eyes so much, there were many factors that made the film actually tolerable.  The casting was brilliant  Ralph Fiennes was incredibly fun to watch as the Tooth Fairy because it was such a departure in role for him and it was obviously a character he could sink his teeth into.  (No pun intended.)  Norton is always good, as is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had a small but memorable role as a sleazy journalist.  The direction was fast paced and the cinematography very slick as well; all elements that made this film entirely watchable.  Had they not completely screwed up the last two minutes of the film and relied on a `wink-wink nudge-nudge' moment it would have been overall more favorable  but until then, it is worth having a look.--Shelly",Red Dragon
107,jpschapira,A well handled thriller,7,6 March 2005,"I'd like to say, before getting into any details, that I'm not a big fan of suspense or mystery movies. Thrillers, to be accurate. I have never liked them much (recently I saw the disappointing ""I witness""). But the truth is that I find myself occasionally trapped (if it can be put that way) by some of these films. It's because the usual elements, those that can not eliminated, are well handled; as in ""Red Dragon"".You have to get a good, or better than good team to make this movie. The people in charge of it were probably respectful with the writer and tried to be faithful to the story, and work professionally. ""The Silence of the Lambs"", a movie I haven't seen, has been qualified as nearly the best of its genre. This team made the right decision, about not letting the story down. This I say because of some other similar cases, in which the team doesn't care for the story; only about the purpose of making the film (earning money in most of the cases). ""The Exorcist"" sequels are good examples for this. They were made to make the same amount of money at the box-office they got with the original. I must say that it works; ""The Exorcist: The Beginning"" achieved that goal. That's a lot already.The cast is superb in this film. I read about the first choices for some of the characters and I don't know if they could have done it better than these people. Anthony Hopkins continues to amaze me in the way he can have the same expressions in every take. He remains the same during the entire film without changing the position of his eyes (well, exaggerating things a little bit). Great acting. Calm, confident and full of personal style. I loved him in ""Hearts in Atlantis"" because of the expressions I'm talking about. Edward Norton is one of the finest actors working today. In roles he shouldn't, he takes risks. I think I first saw him in ""The Score"" and thought of him as the best element the movie had. Then I saw him in ""Death to Smoochy"", playing a very different role, but equally good. Then in ""Fight Club"", in ""Rounders"", in ""25th Hour"" (my God); great performances. Here he does it again. I also liked to see Harvey Keitel playing the role he knows by heart again. The man is sixty and counting.I have to give another paragraph to ""the red dragon"", right? Fiennes played the character with a lot of emotion. Good; because that is what his character needed. We don't always see these villains with deep emotions. The way he feels for Reba (Emily Watson; quite good, but underused as most of the times) is something to study. I don't like the whole thing about the soul possessed by the devil (dragon in this movie), but it works here, because you can see that the villain actually feels.And what can you tell me about the presence of the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Freddy Lounds? He doesn't get tired of doing it right, does he? And of course, a movie with a score by Danny Elfman can't be that bad, I believe.This piece hasn't got everything, but it is alright if it has what it needs. Sometimes ""what a movie needs"" is not everything.",Red Dragon

My view hasn't changed - although it was dug up again after the event and given a new lease of life on video. Where it looks and plays like a good TV movie.In a short sentence, the before-and-after difference is that this is an A movie with A movie actors and an A movie budget. Remember that, I'll be asking questions later...The fact that it is only marginally better than what went before doesn't say a lot for the journeyman director Brett Ratner - of Rush Hour 1,2 and 3 fame.(Having the same basic plot destroyed any notion of this being a thriller. You would have thought they would have moved the furniture around a little bit more!? This isn't Shakespeare you know!)Silence of the Lambs was actually a good, but not great, movie. It worked because it left an image and impression on people. It also presented a strong woman image - which helped women like what was, very nearly, a horror film. Something they are prone to dislike.(The ""sex and age"" scores for the Best Picture Oscar winner make interesting reading. Three cheers for IMDb for bringing us such data at no charge!)Lead (Red Dragon) FBI sniffer - Edward Norton - is a bit like an upmarket version of Sean Penn, better with the lower IQ roles than the higher ones. I presume that the FBI only recruit from the very best of American society, so I have to be puzzled why such a namby-pamby tea boy would have this top job.The return of the supposedly ""younger"" Sir Tony Hopkins adds nothing to the credibility of this movie as a prequel to Silence. He still has that strange attractive/repulsive nature that no one can quite figure out. I guess that perfect diction goes a long way in this world, even if you are a flesh eating killer!Ralph Fiennes is also good as the ""Tooth Fairy"" madman and he is the only one that adds anything that new to the familiar stew. Indeed he would be just as good as Hopkins in the Lecter role. Great thousand yard stare - must be taking lessons from Christopher Walken!Apart from that, there is really not one great spark of inspiration in this production.

Although both of Lambs' sequels are more gruesome, more disgusting than the original cause none of them has got that elegant and wonderful disgusting violence.RED DRAGON takes us back to before The Silence Of The Lambs! We meet Norton as a detective hunting on the psychotic serial killer calling himself Red Dragon, and he has to use Hannibal as a helping force, just as in Lambs. Edward Norton does a good performance, and the movie has really got some very exciting parts although not this either; reaches up to the excellent Lambs.The frightening scenes seeing Dragon's way of killing is one of the movie's most peculiar parts, making the mood very puky although this pure disgusting part disappears slowly, not as in Hannibal were the movie simply did everything out from the pure brutality. RED DRAGON is a utterly exciting movie, and it has captured a lot of a thriller's thrilling excitements, and it really helps this movie becoming a worthy part of the Hannibal Lecter series. STARS: 4-3/5",Red Dragon
110,deatman9,Another great instalment to the Hannibal story.,7,19 October 2012,"Usually when sequels come out they can never hold up to the original. This franchise though is very much the opposite. Each one they come out with is just great. This one adds the acting skills of Edward Norton who does a great job and once again Anthony Hopkins who is his normal creepy self.This movie is about a young skill FBI detective who is put on a case of a new serial killer. He needs help with the case so he asks his friend and recently captured criminal Hannibal Lector.This movie is just a great story. Everyone film in this franchise was so good and worth many viewings. They are chilling, scary and very entertaining.",Red Dragon

The story itself mimics its predecessor in structure and plot.The story starts with the arrest of Hannibal Lecter. If you're like me, Anthony Hopkins is the only reason why you're watching the film in the first place!The plot and antagonist were interesting. Motivations and puzzles held interest. Yet, I do not buy Edward Norton's performance as a super detective. But that may be more of the fault of the playwright than the actor.I give this movie a 2.5/5. It could have been better but felt more like a cash-grab than anything else.",Red Dragon

113,raymond-15,Not what I expected,7,16 October 2005,"If you thrilled to the sinister antics of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and expect to share similar experiences in the prequel ""Red Dragon"" you will be disappointed as I was because the story here concerns a young man Will Graham (Edward Norton) recently retired from FBI investigations and reluctantly called back to solve a couple of nasty murders where whole families have been mutilated. Earlier Will was responsible for putting the psychopath Lecter behind bars and now as a last resort he seeks his helpful advice in catching the current serial killer.There is much banging of the sliding barred doors to create the jail atmosphere and Hannibal Lecter gives his threatening stare straight at the camera in the few scenes in which he appears. In each scene you feel that Hannibal Lecter is the dominant character and you wish you could see more of him. But certainly not to dine with him! Will Graham surveys the murder scenes and gathers what evidence he can. The murderer it seems likes to smash mirrors and replace the eyeballs of his victims with little pieces of mirror no doubt to see his own reflection in them. Gruesome stuff this! But even psychopaths can make mistakes and leave a clue or two while handling eyeballs. What drives Will forward in his quest is the questionable safety of his own little family.The killer is referred to as the Tooth Fairy or Mr. Dolarhyde or simply Mr. D. His completely tattooed back adds a sinister touch to his character. A blind girl Reba McClane seems to enjoy the company of Mr. D. and attempts to seduce him. It seems she will be his next victim. I have to admit their scene together was tense but rather an unconvincing situation in my opinion.On the whole somewhat disappointing. I suggest you watch a repeat of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" instead.",Red Dragon
114,Darkside-Reviewer,Tries to hard,5,10 March 2021,Red Dragon (2002) was the second movie interpretation of the 1981 novel Red Dragon written and published by Thomas Harris. The Red Dragon novel was the first book by Thomas Harris to introduce his now most famous character Doctor Hannibal Lector. Red Dragon is actually just a remake of the 1986 film Manhunter which was the first movie interpretation of the Thomas Harris novel. Manhunter Co - Stared Brian Cox who was the first actor to play the role of Hannibal Lector.Red Dragon tells the story of FBI inspector Will Graham (Edward Norton) who is asked to come out of retirement to help try and catch a dangerous serial killer named the Tooth Fairy. Graham is the one responsible for the capture of Doctor Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) years prior which left Graham both physically and mentally scared. Graham agrees to help find the Tooth Fairy who has already killed two families in horrific home invasion attacks. Graham does his best to find evidence on who the Tooth Fairy might be but finds few answers. Graham decides to try and enlist the help of the genius psychiatrist and cannibalisic murderer who he once put behind bars Doctor Hannibal Lector. Lector helps Graham with his investigation giving him cryptic clues while also playing twisted mind games with the man who is responsible for his capture. Graham now has to find the Tooth Fairy before he strikes again and before Lector unravels his already damaged psyche.Red Dragon is an almost carbon copy of the original Manhunter film. I wasn't surprised by this as it is still just a remake of an already existing film and book. I was however hoping for a more complex and emotional relationship between Lector and Graham especially since in this interpretation we get to see how Graham apprehended Lector.Anthony Hopkins is a great Hannibal Lector but in this film you can see he's had enough of playing this character. Edward Norton gives a great performance as a tortured FBI detective who's job it is to get inside the mind of serial killers. Hopkins and Norton don't quite have that same dark connection in their scenes together as Hopkins did with Jody Foster which the filmmakers tried desperately to recreate in this film. The filmmakers even brought back some of the old cast from Silence of the Lambs and even tried to recreate Lectors prison cell from Silence of the Lambs. But sadly no amount of nostalgic throwbacks can recreate the unique atmosphere created in Silence of the Lambs.Red Dragon is a decent enough movie but in my opinion Manhunter (1988) will always be the best interpretation of the Red Dragon novel. I recommend giving that film a watch if you find that Red Dragon just isn't for you.,Red Dragon

118,WriterDave,Derivative Garbage,6,9 April 2003,"`Red Dragon' is one of those badly conceived Hollywood endeavors, a prequel to an overrated Oscar winner (`Silence of the Lambs'-a rote slasher flick that introduced a novel psychological complexity to the genre) that is also a remake of another overrated film (Michael Mann's `Manhunter'-the best thing that can be said about that film is that you will never listen to `In A Gadda Davita' the same way).  It's the worst kind of Hollywood film-slick, exploitative, and maximized for profit.Though not as polished as `Silence of the Lambs' and not as outright grotesque and darkly comic as `Hannibal' (a film that as horrible as it was, was a master-stroke by Ridley Scott, who clearly understood the vileness of author Thomas Harris' original conception, and the utter crappiness of this ill-conceived and long delayed sequel and turned that all into something artistic and over the top and oddly satirical), `Red Dragon' still makes for a derivative and enjoyable two hours if you have nothing better to do late at night, you turn all the lights off, and knock back a few beers while watching it.This all would have been direct-to-video had it not been for the A-list cast.  Anthony Hopkins and Harvey Keitel basically phone-in their performances.  Ed Norton, though compelling, is badly miscast.  He is simply too young to be playing a `retired' profiler.  It was only seven years ago that he was playing an alter boy in `Primal Fear.'  Philip Seymour Hoffman is as odious and over-reaching as usual.  He continues to be one of the most over-rated and repetitive method actors out there.  Ralph Fiennes as the sickening `Tooth Fairy' and Emily Watson as the blind woman oddly attracted to him act as if they are in a far better film that is more deserving of their immense talents.  This is all directed by Brett Ratner, a hack who clearly thinks he is more astute and talented than he actually is.   At any rate, this isn't all that bad for its genre, and far better than something like `Kiss the Girls,' though that isn't saying much.",Red Dragon

120,LebowskiT1000,"Excellent Remake, A Must See for Lecter fans!",10,16 November 2002,"I have to admit, when I first heard that this film was being made, I wasn't really sure why it was being made.  I thought the original ""Manhunter"" was a fairly good movie, but nothing worthy of being re-made.  Then I heard that Edward Norton was going to star, along with Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, and of course, Anthony Hopkins. ...And under the direction of Brett Ratner!!!  I was left with no choice but to go out and see it.I have to say that this is probably one of the best remade movies I've ever seen.  The film is done very well and the story is told unbelievably well. Brett Ratner is becoming one of my favorite directors and I'm becoming more and more impressed with his versatility (with films like the ""Rush Hour"" films and ""The Family Man"").  I can't wait to see his next work!The cast was just fantastic in this film.  Anthony Hopkins portrays Hannibal Lecter just as excellent as he has in the past.  Edward Norton adds yet another excellent film to his already impressive list of  films.  Ralph Fiennes pulls off one of his best performances to date (if you ask me).  His character is done so well, there are times where you have to hate him, but there are other times where you really feel sorry for him.  Ralph did a fantastic job and really deserves a great deal of credit for his work. Emily Watson was a great surprise to me, she did a phenomenal job with her role and really deserves some notice for her work in this film.  Mary-Louise Parker, Harvey Keitel, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anthony Heald and Ken Leung were all excellent supporting cast members as well.  Everyone did a great job with their roles in this film.If you are a fan of the other Hannibal films, then I strongly urge you go see this film, I think (and hope) that you will like it.  If you know nothing about the Hannibal films, but are interested, this is an excellent place to start, being that this film takes place before both ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"".  If you do end up seeing the film, I sincerely hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Red Dragon
121,EmperorNortonII,"Dr. Lecter Paints ""Manhunter"" ""Red""",8,9 October 2002,"""Red Dragon"" was the first novel in Thomas Harris' ""Hannibal Lecter"" trilogy.  It was first made filmed as ""Manhunter,"" before Anthony Hopkins was cast for ""The Silence of the Lambs.""  It was ""Silence"" that established Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  So I can't help but wonder if ""Red Dragon"" was made just for the sake of featuring Hopkins' Lecter.  After all, ""Manhunter"" barely featured Dr. Lecter, as portrayed by Brian Cox.  But ""Red Dragon"" is an achievement in its own right.  At the very least, it's better than ""Hannibal.""  One improvement is that it is not so gory.  It's definitely better to leave much of the violence to the imagination, offering only a disturbing glance at the real horror.  Anthony Hopkins proves that Dr. Hannibal Lecter is his role excellently.  Ralph Fiennes turns in a disturbing performance as Dolarhyde, the ""Tooth Fairy.""  And Emily Watson is very well cast as Dolarhyde's blind love interest.  With her innocent face, she fits as a kindly but oblivious soul.  While a certain female FBI agent does not appear in this installment, her presence is made known quite cleverly.  ""Red Dragon"" may not be better than ""Silence of the Lambs,"" but it fits well with the pattern set by Hopkins.",Red Dragon
122,Rickting,"Surprise, surprise, this is actually pretty good",7,25 April 2016,"Red Dragon is the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, where another FBI agent, this time one who has some bad history with Hannibal Lecter, must seek his help to stop a serial killer. It doesn't sound promising at first, especially considering it's directed by the much maligned Brett Ratner but the final product is unexpectedly solid. It has various glaring similarities to TSOTL which are occasionally jarring and Hannibal Lecter himself feels somewhat marginalised. Anthony Hopkins is still excellent, although he seems a little weary of the role, and this time the other villain steals the show. Ralph Fiennes is excellent as the serial killer being hunted, who is a fully-rounded character and a (at times) sympathetic villain. As the lead, Edward Norton does a good job although Jodie Foster overshadows him. The film is reasonably well-made, but ultimately the layered, tense and affecting screenplay makes it a success. It still has its issues. The marginalisation of Hannibal Lecter, parallels to The Silence of the Lambs, predictable plot and frequently superficial nature make this a more standard thriller than TSOTL, and one which certainly won't be remembered nearly as much. I enjoyed it though, and it does not tarnish the legacy of the legendary original.7/10",Red Dragon

I found the atmosphere tense and on edge throughout, and think it's the movie's biggest strength. The ending was just as electric as in the book. I thought they did an effective job in providing key character context without too much pure exposition, which many movies (eg the Godfather imo) find it a difficult balance to strike.

124,Spanner-2,A solid prequel,8,7 October 2002,"This ""prequel"" to ""Silence of the Lambs"" is definitely an improvement over the campy ""Hannibal"" but not as good as the original. The film primarily works because Ed Norton is excellent in the central role as the FBI agent trying to track down a deranged killer (a weirdly demented Ralph Fiennes). Anthony Hopkins, in his signature role, returns to the role he now often seems to be playing in his sleep, but his scenes with Norton do contain some good tension and the actors play off each other fairly well. The suspense builds, despite us knowing who the killer is fairly early on. While the ending, suposedly out of the book, seems a tad pat, the film as a whole works quite well. GRADE: B+",Red Dragon

William Petersen plays a better Will Graham. But Harvey Keitel plays a better Jack Crawford. Tom Noonan played a better Francis Dolarhyde, but Anthony Hopkins plays a MUCH better Hannibal. This movie fills in the blanks where Manhunter left them wide open. There's a part in the beginning where it actually shows how Will caught Hannibal. Some scenes were souped up in this movie from the original but over all it worked out. The ending of this movie was actually played out much better than in Manhunter.

It's really got no style to it, and the direction is apt but unremarkable - much like all of Ratner's works. He's really got no distinctiveness to his direction, and the only reason why this is his best film is because of the script and the actors. The story is pretty verbatim from the book, which is pretty good, and there are no weak links among the impressive cast, but it's missing the horror and novelty of Silence.

In this movie, a deranged serial killer is killing entire families every month on the night of the full moon. Jack Crawford of the FBI calls in retired agent Will Graham to help catch the killer. Graham left the FBI after being critically wounded while capturing the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter. Now, Graham must interview Hannibal, to see if he can shed any knowledge on the case. Meanwhile, the killer struggles with himself when he begins to fall in love with a fellow employee. This movie is closer to Silence of the Lambs than Hannibal in quality and style, and therefore is more entertaining.This movie is basically a reworking of the film Manhunter, except with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal, so it connects better with the others. This movie sticks closer to the book than Manhunter did, which will please fans, except that it ads way more Hannibal Lecter interview scenes than were in the book, most likely to bank on Anthony Hopkins' name. The movie has the same suspenseful style as Silence of the Lambs, making up for the fact that Hannibal hardly had any suspense at all. The dialogue and overall fast paced style of the movie made it really worth watching, and if this movie had been released a year before Silence rather than a year after Hannibal, they would be great together. The characters are great and engaging. They seem more realistic than they were in Manhunter. I'm glad this movie managed to be far more successful than Manhunter, because I don't think I could deal with two bad Red Dragon adaptations.The acting is superb. I was kind of annoyed with Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal, because he played the role way too differently than the way he played it in Silence. Now, in this movie, he gets back to basics. Edward Norton is great as Will Graham. The role of the Red Dragon/Francis Dolarhyde was made for Ralph Fiennes. He takes the role and makes it his own. Whenever I think Ralph Fiennes now, I think Red Dragon.Overall, this is an awesome psychological thriller, and any fan of Silence of the Lambs should definitely see this movie.7/10",Red Dragon
133,room102,Average,6,27 October 2002,"Red Dragon (2002) is the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and a remake of Manhunter (1986), based on the novel Red Dragon (1981) by Thomas Harris. Actually, the movie is not as bad as I have expected. It's definitely better than the silly  money-maker called Hannibal (2001), but let's face it, producer Dino De Laurentiis didn't just re-bought the rights for the sake of art. The movie (which premieres here this weekend, btw) sticks, more or less, to the book and the plot is very similar to that of Manhunter - so if you saw the latter, don't expect many surprises. Without giving away anything of the plot, I have to say that while watching the movie I got the feeling of ""man, the screenwriter must have seen Psycho too many times"".
All in all, I'd say it's an average movie and ok for passing 2 hours. But since I didn't find Manhunter anything exceptional either, you might think otherwise. Impressive cast, that does an average acting under a (less than) average direction. Ralph Fiennes is good in his role, and something tells me that we're gonna have quite a few flashbacks when seeing Spider (2002) (broken mirror, etc.). Hmm, I just hope we won't see as much of his butt as we see in this movie :D Cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman as the reporter and Anthony Heald reprising his role as Dr. Frederick Chilton.
As usual, good score by the excellent Danny Elfman which, by the way, does not repeat any of the themes by Howard Shore (the reviewer from the test-screening, who reported otherwise, must have been drunk). Notice legendary composer Lalo Schifrin as the Conductor, right in the beginning of the movie. Don't have many expectations, and you'll have an okay time.

I wasn't expecting much given the cliff drop in quality between 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Hannibal' but this certainly peaked again, a great cast for both supporting and lead and the charm of the ""original"" and various stylistic elements still remain which are nice/unsettling to see and the new focus is refreshing. The only issue personally has to be the end where the 'final showdown' is a bit contrived and forced to seemingly tie off a loose end which was previously established. Aside from that however there's not much wrong for me personally, so on the whole a pretty good film that shifts surprisingly well despite being over 2 hours, well worth a watch",Red Dragon

He oozes evil and your just drawn to the self assurance and confidence; you constantly are wondering whats going on in his mind, but do you dare find out.All the acting is very solid, as this boast a huge cast. Edward Norton is great as usual, Ralph Fiennes is great as the tortured Dolarhyde. Keitel and Watson are good in their roles, also to Hoffman in his short role. But of course the best is Hopkins.

136,kgprophet,Why bother with this remake?,4,27 February 2005,"I avoided this film in the theatre, as well as the last sequel ""Hannibal"" (see my review). This time I waited until I could check it out for free at the library. This film is almost a shot-by-shot remake of ""Manhunter"", a far superior TV movie by Michael Mann (""Heat"", ""Collateral""). Even worse, this version fails to achieve some of the high points compared to the original. This film is just as worthless as other hack job remakes like ""Point of No Return"" or ""The Vanishing"". Those films were made because the original was a foreign language. The excuse for this film is to feature Anthony Hopkins selling out as the Man in the Cage, and also some nudity (because they CAN). Of course Hopkins, Ed Norton, and a few other actors are very good at what they do, but the writing and direction come nowhere near the excellent job in ""Manhunter"" with probably a tenth of the budget. Then comes the obligatory surprise ending that you will see coming without any great effort. That's also what made the original much better, there are no Hollywood Movie traps that you've seen a zillion times. What's more is that this movie is supposed to be a prequel, dating back over 15 years ago. That's hard to believe when Hannibal looks much older - wrinkles and all. Same goes for the the actor playing Dr. Chilton, reprising his slimy role from SOTL. He is obviously older no matter how much youthful long hair he wears. The story doesn't even try to offer anything new from the original. Many plot points are duplicated down to the dialogue and cinematography. So why bother? Certainly an objective viewer who hasn't scene the original would be entertained. Perhaps the same could be said with the ""Psycho"" remake, but you would be short-changing yourself if you wanted to see the best version. In conclusion: rent ""Manhunter"".

Red Dragon which apparently is chronologically the first of the triad, tells yet another tale of a murderous serial psycho whom the FBI can only catch with the help of Lechter. Graphic but pertinent violence instead of comic book gore, wit in place of ham and cheese smirks, and above all finally Hopkins surrounded by actors who can act. Here's one film I did not want to see end. And best of all, no politics! Just a tight thriller full of suspense horror and all that good stuff, with a wonderful cast and competent direction.

138,smakawhat,Worth seeing,7,4 October 2002,"I remember seeing the original of this film back in the mid 80's and it was titled Manhunter.  Now the film has been redone with a greater legacy of the Hanibal storyline, and some more notable actors.  I certainly remember back in the 80's seeing Manhunter and enjoyed it immensely so I was curious about this film if it could relive my great interest.  I was much younger then and wasn't sure I'd remember much other than a few key scenes.  Have my tastes perhaps changed since then?In the end it didn't really, it made me actually want to see and appreciate the original in hopes that it would spark that thrill again.  Red Dragon ends up focusing more on of course the star ""Hanibal"" as he is interrogated by an FBI agent to help stop another serial killer known as the ""Tooth Fairy"".  Hanibal on screen is once again the star, and the story is wise to focus on him since he is a character now of such great folklore.  This is where the film differs from the original where Manhunter's focus was on the FBI agent (played by Edward Norton) and his psyche in traveling through crime scenes, and getting into the killers head.  Many of those similar scenes are used in Red Dragon, but they have less effect since you wait for the great moments when Edward Norton has to face Hanibal.  Some other problems are of minor characters particularly of a sleeze tabloid journalist played by Seymour Hoffman whose acting talents are not put to potential and frankly wasted.I will admit though Red Dragon is very faithful to Manhunter, and is very suspenseful, but since I saw the other film, it ruined some of that. This also made me feel that the film also wasn't that scary.  But for those who can't get enough of Dr. Lecter (and who can't) and who never saw Manhunter, Red Dragon will surely please.Rating 7 out of 10",Red Dragon
139,Dockelektro,Hit the spot,8,5 December 2002,"Uniting the best cast of the year, the movie follows the ""Silence of the Lambs"" formula: an FBI agent that requests the help of the cunning Hannibal Lecter to catch a brutal serial killer. Of course, so the movie doesn't have the freshness of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and Anthony Hopkins is not as powerful as he was on the original movie, and this one doesn't allow us to focus enough on some of the juiciest characters. But any movie that has Ralph Fiennes as a ""Spider""-like character and Emily Watson as a sweet blind woman who questions Fiennes' character's brutality and cold blood raises the bar anytime. Brett Ratner was blessed with a fine cast but he displays a solid direction, Ted Tally's screenplay has quality to spare and Danny Elfman's score is classy enough to make this one a winner. As good as thrillers can be, this one is a fine example.",Red Dragon
140,deepfrieddodo,"Brilliant Thriller, But Less Lecter",8,12 February 2021,"A brilliant thriller but not necessarily what one would expect. A prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, the opening scenes suggest that Hannibal Lecter again would be the lead, or at least the lead villain, to the film, however it is very much just an opportunity to fit Norton's character into the storyline. Still a great film, but one with Lecter as a secondary character, not featuring that heavily throughout. Despite that, Hopkins is perfect again.Ralph Fiennes picks up as the serial killer of note, and unlike Lambs, he has heavy exposure as the film progresses. He is brilliant in his role, yet the character's psyche is really just skimmed. Some obvious past events create an understanding of the character, but if he were to get such screen time perhaps a deeper connection could have been made.The rest of the cast is star-studded too, Norton taking the lead and doing a good job, but this FBI agent isn't as engrossing as Clarice in the original. Furthermore, although a good story, everything the FBI do seems to be inconsequential to the ultimate outcome. Still a fantastic ending though.Overall the cast do well, the dialogue is interesting and the plot is engaging, it is a brilliant thriller. Yet, in comparison to the two previous films, it doesn't quite hit the same level, although this may be due to preconceptions before viewing.",Red Dragon

Will fins out that Hannibal is a serial killer that he has been on the hunt for. Hannibal Stabs him but Will stabs him with hunting arrows and shoots him 3 times.Years later Will is called upon by Jack Crawford played by Harvey Keitel to investigate the murder scenes of two family's that were murdered. The serial killer named Francis Dolarhyde played by Ralph Fiennes seems like a normal guy but really is tormented by years of abuse as a child. He is nicknamed The Tooth Fairy by a reporter named Freddy Lounds played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who will do anything for a story.Francis falls in love with a blind co-worker named Reba McClane played by Emily Watson. Another co-worker is flirting non-stop with Reba. Will goes to visit Hannibal in prison to find out information on Dolarhyde. Hannibal at first refuses but then agrees.Freddy is found by Francis and is tortured for writing lies about him. Francis then kills him. In the films climax Francis kills the other co-worker and takes Reba to his house. He lights his house on fire and seemingly Kills himself as Reba escapes just as the house explodes.Will spends the night with his wife played by Mary Louise Parker and son played by Tyler Patrick Jones. His son is then held hostage inside by Dolarhyde and to get his son back hurls insults at his son to remind Francis of the past. They have a gunfight resulting in Wills wife shooting and killing Francis.This is spectacular. I like how the film starts out as a Hannibal Lecter movie but then shifts the focus to someone else.

142,chron,A Disappointing Caricature of Silence of the Lambs,5,3 July 2003,"I was very disappointed in this movie, even going in with few expectations. There is absolutely nothing original about the plot or direction.  There are several cases where ""Silence of the Lambs"" is blatently ripped off.Anthony Hopkins did a great imitation of Anthony Hopkins doing Hanibal Lector.  The creepiness seemed a little over the top and failed to hold any interest.  The psychopathology of the Red Dragon was pop psychology at its worst.Even without seeing this movie, you have already seen it dozens of times. There's no sense spending any more time with this unoriginal garbage.  The only thing that keeps this movie from being a total dud is the performance of Edward Norton.  The fine actress, Mary-Louise Parker, is way underutilized in this movie.SPOILERS AHEADWhile I considered the movie to be unoriginal and somewhat second rate, I wouldn't consider it BAD -- until the ending.  It is certain to ruin the ending when the antagonist is apparently dead and rises to strike ""one more time"".  And who do they go after?  Why the protagonist's family of course. Sheesh.  That has been done to death for decades now. Dozens of movie endings have been ruined by this populist garbage.  Movies should be written by writers, not audience polling data.",Red Dragon

Fiennes does a great job.One thing that's really nice is they have a blind lady character who's actually treated like a real life human, with normal desires that a woman her age would have. Hollywood almost invariably writes characters with disabilities as being kind angelic sages and such, which is incredibly dehumanizing.The acting is solid. Norton plays his casual thing which I personally am not enamored with, but it works here.Some aspects of the plot seem far fetched, like Dolarhyde and Lecter sending messages to each other. I assume that's in the original book, I don't know, but it's weird because not only is it implausible, this is pretty much a switcheroo. Usually nutters like this think they are sending/receiving messages through newspapers and such. Here, the FBI believes that, and it's not clear Dolarhyde is even aware of it.The dinner party at the beginning is kind of humorous, but contains some badly on the nose dialog. I think the vast majority of the audience got what was going on without any wink-winks, and if they didn't, they would be clueless as to why these people are talking so strangely anyway.",Red Dragon

Excellent performances all across the board. Edward Norton gives another top-notch performance. Anthony Hopkins IS Hannibal Lecter, no question about it. What most impressed me, though, was Ralph Fiennes an Emily Watson. The chemistry between them was very humane and Fiennes was very convincing as the mentally disturbed psychopath. While the easily overseeable Ted Levine was given little screen time and no motive in Silence, his character was given little conviction and didn't jump off the screen. In Red Dragon, Fiennes is given ample screen time and the audience feels sympathy for him.

147,Darkjak007,An underrated prequel do you see? do you see?,7,24 March 2021,"Red dragon stars Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes. It is a remake to the movie Manhunter and a prequel to The silence of the lambs. Edward Norton plays FBI agent named Will Graham who after capturing Hannibal Lecter. 12 months later reluctantly ask for lecters help in tracking down a new serial killer called the tooth fairy. While the film has a similar plot to silence of the lambs it does stand out enough. Will's an agent who has more of a advance perspective on serial killers which gives them more of an advantage on capturing them compared to Clarice was a rookie start it off. He also offers a different kind of chemistry between him and Lecter which comes off more of a professional hatred relationship. Unlike Clarice will has a long history with Lecter, doesn't not wish to fall down and narrow path. Lecter past gives he more of advantage because he already knows how to push Will manipulate him, but the same time wills not completely vulnerable to his charms and tricks the same as Clarice. The Serial killer the tooth fairy is all around a tragic of a character A victim of abuse at the hands of his grandmother. You feel sympathetic for the guy in their scenes where he meets up with his coworker played by Emily Watson she's blind and doesn't really can't judge him on his appearance but goes off of his personality. This is where you feel sympathetic for him until you realize a scene later he's Bites a guys tongue out and let's light them on fire. It gives him more of face then he's just a crazy guy. Similar to lambs the film has a somber tone to it with moments of at suspension and tension when you first see the image of the red dragon you can tell that there is a story behind this painting. While still offering fresh scenes Without coming off as stale when will goes to see Lecter for the first time. The camera going down the hallway similar to lambs he's not standing there waiting for him he's just laying down but at the same time you still feel an urge of suspense. The second he's starts talking you know he's going to try to dissect his brain. The one major Problem of this movie is that it's certain parts it does feel like it starts to draw on. There's scenes that just consist of dialogue that you feel is not really important.it's just padded out the movie.

I think he was great in the Francis Dolarhyde role here.  Excellent cinematography, acting and a good script make for very enjoyable viewing.  I admit to being a bit tired of the whole ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" theme at this point (Hopkins seemed a bit bored too), but this movie was a treat.  Unfortunately I was feeling sick for part of it and had to leave to use the men's room during several interesting scenes -- I'll certainly rent it again when it comes out on DVD to catch what I missed.Could have used Tom Sizemore somewhere in here (another favorite I first really noticed in ""Strange Days""), but this movie is solid filmmaking... fell short of greatness, and like many I'd put it in between ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"" -- certainly closer to ""Silence"" in overall quality, minus the campiness and with a real sense of menace.

Norton is one of the best actors of our days, and he clearly proves it here.The movie is quite strange if you think of it again...I mean, do you know any other movie which went ""backwards"" in a sequel? I haven't. And another exception is that this sequel, though not better than the original(so I've heard) is much, much better than Hannibal. The story is interesting, and I doubt many will say it's boring. After an explosive beginning, the real terror starts. Most of you know what Dr. Lecter's profile looks like...a mad genius? Maybe genius isn't the proper word, but anyway, something in that direction. Well, we still have some ""nice"" characters...there would be D, who is the killer. He reminded me of the one and only Norman Bates(Psycho). The fact that a kind of monster has control over him isn't very original, but it sticks great to the plot. This D, is a person who is the result of his grandmother...better would be, if we would say the murderer is the result. Anyway, we still have one great character, Reba.

Anthony Hopkins returns for one final round as the sinister Dr. Hannibal Lecter who is as terrifying as ever a decade after first appearing on- screen in 'Silence of the Lambs.' His opponent is former Special Agent Will Graham, brought to life by the ever talented Edward Norton displaying a vulnerability exploited by Lecter's mind games. Rounding out the twisted triangle is the film's main villain, Francis Dolarhyde cruelly dubbed 'The Tooth Fairy' by the tabloids, eerily and frighteningly portrayed by Ralph Fiennes displaying a sadistic personality so unsettling that Hopkins' Lecter is tame compared to him. The plot is fairly straightforward in its adaptation from Thomas Harris' novel. Will Graham is forced out of retirement when Jack Crawford (portrayed this time by Harvey Keitel) tells him of a deranged serial killer who brutally slaughtered two families in Georgia and Alabama. Graham resorts to asking the incarcerated killer (thanks to Graham himself) Dr. Hannibal Lecter for assistance, yet Lecter makes cryptic allusions in his intellectual fashion to the identity of the murderer the FBI seeks.Overall a solid sequel that stands up well against the original film that put Lecter in the spotlight, but it's not better than 'Silence.'",Red Dragon

I had my doubts about this movie, having heard that it was a rather cheap rehash of ""Silence of the Lambs"". While it's not nearly as good as Silence of the Lambs (but what is, anyway), it's far superior to 2001's mediocre ""Hannibal"" and also a pretty good movie in its own right.Where ""Silence"" focused on the relation between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, this movie focuses much more on the serial killer that is still on the loose (Ralph Fiennes). OK, there are some conversations between FBI Agent Graham (Edward Norton) and Lecter, but these aren't that interesting by themselves. Fiennes' character, Francis Dollarhyde, on the other hand, is definitely one of the more fascinating and disturbing psychos to have ever appeared in a movie: equally as sick as Hannibal Lecter, but also horribly confused, ambivalent and vulnerable. The story isn't the best I've ever seen, but it holds up without any huge plot holes. The acting is universally top-notch (what would you expect with a cast like this) and the directing very good, although the suspense could have been built a bit better at times. Two thumbs up for the music, though.
All in all, this movie kept my captivated from start to finish without a single boring moment and without breaking my suspension of disbelief for a single moment. It's not THE most suspenseful or brillaint movie out there, but it's way above average. *** out of **** stars",Red Dragon

The Lector franchise is already far past its prime due to 2001's flop of a sequel Hannibal. Why Director Brett Ratner would want to re-visit the Lector franchise, much less remake one of its films alludes me. The story is also also eerily similar to The Silence of the Lambs.

This movie should of been brilliant with names like Norton,Hopkins, Keitel and Fiennes. On some levels it succeeds on being better than Manhunter as one could say that their is a lot more emotional depth to the movie. Ed Norton once again shows why he is one of favourite characters with his troubled and traumatised take on Will Graham whilst Hopkins feels a little bored with his Hannibal Lector role although still amusing , he is given very little to play with. The Dolarhyde over here is played well by Fiennes as it shows the complex nature of the character which was great and the audience in a way can empathise with him. The film wastes no time getting into the action and just like Manhunter moves at a constant and consistent pace. The only problem is that a weak script makes it feel that all the characters have very little to work with which kind of makes it at the end of the day a kind of predictable thriller compared to Manhunter which had a sharp edge to it. To be honest Manhunter could of been brilliant however a weak script makes it a basic movie , although it is enjoyable a worth a check it just feels like a let down due to all the potential it carries although in some ways it is better than Manhunter but then it others it is not.RED DRAGON - 8.0 OUT OF 10BEFORE THE SILENCE, MEET HANNIBAL LECTOR FOR THE FIRST TIME...",Red Dragon

157,Brogan,In the beginning...,9,2 October 2002,"Sixteen years ago, I guess famous film producer Dino DeLaurentiis felt that a psychological thriller about a retired federal agent going into the mind of a serial killer, called MANHUNTER, wasn't that intresting.  Then five years latter, the follow up to that film, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, won every major catageory for the Academy Awards (remember that acceptance speech, Director Jonathan Demme gave saying ""uh"" sixty some times?)  Then when Tom Harris published the third in the series, HANNIBAL, DeLaurentiis scooped up the bidding and made HANNIBAL one of the most successful ""R"" rated box office grosses of all time. Now ninteen months later, DeLaurentiis feels that going back to the beginning of the Hannibal Trilogy will make more money, eventhough his studio produced the film adaptation of the first of Harris' novel.  Since Dino feels that the public WANTS to see Sir Anthony Hopkins put on that grey jump suit, slick his hair back, and givethat errie stare as he has that wicked smirk.  RED DRAGON, the latest film adaptation of the Lecter trilogy is the prquel to SILENCE and HANNIBAL.  Similar how PHANTOM MENACE and TEMPLE OF DOOM are to A NEW HOPE and RAIDERS. Here's the story, in case you haven't seen MANHUNTER or read the novel. Retired federal agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) is asked by former boss and friend, Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) to do a research on two grisly murders in Southern U.S.  Both crimes had the entire family murdered with grotesque results.  Graham trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together by thinking like the murder is still lost and confused in some parts.  So to get answers to difficult questions, Graham seeks the assistance of the serial killer he captured and nearly lost his life from years eariler, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  Lecter, as usual, gives riddles as clues, as he tries to minipulate personal answers from the authority figure questioning him.  Yet, unlike Agent Clarice Starling, Will Graham is no pushover, and doesn't trust or rely on Lecter for anything but the serial killer's identification. The viewer is then given the story of a physical and emotional tourtered young man, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Finnes).  A quiet and isolated man who usually keeps to himself, until he befriends a blind photo developer, Reba McClane (Emily Watson), who turns Francis into a more social person and a little more open.  But there are very dark secrets and mysteries that lie within Francis that is very terrifying to reveal. Now the big question, how is RED DRAGON compared to SILENCE and HANNIBAL?  And how is RED DRAGON compared to Michael Mann's MANHUNTER? Let me start off with the first one, how is the film in the Anthony Hopkins Lecter trilogy.  This was a very well done and great thriller. It's not as exciting or intense as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it's not as grotesque or at times as silly as HANNIBAL.  RED DRAGON has more of the mood and feeling that SILENCE has with focusing more on the federal agent trying to uncover the serial killer's identity than hunting down the known killer and uncovering his whereabouts.  Like SILENCE, Lecter isn't a major character but more of a strong supporting.  Lecter is given his screen time, but Graham and Dolarhyed are also given their screen time, a little more than the ""Cannibal."" Now how is RED DRAGON compared to MANHUNTER?  Well, the best way to describe it is by doing a Shakespeare comparison.  Think of the Franco Zeferill's 1968 version of ROMEO & JULLIETT and the 1996 Baz Lurhman's ROMEO & JULLIETT.  One version was very faithful to the characters, costumes, setting that was written around the peorid when Shakespeare wrote it. While the other focused more on the plot, dialogue, and characters as the Shakespeare classic, yet made it more stylish and flamboyant.  While Michael Mann's MANHUNTER is more of the Lurhman's ROMEO & JULLIETT by telling the RED DRAGON story very stylish, and flamboyant.  Brett Ratner's RED DRAGON, is more faithful and loyal to the original writing of the Thomas Harris novel. There are the comparisons, now how is the movie?  I really enjoyed this version of the RED DRAGON story more than I expected to.  After seeing some half-hearted remakes done lately of classic films (i.e. PSYCHO, DOWN TO EARTH (Heaven Can't Wait), etc.)  It is definitly one of the better adaptations or remakes done recently.  But it is obvious that screenwriter Ted Tally (who wrote the screenplay for SILENCE) and director Ratner tried to put Dr. Lecter in the film as much as possible, giving the audience what they want.  As many scenes with Hannibal Lecter in it.  But the story is more about Agent Will Graham, than Dr. Lecter. But the acting in RED DRAGON is very well done.  Edward Norton does a great job as Agent Will Graham, proving that Norton is still, one of the best actors working in Hollywood today.  Ralph Finnes does a great turn as a villian being very quiet yet gives that haunting look on his face, the same expression we've seen from him as Amon Goeth in SCHINDLER'S LIST.  There is even a excellent personal conflict scene that Finnes acts out excellent. The supporting cast of Keitel, Parker, Watson are also good.  And I couldn't think of a better actor than Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing the sleezing Tattler reporter Freddy Lounds.  And of course, Hopkins gives another great performance as Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins most popular role.  But I feel that people should also remember Hopkins in other great performances in AMASTAD and ELEPHANT MAN than just Dr. Lecter. I enjoyed the musical score from Danny Elfman.  And I was so pleased to see that Dante Spinotti who was the cinematographer for the original MANHUNTER, returns to do the cinematography for this film as well. However, without Michael Mann present, the painter is present, but the visualist isn't.  Making the look of RED DRAGON not as mesmorizing or as beautiful as MANHUNTER was. Which is why I would still lean towards MANHUNTER more than RED DRAGON. The look and style of MANHUNTER appealed to me more than RED DRAGON did. But don't get me wrong, in this season of summer left-overs and horrible fall releases (i.e. BALLISTIC & THE TUXEDO).  RED DRAGON will sure to please the film public and those who love Dr. Lecter.  Like what other comments are said, it will get people back into the Lecter mood again.  But for people like me, it would get you in the mood to watch MANHUNTER and compare and contrast the two films.  RED DRAGON, a smuge below as good as SILENCE, but quite a bit better than HANNIBAL.

158,Alex-372,Pales In Comparison To Manhunter,6,22 May 2005,"Judged on its own, Red Dragon is a pretty good horror and profiling procedural.The problem comes when you compare it to the original film of Thomas Harris' book ""Red Dragon"", Manhunter. If you do, it is like dying a death of a thousand cuts. Nearly every scene, every character cast is inferior to that 1986 masterpiece made by Miami Vice director Michael Mann, and starring William Petersen, Tom Noonan and Brian Cox. Some of the lines in the movie Red Dragon aren't even based on the book, but are lifted directly from Manhunter, and even Silence Of The Lambs. How lame and uninspired can you get? Tom Noonan literally towers over Ralph Fiennes, who is an otherwise passable actor. Fiennes imbues his Dollarhyde character with the personality of Norman Bates, and a little of his other psychopath role, Spider, thrown in. Noonan gave his character far more depth, and had a far greater physical presence. William Petersen (Gil Grissom in the original CSI) was far more troubled and highly strung than Edward Norton manages to work himself up to be. Secretly, Graham isn't just damaged goods because of his encounter with Lector - his real secret is that he loves to kill, like Lector and all his other prey. Philip Seymour Hoffman in other movies is a superior actor to Stephen Lang (Crime Story, Manhunter), but somehow he doesn't add anything to the Freddy Lounds role. Graham's wife, Mary-Louise Parker, is simply blown away by the quiet elegance and class of Kim Greist. David Seaman as Graham's young son (called Kevin in Manhunter, but in this movie for no reason he is called Josh) had a clear eyed, innocent freshness that Tyler Patrick Jones doesn't have - the scene between Graham and his son in the supermarket is missing too. Harvey Keitel - well neither he or Dennis Farina matched Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford (""the stoic"" as Lecter describes him), however Farina was a real life cop and had a certain attitude that an aging Keitel simply doesn't have. And bringing back Anthony Heald as dr. Chilton was a real disaster - the guy is a lot fatter than in Silence Of The Lambs (1991), and to top it all off, he even makes the same pass at Will Graham as he did at Clarice Starling. Does dr. Chilton swing both ways? Or did the director just want Heald to relive the glory days that were Silence Of The Lambs? I did like Emily Watson, although not as pretty as Joan Allen, she does have a certain ""it"". And Allen almost had a German accent in Manhunter - what was all that about? The score of Manhunter is superior to the almost absent soundtrack of Red Dragon. Also, Florida's subtropical beaches and pastel lighting simply cannot be recreated in rainy, moss covered England. One of the minor characters (the janitor who walks by Lecter's cell) even has a cockney accent. They cannot hide that they are shooting in Britain, not Florida. Shot for shot, Red Dragon is inferior to Manhunter, even though Dante Spinotti was again part of the production. Too many scenes where just there to give Anthony Hopkins some on screen time. On the other hand, too many other scenes (like Will Graham's hotel room scene) were rushed through.My advice is, despite the 1980s feel of the original, despite the sometimes gimmicky acting, if you have the choice, see Manhunter instead.",Red Dragon
159,HelloTexas11,another captivating chapter,7,17 December 2007,"'Red Dragon,' the third of the Hannibal films based on Thomas Harris' books, is probably the least of the three, but not by much. It's still a wonderfully acted and directed thriller with much to recommend it. All things considered, the movie is a lot better than it has any right being. First of all, 'Red Dragon,' the novel, is the worst of Harris' first three Hannibal books. Not that it's poorly written, but the protagonist, Will Graham, is such a miserable and unhappy character that it's difficult for the reader to care about him. His personal life is a shambles and the gift he possesses to solve heinous crimes brings him no joy or satisfaction. There is also the problem of this being the first book, so as a film it is a prequel to the others. Anthony Hopkins is eleven years older than he was in 'Silence of the Lambs' and yet Hannibal Lecter is supposed to be younger than he was in that film. And a new director was on board (Brett Ratner); it seemed unlikely he would do as well with the material as either Jonathan Demme or Ridley Scott. However, lightning struck a third time and this installment compares favorably with the first two. A number of savvy decisions made the book's transition to the screen successful. Edward Norton's Will Graham is similar to the book's character but not identical. The self-torment that became grating in the novel has been toned down considerably and generally replaced with a more sympathetic kind of self-doubt. Graham's wife is not happy about him going on another assignment after almost being killed by Lecter the last time out, though she too is more understanding, and there is a genuine rapport between the couple. The problem of Hannibal's age is not immediately an issue; in two or three scenes, Hopkins seems to struggle to get inside the character, particularly his speech patterns. At other times, he is perfect. It is something of a distraction but certainly not a fatal one. (Another returning character, Anthony Heald's Dr. Chilton, is almost absurdly enhanced with wig, heavy facial make-up and lip gloss in order to make him look younger.) The opening scene where Lecter and Graham have their violent confrontation is exquisitely played by both men (as is the dinner scene just preceding); the acting for the most part is fine. Ralph Fiennes plays the mentally disturbed 'Tooth Fairy' killer Francis Dolarhyde and Emily Watson, the blind co-worker Reba McClane that he has a brief relationship with. Again, the film improves on the book by some helpful editing and economizing, and both actors are well-suited for their roles. The scenes between Lecter and Graham are very reminiscent of the ones in 'Silence of the Lambs' between Lecter and Clarice Starling, right down to the 'offers' made by the FBI agents in exchange for Lecter's assistance and insight. It strikes me as ironic that 'Hannibal,' the second film, has a reputation for being the most gruesome of the three, when it seems obvious that distinction belongs to 'Red Dragon.' And the third film is lacking the low-key, black humor that distinguished the first two. But overall, 'Red Dragon' is an intelligent, smoothly-paced thriller that feels very much a part of the same world as 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Hannibal.'",Red Dragon
160,Dragonsouls,"An amazing film, right up there with Silence of the Lambs",8,8 October 2002,"It took a while after I left the theatre to decide on which was the better, more intense, and suspensful thriller. So I decided to throw on my SOTL dvd right after watching Red Dragon. Silence was definatly better but Red Dragon is almost as good. The exchanges between Graham and Lecter, were not as deep as the ones with Clarice. I also thought that Lecter's role was limited in RD, he only appeared in about 5 or 6 scenes. The prologue being his longest, about 10 minutes. However, Hannibal was once again played brilliantly by Hopkins to prove that Hannibal Lecter is the best fictional character in movieland. This movie had all the intensity and edge of your seat moments as silence did. Gore? not as much as the comic bookish ""Hannibal"" but that was a different movie. Red Dragon had a surprising ending, and Ralph Fiennes' character was much better than Buffalo Bill, played by Ted Levine. I thought Ralph Fiennes should win an Oscar, He definatly stole the show, even though Ed Norton wasn't bad, just too bland. To sum it up, Red Dragon gets 4 stars ****, The best Psycological thriller since Silence of the Lambs.",Red Dragon

While not criticizing the first to any real extent I just preferred the pace of this movie. It really held my attention from minute one.

And the most stupid thing is, they replaced Jodie Foster for Edward Norton- WHAT THE HELL!!!!! Norton doesn't give the mood and carry any sustainable energy the way Foster did in Lambs. Another aspect that got on my nerves was the fact that it was a fifteen. At least keep the faith of the rating like Lambs. But honestly don't bother waisting your time over this crap.

The background score makes the film even more chilling and haunting. And the climax of the film is just next level. Fans of psychological thrillers should not miss this gem.,Red Dragon
165,johnny-08,'Remarkable boy. I do admire your courage. I think I'll eat your heart. ',8,10 July 2008,"After watching this movie I have to get ""Manhunter"", the only movie about Hannibal Lecter I haven't seen. Also after watching this one I officially declare that this is the best Hannibal movie right after untouchable ""The Silence of the Lambs"". What I liked in ""Red Dragon"" is its great script, very good acting and music from master Danny Elfman. While ""Hannibal"" takes Hannibal Lecter in the world, this movie keeps him in his familiar surrounding - cell with unbreakable glass and those spooky drawer. It also seems that in that cell Anthony Hopkins played one of his best roles in the entire career. He's scary, frightening and dangerous but yet so well mannered and with great phrases and accent coming from his mouth. Here, the object of our attention is not on the Hannibal, but on young detective Will Graham who is trying to catch a murderer called 'The Tooth Fairy'. Graham is the man who put Hannibal behind glass (in his case) and Graham seeks help from Hannibal in order to catch a killer. Edward Norton is that detective and he played his part well, with no ups or downs. I think that we all know that Norton is one of the most talented actors of his generation (Johnny Depp & co.). What is truly brilliant is acting of Ralph Fiennes and specially Emily Watson. Too a true movie fans of course that this is not a surprise, cause both of them are actors with huge capacity. I really liked the whole story about 'The Tooth Fairy'. Yes, tormented childhood is nothing new, but his tattoo and connection to a dragon from Blake picture is great, just like his madness (don't get me wrong, I'm still under the impression of Fiennes powerful acting when he's about to kill Freddy Lounds or when he holds Reba in ring of fire). Also, the whole story with Reba is very important, cause she was the only reason he didn't kill more families. He fell in love and that was the only good thing in him. Even monsters fell in love, but at the end his dark 'dragon' side overcome. Really a topic to talk about.The whole ending is suitable, as we found out that Agent Clarice Starling is visiting Hannibal. And what's next? Well, I would say a movie classic or at least a thriller classic, ""The Silence of the Lambs"". If you wanna' watch it, make sure that you first watch ""Red Dragon"", cause it's a great start.",Red Dragon
166,datorsiers2,Out classes the original,9,10 December 2015,"The remake of Michael Mann's 1986 ""Manhunter"" proves us that rarely a remake can be better than the original. I was happily surprised after watching ""Red Dragon"". It was just far more superior overall in comparison to ""Manhunter"".Here we got a lot more details on the case than before, some cleverly altered scenes and stories and last, but not least, a better vibe. Acting can't be comparable, the cast for this movie was just upper class, especially outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins(Hannibal Lecter) and Edward Norton(Will Graham). Other roles were filled with significantly stronger actors too. The thing that i really loved was Dr. Lecter getting way more screen time, in ""Manhunter"" he barely got his time under the spotlight, hence his character felt kind of insignificant. To be honest Dr. Lecter is the main reason people love this franchise and i can only associate Anthony Hopkins with Hannibal Lecter and in my opinion that is a huge plus for the remake, in ""Manhunter"" Lecter's performance wasn't really enjoyable and it is not how we remember Dr. Lecter.Not to mention the great ending alteration here, the original had a very dull ending for a crime/ thriller film, here we got to feel the suspense and thrill that the first film lacked. Also i love i how it really tries to be a prequel of ""The Silence of the Lambs"", hence giving us some more insight on maybe some unanswered questions about ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Finally we saw how Hannibal Lecter got caught, which always was a factor of curiosity.Overall much better than the original, this is a good depiction of how ""Manhunter"" should have went, it would make an awesome correlation with ""The Silence of the Lambs"", hence making the franchise even greater. Unfortunately ""Manhunter, although it was not bad by any means, is going to be left aside, because nobody likes to associate the Hannibal Lecter franchise with those actors.",Red Dragon
167,ilovedolby,"Good Film; Little Gore, and Scares!!!",7,4 October 2002,"I was certainly expecting to see a lot more gore, and spooks in this film. Afterall, what would one expect after seeing HANNIBAL, which I did like very much, by the way. This film, however, most people are comparing to be more reminiscent of Silence Of The Lambs. I have Silence... (on tv), and it did really bother me. But as my girlfriend told me then, it's nothing like watching the theatrical, unedited version of the film. So, with Red Dragon I was expecting things that would absolutly discust me. Quite the contrary. It has it's disturbing moments which make a person shudder. And it is a bit gory at times, but all in all, if you could stand Kiss The Girls, then Red Dragon sholdn't be a problem. Does it live up to the hype? Yes, and no. Yes in the fact that you do see Hannibal Lecture, and his beginnings. No in the fact that you don't see too much violence, which is to be anticipated after watching Hannibal. Most critics, and some people agree that Hannibal isn't great like Silence... I guess they are right. After all, Silence... dealt with a much more intricite plot, and characters. However, Hannibal was extremely well done. I must applaud Riddley Scott's direction, and his use of colors in the film. Red Dragon is more like Silence... in it's direction, and plot. But not as in depth as Silence...was. Perhaps that's because of Lecture's intrigue with Starling in Silence...and Hannibal. Overall, Red Dragon is a good film and worth a see. Perhaps it will leave some disappointed because of the lack of violence. And it obviouse to me that director, Bret Ratner could have definetly made some scenes in this film very disturbing and violent, but chose not to. This is to be commended as far as I am concerned. As much as I love Hannibal, and Silence..., perhaps the violence isn't necessary to tell a good story. And I think that is what Bret Ratner is trying to get across here. Check it out!",Red Dragon
168,Slarkshark,Ominous Thriller Prequel,8,20 December 2020,"A very respectable prequel to 'Silence of the Lambs'. We get to meet the man who put Hannibal the Cannibal behind bars, then utilizes his ultra intelligent mind to catch a new and sadistic killer. But as we all know, Dr. Lecter speaks in riddles and does not offer his opinions freely, there's always an angle, almost for his own amusement. And above all else, he is bitter and craves vengeance. Therefore we get to see a different side of Dr. Lecter then in 'Silence of the Lambs'.'Red Dragon' introduces us to a character we are already well acquainted with, but we get to see Edward Norton play as Will Graham, and Ralph Fiennes as the seriously disturbed Red Dragon. I thought Norton did well, though I can't comment too much or compare with previous adaptations as i haven't seen 'Manhunter' or read the book. Fiennes was excellent and I have to think this helped him win the role for Voldemort a couple years later.This isn't as good as 'Silence of the Lambs' but let's be real, that is a very high bar. This does stand well enough on it's own for sure though. It's a well put together serial killer thriller to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.",Red Dragon

However, his performances keep going more and more over the top. Why would anybody fear this clown? The hack director copies entire scenes and camera angles from the original movie.

In 2002's ""Red Dragon"", Hopkins plays the part he's famous for, but he looks much too old this time. The movie is a prequel to SOTL but was made 11 years later so you can see the problem. Plus the lekter character in RD has no charm at all; he's still brilliant but mainly comes across an evil, ugly, old man instead of the civilized monster we all loved. Edward Norton plays a cop who enlists lekter to help him solve a crime, but he's miscast. He looks like a dweeb and talks with a lisp and is not a worthy adversary to the great lekter.Ralph Fiennes plays the serial killer loony and he's outstanding and his blind girl friend played by Emily Watson is OK too.A pretty good show really but not a 10 like SOTL.",Red Dragon

You start to realize that the cast that looked so good on paper suddenly seems wrong; Edward Norton looking dazed, pragmatic; Ralph Fiennes unsure of what kind of monster he is.

172,fredericksmith1952,"This remake of Manhunter is the first of two prequels to the Hannibal Lector saga, and there are some marked differences in the visions of Ratner and Mann.",10,27 February 2012,"This remake of Manhunter is the first of two prequels to the Hannibal Lector saga, and there are some marked differences in the visions of Ratner and Mann. Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal Lector, and his vicious and brutal nature are more pronounced here that in the previous two films. Perhaps it is his hatred of Will Graham, played brilliantly by Edward Norton, perhaps it is his blossoming hatred of Dr. Chilton, the second appearance of Anthony Heald in the role. Frankie Faison also reprises his role as Barney, the nurse. Harvey Keitel's vision of Jack Crawford is an interesting shift from Scott Glenn's portrayal, with Keitel being a more emotional agent, but that may be a sign of maturity from the days of this film to SOTL. While I am a big fan of Michael Mann, I have to say this film is a more complete picture of the events, and a much more in depth look at the characters, particularly of Lector. Ralph Fiennes gives a spectacular performance as the Tooth Fairy, and Emily Watson's portrayal of the blind Reba McClane is passionate and very human. We have a glimpse also of Lecter before he was incarcerated in the flashback scenes between Hopkins and Norton, as well as the interaction of the two in Lecter's exercise room. Rated R and they mean it. Much too grisly and bloody for the little ones, and some teens and adults will find the settings and the gore disturbing. Collectible for lovers of Hopkins, Hannibal Lector, and anyone who loves a good horror story.",Red Dragon
173,Benjamin_Cox,A dark and creepy swansong for Dr Lecter - 77%,7,28 December 2004,"When is a sequel not a sequel? When it's a prequel, of course! Despite more than a decade passing since we first met Dr Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", we meet him again for the first time here in ""Red Dragon"". Only, we haven't because this is the same story as the first Lecter movie made which was ""Manhunter"" (1986). So welcome to the fourth Lecter movie, Hopkin's third portrayal of the cannibalistic scientist and the first story to feature the great man. Confused yet?""Red Dragon"" follows the pursuit of a deranged serial killer dubbed the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) who disposes of his victims in a quite gruesome manner, as you'd expect from a Thomas Harris book. Leading the chase is FBI psychological profiler Wil Graham (Edward Norton) but despite several clues, the chase gets nowhere. Until Graham is forced to confront the last man he wants to see and the only man who can help him with the case - Lecter, played once again by Anthony Hopkins. Soon, Graham is putting himself and those around him in danger in order to capture the killer, who grows more confident with each kill.There's no point in pretending that ""Red Dragon"" does anything new - it was written in 1981, after all. But despite being the only Lecter book I've actually read, I did enjoy this film. Not because I know how it ends (although this does take some of the shine off) but because the film sticks to the book quite well. Hopkins over-acts a little during his scenes, trying to recapture the old ""Lambs"" magic but it's starting to wear a little thin. No, for me, Norton and Fiennes deserve top billing as both men bring an unexpected emotional dimension to their roles. Watson also does well, though she isn't too convincing at being blind.One possible gripe is that the tension you get reading the book is replaced by a couple of ""ghost-train"" moments, the sort that most serial killer movies favour. But by and large, I thought they worked well. The vision of the book was well realised, although I don't remember Lecter's scene in the exercise yard at all - they probably included a bit more Lecter than was originally written. Hopkins does take top billing but he's a peripheral character here, little more than a reminder of the Lecter movies of the past. I suspect that this movie is a stop-gap until the role can be filled again. Hopkins has said that this will be his last appearance as Lecter but I'm willing to bet that we'll see the good doctor one last time in the future. A shame, really, that there will be another failed attempt at recapturing the glory days of Buffalo Bill and Clarice Starling. ""Red Dragon"" is a perfectly good thriller which will take you on a dark journey through the minds of twisted genius. But it is not another ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" and unless they risk falling into a franchise rut, they will need to take care in future. As a stand-alone, ""Red Dragon"" is as good an example of a cop thriller as I can think of. Despite knowing winks to its heritage, this is a rare example of a thriller that actually thrills. But by constantly playing to the past, it does suffer a trifle in comparison.",Red Dragon

Of course this would be an exaggeration but there are so many good things one can say about 'Red Dragon' that comparison with 'Silence of the Lambs' is inevitable.First of all the clever script. This is a prequel so the writer used this element, to create a movie very similar to the original but also completely new. James Cameron says that a successful sequel has to be just like the first movie, but different.The other strong element here is the ensemble cast. It's really impressive, just take a look at the credits.Another strong element compared to the previous movies, is that 'Red Dragon' is really sick. Excellent acting makes this one really get to you.

176,senortuffy,Worthy addition to the series.,8,31 August 2003,"This is a remake of ""Manhunter"" (1986), the first in the series of films centering on FBI profilers, serial killers, and the infamous Hannibal Lecter, who I suppose is the modern day equivalent of Jack the Ripper.  I haven't read the novel by Thomas Harris so I can't say which is the more authentic, but they're both very good films.As in the original, ""Red Dragon"" centers around the character of Will Graham, a retired FBI profiler who is brought back to help find a serial killer that is preying on women with families.  He kills once a month in sync with the lunar cycle, so Graham has time to investigate the two crime scenes and look for evidence that would indicate who the next target is.Also as in the original, Hannibal Lecter is a supporting figure, not the main attraction, though Anthony Hopkins certainly chews up the scenery in a performance he's gotten quite good at.  Edward Norton plays Will Graham, and he turns in a strong performance.  The movie doesn't play up his character as much as ""Manhunter"" did for William L. Petersen, but that's just a style difference in the directors. 
Ralph Fiennes plays the killer, Frances Dollarhyde, and he's downright creepy.  Michael Mann cast one of his favorites, Tom Noonan, as Dollarhyde in the original, and he played the part more as a cypher, not a real person. Here, the killer is developed more and you see why he became such a twisted figure.  Think Norman Bates on steroids.When Michael Mann made ""Manhunter"" in 1986, he was at the peak of his success with ""Miami Vice"" and the movie reflected that genre, with hip characters and rock & roll music on the soundtrack.  Who could forget the ending when Will Graham crashes through the window while ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" is blasting away.   Here, Brett Ratner (the ""Rush Hour"" films) directs ""Red Dragon"" as a more traditional suspense film without the flashiness of Mann's creation.

Ralph Fiennes has trouble with mastering an American accent but otherwise his performance is flawless. The movie seems a bit long but it holds you the entire time.

Some series veterans (Heald, Faison) reprise their roles rather well, while Hopkins is once again magnificent as Hannibal.

Rush Hour, the movie he made before, is pure action and a horror-movie like this needs more ""inner tension"". Directing rap-movies is something quite different from directing horror-movies. The novel by Thomas Harris ""Manhunter (1986)"" is based on experiences by the author at the trial of the ""Monster of Florence"", so it is based on real facts and it deserved another director. The actors are good: Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins is less convincing than in ""Silence of the Lambs""), Will Graham (Edward Norton) is quite a professional policeman who can trap Hannibal Lector and Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) is a good chief of police but was he the right cast?  Red Dragoon/Tooth Fairy/Francis Dolarhyde is a right cast. Without doubt the blind girl Reba McLane (Emily Watson) was the right choice and it is an idea rather well explored in the movie: the blind innocence against the evil of a sick mind.

Years later, he is brought out of early retirement to pursue another killer (Ralph Fiennes), who is courting his next victim, a blind woman (Emily Watson). But can Graham retain his sanity? This is the second attempt to film the Harris novel, the first being 1986's ""Manhunter"", directed by Michael Mann.Critique -- Although ""Red Dragon"" isn't a bad film by any means, it's one of the most unnecessary major releases of the last decade. The same story was told in Mann's 1986 film, which was flawed but had more life and energy than this rework. As a stand-alone movie, it's adequate enough, but at this point the formula is getting stale. Brett Ratner (""Rush Hour"") does a competent job behind the camera, but he is clearly the weakest director to helm a film featuring the good doctor. He does not generate quite enough tension or atmosphere to sustain a two hour movie. This must be Edward Norton's weakest performance by far; after he lit up the screen in ""Fight Club"" and ""American History X"", it's a shame to see him sleepwalk through a role. Anthony Hopkins is okay, but at this point he must be getting tired of playing this character. The supporting performances fare somewhat better, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman as a sleazy tabloid publisher.The storyline is still intelligent and literate; there is a much-welcome opening scene showing exactly how Lector was caught (only referred to by dialouge in Mann's version), but it's clear that the whole project is just a commercial endeavor. Critics thrashed Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal"", but that film at least had a freshness that this one lacks. I can only pray that Michael Bay doesn't have anything to do with the next entry.Rating: 6/10 or (**1/2)Released by Universal Pictures",Red Dragon

If you'd read both scripts, you'd find Red Dragon's to be much lengthier and that pinpoints the nature of the film. Overwritten! Every single piece of the puzzle is overly explained to the audience, you don't get the feeling the characters are talking to one another but to the viewers, which distances the viewers from the characters and hypnotia of the story. The best lines from manhunter (and presumably also the book by Harris) also feature in Red Dragon, and I couldn't help but wonder that it wasn't true vice versa. There wasn't a single line in Red Dragon I wish they'd put in Manhunter. Basically, the screenwriter for RD took the Manhunter script, kept the juiciest bits in as a skeleton and then wrote filler in between and added a couple of extra scenes with Lecter, who serve little to the plot but after all, the audience do come the theater to see Hopkin's creepy Lecter don't they. I have a big problem with this excessive amount of explanatory dialog. Even the smartest films like Mann's The Insider have too much of it. Not a lot, but too much anyway. Red Dragon is an extraordinary thriller, but very much a pure thriller; it's pretensionless about what it is. So I see no harm in having most scenes and dialog advance the plot. But what I do detest is the childish manner used to explain every little twist and clue. Manhunter was a glorious success in that field, Mann took the time to do his scenes, he didn't feel the need to fill every silence with senseless useless dialog but let the art speak for itself. A scene that lends itself excellently to illustrate my point: the scene where he examines the first murder scene (the bloody bed). The blood stained bed scene is not only more interesting visually, it's wildly intense and unsettling. Exactly the emotion a skilled director would want to and be able to provoke from the viewers. In RD the scene was fairly disturbing but there was hardly any attention focused on it, which is true for most scenes in the movie. Which leads me to my next point: pacing.PACING: Now this is a very tricky thing. If the story's too slow the audience will lose focus and interest if it's too fast this will also happen. In RD there were not a lot of scenes where the audience can 'catch a breath'. In order for the intense, important scenes to stand out you have to break the tension once in a while, like for instance with a scene from Will's personal life. This was superbly done by Mann in Manhunter, when analyzing the movie it's fairly easy to draw out the story using pivotal points, this is for me an indication of excellent skill of pacing. RD felt a sloppier, more carelessly directed and even though the tension mounts I never felt my heart beating as heavily as during Manhunter. VISUALS: okay, many have praised the outstanding photography in Manhunter, and while this may be true from an artist point of view I feel the color tone and sober direction in Red Dragon was more appropriate for the kind of story involved. Strangely enough both films had the same DP, namely Dante Spinotti. The color pallet in RD is wonderful, the faces look weary and tired and that accompanies the fact that the detectives are supposed to be exhausted and desperate in the chase beautifully. I also liked the fact that Spinotti had many variations on the theme 'mirrors', which not only looked attractive but were also very relevant to the plot. ACTING&CASTING: Norton and Petersen are two completely different type of actors. Petersen has a quiet brooding quality, he's a sober actor while Norton has more of a highly intelligent sophisticated thing going, which is why Petersen did a much better job as Will Graham. He was just better for the part, the intelligent yet troubled police inspector, struggling with his inner demons constantly. Norton is an excellent actor but his character felt like a run in the mil inspector in any mediocre crime thriller you'll see. He never really registers on screen, even highly talented actors need direction to help find their character. So I mainly blame Rattner rather than Norton or Keitel who was also wasted. Fiennes on the other hand is better for the part then Noonan was. While Noonan was impressive and one of the most menacing characters ever on screen, Dollarhyde was written as a highly haunted individual who thought he was worthless and ugly but in fact wasn't. Noonan is in fact very unattractive plus he overplays his character. The Dollarhyde he creates is not how Harris intended him to be, but does it make him any worse? After all, an adaptation is an author's vision on another author's work and why shouldn't he get to stamp it. From that point of view, a man like Rattner who is not a great visionary was a better choice for directing Red Dragon. Red Dragon, the movie, is very much Harris' baby brought to life. My word limit won't allow discussion of the other less interesting aspects. But there is the matter of the ending. I personally prefer the one in Manhunter but it's really more a matter of taste than absolute objectivity. Both endings worked fairly well, none of them was the climax the whole film was leading up to. Red Dragon is a very strong thriller that pleases but shouldn't be compared to masterpieces like Silence OTL and Manhunter. 8.3/10",Red Dragon
184,joshuadrake-39480,"Better than ""Manhunter""",8,18 May 2015,"RED DRAGON is the third film in the Hannibal Lector trilogy and it is really amazing to see on screen.The plot you already know, by me explaining it in MANHUNTER, so I won't explain it. The music in the film was really amazing and I thought it was just cool to hear and Danny Elfman is a great composer and I like his theme music for Batman, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, Hulk (2003), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and also, the theme music for this movie.The visual effects are amazing and I could have not been happier. The costume designs and production designs are just amazingly well done. The tone of the movie is dark and serious, but also a little humorous in this film and I think this was a really cool film.The acting is amazing in this film. Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lecter for the last time in this film and he is just incredible. Edward Norton plays Will Graham and he did a great job. Ralph Fieness from Harry Potter fame plays the role of Francis Dolarhyde, a.k.a. ""The Tooth Fairy"" and he is just over-creepy in the role and he does a great job with what he has.Emily Watson is amazing as Reba McClane and performs the role perfectly. Mary Louise Parker and Tyler Patrick Jones plays Molly and Josh Graham and they both do a very great job and I could not have think of better actors playing these parts. Harvey Keitel plays the role of the detective who helps Graham and he is amazing. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the role of Freddy Lounds and he does good in the screen time he has.Overall, with RED DRAGON is dark, brilliant, seductive, intense and very amazing and is a great conclusion to the Hannibal Lector trilogy and fans and people should be very pleased with this remake / re-imagining because it is better than MANHUNTER.8/10.",Red Dragon
185,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Very good, but still not as good as Silence of the Lambs",7,30 January 2005,"Red Dragon is based on the novel ""The Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris. In 1986, it was filmed as ""Manhunter"", but this was released sixteen years later. In Manhunter, the technology was more primitive and the music was more of something you'd find in the '80's, in Red Dragon, the technology is up to date and the music by Danny Elfman is more effective. However, in Manhunter, there was a scene where they did a masterful remix of Iron Butterfly's epic ""Inna Gadda Da Vida."" That song is nowhere to be found in Red Dragon, but it was a very unique scene in Manhunter, so it probably wouldn't have worked a second time.Many people complained about Hannibal. Those of you who complained about Hannibal might like this, as it is more like Silence Of the Lambs. The problem with this movie is that Edward Norton wasn't a convincing Will Graham, where as William Peterson was excellent in Manhunter. I haven't read the book ""The Red Dragon"" so I can't really compare to anything. I do realize that this movie follows the story about the painting The Red Dragon, which was nearly absent from Manhunter. The climaxes in both Red Draon and Manhunter are different, and I don't know which one I liked better.This is a treat for any fan of the Hannibal Lecter films, or for anyone who wants to watch a good serial killer movie.",Red Dragon
186,vonnoosh,Everything about it feels forced.,1,11 November 2021,"This tries way too hard to be like a Silence of the Lambs 2 (even though it is the first of the trilogy) and it fails on every level because of it. Red Dragon was the first novel written and believe it or not, the novel doesn't have much Hannibal Lecter in it. The character plays a key role but at a distance. This movie tries to replicate Silence of the Lambs by having Will Graham visit Lecter for help as though he is as inexperienced and niave as Clarice Starling who was still only a student.The novel is about the man who caught this modern day boogeyman and nearly lost his sanity and even life doing so. He is pressed back into service by his former boss because he was good at his job. He visits Lecter not so much for advice because he already knows enough from the case files and Lecter shares no new knowledge. The reason he visits him is to see how a sociopath behaves because he first tried to bury that image from his mind when he started to lose it fearing he was becoming one of these creatures he went out of his way to think like in order to catch them. Why dumb down that kind of character? Michael Mann's Manhunter didn't and that's why it is still far more of a classic than Red Dragon ever was or will be.",Red Dragon
187,mattrochman,Another great film that slipped under the radar of most,9,3 July 2006,"This was a fantastic film, but it slipped under many people's radar for three reasons: 1) The critics said (and rightly so) that it is not as good as the Silence of the Lambs. However, I find it difficult to compare the films, largely because Will Graham (Norton) is completely different to Clarice Starling (Foster). The different dimension they bring to the investigation is enough, by itself, to distinguish them beyond comparison.2) This was the third film in the series. The problem with the Hollywood pumping out an absurd number of sequels and prequels (even when the original film was terrible to begin with) is that it alters the public's attitude towards them. People are usually happy to see the ""part 2"" but beyond that, you're usually down to loyalists. In fact, this situation has been made worse due to the fact that many of the sequels made are shockingly bad (eg, the American Pie sequels, the Highlander sequels). Some are so terrible that they can actually tarnish the memory of the original (eg... Matrix Revolutions). So a third Hannibal film was always going to be an uphill battle. 3) This followed an awful sequel: Hannibal. People who thought Hannibal was terrible (and there's no shortage of them) are likely to turn their nose up at any further sequels or prequels. That's what Hollywood always overlooks - once you pump out one bad sequel (eg, Ocean's Twelve 2004), fewer people will even consider seeing the next sequel, unless it receives almost unanimous critical acclaim.I did not like Hannibal either and I think that many stars in Hollywood would have turned it down after reading the script. Jodie Foster, with the offer of reprising her academy awarding winning role, and Jon Demme (director of Silence of the lambs) walked away from the Hannibal after disagreements with author (Harris) over the character directions. Hopkins nearly left when Foster and Demme walked, but was persuaded to stay (probably with a nice salary increase!). In any case, key elements were gone and in my view, they ultimately failed to attract a strong supporting cast. By contrast, I think many actors would have been falling over themselves to land one of the roles in Red Dragon after reading the script. Accordingly, we ended up with Hopkins (reprising his academy award winning role to absolute perfection), Norton (who is the rightful winner of the academy award for American History X in my view, even though the academy went to someone else that year), Harvey Keitel, Ralph Finnes and the brilliant, but under-rated, Phillip Seymore Hoffman. They combine to breath tremendous life into this investigative/thriller. And the opening 5 minutes is magnificent.However, I have two criticisms that cost it a star. First, it wasn't quite dark enough. Perhaps that masterpiece, the Silence of the Lambs, used up all the visceral attributes that were so pathetically contrived in Hannibal and present, but not powerfully present, in Red Dragon. There certainly was a dark edge, but it just didn't get under my skin the way Silence of the Lambs did (if you'll forgive the pun). Second, I felt that there were a few off-shoots to the main plot that could have been worked around or seemed to play no real role in the film whatsoever. For example, the tense relationship between Norton and the reporter (Hoffman), Finnes taking the blind girl to listen to the sedated tiger (or lion or whatever it was), Norton teaching his wife to shoot ... and many others. Most of the time, I felt that they should have been left on the cutting room floor as they were of little interest, had little (if any) role in the context of the story and accordingly, unnecessarily bulked out the running time of the film.Otherwise, terrific viewing. Don't be dissuaded by Hannibal - this sequel achieves where that one so dismally failed.",Red Dragon
188,ween-3,"""Manhunter"" Revisited-Hopkins Atones",6,2 April 2003,"Why the remake? Michael Mann's 1986 ""Manhunter"" was a perfectly functional and well-crafted version of the novel, so the only possible rationale was to offer Hopkins an opportunity to do penance for his Grand Guignol performance in ""Hannibal"". Whatever the reason, it's hard to argue with the new version due to the overabundance of acting talent attached to the project. The additional screen time afforded the Lecter character in ""Red Dragon"" is about the only significant difference between Mann's version and this one. Other than that...the same story line is adhered to. The experience is similar to seeing a solid Broadway show for the second time with a revitalized new cast. Fiennes is..well..fine...and Emily Watson's eyes are much prettier than Eddie Cantor's, but about the same size. Her face alone is worth the price of admission. 
I'd strongly suggest that one sees ""Manhunter"" as well as this film, if for no other reason than to comparison shop. The two are fairly equivalent as far as quality, but it's interesting to note the stylistic differences.",Red Dragon
189,pal05052003,A decent thriller lifted where supporting actors get to shine with the main actors.,8,19 April 2020,"I have not seen The Silence of the Lambs, so I naturally appreciate this movie by its own merit. First off, all the performances were great. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as the antagonist, and you actually feel sorry for him at times. He reminds me of Anthony Perkin's Norman Bate, and in some scenes he almost resembles Perkins. I think he does channel a little Norman in the story. Another riveting performance is by Emily Watson, a side character who happens to be Fiennes' love interest. Watson's character's chews every scene she is in, and is extremely likable. However, Fiennes and Watson are secondary characters. As for the main characters, Edward Norton's Will is an interesting character. He does not have super intelligence, nor good shooting skills, but has the ability to imagine a crime scene. His demeanor suits these characteristics, it also makes his character more vulnerable and you feel that he is in constant danger. As for Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector, there is no question why Hannibal Lector has become an iconic character. Hopkin's Lector is cold, and calculating. Though he mostly talks, you know for certain he is dangerous. In fact, the performances of the cast elevates the movie material. I like the pacing of the movie. It is slow, gradual and ends climatically. Even the very final scenes leaves me wanting more. What could be improved would be adding more tension and mind games between Norton's Graham and Hopkin's Lector. The film wisely sets a time limit for Norton's character to find the killer, as apart from being reminded of the deadline, our protagonist seems to be in no rush; and the audience feels no urgency either. This is where Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson's characters fill in the gap. Their dynamic drives the plot and fills up the other half of screen time. Thus, despite its flaws, Red Dragon is one of the better crime thrillers due mostly to the well-chosen casts.",Red Dragon
190,BeanieCore,Better than it has any right to be.,8,20 November 2020,"This film simply has no right to be as good as it is. It's a prequel to ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", something that could arguably be seen as redundant, filmed only a year after the ill-advised disaster that was ""Hannibal"". Not only this, but an adaptation of the novel called ""Manhunter"" had already been filmed by Michael Mann in 1986, the first on-screen appearance of Hannibal Lector. But, despite all of this, the efforts of a superb cast, a talented director and writer, combined to make this an effective horror/thriller hybrid, that caps off the Hannibal trilogy quite nicely. Thankfully, the film places Lector in the context in which he is most frightening once again, rather than him being the focal point of the entire film. Meanwhile, Edward Norton is inherently likeable as our main character, a gifted FBI agent with a knack for prying into the minds of killers. Most memorable however, is Ralph Fiennes as ""The Tooth Fairy"". Fiennes brings a strong emotional undercurrent and incredible depth to his role as a mentally unstable killer. The film isn't quite as forward with it's horror elements as the previous two were, but there's still plenty of disturbing moments. And like the original, emphasis on the psychological terrors of it's characters and Lector's mindgames lend it strength. It can sometimes feel a bit to similar to the first film in the trilogy, but luckily the characters are distinct enough to stand on their own, and there's several scenes of nail-biting tension to keep viewer's on their toes. This is simply an effecient, superbly acted ending to the trilogy, and well worth the time of horror and thriller viewers alike.",Red Dragon

The movie is ok, but it pales by comparison.The same goes with Manhunter. I liked it a lot. In some ways it was scarier than this version of Red Dragon.

There are scenes in this movie that can never be forgotten once viewed, such as the sight of Ms. Watson's face as she listens to the heartbeat of a sedated tiger. It is nothing less than wondrous in that she makes us share her amazement as if the stethoscope was in our own ears. There are too many scenes of such magic to mention in the space of this modest review but Watson is spectacular in every one in which she appears. It is essential to mention that no other actor in history has played the part of a blind person with such perfection, such astonishing honesty, such absolute spot-on power as Emily Watson does in this film. Though she is not technically the star of the film, it is she who undeniably shines the brightest. The viewer is moved from tears to laughter by her performance and it is acting of such beauty that it will stay with you the rest of your life. She has set a standard that few, if any at all, actors can ever approach let alone touch. Those who see Watson on stage, in film, or on television share a common bond of feeling privileged to view such greatness. Whether the lead role or in a supporting one, Ms. Emily Watson stuns audiences worldwide with every performance and is recognized by everyone as the most talented, most artistically gifted actor working in any medium today.",Red Dragon

More of the book's plot is here than in Mann's adaptation, and of course what's most important is that this is our third -- and probably last -- chance to enjoy Anthony Hopkins' delectable archvillain of our times, Hannibal (""The Cannibal"") Lecter, the creation of novelist Thomas Harris.Although the always interesting Edward Norton here seems a bit of a lightweight as this tale's FBI hero, excellent support is lent by Harvey Keitel, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Emily Watson, and especially the chameleonic Ralph Fiennes.  He's scary and believable as the object of Norton's manhunt, excelling with body language and minimal dialogue in making Dolarhyde a sympathetic monster.Enhanced by the excellent production design of Kristi Zea and meticulous, painterly cinematography by Dante Spinotti (who also photographed MANHUNTER), this film represents a considerable step up for Ratner, heretofore known for his RUSH HOUR films, and provides a worthy lead-in to Hopkins' and Demme's tour-de-force in SOTL.",Red Dragon

I would also say that out of Buffalo Bill played by Ted Levine and Mason Verger played by Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes is easily the best as Red Dragon, the twisted killer. Brett Rattner chooses an interesting style that in the end pulls off very well where he uses a mixture of thrills and chills. Jonathon Demme stuck to chills and Ridley Scoot stuck to thrills so a mixture was risky but worked very well for me. Overall a very good movie. Just not as good as the others.",Red Dragon
203,Kashmirgrey,Far Better than Manhunter,6,7 March 2007,"I think Brian Cox is a good actor, however, to consider him a better Hannibal Lecter than Anthony Hopkins is ludicrous, not just a mere preference issue, but as far as creating an icon image of one of the most downright sinister villains to ever hit the screen. That really makes no difference, however, because Lecter plays a small role in 1986's ""Mindhunter"" based upon the Thomas Harris novel ""Red Dragon."" In ""Red Dragon"" Lecter plays a much larger role. Those unfamiliar with the Hannibal Lecter saga will not catch some of the scenes referenced in the other two films, ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"" such as in the beginning when Lecter, sitting in the audience, grimaces dissatisfaction with a flutist playing out of tune during a symphony performance. Moments later the scene shifts to Lecter serving a meat dish for a dinner gathering he is hosting. We find out that the guests are symphony members and that a flutist has recently disappeared. A guest inquires of Lecter as to what the dish is he is serving to which he replies that if he tells her he fears she might not try it. Get the joke? Although they would not have been my first choice, I'll take Edward Norton as Will Graham over William Peterson and Harvey Keitel over Dennis Farina as Jack Crawford any day of the week. Farina is best kept as a mob boss and Peterson was far too ""I'm too sexy for myself 80's style"" back then (""To Live and Die in L.A.""... need I say more?) Hopkins was excellent as Lecter, although I didn't quite understand his animosity towards Graham in the film. True, Graham captured him, but it just didn't sit right with me that he would exact revenge on Graham, for whom it seemed he had some admiration for being that Graham out-foxed him. Ralph Fiennes was excellent bringing believability to his tormented serial killing character.The ending was not so rushed as in ""Mindhunter"" and proved to be suspenseful in the end. I don't see ""Red Dragon"" standing on its own without ""Silence"" or ""Hannibal,"" but for those familiar with the trilogy, it's a lot of fun.",Red Dragon

I give it 9/10 but could easily be 10/10! Like I said I was a huge fan of the show Hannibal, but the quality of acting from Edward Norton to Hugh Dancy(who plays Will Graham on the show) is massive on how it brings the whole story to life. Edward Norton laid the foundation for the character of Will Graham to bring life to a movie which has so much death and gruesome murders in it, while Hugh Dancy maybe tried to make the character his own, but decided to do it in a boring lifeless style. Aside from the character of Will Graham it's such a breath of fresh air to see all of the characters in the movie truly being acted out. In 2021 when I'm writing this review I feel like it's rare to see a movie where almost every actor is method acting their individual characters with unique quirks as how they think that character to be. In modern times actors are more just trying to fit in and act more casual.
The twists and turns of the movie continue to build on the suspense right up to the climax that you don't see coming. They're all great but Red Dragon probably was the best overall story of the Hannibal movies and they tell it flawlessly in this film.

So the attempts made to replicate the magic of that movie always fail to impress me. Except this one. The tagline of the movie is 'Meet Hannibal Lecter For The First Time'. Clearly it suggests that it is a prequel to Silence. This movie introduces us to the officer who actually caught Lecter - that being the character played by Norton. This movie also introduces another manipulative, violent and cold killer who is in control of a Chinese myth called Red Dragon which makes him kill families every full moon. Norton along with the 'supposed' help of Lecter try to catch the killer, but does he succeed? - Is the movie.Hopkins is his usual self playing the cannibal Dr Lecter with the coldest of expressions penetrating the mind of Norton and even the audiences. Norton plays his role very subtly and actually underplays brilliantly. Maybe this was needed in between all the Psychosis. I was much impressed with the killer played by Ralph Fiennes who discovers his human side and love for a blind woman even though he is in control of the Chinese Red Dragon. Overall, not equal to Silence, but will surely give you some thrills.Rating : 8/10",Red Dragon
208,Deckard-16,One of 2002's nicest & creepiest surprises.,8,12 October 2002,"Who the heck is Brett Ratner and how did he get this gig with this awesome acting lineup? I remember Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" fondly. And that, of course, was the 1st movie made from Thomas Harris's 1st ""Hannibal"" book ""Red Dragon"" (Alex Cox made Dr. Lecter a very memorable character). So I wasn't particularly excited when I learned that this guy, Ratner, was directing a remake retaining the novel's original title...but, there was no denying the roster of actors they got to work on this movie and that Ted Tally adapted it to the screen. But Rattner? Upon seeing his movie my reaction is ""Wow!"" The actors deliver, Tally delivers...and Brett Ratner hits a home run. I thought the trailer made Edward Norton's ""Will Graham"" too much of a wimp. Norton is no wimp in the movie (much to my relief). Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson are the standouts among an excellent cast. Fiennes is one the best and most conflicted bad guys in movie history. Watson's wide-eyed innocence is a marvel (she reminded me of Samantha Morton's great work in ""Minority Report""). Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal for the 3rd time and it seems he puts a more feral spin on the cannibal than he did in his Oscar winning work in ""Silence..."" (I never saw ""Hannibal""). Norton, Harvey Keitel and Philip Seymour Hoffman are all a pleasure to watch. The movie is very creepy (especially a scene with Fiennes and Watson on the couch) and very sly. There is some wicked humor throughout the movie (a Spielberg reference that is a hoot) and Tally and Ratner manage to slip in another William Blake reference either consciously or subconsciously to great effect (it involves something that is primarily the colour of a pumpkin with the markings of a zebra). This movie burns with intelligence until the very end. I won't give it away, but Mr. Ratner, you should've ended the movie earlier while it was still very hot. Overall this movie was a very nice surprise and is one of '02's best films.",Red Dragon
209,lopcar1993,"A great prequel to the mind blowing ""The Silence of the Lambs""...",8,14 December 2009,"Red Dragon, while not as good as Silence of the Lambs, lives up to it's horrific roots exceedingly well and gives us a great look at evil contained.Red Dragon is set prior to the events in the 1991 classic Silence of the lambs. In this we see how Lecter was captured and incarcerated at the Psych hospital it also introduces to us yet again retired FBI agent William ""Will"" Graham the man who captures the beast. After Lecter is tried and convicted of 11 murders an sentenced to 9 consecutive life terms, a new serial killer dubiously nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy"" and later ""The Dragon"". emerges and murders two family in tow different cities a month apart. Naturally this catches the attention of the FBI and they immediately seek out Will Graham(Norton) to help track down this psychopathic mad man. Graham reluctantly agrees to help track down, ""Red Dragon."" Red Dragon is brilliant, dark, complex, sadistic, horrific and relentlessly suspenseful it's one of the best of the series. But the haunting similarities between this prequel and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" keeps it from being the truly terrifying epic it could have been. Brett Ratner(Director of X-3 and The Family Man) does amazing here directing season actor Anthony Hopkins at his terrifying best. Ratner understands the material and he understands what Lecter is and how he should be played out on screen. The film is well conceived and well played out in every way imaginable it works on some many levels that when your watching it you don't feel like your seeing a movie but living it. It's extremely nerve jangling. All in all ""Red Dragon"" is an amazing piece of film making that is sure to please fans of the series and new comers alike.Anthony Hopkins is more terrifying and sinister than ever as the diabolical Hannibal Lecter but he is left mostly as a bit player. But the scenes he is in are truly terrifying and solidify that Hopkins is one of the best actor of our generation. Edward Norton is fantastic and at the top of his game in this twisty and mind blowing thriller. Norton's Will Graham is much more resourceful and more brilliant than William Petersen version of Graham in Michael Mann""s ""Man hunter"". Ed Norton use every inch of his genius acting ability to make the character believable and worth watch on screen . Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the malicious and psychotic Tooth-fairy, Fiennes almost outclasses Hopkins and Norton in his role which is sad to see but also amazing at the same time. Fiennes performance truly blows your mind it may also shock you at the same time how crafty and sinister he can be. It's truly a sight to see. But all in all the cast is truly brilliant and something to admire in this heart stopping psychological thriller.Brett Ratner's ""Red Dragon"" is enthralling in the fact that it draws you into a world you think you know and then completely spin it around on you and gives you something you've never seen before. It's as mind boggling and it is intriguing it will engage you every minute and every second you watch it. It's one of those films that must be seen not for the characters or the action but for the psychological aspects it relays onto the audience. All in all Red Dragon is one manhunt you'll want in on.",Red Dragon
210,arturmachado-29588,Remake (of the remake),3,23 January 2017,"This movie is basically a remake of ""Manhunter"" from 1986 and many of the lines are exactly the same, but at least this remake is not so sleepy, although it has some parts.It is also a prequel to ""Silence of the lambs"", but the story is basically the same: just a few characters switched and minor alterations to the script.Although it has good actors, none of them can deliver impact, not even Anthony Hopkins; it just seems like they're all taking a stroll along the movie...Compared to SOTL, this movie creates no tension, no threatening sensation on the viewer. As a remake, is a little better, but just a little. As per se it could and should have been better. Even ""Hannibal"" is better, an that is a bad movie too. Oh, how I love the ""Silence"".",Red Dragon

213,pazu7,How More Becomes Less (spoliers),6,9 January 2005,"Warnin: Light spoilers, nothing specific though.Red Dragon has a curious history. It is a remake of the 1986 film ""Man Hunter"" which was the original film adaptation of Thomas Harris's novel ""Red Dragon"". This newer version has the advantage of a stellar cast, the lingering aura of ""Silence Of The Lambs"" as well as Hopkins bigger than life personification of Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter to carry it through. But unfortunately Red Dragon has proved to be an example of how more can becomes less.This is the first time I recall being disappointed by an Ed Norton performance, all the worse when I consider he was bouncing off Harvey Keitel. That may be due to the fact I was so impressed by the interaction of William Petersen and Dennis Farina playing the same roles in Man Hunter. Peterson walks through Man Hunter with a haunted anxiety bubbling just beneath the surface of his character that Norton fails to capture, and Farina plays against Petersen with a manipulative antagonism that, for some reason, Keitel downplays.Fiennes is oddly miscast as the mad killer, Francis Dollarhyde. Tom Noonan was the perfect Dollarhyde: odd, subdued, haunted and just looking like the role. Fiennes has to work the character's schizophrenia to build the same tension one got by just looking at Noonan.And on the subject of tension, while it does follow the book more closely, ""Red Dragon"" fails to deliver the climatic punch of the original adaptation, even with its strange scoring decision of ""In A Gadda Da Vida"". Where Man Hunter omits sections of the book to establish a clear linear conflict and resolution, ""Red Dragon"" delves deeper into the relationship between Lecter and his captor, Will Graham, played by Norton, and therein lays its failure. It ceases to be about Graham's battle with his own disturbed thoughts (the most compelling aspect of the story) and this more widely focused story suffers in its balancing act to include Hopkin's charismatic version of 'Hannibal Lecter', who winds up eclipsing the most important elements of the film.Brian Cox's role as the original Lecter is admittedly not as captivating as Hopkins super villain, but while it is much more subdued it is also more appropriate to the storyline and does not detract from the character of Graham, who should have been the central focus of the story. The conflict of Graham's work with his family life is missing in this more encompassing version, and that is a loss that might have made Norton's character work for me.All thing considered Red Dragon is an entertaining film, but to all who have not seen the original, humbler production ""Man Hunter"" I recommend it. It's a smaller budget and subtler adaptation, but in the end it exemplifies how less can be more.",Red Dragon
214,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - 'Dragon' Spreads Wings But Doesn't Fly High,7,9 November 2002,"Released October 4th, 2002Director: Brett RatnerStarring: Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Anthony Heald, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Harvey Keitel, Mary Louise Parker, Emily Watson, Cliff Dorfman, Tyler Patrick Jones, Ken Leung, Anthony Reynolds, Tom VericaPremise: This is the story of former FBI agent Will Graham (Norton), nearly killed by Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), who finds himself asking the imprisoned killer for help in solving a new serial killer, Francis Dolarhyde.
Before Hannibal. Before Silence of the Lambs. There was evil in its purest form. That is the tag line that Red Dragon uses to lure the followers of Hannibal the Cannibal to the latest feature. Red Dragon is not exactly an original film. The film is a prequel to the previous Hannibal Lecter films but it is also a remake. Red Dragon is actually a remake of the first Hannibal Lecter movie, Manhunter, which starred Brian Cox as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Now Anthony Hopkins returns to the role that made him more famous then any other role he has played. Many people anticipated the return of this sinister villain in Hannibal but after a huge opening weekend and lackluster reviews, the film dropped quickly from the public eye. But the opening weekend was enough to spawn a prequel to the film. Will Red Dragon suffer the same fate as its predecessor or will it turn back the clock and bring the series back to its former glory?The story takes place several years after FBI agent Will Graham had captured Dr. Hannibal Lecter, which had resulted in a bloody confrontation between the two. Graham had left the FBI because of this but he is sought out by Agent Crawford to help out with one last case. Will posseses an ability to get into the mind of the criminal and capture them quickly. After searching through evidence of the disturbing murders of two families, Will admits that had help in his cases. That help came from Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is now in jail serving nine consecutive life sentences. Now Will must face his greatest fear of confronting Lecter again. If he doesn't then more and more people will die from the hands of this serial mad man. The story of Red Dragon is well done. It sets up a good opener of how Lecter was captured but the injured sustained by Lecter in that confrontation are not fully explained in the course of the film, which confused the audience. Outside of small squabbles, the story envelops the audience and really brings them into a suspense thriller that is well played.Anthony Hopkins gives, once again, a stirring performance as Hannibal the Cannibal. He presents a character that is not only intelligent but one that will leave chills down your back. He plays him so well that it seems that he was destined to Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Edward Norton gives a good performance as Will Graham. His character isn't cared for as much as Clarice in the previous Lecter films but then again, the audience isn't as attached to him as they are Clarice, emotionally that is. Ralph Fiennes presents a quite but twisted look to a serial killer. He plays the role straight out as a man who knows what he is doing is wrong but has no emotional control over. Others characters within the film are played as they should be and do not stand out amongst the earlier mentioned cast.Overall, Red Dragon was a good film but not a fantastic film. One which the audience enjoyed but really didn't gain much from. The story played well with its two hour time frame but there were moments that offset this generally good film. There were parts in the plot like the ending to the confrontation between Lecter and Graham in the opening sequence and whole ending to the film that confused the audience and really let them down. The ending to this film could have been taken to a whole new level but they stuck with one that was sort of expected. Not to say that everything in the film was bad. The story played out for the most part except for the previously mentions plot holes. The acting from Hopkins, Norton and Fiennes really set this film from the rest of the trash that is currently cluttering the box office theaters. Plus the way Red Dragon transitions itself into Silence of the Lambs film by introducing Clarice but not showing her was very well done by the film makers. But all those good things can't take away the feeling the audience was a little cheated with the ending. This is a good film to see opposed to trash like Knockaround Guys and The Tuxedo which may or may not be getting more attention then films like this.My Rating: ***1/2 out of 5",Red Dragon
215,FilmFan777,Red Dragon Redemption,8,5 October 2002,"If you liked Silence, yet felt somewhat cheated with Hannibal, then you'll be delighted with Red Dragon. A very well written and directed think piece thriller that analytically tells the first part of our love to hate and secretly admire him,    Dr. Lecter saga. Replacing the shock factor with articulate plot line, Red Dragon may have drug on a bit for a short time yet suspends your interest and wonderment well throughout. If you want only gore, then watch the news. Yet if your interested in a well thought out film with layers of interesting appeal, then I suggest you experience it yourself. Nothing will replace Silence of the Lambs yet Red Dragon stands proudly in the not too far distance. Powerfully scored by the ever haunting feel of Danny Elfman, this film starts with a well crafted script, followed by skillful direction sprinkled with a talented cast where no one person clearly outshines another yet compliment one another as a fine white wine with freshly grilled fish.
So go ahead..... pull up a chair.... sit down .... and pleasure your pallet with a healthy serving of Red Dragon.",Red Dragon
216,crypticcrytic,Who's for Dinner?,7,11 October 2002,"Someday a Hollywood filmography will be incomplete without having - or being - a meal with Hannibal Lecter. While watching this latest episode I am struck by the list of accomplished actors who have passed through. It may soon be as popular as appearing in a Woody Allen movie, if not as appetizing.Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the creepy connoisseur of gustatory gore and continues to scare us silly. Ed Norton plays the super sleuth Will Graham who brings down Lecter after a skillful sleight of hand making the good doctor both the hunter and the hunted. Norton portrays a master of investigative powers who is recalled from retirement to solve another series of murders baffling the FBI. And much to his dismay, it begins to get personal. Norton's acting skills are superb but the nasal quality of his voice detracts from his impact.Ralph Fiennes plays the latest monster - or rather ""a man with a monster on his back"" - Francis Dolarhyde aka Red Dragon a serial murderer that survived his abusive mother without a well-developed sense of self-worth. Fiennes never seems to get into his role or perhaps that's his interpretation of this psychopath. Harvey Keitel brings his rough-cut authority to represent the FBI mainstream. Emily Watson portrays a vulnerable woman, handicapped by blindness who's attracted to Dolarhyde and her fate is predictable.
The story intrigues as it moves through the investigation of brutal crime, the victims and the perpetrators.  When Graham recruits the good doctor to help solve the mystery, Lecter lends both his criminal mind and his analytical acumen from his solitary confinement to force his former adversary to stretch his powers while mentoring Red Dragon.  With nothing to lose and the lure of a challenge, Hannibal uses this opportunity to get back in the game.I missed chapter 2 (""Hannibal"") deliberately and never caught ""Manhunt"" so my perspective only includes ""Silence of Lambs"" which broke new ground in characterization and plot. ""Red Dragon"" gives us our moneys worth without gratuitous gore. It's suspenseful, generally well acted and keeps our interest without leaving that sour aftertaste.",Red Dragon
217,Squrpleboy,This Ain't Your Daddy's Fava Beans & Chianti!!!,9,21 October 2002,"Exceptional film, exceptional filmmaking.  RED DRAGON blew me away!  Until I saw this film I had never truly seen a ""THRILLER"", or been SCARED like I was while watching this movie.  Just damn good and scary!!!  Quite frankly, I walked into the theatre expecting nothing much more than a couple hours entertainment, and maybe something to cut-up on the car ride home; I was sooo gladly surprised.  IMO, this one was better than SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and better than MANHUNTER (which I have always loved).  The plot, pacing, performances, cinematography, direction, editing ..........everything, was superb.  The entire cast, including Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, and Philip Seymour-Hoffman, were solid to great in every circumstance and delivery, but Anthony Hopkins, as Dr. Hannibal Lector, and Ralph Fiennes, as Francis ""The Tooth Fairy/Red Dragon"" Dolarhyde, were simply amazing.  Hopkins gives a surprisingly subdued (Pacino & De Niro should take notes here!) and genuinely CREEPY performance as Lector this time out; no hammy acting and cheesy one-liners like this character has come to be known for (or Hopkins has let himself be reduced to as an actor as of late).  Hannibal is genuinely unnerving and chilling. However, Ralph Fiennes portrayal of Francis Dalarhyde is the FEAR that runs this film!  Until now, Fiennes has been a minor radar blip on my personal screen of noticeable actors; RED DRAGON changed that completely.  Not only is his performance as the deranged and murderous ""Tooth Fairy/Red Dragon"" utterly engaging and believable, but one of the truly scariest characters I've EVER seen.  It takes a truly great actor (or human being) to find that kind of darkness within themselves and bring it out into to open for all to see.  His character is a Man, and a modern Monster.The film isn't perfect, often you can deduce what is coming next, but knowing does NOT protect you from the FEAR of what you expect you are about to see (and thankfully, it is not a gore-fest, as so many modern Horror or Thrillers filmmakers feel are necessary anymore).  I had my friend hiding her eyes or burying her head in my shoulder, I heard people gasping out loud, and I found myself almost praying that what I suspected might happen would NOT happen next, despite knowing that it was only a movie.  I was scared. Good!9/10.  A genuine THRILLER!  (And a great excuse for someone looking to ""get close"" with that someone special!)",Red Dragon

I do like how the film cut out a lot of the book's clunky exposition and development. It was a vast improvement in that sense. But I didn't like how they cut out the backstory of Francis Dolarhyde. He was such an interesting character and I wanted to learn more about him. I also didn't like how the film referred to Dolarhyde's character alternately as the Tooth Fairy and the Red Dragon.

219,Maladjusted_1,A memorable cast deliver a revamped 'Manhunter'.,7,8 June 2015,"The third instalment in the Hopkins-as-Hannibal trilogy boasts an instantly enjoyable ensemble. Whilst Anthony Hopkins doesn't get the chance to shine as brightly as he did in the previous titles, his co-stars deliver some quite memorable performances. Ralph Fiennes adds an enticing complexity to the character of Francis Dolarhyde, the serial killer named 'The Tooth Fairy' by the media. He keeps Dolarhyde's awkward rigidity, but doesn't go to extremes. (This is where I think Tom Noonan went wrong in portraying Dolarhyde in 'Manhunter': he came across as a little too machinelike.) Edward Norton also, as you probably know, stars in this film, and he – like Hopkins – doesn't really get to do anything dramatic or Oscar-worthy in 'Red Dragon'. Philip Seymour Hoffman, however, is awarded a couple of satisfying scenes. The art-house charm of 'Manhunter' is sadly lacking in this film, but the first-rate cast and higher standard of character development go some way in compensating. I just don't know if 'Red Dragon', considered in relation to the other Thomas Harris adaptations, contributes enough to the Lecter universe to be highly acclaimed; it seems, to a certain extent, to simply revamp 'Manhunter' and fit it for a 21st century, mainstream audience. It's more interesting and of a higher quality than the 'Hannibal' film, but falls short of being as biting as 'The Silence of the Lambs'or as ""important"" as 'Manhunter'. (If you have seen 'Manhunter', though, don't grudgingly approach this as a cheap remake, for there are some satisfying departures from that film in 'Red Dragon'.)",Red Dragon
220,KillerLord,A Very Well Done Prequel,10,5 October 2008,"The Silence of the Lambs introduced to us among the most complicated characters of all times - Dr. Hannibal Lecter, brilliantly played by Anthony Hopkins. The portrayal was so strong that one would have felt that there was a need to remake the Manhunter and so it was done - The Red Dragon is worthy remake this time with Anthony Hopkins in another brilliant portrayal as Dr. Lecter. But this movie is different from Silence of the Lambs in many ways. I would not prefer making the comparison and lowering credit for this movie because it is different from the Silence of the Lambs. Let us have a small comparison to begin with. The Silence of the Lambs is more about Agent Starling and her interaction with Dr. Lecter rather than about the man they are trying to catch. Dr. Lecter's interest in the FBI trainee and Starling's apprehension of dealing with a man of Hannibal's reputation is the central theme of the Silence of the Lambs. We are not keen on exploring the past evolution of the Buffalo Bill character. He only defines the purpose that brings the two central characters together. On the other hand, the Red Dragon is more about the guy they are trying to catch and also the intense feelings the two lead characters have for each other. Hannibal was scary in the first movie and a great part of the scariness came because Starling was scared of him as well. But here you have Will Graham who is not completely scared of him though discomforted by his presence. Will Graham is more bold and straight in his approach making Hannibal's presence less effective but that is how it ought to be because somebody who has faced the worst with Hannibal already cannot be expected to fear him as much as an FBI trainee with a troubled past. Moreover, Will Graham also has a similar gift like Lecter which allows him to explore minds other than his own. So, honestly, the fear and tension of Silence of the Lambs will not be found here. But I feel that this toe-to-toe standing up of Lecter and Graham to each other is the treat of this movie. The character who is being chased is a complex character indeed. He has emotions but is disturbed enough to commit brutal crimes to bring about what he believes to be the most important transformation in his life. He is not an average serial killer who is killing out of sadistic motives. He has a complex motive and the very attempt to step inside his shoes and imagine what he is thinking is a thrill. Ralph Fiennes fits the role of Francis Dolyerhyde beautifully. His love interest Reba again wonderfully played by Emily Watson plays a very important few minutes on screen as well. Overall, he proves himself to be a complex and a scary villain in his own right. The direction of the movie is very decent. A changed director can easily lead to a steep fall of the effectiveness of the franchise. But Brett Ratner does a wonderful job. The way the first scene has been shot is simply brilliant. The camera shows a crowd and there is something about the way it has been done but your eyes cannot but catch hold of Lecter sitting in the middle and his expressions are so rich. Overall, I loved the movie and I think that down rating it because it does not have the element of fear that Silence of the Lambs had is not fair. I cannot think of a better way of doing this movie. I simply love it when Hannibal finds a near equal in Will Graham and deep down inside knows that he are Will are matched rivals. A splendid movie indeed! My personal all time favorite.",Red Dragon

223,khouston86,an abomination,3,31 December 2002,"What an embarrassment! Manhunter was wonderful.  It was tense, intelligent and stylistic.  This one is, well... making a lot of money.  It has been described by one reviewer (the guy at Arrow in the Head) as Silence of the Lambs for dummies.  He is dead on.  Most of the rest of the reviewers bought this one hook, line and sinker.  One day they will feel ashamed.    First, the casting, other than Keitel as Jack Crawford and, of course, Hopkins as Lecter, is miserable.  Ray Fiennes is completely uninteresting as the Dragon.  Edward Norton is not that far from the character in the book in terms of physical size--skinny, but he delivers a largely uninspired performance, is too young for Graham's fortyish age, and has the misfortune of being compared to Manhunter's great Graham--William Peterson.  The woman who plays Molly is not attractive, and she should be.    Second, so many characters and key plot subtleties from Harris' novel are absent. The irony is that the director probably thinks that he made a movie more faithful to the novel than Manhunter. For Ratner, that apparently means including all the major, major stuff that happens in the novel, and forgetting about the little connections that set those events up and totally abandoning the crucial characterization of the major players (much less even presenting the important minor characters--FBI employees, cops, the Jacobi's step-child, etc.) As a result, this movie completely lacks the mood, or even the general coherence of Harris's novel. Use a famous novel, assemble a famous cast, hit major plot events, leave out the heart and intelligence, and you can apparently fool more than enough people to make a killing.  Ratner ought to be ashamed.  So should the viewers who bought it.",Red Dragon
224,PoppyTransfusion,Mediocrity is its name,4,16 June 2011,"This review is not about the plot; it's about the point (or lack of one) of this film.Most who watch and enjoy Red Dragon do so because Anthony Hopkins reprises his ghoulish role as Hannibal Lector. Some who enjoyed him as Lector in Silence of the Lambs begin to find his turn as a loony serial killer wearing thin. My best advice regarding this film is: either watch Michael Mann's Manhunter, which for all its faults is a far superior adaptation of Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon (of which both films are adaptations). Failing that, just read the novel.Never has a stellar cast been so wasted, or the making of a film so empty and meaningless. Dino de Laurentis bought the rights to the Lector name and unhappy with Mann's earlier film version ordered a re-make to cash in on the success of Silence of the Lambs. Watching this film is a good study in exploitative and cynical film making for commercial gain.Aside from the overall mediocrity of the film Ed Norton deserves a nod for standing out amidst the pointlessness of the film. He is especially poor. Forget his film triumphs in American History X or Fight Club. His turn here is more akin to an extra from a Zombie film.",Red Dragon
225,Merely,Director blew it - Wait for the Video,5,8 October 2002,"As many have stated correctly, better than Hannibal, but not as good as Silence. Was very disappointed to learn the director was rather green, and it showed. Edward Norton basically phoned in his performance. Not that he was miscast, but he needed more, well, direction. I ended up not caring about any of the characters...Not a good sign. (I think we were ALL rooting for Jodie Foster in SOTL) Emily Watson was a ray of light, but in retrospect, had a small throw-away role. I'm starting to wonder if Sir Anthony will do anything for money. Ralph Fiennes was acceptable, but the movie should have gone on longer to delve into his character more.

OK I understand that with the popularity of the Lector films they wanted more cash but would it not have been cheaper to re-release Manhunter...again a superior film. There are some good bits in Red Dragon but they used the same script to the point where I could speak the words for them. This movie (Manhunter) may not have been as hi-tech as Red-Dragon and they may have wished for continuity with Antony Hopkins but other than that..why bother? The original guy, Tom, as the first red dragon had a wonderful way with the part and although he finds himself typed for freakish roles, he did have a certain quality. Ralph was good, and I have no problem with the performances of the actors...its just that I did not need to watch the same quotable film again...And I hope that the actors from Manhunter got a share in the profits from Red Dragon.

227,bulleetz37235,Mediocre,7,18 October 2005,"It is not anywhere near as good as The Silence of the Lambs, but then again, in my opinion not many films are. Red Dragon is still a very good film, and a million times better than Hannibal, but I'm a little undecided about whether it is better than Manhunter, I get the feeling that begrudgingly it isn't as good, but it is still entertaining. Ralph Fiennes is a good baddie, and Hopkins is an on form Hannibal, although he looks a bit old. Ed Norton is typically enjoyable as a retired cop dragged back into the business, and even Harvey Kietel pulls in a performance as Crawford, I am a little mystified by this though, I am actually quite gutted being a big Kietel fan, because I think he isn't a patch on Scott Glenn's Crawford. I was happy to see Chiltern act just as assholish as usual and I thought Brett Ratner was pretty good as the helmsman. Although I didn't particularly like the bits where Ed's looking around the Leed's crime scene and then when he gets a vision of the horrible atrocities that took place, it uses that rather despicable old scare tactic, which is... Use a deafeningly high pitch squeal and show some flash of a horrible obscene image, usually a body caked in blood or something, that not only made me jump as it was quite sudden but I also thought it was a rather cheap way to shock someone. Overall I ain't to bothered and I ain't gonna pick bones with this for too long, it ain't bad, I give it 7/10 ... Oh and if anyone says it's better than the silence well I think I hate you.",Red Dragon
228,asd29,Not bad but it definately has flaws.,6,24 February 2019,"This prequel isnt the worst but seems like it was just made for the sake of it, the obvious problems are as follows:1. Hopkins is clearly a lot older and looks a lot different to how he did in silence as does anthony heald who plays dr chilton2. Why didnt the original jack crawford- scott glenn return? Looked too old maybe?3. Hopkins out of sync in character and mannerisms- he just isnt scary in this.which shows the film was just made for a quick quid and to make up the hopkins/lecter boxset , manhunter(1986) is still a better film than this for these reasons.
dont get me wrong the movie is good in merit with very good performances from norton, fiennes and watson but the movie is flawed because its too belated, it should have been produced back in the nineties it doesnt quite work, not hopkins fault it was a big ask trying to emulate his original performance but this in my opinion was his worst performance in the trilogy.",Red Dragon

230,HBeachBabe,Solid but mostly unnecessary remake of an already great film,6,5 October 2002,"Contains Spoilers!! I just returned from watching Red Dragon. It's good, but knowing 85% of the plot from a film only 17 years old and not in need of a remake definitely lessened the experience.""Manhunter"" was about FBI agent Will Graham. In the original novel, Lector is a minor character only appearing on 11 pages (out of over 300). In the original film, the character, played to perfection by Brian Cox only appears twice, and is pure evil, unlike the cutsy Anthony Hopkins portrayal. In the new film, Lector is visited 3 times to the book's 1, plus an opening prologue, finally showing the exact circumstances of Lector's capture (which was alluded to in the book) is also shown.Villan Dollarhyde isn't shown at all until the final third of Manhunter, as revealing his job is a huge clue to the mystery. The book has quite a bit of his back story and history. Manhunter left that out entirely. Red Dragon includes much of it.Given the expanded roles of Lector and Dollarhyde, something in the story must suffer. In this case, it's Will Graham. With the exception of a newspaper headline included in a montage and some mystic mumbo from Lector, the idea of Will thinking like a killer, and that thinking like they do drives him mad is downplayed this time. His relationship with his son is weakened by losing Manhunter's grocery store father-son conversation.What also suffers is some of the procedural aspects of the case. Manhunter was all about police procedure. About deciphering the clues and using intuition as well as science to finally get one step ahead. This time, procedures aren't as interagal and often are streamlined to get through the clues faster.The film smartly drops the midnight jog/trap which always seemed to be the most cliched moment of Manhunter. The problem here though is that it is set up with talk of Will wearing Kevlar and having guys with him at all times. This is never paid off.As good an actor as Philip Seymour Hoffman can be, he was just coasting here, never weasalie enough as the trashy reporter or terrified enough as Dolarhyde's captive. In fact, during Dolarhyde's lengthy speech to him regarding how he sees his fear, it seemed a bit absurd, since Hoffman looked the same as he always had and certainly not frightened enough to motivate what Dolarhyde says to him.Much dialogue was lifted directly from the book as well as the previous film. To be expected of course, but in several instances, the actors practically mimicked Dennis Farina's or William Petersen's original delivery.Red Dragon's ending is significantly changed from Manhunter's. Yes, the main revelation of how Graham finds Dolarhyde remains in tact (although slightly modified and closer to the book) but the protaganist vs. antaganist finale is much different and includes some very strong moments.Brett Ratner is not Michael Mann. Manhunter had style. Perhaps dated now, but quite distinctly a Michael Mann film. This film lacks any style, neither having the high tech gloss of Manhunter, the gritty earth tone decay of Silence of the Lambs or the operatic flamboyance of Hannibal. This film just is.I must also mention my extreme disappointment with the usually exceptional Danny Elfman.  His score here was overblown and obtrusive.  I noticed the music several times, when the music was not what I should have been paying attention to.Sadly, this film seems to exist solely to allow Anthony Hopkins to play Lector again. Apart from the extra Dolarhyde scenes, I could have saved $6 and watched my Manhunter DVD at home. Perhaps for the Manhunter challenged, or those who just *need* to see how Lector was caught (which is a very good scene) this film will be worth the two hours. For Manhunter fans, there are scenes that you wish had been in the original (the prologue, the ending, the extra Dolarhyde backstory) but overall, it isn't enough to warrant the entire film being remade.",Red Dragon
231,videofreak2002,The best Hannibal Lecter film ever!,10,6 October 2002,"In 1984, novelist Thomas Harris made a novel that would change the face of the earth.  That novel was called ""Red Dragon,"" and it introduced Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.  In 1986, ""Miami Vice"" creator Michael Mann brought it to the screen and changed the title to ""Manhunter.""  In 1989, Harris brought Lecter back to life in ""The Silence Of The Lambs.""  In 1991, director Jonathan Demme brought it to the screen and changed the vision of the way we watch movies.  It won 5 oscars: Director (Jonathan Demme), Actor (Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter), Actress (Jodi Foster as FBI Agent Clarice Starling), Screenwriter (Ted Tally), and Picture Of The Year.  It wasn't 1999 that Harris went for a third helping in ""Hannibal.""  In 2001, director Ridley Scott brought it to the screen and the critics and audiences reacted to it negatively.Now, it's 2002, ""Spider-Man"" just broke the record for the highest-grossing opening ever at the B.O.  Now, screenwriter Tally and director Brett Ratner decided to bring Lecter back to the screen, but to understand the origin of evil, you must go back to the beginning.  ""Red Dragon"" is both a prequel to ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"" and a remake to ""Manhunter.""  When ""Manhunter"" was released, Mann did it completely different.  Now, with ""Red Dragon,"" this movie is far more superior than ""Manhunter,"" ""The Silence Of The Lambs,"" and ""Hannibal.""  When the movie opens, we see Lecter (Hopkins, Brian Cox from ""Manhunter"") is enjoying a nice music at a concert.  After the concert, he invites people over for dinner.  After dinner, FBI Agent William Graham (Edward Norton, William Petersen from ""Manhunter"") tracks Lecter down and arrests.  After Graham retires, his boss, FBI Agent Jack Crawford (Harvery Keitel, Dennis Farina from ""Manhunter"") asks Graham to go on one more case.  He's been givin a case that involves a serial killer attacking two families and smashes mirrors.  The killer's name is Francis Dollarhyde: a.k.a. ""The Tooth Fairy"" (Ralph Fiennes, in a gripping and scary performance, Tom Noonan from ""Manhunter"").  And Graham must get help from the man who almost killed him; Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.  Now, Graham must protect his wife Molly (Mary-Louise Parker, Kim Griest from ""Manhunter"") and Josh (Tyler Patrick Jones, David Seaman as Kevin Graham from ""Manhunter"") and hide from sleazy reporter Freddy Lounds of the ""Tattler"" (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Laing from ""Manhunter"") and Dollarhyde falls love with his next victim; a blind woman named Reba McClane (Emily Watson, Joan Allen from ""Manhunter""). Now, can Graham stop the killer in 3 weeks before he attacks another family, mainly his own?  
Once Danny Elfman's music starts in the movie, you know you're in for a wild ride.  And this movie is gripping from beginning to end.  Brett Ratner, director of the ""Rush Hour"" series knows how to make a movie edgy with the camera.  Writer Ted Tally surpases his writing skills from ""The Silence Of The Lambs.""  If ""Hannibal"" wasn't you're cup of tea, then ""Red Dragon"" is you're 4 cups of tea.  And like the previous Lecter films, if someone spoils the ending to you, eat their liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.

232,LJStephens1980,The begining,7,15 November 2002,"Saw this on Friday 15th November: Red Dragon is an okay film. It has it's share of scares, shocks and other nasty elements.However Red Dragon isn't as chilling as Silence and is nowhere near as gory as Hannibal, yet is quite reasonable for the begining as the trilogy involving Dr Lecter 7/10",Red Dragon
233,claudemercure,the very definition of 'unnecessary remake',6,7 October 2002,"There is nothing wrong with a remake, in and of itself. But if you're remaking a good movie, you better have something new of your own to add. And that, in a nutshell, is why Red Dragon is a disappointing movie. Brett Ratner kept bragging that his version would be closer to the book than Manhunter was, but that's irrelevant. In his hands, Thomas Harris's brilliant story turns bland. You get the feeling everything Ratner touches turns bland. His idea of innovation is to give his characters weird, bad hair (Edward Norton's and Emily Watson's is dyed, and Anthony Hopkins has a little ponytail in the prologue) - that's as deep as he gets.Michael Mann, who directed Manhunter, may have altered the book's ending, but he understood that what drove the story was the main character's intensity. The most disturbing aspect of Manhunter was Will Graham's ability to get inside the killer's head, and William Petersen, who played Graham, understood this too. Norton would have been more than up to the task, but Ratner chose to ignore this, one of the book's most compelling elements! So basically, instead of adding something of his own, the Brett Ratner style is to SUBTRACT! And it's a real shame, because he had some of today's greatest actors to work with - Norton, Hopkins, Watson, Ralph Fiennes, Philip Seymour Hoffman. When a director manages to drain the life out of as great a performer as Edward Norton, you know something's amiss. As for Hopkins, his performance seems to deteriorate a bit each time he plays this character (right along with the quality of the movies). And you get the feeling Hoffman could have gone to town with his character, but he's given very little to do. Only Fiennes escapes unscathed - he turns in a memorable, unsettling performance, and he is the reason there is any suspense in this film at all (the highlights are his scenes with Watson, who also does a good job).Two other concepts Ratner doesn't seem to be acquainted with are style and subtlety. For instance, (and screenwriter Ted Tally shares the blame for this) Graham tells his wife that after reading the killer's journal he felt sorry for him. This is a classic example of a filmmaker who doesn't respect his audience's intelligence. If you've ever taken a creative writing class, you might remember that the first rule is 'show don't tell'. A good director would have noticed that Fiennes does a good job of eliciting sympathy, and that the audience doesn't need to be told about it. Something else the movie should have shown us instead of spelling it out is Graham's boss telling him he has a gift for finding killers. When poor Harvey Keitel has to deliver that line, it stinks of cheese.Red Dragon is not a boring movie; it's not even a bad movie. The story and the actors (as diminished as they are by Ratner's ineptitude) prevent that from happening. It's simply not a very interesting movie. Imagine how good it could have been if a real director had made it...",Red Dragon

236,Finntroll,Very good.,8,19 July 2004,"I must say I had my regrets when I heard that Brett Ratner was going to direct this movie. Ratner, mostly known for the pretty useless ""Money Talks"" and the passable ""Rush Hour"" movies, hadn't exactly delivered any good thriller, but that was of course before he made this movie. The cast is solid to say the least: Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson are some of the big stars appearing here. The directing is slick and the plot is very thrilling. This is no new ""Hannibal"" and thank God for that. This is scary were ""Hannibal"" just managed to be boring, this is shocking were ""Hannibal"" was gruesome. ""Red Dragon"" is, shortly put, one of the finest thrillers to hit cinema since ""Se7en"" and every fan of the genre should watch it immediately.8/10",Red Dragon
237,Logan-22,The weakest of the series - butchered by the MPAA?,7,5 October 2002,"This is the weakest of the series without doubt. Hannibal is only seen at liberty for the first ten minutes. A movie about Lecter before his incarceration would have been much more interesting. Instead, we get a mediocre story about FBI agent Graham (the one who put Lecter away after almost becoming his final meal) tracking down the ""Tooth Fairy"" (who prefers to call himself the Red Dragon--I would too if I were him). The movie was slow and the print I saw suffered greatly from totally amateurish, unprofessional jump cuts during the final violent scenes, which appear as if shots are purposely missing (a head being blown off at the killer's house, and then again a bizarre cut when the killer is shot a second time). I don't know if these were enforced by the studio to get an R rating from the MPAA or what, but the cuts helped ruin the film for me. Edward Norton is no Jodie Foster and his acting is dull and wooden. Ralph Feinnes, on the other hand, is a great actor who could have done much more with his character, but was hampered by a poor script that doesn't let us truly get inside the killer's head. He hardly has any dialogue in the movie, and his past is only hinted at through cheap audio ""flashbacks"" that reveal little other than he was abused. The rest of the cast is wonderful: Hopkins, Keitel, etc. The film looks beautiful, but ultimately fails to satisfy in the same way that Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal did. Silence was a very scary film, and its sequel a modern day grand guignol romp. Red Dragon isn't horrible, but it's not great, either. I give it a 7 out of 10. Not a film I want to watch more than once, and certainly not a classic like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.",Red Dragon
238,Servo-11,"OK, but not spectacular",7,7 April 2003,"Maybe the whole Hannibal Lecter franchise is wearing itself out -- or that no other installment can even approach the original chills and thrills of Silence of the Lambs -- but Red Dragon left me lukewarm.  I don't think enough explanation was give to Dolarhyde's character and his obsession with transformation.  That's what tripped me up the most. Dolarhyde was a sympathetic character and naturally I didn't want him to die, but the ploy he used to spring up again was the same Lecter used in Lambs and for this viewer, it was a case of ""seen it.""  I have not read the book, but I assume that a blind woman is in that as well.  It's a horrible cliche to have a blind girl bring out the human side of a monster -- the Poverty Row flick, The Brute Man with Rondo Hatton, did the same thing 50 years ago and it still stunk.I am becoming increasingly disenchanted with Edward Norton.  In Primal Fear, he was a stunner, and in American History X as well.  However, in most of his movies since, I am seeing the same type of performance over and over. You could pretty much switch his roles in The Score and Red Dragon and not know the difference.  His delivery is the same, his mannerisms are the same...  Is he becoming a one-note actor already?  A shame, since he showed so much promise.Anthony Hopkins managed to recreate Lecter, but again, it just doesn't have the zing and chills from Lambs.  In Red Dragon, I laughed at his witticisms like they were one-liners, instead of the nervous and uncertain feeling I got when we first were introduced to him.  His jokes were macabre then, now they're just funny.  The eerie edge has been worn away.Still, I give this 7/10 because it wasn't the wretched ""Hannibal"" and it had the bonus of a buff, naked Ralph Fiennes.  That's worth the price of a rental alone.",Red Dragon

240,L_Miller,Total -RIPOFF- of Manhunter,1,8 April 2003,"Let's see, Brett Ratner has lit up the screen with crack-pipe fueled masterpieces like ""Rush Hour"" and ""Rush Hour 2"". Why not take him and drive a dump truck full of money up to Tony Hopkins' door and remake a movie that fundamentally does not need to be remade? (what's that, Gus Van Zant? You think there was more to say with ""Psycho""? Well, let's just say you weren't the guy to say it, OK?)Now, I think Anthony is OK when he's not phoning it in for the money.  Ed Norton and Ralph Kramden - er, I mean Finnes are really great actors but they are seriously miscast here. Ratner is from that Tony Scott school of ""acting? what? read the words!"" but I guess he puts rears in the seats so whatever.Nothing structurally wrong with it, except when Norton's gun morphs from a revolver to a semi-auto in a single scene at the end of the picture so he can shoot someone a few more times. Just totally derivative, quotes the lines, give Lecter more leer time (and I don't care what anyone thinks, Bryan Cox was much better in Manhunter than the little English professor take Hopkins has). Resurrects the original novel ending (which was dumped for a -reason-, hello) and brings us Harvey Keitel reprising Mr. White as a FBI boss.Throw in thirty-second ""extended scenes"" (ooh, look at Ed look at something...three, two, one, cut!) some -LAME- stuff about Lecter's childhood memories and an interview where John Douglas (the brilliant FBI agent who basically invented the art of criminal profiling) thoroughly embarrasses himself by talking about Lecter's ""formative experiences"" (it would be much more interesting to see him talk about Tony Soprano).Basically ""the Wizard of Oz"" rewritten to maximize The Tin Man's face time, realized on the screen by a director with the sense of timing and drama of a Merrie Melodies cartoon, crapped on and then pressed into plastic. Like, eeeuuw. Someone please give Tony H. a new cash train to ride so we don't see any more of this.Avoid this, please. Rent ""Manhunter"" and enjoy a fine movie and check out William Petersen in the role that I think played a factor in getting him on CSI.

241,enigmaticmaniac,Hopkins takes it to next level,8,7 October 2011,Well if you have already seen Manhunter you might find yourself pressing forward again and again as its just the same. Even the dialogs are copied to much extent. I was a little disappointed for the fact as I had the highest expectations from this one from the whole series. Edward Norton as the manhunter is nice not great in his role. The credit here goes solely to Anthony Hopkins who just sparked life into the movie by his amazing performance as Hannibal. He's creepy throughout. I feel the character of Dolarhyde and McClane were performed better in Manhunter. The script here remains same excluding the climax which is also a plus point of the movie. Red Dragon on whole is much more creepy than Manhunter thanks to Hopkins. So if you view it on comparison basis you might be disappointed with it to much extent. As a separate movie its pretty much thrilling and terrifying. Do go for it for the brilliance of acts.,Red Dragon

Long is the grittiness of Silence of the Lambs, here we are just going through the motions, just like Hopkins' performance. Hannibal's runtime is greatly inflated but even Hopkins knows this is just a cash in. Edward Norton is decent but comes off as flat and without any of the torture that William Petersen portrayed.Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Anthony Heald are both good, and it's obviously a slick production, but there's little else to recommend here.",Red Dragon

I loved this movie..I thought it was excellent. First off, the character of Hannibal was just as chilling as ever, just as scary. There's a scene where Hopkins looked almost straight into the camera, and his face alone scared the hell out of me. Truly intelligent casting, expert. Norton is great as well, as always. Hoffman played a character who successfully evoked a genuine dislike from me..I really could not stand him. The Red Dragon, played by Fiennes, was established well, from finding out about his first crime to when he finally came on screen. He was freaky, but somehow managed to get the audience to sympathize with him, which is excellent acting and dialogue. Impressive.The direction was great. The scenes, the dialogue, the acting, everything was high quality. If I made this myself, I'd be pretty damn proud of myself. Most scenes had terrific composition, they were just wonderful to look at. Great cinematography. The plot was intriguing, smart, interesting, scary. I was never bored, never confused. There was a good amount of emotion in the film, some of it was relatable, like family love and such, and some of it was sickening, like child abuse. There wasn't too much or too little, there was a great balance.I'm definitely gonna buy this movie when I have the dough. I got a kick out of it and I'd like to see it again.",Red Dragon

That's the good news. The bad news was that ""Red Dragon"" didn't come close to the magic of ""Silence of the Lambs."" But maybe that's just because Edward Norton is no Jodie Foster.It was scary, but only if you react well to the standard tricks of good movie scoring. The music was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. And the cinematography was...pretty at times, but fairly standard. It looked like a generic high-budget action/thriller/suspense.The acting was believable but nothing special. About as much as can be expected from the high-profile cast. They're not laughable, but they probably won't win any Oscars for their performances. One notable exception was Emily Watson, who did a terrific job, but didn't really have enough screen time to develop her character.But if you're a fan of ""Silence of the Lambs"", this movie fills in a lot of the gaps and unknowns in a fun way, so it's pretty much a must-see. Especially amusing are the cameos by actors from the original trying to look younger than they did 12 years ago.So...unless you're expecting another ""Silence of the Lambs"", this film won't disappoint you, at least as far as providing a diversion for an evening.

In my opinion, this chapter in the horrifying series is better than 'Hannibal' but slightly not as good as 'The Silence of the Lambs'. Red Dragon definetly has the most acting talent - Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keital, Emily Watson, Mary Louise Parker and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Also, Red Dragon has the least blood and gore, but is probably the scariest film of all of them. The story is about a young hero cop Will Graham (Edward Norton) who in the beginning of the film catches Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), but leaving both Hannibal and him severly injured. After catching Hannibal, Will decides to retire. About a year into retirement his old cop buddy Lt. Jack Crawford (Harvey Keital) asks for his help on a series of murders down by a serial killer (Ralph Fiennes) the police like to call ""The Tooth Fairy"". Why Tooth Fairy? Because he is a cannibal just like Hannibal and bites human flesh off his victims leaving a series of bite marks. Will decides to investigate the case, and asking help from Hannibal, since he knows how a criminal thinks.

""Red Dragon"" in my opinion is the best of the three Hannibal films (four if you want to include Manhunter). The film doesn't include unnecessary violence and gore like Hannibal, but the well-developed suspense from Silence of the Lamb. This element of suspense over gore once more proves that it's the best formula for a Hannibal film. It worked great in Silence and in this film as well.

Which was based on the book that Dr. Hannibal Lecter first appeared in, Red Dragon, by the New York Times bestselling author, Thomas Harris. This, I have to say, though many will disagree with me, is an equal match to its original and better than The Silence of the Lambs.To compare this to Manhunter is a completely unfair comparison. The two are very different. But, the two are both masterpieces of the thriller genre.Michael Man (Manhunter) used music and acting to accelerate the tension of his film. Brett Ratner uses good acting and gritty cinematography to create suspense and tension. Both Hannibal Lecters were great (Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox), as well as both Francis Dolarhydes (Ralph Fiennes and Tom Noonan), though Tom Noonan was scarier than Fiennes, but I found Fiennes as more sympathetic and tortured. Edward Norton also did a fine job, but did not come even close to recreating the Will Graham that William Peterson portrayed in Manhunter and the Graham that Thomas Harris created in his novel.The plot of the film is very similar to The Silence of the Lambs. Will Graham (Edward Norton) is a retired FBI profiler who worked under Jack Crawford (Harvey Kietel). Graham retired after capturing the diabolical and cannibalistic psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Now Graham is called by into the job by Crawford to aid in the capture of a ritual killer that brutally murders entire families called the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes). Graham decides to seek Dr. Lecter's help in catching the Tooth Fairy.Their is also a subplot about the tortured killer, Francis Dolarhyde. Dolarhyde was shaped by his traumatic early life into a human monster and also idolizes Hannibal Lecter. He also has an obsession with the William Blake painting, The Great Red Dragon and the Women Clothed In Sun. Francis Dolarhyde knows that Will Graham is coming and he intends to stop him. By killing, Dolarhyde believes, he can become the Dragon. But now Dolarhyde's killing spree is put on hold when he falls in love with a blind co worker, Reba McClane (Emily Watson). Will he stop his murder spree and his search for Graham or will he become the Dragon? This film is sure to please the fans of The Silence of the Lambs. There is quite a bit of ""battle"" going around about which cast was better. But that can't be decided by them, but you as the viewer. Please, sit back and see what Dr. Hannibal Lecter is up to this time in Red Dragon. If you enjoy this film, I recommend you the original novel as well as the original version of this film, Manhunter.",Red Dragon
254,Jac23443,I am Going to Throw Up...,2,5 June 2021,"This was forgotten as quickly as it was turned off, this was just awful. The pretentiousness of this film is overwhelming and Ed Norton made me want to throw up. I have never seen an actor look so uncomfortable and bored, it literally looked like he hated being there and it felt as if he was reading cue cards. I'll just watch the Silence of the Lambs again. It was so unfortunate because Hannibal in SOTL was so conniving and evil and elusive and in this film they gave him crap scenes and his accent is all over the place... it just feels like mimicry instead of commitment. I couldn't even finish this.",Red Dragon
255,thechosen1,Extraordinary performances.,10,25 November 2002,"Well, this film was MUCH, MUCH better than Manhunter.  That's what I thought anyway.  Anthony Hopkins' work as Hannibal Lecter does not even need to be described anymore.  There just couldn't be anyone better.  Edward Norton's expressions are excellent, he's a very gifted actor and deserves all the praise he gets.  BUT, Ralph Fiennes was just extraordinary.  His work has always impressed me in every way and whatever role he plays, he plays it to perfection.  I still couldn't decide whether it was Fiennes' portrayal of Francis Dolarhyde or the Dolarhyde character himself which made me almost wish that they never catch him.  Even though the character is so evil, you cannot help but feel sympathetic towards him.  And besides, let's be honest here, he LOOKED GOOD. (even though they described his character as 'ugly' in the movie - at which point I thought, ""WHA???"")  He developed a pretty good build too. Brett Ratner's done a great job in getting this film together.  It's just filled with so much tension that you actually jump whenever one the character's gets a shock of some sort.  The movie has a very eerie look to it, which makes it even better because that's what this is all about...the introduction of Hannibal Lecter...one of the creepiest fictional characters of all time.",Red Dragon
256,jakespick,FINALLY some relief!,7,13 July 2007,"The first Hannibal movie was Manhunter (2 stars of 10) and it was a horrible movie. But then...we had the excellence of Scilence of the Lambs. But then...comes along the 2 worst Hannibal movie yet, HANNIBAL! I was so disappointed, i stopped half way through the movie, but then i had to watch the whole thing because then i could actually make my decision. Jodie Foster performed excellence,and the series was picking up until HANNIBAL, Juliaane Moore couldn't do it. I had lost hope for the Hannibal series until now, Red Dragon! The second best in the series, Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes give a Oscar material performances. This film was a great edition to the series, i new they had to make a remake of Manhunter because that film was just horrible. Can't wait for Hannibal Rising!",Red Dragon
257,CarpenterKen,A slight edge to 'Manhunter' over 'Red Dragon',9,4 October 2002,"In a head-to-head comparison of the new ""Red Dragon"" with the fabulous ""Manhunter,"" I have to give a slight edge to Michael Mann's 1986 classic.Both films are sufficiently scary; both are true to the Thomas Harris novel (including some verbatim dialogue); both offer fine performances from all involved . . . but I think ""Manhunter"" better portrayed the turmoil inside both FBI agent Will Graham and ""Tooth Fairy"" killer Francis Dolarhyde.The original players -- William Petersen as Graham, and Tom Noonan as Dolarhyde -- are better than Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes. Norton never portrays the fear Graham must feel, and Noonan is simply more frightening than the too-good-looking Fiennes.We're four paragraphs in, so I guess I have to mention Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Sir Anthony Hopkins has created the franchise role, but Brian Cox was calmly sinister in the first film. Edge to Hopkins, but just barely.Both supporting actresses -- Joan Allen in ""Manhunter"" and Emily Watson in ""Dragon"" -- are brilliant, but Watson offers a wider range of emotion. She's happier, sexier, funnier . . . and more terrified.The tiebreaker might be Dennis Farina's in-charge Jack Crawford from ""Manhunter,"" although Harvey Keitel wasn't bad. And the FBI investigation elements in ""Manhunter"" are more interesting and convincing.I thought the new opening in ""Red Dragon"" was OK (I don't remember any of it from the book), and its ending was different, but not necessarily better. Kudos to director Brett Ratner for including a crucial museum scene in ""Dragon,"" but it does not have the impact of the truly chilling sequence in the novel.I gave ""Manhunter"" a 10 years ago; ""Red Dragon"" gets a 9, only because 9.5 wasn't available. The book, on the other hand, gets an 11, or 12.",Red Dragon
258,Vassago,"Joins van Sant's ""Psycho"" on the Growing List Of Horrible Remakes.",1,30 September 2002,"I knew ""Red Dragon"" would never match ""Manhunter"", but I had some faint hope that it might turn out not *too much* worse, and that it might preserve some of the spirit of the book, in spite of Brett Rush Hour's directing.Unfortunately, it's on par with Gus van Sant's remake of ""Psycho"". It's painfully clear, too clear, that the only reason for its making were the dollar signs in Dino de L.'s eyes. It's a (bad) school play on the steroids of a big budget. Everyone, literally everyone in the film is stiff and wooden, except for Hopkins, who is hammy.Where Brian Cox was caged evil, Hopkins is a clown. Where William Petersen was a tormented agent, Norton is a bored yuppie. Where Tom Noonan portrayed a man of a demented yet fascinating psyche, Fiennes is a bumbling cartoony villain who behaves like a village idiot and seems as dangerous as a bumblebee, while pitifully trying to look like Harrison Ford. Keitel chews his dialogue as if to say ""let's get this trash done and go home already"".The dialogue is lifted from ""Manhunter"" and sometimes (less often) from the book, and I felt extremely bored, because every minute I knew exactly what would follow and what words would be said. The few scenes that were thrown in The ridiculous, ubercliched ""Jason Voorhees syndrome"" ending doesn't help much, either.Of course, Manhunter had *a real director*, and a damn good one, too - Michael Mann, one of the few directors who have *and care for* their artistic visions; Brett Rush Hour cared primarily for the check, apparently.",Red Dragon
259,Movies8586,A masterpiece!,10,6 October 2002,"RED DRAGON, the prequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and HANNIBAL, may very well be the best of the 'Hannibal Lecter' trilogy. It is the scariest, tightest, and most intelligent.Brett Ratner expertly directs this horrifying tale about how Hannibal got caught, and how he helped a retired FBI agent (Edward Norton) track down a demented killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes). Ratner uses his talent to put an urgent rush through RED DRAGON, and it helps to quicken the heartbeat of the audience. No other actor can play the role of Hannibal like Sir Anthony Hopkins. The man IS Hannibal. All Hopkins has to do is look at you someway or use his soothing, articulate voice to hiss something diabolical... and chills immediately run up and down your spine.EVERYONE in this outstanding ensemble cast does a great job (standouts include Hopkins, Norton, Fiennes, and Emily Watson).RED DRAGON is a crafty, inventive, clever, delicious, and suspenseful masterpiece! One of the best films of 2002!",Red Dragon
260,Atticus_1588,One of 2002's Best Films.,10,5 October 2002,"I had the luck of getting to see the long-anticipated(at least for me) ""Red Dragon"". I am a very large fan of the 1st two Hannibal Lecter films and could not wait for the last one (""Silence of the Lambs"" and Hannibal"".) ""Red Dragon"" was much better then ""Hannibal"", although I didn't think HANNIBAL was that bad. But ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the best. DRAGON was a smart, clever, and scary thriller that I very much enjoyed. I had to think about it all of last night and this morning but I give DRAGON a 10/10. It has a very strong story that flows extremely well and very. very few to no flaws. So if you are ready for the last serving of Hannibal Lecter (They better not make anymore because without Anthony Hopkins HANNIBAL movies would go nowhere) I suggest you go see this great movie now.",Red Dragon

This movie is a must see and I guarantee that you will love this movie.",Red Dragon
262,McHuevo,Hannibal is back... again.,8,16 November 2002,"They say that ""Red Dragon"" was a sure bet, even when there already was a film adaptation from the book (""Manhunter""), since everybody wanted to see Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter one more time. Well, include me in ""everybody"".Anthony Hopkins is plain simply one of the best actors you'll ever see in the big screen. Once again, he takes a step off his well known educated-gentle-wise-old guy role and into our beloved psychopathic genius murderer, the best villain Hollywood has seen in the last decade. As always, his performance is nothing less than brilliant. But it doesn't stop there; you also get to see excellent performances from Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes too! The cherry on top. I waited so long (since ""Silence of the Lambs"") to see someone that could put up with Anthony Hopkins on screen, and finally Edward Norton has done it. The psychological confrontations between Graham and Lecter were my favorite parts of the movie. Dare I say, somebody in here might get away with an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.I haven't seen ""Manhunter"", nor read the ""Red Dragon"" novel itself, so I can't go into comparisons. I just think this is a great thriller; it's not as gory and dark as ""Hannibal"" but it has a more ""insane"" feeling to it, specially coming from Ralph Fiennes' character. I was amazed that Brett Ratner could pull out quite nicely a Hannibal Lecter film after making the ""Rush Hour"" comedies. Kudos to him. Maybe we can expect something very big from him in the future.",Red Dragon
263,ignatiusloyala,Great acting,9,25 October 2002,"If you ask me what is good about Red Dragon, great acting will be my only answer. I am not very surprised by the plot. In fact, the story is pretty similar to the Silence of the Lambs, only this time we have a male investigator and Hannibal doesn't escape. I give this movie a 9 (out of 10) mainly for the superb performance of the dazzling ensemble cast.Hopkins continues with his interest in making exotic cuisine out of human organs as Lecter. The same unspoken violence and evil in his eyes make him shine as brightly as he was in Lambs. Yet, Norton's presence often steals the show. In fact, this is the best job Norton has done after American History X. He successfully portrays the traumatized ex-FBI agent's hatred and fear for Lecter, and at the same time his determination and sensibility as a smart, talented officer who has a family to protect. Fiennes' performance is good, though room for improvement certainly exists; equally brilliant are Hoffman and Watson who illuminate the picture so beautifully. All in all, Red Dragon is a great film with an impeccable cast. I can say for sure that the movie wouldn't have been so good if it weren't delivered by these very actors. An enjoyable movie and a potential Oscar contender.",Red Dragon
264,motta80-2,"Fun and Fiennes, no Silence but eats Hannibal whole",9,27 September 2002,"The new Hannibal Lecter film would work infinitely better if last year's Hannibal had never existed as the hammy acting and trivialisation if the character make it impossible for Hopkins to really regain the chilling edge he had in the superb Silence Of The Lambs (one of my top 10 all-time films) and desperately needs in this film.As a result Hopkins is left ironically as the weakest acting part in this movie that would never have got made if not for his involvement.However strong performances from Ed Norton, Emily Watson and, in particular, a frighteningly good Ralph Fiennes crank up the quality and tension. The script is also far superior to Hannibal's with Silence's Oscar-winning scribe, Ted Tally, returning.The film is fun and great entertainment. It boasts lots of good performances and a good story, even if you have read the book or seen 1986's Manhunter you'll be swept along by it if you give it a chance.Slighty negative is the unsubtle direction from Brett Ratner and, more so. the hideously misjudged and irritating score by Danny Elfman. Still go see with an empty mind and no expectations and you'll probably enjoy, just don't expect high art because its not here, and nor should it be. Have a blast.",Red Dragon

That's not a question for a better adaptation of the book from Tad Tally only because the final is more close to the book or because he Wrote the great Silence of the Lambs;Just asking to myself where is a better adaptation?Maybe Call different Point of awful View. That is a silly pretext,anybody is living with haughty first Dino de Laurentiis and his maniacal passion for make Money...sorry but I prefer your production when you been DEG. The choice of Brett Ratner is simply bad,and make me see bad clouds at the horizon about filmaking! The only reason for give a sense to Red Dragon should be that Manhunter never exist,but the reality is different so I feel to compare. I'will not speak too much about technical differences and characters Performance (Too Much Gap). For understand what i'm saying ,The difference between this two film could be condensate on two scenes skipping the bad photocopy scene where is analysed a piece of paper. First, Lounds on the street is speaking with Graham,on Manhunter Lounds fly on the Car's bonnet ,here on RD is simply take for the collar...thats means the difference of Strong. Second scene is the Tiger's scene...on Manhunter there is an Explosion of empatic sensations from the character,music is more adeguate,lights is superb...on Red Dragon look like a ridiculous b-movie. Dante Spinotti make the best possible with this director,I hope will come back to work with the Great Director,first Michael Mann because I will be redundant but thats duo worth the right consideration and the right awards!

268,Jenny Ho,Quality cast and highly entertaining -fans of the Hannibal series so far will not be disappointed,7,27 October 2002,"Before the opening credits roll, the scene is set whereby we see how it came to be that Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal was caught and put behind bars. The man responsible for this is FBI Investigator Will Graham (Edward Norton) who retires shortly after.  However, it doesn't take long before Will is lured back into action when the FBI seeks his help in the investigation of a serious of murders carried out by a new serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes).  Just like in Silence of the Lambs', the Investigator enlists the help of Hannibal Lecter to catch the killer.Anthony Hopkins gives another effortless performance as Hannibal.  Although he is looking too old to play the part in a prequel, he has already made the part his own and it would not be right to have anyone else replace him. Although the audience has grown to know about Hannibal's ways, there is still an element of unpredictability in his character which makes him all the more sinister and dangerous.  He is also highly astute in one scene when he returns to his cell, he notices gloves in the pockets of a supposed cleaner which leads him to work out that a search and some tampering has been carried out during his absence.There is no doubting the quality of the rest of the cast -I've always found Edward Norton a very likeable actor to watch and Ralph Fiennes intriguingly manages to show the two sides of the serial killer's character: on the one hand he is completely mad, running around naked with a huge tattoo on his back and buttocks or eating a William Blake painting; and on the other hand, he encourages sympathy from the audience in his tentative relationship with a blind colleague (Emily Watson who conveys the character's naivety and vulnerability with great conviction). The ending of the film tying in with the arrival of a new FBI agent Clarice Starling is neat but too obvious and not really necessary as the majority of the audience already know this story to be the prequel to Silence of the Lambs'.  However, it does serve to invite you to watch the latter again! 
This adaptation of Thomas Harris' prequel is an entertaining one but is not as explicitly grotesque and is lacking the black humour of Hannibal'. Perhaps the most disturbing scene is where The Tooth Fairy tortures a journalist (Phillip Seymour Hoffman reduced to his underwear). Nevertheless, you can see this one coming as the journalist involved is a slimy one and one can't help but feel that his fate is deserved!
Although not as powerful or memorable as Silence of the Lambs', fans of the Hannibal series so far will not be disappointed.  I found this film very entertaining.",Red Dragon
269,pearlinasilverbasin,A good prequel,7,12 February 2021,All in all it's comparably a great thriller.

Compared to almost every other movie in the crime thriller genre this is still a good and thrilling movie.,Red Dragon
270,magic_marker,Surprisingly good,7,6 October 2002,"The story of how this film was made is a personal experience shared by the millions of Lecter fans throughout the world. It involves pain, fury, anger and frustration, much like the movie itself. From the moment of its inception, battles raged over the internet, the first line of attack from movie geeks who demanded to know why Dino De Laurentiis, who is a hack by anyone's standards, DARED to ""remake"" Michael Mann's 1986 film ""Manhunter,"" the second from ""Silence"" fans who wanted to know how could he POSSIBLY have chosen Brett Ratner, the director of ""Family Man"" and ""Rush Hour"" to helm the latest installment in the hallowed franchise. I was always on the fringe of these debates. I reminded myself that, despite the silly claims of a few lifeless fools, ""Manhunter"" was NOT as good as ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and indeed was so unfaithful to the original novel in both tone and plot that it left ""Red Dragon"" begging for another adaptation. I also reminded myself that Jonathan Demme's films prior to ""Silence"" had been ""Married to the Mob"" and ""Something Wild,"" both comedies, neither classic, so perhaps it was too early to judge Ratner.
His cast list for the film raised both hopes and fears; Emily Watson, my favourite actress in the world right now, was born to play Reba McClane, Ralph Fiennes was an excellent choice to play Dolarhyde, and it was nice that they got the series' lucky charm, Frankie Faison, (the only person in all four Lecter films) to play Barney again, but Edward Norton was too naturally restrained to play someone as emotional as Graham. Still, with Hopkins on board, the cast's pedigree (Four Oscar nominees and a Tony winner) would be the best seen since Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet."" So I waited.Well I can now say, having seen the film at last, that I am surprised at how good it is. Ratner does a very good job emulating the pace and feel of ""Silence,"" sometimes to a fault; the scene where Chilton (Again wonderfully played by Anthony Heald) leads Graham to Lecter's cell is so obviously a homage to the parallel scene in ""Silence"" that it only reminds you how much better that earlier scene was. I was particularly impressed with the way Ratner handled sound; people who never listened to music would have sympathised with Lecter at the bad playing of an unfortunate flautist, even though he was only slightly off-key and in the middle of an orchestra. Danny Elfman's score is evocative of, though different from, Howard Shore's score for ""Lambs;"" a rather difficult feat, and very well achieved. Dante Spinotti, who lensed ""Manhunter,"" throws that film's ""Miami Vice"" look out of the window and instead tries to emulate the supernatural qualities of Tak Fujimoto (""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Silence""), almost succeeding.
And the actors? Well, I'm sorry to say Norton was exactly as I expected him to be, flat and rather immature as the supposedly world-weary Graham. Fiennes, who demostrated in ""Schindler's List"" that he could wring sympathy from psychopaths like water from stone, ups his game a hundredfold with his terrifying and disturbing portrayal of Dolarhyde. What the previous Dolarhyde, Tom Noonan, relied on his eerie features and massive frame to convey, Fiennes manages through acting alone, creating a tortured soul of immense power and menace. Much has been said of Watson's performance in this film, and indeed she does nail her character, though I wish she was given more and better lines to deliver. That she managed to make such an impact with the little she had is a minor miracle. Hoffman, Keitel and Parker all aquit themselves well, though they don't bother shifting from their standard screen personas. Hopkins, well, he's back at the funfair and he's relishing every minute of it. You can tell he obviously loves playing this character (Who wouldn't?) and he goes all out giving us the Hannibal we remember, though not quite as powerful as his first incarnation (There is nothing in the film that equals his ""spring lambs"" interrogation with Starling, for instance). He still manages to both terrify and play the crowd with masterful aplomb. No, if this film has a weakness, it is surprisingly, Ted Tally's script, which tones down much of the novel's more disturbing aspects, including its wonderful ending, which, sanitised, now lacks punch. There are too many overt references to ""Silence,"" including one line near the end lifted wholesale. And Lecter is given very little of his ingenious dialogue to speak. However, the film's opening sequence, in which we see Lecter before he was caught, is brilliantly written and jibes with Lecter's now mythic status. The opening credits, in which we see the proceeding events played out through the pages of the killer's journal, are eerie and apt.
All in all, a good effort, but it cannot match ""Silence,"" though it could have.",Red Dragon
271,elle_kittyca,Lots of potential buit flawed,7,28 September 2018,"This is a movie that is made and lost by its performances. I loved watching Ralph Feinnes and Phillip Seymor Hoffman and Emily Watson. The film was ruined by flat performances, mostly by that of Edward Norton who played no discernible character except himself. It took me several watches of this movie to figure out what i didn't like about it, and it was the lack of interest created by Norton and Harvey Kaitel.The opening scene with Lector and Norton's character are exciting and promised a great set up of a movie with justifiable reason for tension between them. But as the film progresses, this becomes silly. Norton's character comes of as not what he is being portrayed as (someone smart or perceptive or gifted), and Lector comes off as being petty. More more interesting and compelling are the performances of Ralph Feeines as a fledgling dragon, and Emily Watson (in a rather unusual role for her) as the blind love interest. This had so much potential, with two disabled people being themselves with each other, facing their demons, avoiding the pitfalls of pity, ... too bad it was overshadowed by a the lame plot line of the stereotypical ""gifted"" detective entangled with the madman.",Red Dragon
272,Nahret,... or the one that gave Hannibal back to us. 8/10.,8,3 October 2002,"As the tag line suggests, to understand evil, you have to go back to the beginning. This is, thus, the beginning; we see Hannibal as he was in liberty, serving culinary delights to his sophisticated guest. And after that, of course, there he is, freshly incarcerated, reduced to nine square meters and to suffering fools such as Chilton. But essentially, this is not a film about Hannibal Lecter, and that's probably what makes it work (as opposed to Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal""). The same as ""Silence..."" was about Starling's quest, ""Red Dragon"" essentially focuses on Will Graham, the FBI agent who put Lecter away, and who now is taken out of retirement in order to find a new serial killer, the ""Tooth Fairy"". Hannibal may be the best secondary character ever, but his appeal lies in his interaction with the main characters; in this case Graham and Dolarhyde.The story line is solid and develops in a straight-forward manner. Rather than create a work of art, the makers of this movie relied on what could be called the craft of film-making: a good story is here populated by believable, fleshed-out characters. While the personality of Graham is naturally explored to satisfaction, much screen time is also given to Francis Dolarhyde and his inner struggle, which is mesmerising to behold.The crime scenes are harsh, but not gratuitously gory. More than cheap shock effects, they contribute to the atmosphere of terror that permeates this movie - as it did ""Silence"".The cast of showbiz heavy weights is not just impressive, it is, forgive the superlative, perfect. Apart from a brilliant Norton, Hopkins and Fiennes, Emma Watson's performance in a pivotal role is incredibly accomplished.All things considered, this film is a worthy successor (or predecessor?) of ""Silence of the Lambs"". And almost makes us forget about ""Hannibal"".",Red Dragon
273,MikeSmash,"""Red Dragon"" ranks high but under performs ""Silence of the Lambs""",7,12 February 2006,"""Red Dragon"" does not contain the level of cerebral horror as ""Lambs"" but does have shock value & will disturb the viewer. The star power is above average with good performances notably by Ralph Fiennes(The English Patient) & Edward Norton(American History X). Will Graham(Norton) is a retired FBI agent living a calm & secluded existence with his wife Molly(Mary-Louise Parker) & son Josh(Tyler Patrick Jones) in Florida. Unfortunately, Will is still haunted by the memories of his apprehension of sadistic sociopath psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter(Hopkins). Will was nearly killed by Lecter when he discovered that it was actually the psychiatrist who was committing the unspeakable crimes that Graham was investigating for the FBI. Graham's quiet family life is interrupted by his old boss & friend Agent Jack Crawford(Keitel). Crawford pleads with Graham to use his investigative gifts"" to help on a case baffling the FBI for some time. Reluctantly, Graham agrees to help only in a consultant capacity & flies to the crime scenes of the latest ""Tooth Fairy"" victims. Graham observes the crime scenes, slowly getting his ""feel"" back for sensing the motives of the killer. Graham discovers that the killer smashes mirrors at every crime scene & uses the shards of glass to put into the eyes of the women to ""see"" him as an object to desire. With the last victim, the ""Tooth Fairy"" makes a fatal mistake; he touched his victim's eye with a bare hand. Unfortunately for Graham only a partial print remained thus prompting further investigation & evidence gathering. Meanwhile, the killer's true identity is revealed to the viewer as psychotic video processor Frances Dolarhyde(Fiennes). Abused as a child both physically & emotionally by his maternally detached mother, Dolarhyde is very withdrawn & anti-social. Dolarhyde also suffers from a cleft palate which left him somewhat disfigured & slightly speech impaired. His manifestations of severe psychosis has created a person who believes that he is ""becoming"" someone or something greater than himself. In this case, Dolarhyde is becoming the Red Dragon, a mythical creature of great power & even greater wrath. Through work Dolarhyde meets blind film developer Reba McClane(Watson) & quickly decides on developing a pseudo-romantic relationship. Their dating is extremely awkward for Dolarhyde & troubles him significantly. Dolarhyde takes Reba to a zoo, on a favor from zoo staff, where she gets up close & personal with a sedated tiger. The meeting between Reba & tiger is almost erotic for Dolarhyde as he watches from the background. Graham & Crawford work hard to piece the crimes together & are inching closer than before. Graham has only one last ditch effort to help break the case wide open & that is a meeting with the infamous Dr. Lecter. Graham does so with great reservation but needs Lecter's brilliant criminal mind to ""get the feel"". Of course, being around Lecter has its price. Although Lecter toys with Graham, the psychiatrist does provide him with clues to help the case further along. National Tattler reporter Freddy Lounds hounds Graham for an exclusive on the case to Graham's ire. But Graham grants Lounds' request only to use the scoundrel reporter to lure out ""The Tooth Fairy"" by posing for pictures & talking about the case. Angered more than ever, Dolar is becoming more and more irritated by Graham & Lounds. Dolarhyde kills a worker friend of Reba's & captures National Tattler star reporter Freddy Lounds(Hoffman). While glued naked to a wheelchair, Lounds is subjected to Dolarhyde's rage. A break in the case comes when a routine toss of Lecter's cell reveals tabloid correspondence between Lecter & the ""Tooth Fairy"" & is intercepted by the FBI. The message is written in code on toilet paper & ripped apart but is breakable. Graham, Crawford & his staff are on a race against time to decode the message before the National Tattler runs its next day's edition. Meanwhile, Lecter is kept at bay to slyly put the message back in his cell without him becoming suspicious. The Tattler runs the coded message to not cause suspicion. Graham suddenly realizes how the killer is choosing his victims. While going through the victim's materials, he stumbles upon home movies of the victims. Graham finds that the killer has seen these tapes & has prior knowledge of how best to access the homes. Graham & Crawford discover the identity of Dolarhyde through the name of the video company he subcontracts through. Realizing the end may be near, Dolarhyde takes a trip to Washington to the museum where the original Red Dragon painting is held.

Dolarhyde makes his move & grabs Josh in the process, holding a large broken piece of glass to the boy's throat. Graham, taking a big risk, degrades Josh for urinating on himself, which is the exact same treatment Dolarhyde received form his mother as a child. Graham uses Dolarhyde's psychosis against him to release Josh & Molly shots the killer dead.

274,meejoir,Ye of little faith!,9,7 October 2002,"Up until now Manhunter was my favourite Hannibal movie. Sure I thought Silence of the Lambs was great too, but Manhunter was where it all began and I have always loved it. To say I was dubious about going to see a virual re-make of it is a bit of an understatement especially from the man who brought us the Rush Hour films. However I needn't have worried.
Red Dragon is a splendid spin on the Thomas Harris novel. Sure it has Hopkins back in the saddle as Lector, but this is a fantastic ensemble piece with Ralph Fiennes taking pride of place. Ed Norton (who rarely has a bad performance) is also on top form. The gore is better, the suspense is nail biting and thank God that Tangerine Dream didn't do the soundtrack! Go see this movie, it makes up for Ridley Scotts poor attempt a couple of years ago.",Red Dragon
275,kausix777,Not bad but Manhunter (1986) was better,6,9 August 2010,"As this is almost a scene-by-scene remake of Manhunter (1986), the comparisons are but expected.In my opinion, it all boiled down to the casting and the ""performances"".I was not very impressed with the Will Graham of Manhunter (I thought it was overacted) until I saw this one. This one was not overacted but instead appeared lackadaisical. It is only in a couple of scenes towards the middle of the movie that Edward Norton shines.Hannibal - that's what this is about, isn't it? I would say both Brian Cox and Anthony Hopkins outperform each other in various scenes. Yet, I have that little bias in favour of Brian Cox as Hannibal because there was this eeriness about him.I also liked the cinematography and sets of Manhunter better than this one.The tooth fairy was better cast in this one, I guess. I also felt that Seymour Hoffman was miscast as the reporter Lounds in this one. He is a very good actor but he did not portray the callous attitude of the reporter well. However, he did a very good job in the ""serious"" scenes towards the end which were not managed by Stephen Lang in Manhunter.Joan Allen did a wonderful job as Reba in Manhunter. Although Emily Watson also did a good job as Reba in this one, they appeared to be portraying a different Reba each.Overall, I was more satisfied with Manhunter which I watched prior to Red Dragon (maybe that has resulted in my bias).However, the story was explained better in Red Dragon than in Manhunter.",Red Dragon
276,trvolk,Correcting Manhunter's Mistakes,8,11 October 2002,"As a big fan of the original novel, 'Manhunter' was a major letdown for me, especially after the impressive visuals Michael Mann conjured up for 'Thief'. 'Manhunter' just did not capture the menace of the book, and I rated it a 6.However 'Red Dragon', the movie, stays truer to the book both plotwise and feelwise while tying up the loose ends for those who only know the story by way of the films, an easy 8. (I reserve 9s and 10s for those films I intend to buy on DVD.)For what it's worth, I hated 'Hannibal', the novel, writing it off as commercial pretense, and I have not yet seen that film.",Red Dragon
277,robespierre9,Excellent! Well-done(no pun intended) and well-acted,10,25 October 2002,"I like Red Dragon even more than Silence of the Lambs! I think Will Graham's character is much more interesting than Clarice Starr ever was--and Edward Norton does an excellent job in conveying his weariness and determination in this remake of Manhunter. I also find this to be a much superior film to Michael Mann's 1985 attempt. The acting is better, and Anthony Hopkins is the best he has ever been as Hannibal Lecter. Norton and Hopkins have great chemistry on screen in this! The initial scene (SPOILER) when Lecter attacks Graham is so shocking and the impact is keenly felt. Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson are also splendid in this. I liked the fact that the film-work was kept very minimalistic in this movie--no flashbacks, no CGI effects, no overwrought action scenes--just nice, good, lingering closeups and good simple, solid story-telling. This is a director who just let the actors use their talent to move this story along. This redeems the triology which slipped to precariously when the hideous ""Hannibal"" movie came out. Now I just wish that Thomas Harris would write a sequel that included the Will Graham character in it!!!!!!!!!",Red Dragon
278,Abominog,Dare to compare,6,2 July 2004,"It's hard to perceive a remake as it is, without annoyingly persistent parallel with its predecessor. I hate to sound stereotyped but it could have been much easier to speculate on merits and drawbacks of Red Dragon unless there was Manhunter.Perhaps I'd hesitated to give the palm of supremacy to either movie, should Red Dragon was shot prior to Manhunter. I always wonder what actually remakes are produced for. Bigger budgets? More impressive f/x? Better cast? Finer accuracy to the original? Color vs. B&W considerations? Infatuation with classic? Adaptation to present day reality?Costwise, well, hardly. I didn't try to figure out the budgetary allocations. But both films are extremely well produced. To my liking either movie provides excellent cinematography. Production designs are equally fabulous. Danny Elfman's classy score fits well, but energetic rock tunes, to my view, provided better dynamics and more depth to Manhunter (which is a matter of personal taste, of course).It doesn't really much matter, which one is a split inch closer to Thomas Harris' book. Tally's adapted screenplay is basically similar to Mann's if slightly simplified and a bit more violent (captive Lounds fixed with adhesive, the bitten tongue). Many principal elements of the storyline, except for some minor details, are more or less pretty much alike though.Switch from 8mm film to VHS tape home movies concept was rather forced move for the sake of chronology (the film is set a couple of years prior to the events portrayed in The Silence of the Lambs). As regards the truth to the original, having read the book long ago I may however recall that it was written yet in 1981, before VHS-C tape was yet unavailable.Besides the ""cuisine"" prologue and closing dialogue abridging the film to TSOTL, this is yet one more reason to make sure that the idea of the remake was an attempt to squeeze the prequel into the format of Sir Anthony 'Hannibal' Hopkins trilogy.As for the final (unlikely) intrusion sequence, I guess, it doesn't add much thrill to Red Dragon. I believe, regretfully, Red Dragon is secondary (good but not great) in every sense. It seems that RD doesn't click because it lacks the soft balance/priority of characters, which made Michael Mann's movie fascinating.Fiennes' Dollarhyde is one-sidedly sullen, ferocious and too obvious. Strangely, Noonan (a perfect fit to the role), which is plausible and lively, compassionate and pitiful at times, looks much more creepy. Scenes with the tiger, Francis silent sobbing and daybreak embrace are especially moving.Lecktor (Cox), a supporting character in the book, is adequately positioned as a sort of a medium between Graham and Tooth Fairy. Lecter (Hopkins) is overly self-sufficient and often steals the show.Petersen, in my opinion, was somehow more convincing as troubled FBI profiler than Norton. The latter is an undeniably bright young actor but his constant intangible grin hardly matched the gravity of Graham's (abrupt) evaluations of the killer's psychological portrait/identity.All in all, Red Dragon, if considered irrespectively, is a good effort with really nice cast and based on an excellent novel. But as a needless remake of an unrivaled Manhunter, it is neither a miss nor a hit.",Red Dragon

282,Frogfisher,Entertaining and exciting...,8,1 October 2005,"This is the second best story starring Dr. Hannibal Lecter.This film is starring some of my top favourite actors and actresses Ralp Fiennes is brilliant as Francis Dollarhyde, he gives the characters so much life, and he plays it so we get to feel for him, he is definitely one of the actors to take over from Peter O'Toole, Ian Holm and company. Edward Norton is probably one of the best actors ever. His enormous talent has been shown so many times by now, not many can disagree. And he got so many facets, and this role like many of his others really is believable, yet not the best. Emily Watson, she so beautiful and so talented, awesome girl, and she too lifts the role to something brilliant. Phillip Seymour-Hoffman I hate him and I love him. There's something wicked about him, and he is definitely a talented actor, yet I hate him, most likely because as usual he gets a creep to come alive and almost so pathetic, you have to feel bad for him.And then there is Anthony Hopkins, this role still is his best role, Hannibal can be no one other. He's as good as in Silence of Lambs. The story is well thought-out and well penned-out, at no time did I feel it was too much or too little. One is kept seated all the time, just to see what's next.

283,CCS-CRITIC,Just a starter to the Lambs main course,6,13 May 2003,"6/10The prequel to Silence of the Lambs is a tense affair that tries to put into some perspective the Hannibal Lecter story before the unveiling of the Lecter-Starling relationship.  This film focuses on Hannibal Lecter and just how he was caught, after a string of brutal murders, by a colleague that confided in him within the FBI.  Edward Norton plays the FBI agent, Will Graham, who comes out of retirement after only just escaping an attempted killing from Lecter.  After two linked cases Graham is asked to help in the case of the Tooth Fairy' and soon becomes embroiled in the case with direction from Lecter himself.The film was quite a sturdy affair with the relationship between Graham and Lecter developing into where Silence of the Lambs started off, and although the plot was relatively good the sense of tension and intensity that the Silence of the Lambs portrayed could not be matched, nor was it expected to be matched.  Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of the Tooth Fairy' was often eerie and in disturbing, but something didn't quite click and I was left with a small sense of being let down.  It seemed simply a case of a good idea put into practice quite effectively, but perhaps in the end over-stretched as to the expected impact of the movie.  In essence then it was just over average, and although the acting simply couldn't be faulted and the focus on Graham's character was well done there wasn't the electric chemistry that the original produced.  And as with Hannibal, it seems like window dressing around the brilliance of the first film made.",Red Dragon
284,TexVanWinkle,"Good, but suffers by comparison",7,20 October 2002,"Avast ye: Spoilers ahead.It's not often -- okay, it's never happened -- that I finish a book and see two film adaptations of it the same day.  Very interesting -- a little strange, in fact -- experience.As an adaptation, I think the Ratner and Tally did a good job, but Manhunter shows it could have been vastly better (though Red Dragon's ending was better than Manhunter's).  As a stand-alone movie, definitely better than average.  I recognize why for time compression certain parts of the book were left out or condensed, but I thought overall the film moved too quickly to achieve its principle goals, mainly (a) expressing the frustration at figuring out Dolarhyde's m.o., and (b) catching Dolarhyde's crucial dichotomy.  It achieved the second better than Manhunter, certainly, but it tanked in comparison on the first.  Changing Graham's family dynamic was a big mistake, because it helped as much as anything to define Graham's personality and situation.  (Plus it just set up even more the significance of Molly's actions at the very end regarding Dolarhyde.)My biggest beef is with the casting, though.  Odd at first blush, I know, because it's obviously a great cast of actors, and ones I really like; I just didn't buy them in these particular roles (or at least with the direction they received from Ratner).  Most especially I didn't buy Norton as Graham, as I knew I wouldn't.  Norton always does at least a good job, but he wasn't old enough, damaged enough, or bitter enough to be Graham. Graham is an old, tortured, moody soul and Norton is just too young and played him too casually for my taste.  William Peterson was just damn near perfect for that role, and I think it would have been a coup to get him back for it.  Hopkins scaled down nicely from Hannibal, but he was still too aware that he was playing The Role.  Still a little too self-conscious and hammy for me.  I do think Ralph Fiennes was a damn good cast for Dolarhyde, and he plays it well, but I think he needed more time to develop than the movie allowed.  Plus, almost as important, he wasn't ugly enough. Ultimately it's his facial disfigurement which puts him on his destructive path, and he has ... a bad scar on his lip.  I understood from the book that his nose was severely messed up, too, and he'd had failed surgery using sixty-year-old techniques.  I mean, there's a reason the other kids called him ""c**t face"": His face is a hard thing to look at.  Fiennes wasn't hard to look at.  He just looked too pretty still in the movie for that to be the momentous, singular motivation it was supposed to be.As for the minor characters, Emily Watson did a good job as Reba, but they made the Reba character weaker than she was in the book or Manhunter (Joan Allen was better), which hurt the story for me because it was largely that attitude that made her relationship with Dolarhyde possible.  She had attitude in the book that she lacked in the film.  (And a minor quibble: Someone needs to tell actors that blind people don't walk around looking perpetually amazed.)  The worst casting choice, though, in my opinion, was Philip Seymour Hoffman for Lounds.  I like Hoffman, but I thought he was completely wrong for Lounds not only physically but in demeanor as well. Lounds in the book is an old, gruff, aggressively desperate almost con man, an irritating, insinuating firecracker, not the young, mumbling sloth that Hoffman portrayed him as.  I think Scott Glenn made a better Crawford than Keitel, too, but Dennis Farina trumps them both in Manhunter.  Keitel's too... big ... for that role.  He's not subtle enough, I guess.  Crawford's a poker player of men; Keitel's ... well, he's a Bad Lieutenant.  Like my friend Jason says, he's a tough guy.)So overall -- I am mixed.  It was a good movie -- I'm giving it 7 out of 10 stars -- but I'm disappointed in the adaptation. It just didn't capture the spirit of the book or the characters nearly as well as it could have, as Manhunter is solid proof.  The perfect adaptation would be Manhunter with Red Dragon's Dolarhyde/Reba story, Fiennes and Joan Allen playing the respective parts, with the ending as staged in the book.  Both movies change that up to their detriment.  Red Dragon is closest on that score, but watch Manhunter if you want to get the best feel for the whole story.",Red Dragon

Ralph Fiennes was fabulous as Dollarhyde, he just oozed an abused and tortured innerself and was incredibly entertaining. Hopkins was, well... Hannibal! He seemed less inspired than his incredible performance in SOTL and Hannibal, but no where near as lazy and phoned in as he was in Dracula. Ratner seemingly tried to go the route using the least amount of gore possible, but in many ways failed to achieve much by hitting dolby scares, and by going overtly art house in some scenes.

How so? Reading the comments it seems it's because people are placing this in the ""trilogy"" of Lecter movies staring Anthony Hopkins, and within the trilogy starring Anthony Hopkins, yes, it's better than Hannibal. But, I don't think these people know that Manhunter exists, and their understanding of film history is lacking, because a) this really isn't a Lecter movie, b) there is no ""trilogy"", because they're out of sequence, c) they clearly haven't seen Manhunter.Manhunter, the first movie adaptation of a Thomas Harris novel with Lecter, is easily as good as Silence of the Lambs, and way better than Red Dragon. I could go on a long rant about things, but it's really quite simple.1) Michael Mann's version is better than Bret Ratners, better direction, pacing, thrill moments and visual wonder.2) William Petersen's ""Will Graham"" is far more complex, thoughtful, deep and compelling than Edward Norton's attempt.3) Tom Noonan is a far more scary ""Francis Dollarhyde"" than Ralph Fiennes.4) Dennis Farina is far more watchable in the role of Jack Crawford than Harvey Keitel.5) Joan Allen, in the role of Reba McClane, is much more believable as a blind woman than Emily Watson, who thinks staring straight ahead is all it takes.

Similarly, Ralph Fiennes portrays a sociopath incredibly well.  Between him and Buffalo Bill (of 'Silence' fame), Fiennes' character easily wins out as the most intriguing of the two.  Of course, Anthony Hopkins reprises his role with yet another terrific performance.  There's no question that 'Red Dragon' is better than 'Hannibal,' and easily steps up to the lofty heights achieved by 'The Silence of the Lambs.'

290,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,What? No Inaga Davida?,7,5 October 2002,"Ok, so apart  from that track O didn't really miss Michael Mann's music of choice for his 1986 Red Dragon adaptation Manhunter (and I REALLY didn't miss Strong As I Am). Manhunter's one of those films which always inspires useless debate among fans and detractors. Is it an overly glossy 80s thriller or an almost visionary film on the ability to empathize with evil and its consequences? Is it better than Silence Of The Lambs? Is Brain Cox' calculating sophisticated Lecktor (yes, that's how it's spelled in that film) better than OTT-Anthony's Lecter? Whichever way you feel about the answers, I always thought Manhunter's protagonist, Will Graham, was a million times more interesting than Clarice Starling and the same goes for Manhunter's serial killer on-the-loose, the Toothfairy. Still, Strong As I Am IS a godawful piece of music.....So I was never entirely opposed to the idea of a remake (from source material). Especially since Manhunter leaves at least one hugely fascinating aspect of Thomas Harris novel untapped (that whole red dragon-thing). And when Hannibal, which turned a thriller into a twisted romance-cum-hamfest, made a gazillion dollars, you knew it was going to happen. It's not as though Harris churns out the Lecter novels at the speed of light. So then Silence-scripter Ted Tally became involved. He would no doubt turn (and in fact has turned) a sickening subject to something acceptable to your average middle-aged, middle-class and generally jolly suburbian. And when you put the not-too-heavyweight Brett Ratner behind the camera, you know what this movie is going for: the crowd-pleasing approach. The ending in particular (much like SOTL's) is a typical set-piece, devoid of thematic interest. Also, Hannibal is now onscreen for 20 minutes, whilst the movie really only requires him for 10. That's a shame, because I still believe that somewhere in Red Dragon is the story of the dehumanizing detective and the humanizing serial killer or at least something more than 120 minutes of tension.The main problem I have with the film is that neither screenwriter nor director seem to connect with the Will Graham character. Thus the theme of his ability to empathize with serial killer, which is predominant in Manhunter, is mentioned but never really developed. When he goes to talk with his mentor/ nemesis, Hannibal, the sense of fear is not one of being confronted with his own innate capacity for evil, but it's one springing from the pretty rational fear you'd have for someone who stabbed and almost killed you. There are little touches here and there that add to that idea. For instance, in Manhunter's first scene the photos of the murdered families become a threat. In this film, they're merely shown. Also, a crucial sequence in Manhunter features Graham walking through the victims' house talking to himself as though he's the killer. It is completely absent here. The fact Ed Norton chooses to play Graham more internally than William Petersen isn't necessarily a wrong one, but because of Ratner's reliance of two-shot set-ups, it doesn't really work either. And that's the film's second problem, sometimes you feel Ratner isn't really helping his cast with his fondness of the close-up. This is a shame, because the acting is pretty good. Hopkins is more angry than he's ever been and he isn't half as hammy as the trailers make him appear. Still, the stand-outs are Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson. Their scenes together are the hightlights of the film.And there's more good to be had. The addition of the opening sequence and the climax may have been misjudged in my opinion, but the addition of the Toothfairy's connection with the Red Dragon is essential. And his scene with the piece itself is a corker. Far more relevant however is the fact that no matter which way you look at it, Red Dragon is tense. Especially when Fiennes make his entrance into the film.So what you have here is a film that seen as entertainment is simply very good. On a deeper level, only the development of the Toothfairy makes it interesting and the handling of Graham is a bit weak, but who's going to look deeper when a film's more than entertaining enough for two hours? Oh, and did I mention it doesn't have Strong As I Am in it?Rating: 7/10",Red Dragon

Compared to William Petersen Edward Norton is like Dustin Hoffman that fight with the dragon!!! And if you look to the ending scene you can see a real resemblance",Red Dragon
292,elroy_geronimo,Couldn't help feeling ripped off,7,6 October 2002,"Of course I had seen Manhunter before I saw Red dragon, so I knew what I was in for, but it was promoted as a Hannibal Lecter Prequel and instead you get a Lecter spin-off. It is a great movie, but it left me wondering about a real Lecter prequel. Will it ever be made? Will we  ever see the killing spree that lead to the beginning of Red Dragon and the fear of Hannibal the Cannibal ? How did he catch that main course of Oysters ? Who's liver did he eat with some Chianti ? What on earth did our beloved Hannibal do to be chained up like a rabbit animal whenever he's let out of his terrifying fiberglass cage ? I think many out there will agree with me ; I want to see the original Lecter killing spree !!!!! Director suggestions : Sam Raimi, Ridley Scott or Brian Yuzna. Hey it's just a thought!SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CINEMAS, MOVIES ARE MADE FOR THE BIG SCREEN !!",Red Dragon

294,chrisforeman-01920,Surprisingly good,8,7 November 2021,"I was always going to be a tough audience for this film. Manhunter is one of my all time favourites so you always tend to be a bit sniffy about remakes. But this was a great surprise. The cast are great , the plot moves along nicely. The one thing I will say, Manhunter is still the better film but Red Dragon has the better ending.",Red Dragon
295,Justin Harris,Not as good as 'Silence' but much better than 'Hannibal',7,6 October 2002,"Just got back from seeing 'Red Dragon'. It was exactly as I thought it would be. Entertaining with terrific performances, however not as good as 'The Silence of the Lambs'. While it's not as good as 'Silence', the movie is much, much better than last year's disappointing 'Hannibal'. I've noticed that many people have compared 'Red Dragon' to 'Manhunter', but I don't see why--they're not the same movie. Both are good in their own ways. 'Red Dragon' is a worthy film to see, especially if you're a fan of the Hannibal Lecter series.My score: 7.5 out of 10 (More than just a good movie)",Red Dragon
296,slimebitch,"Omg, this is so wrong!",1,23 January 2007,"I have now seen ""Red Dragon"" twice. I must say that was a huge mistake! I have seen Manhunter (the original ""Red Dragon"" movie) 5 or 6 times. The whole point with Manhunter is to show the world what kind of a man Will Graham, William Petersen is. We get to see that he is smart. He is different thinking. He is thinking exactly like a killer would think in order to catch the killers. I am not sure weather Edward Norton is doing such a bad job on purpose or if it is just the script? He is probably doing his very best, but after seeing the original movie, this makes me sick. I was 9 or 10 the first time I watched ""Silence of the lambs"", just watched ""Hannibal"" a couple of years back and thought to myself that I loved them. ""Silence of the lambs"" is more than great! Jodie Foster as (agent Starling) is doing a great job and she and Anthony Hopkins work great together. And, a big and this is, the atmosphere is there. The atmosphere that makes you scared. But off course it did. I was young back then, watching a scary movie. But I still think ""Silence of the lambs"" is great. What my point is about ""Red Dragon"" being so bad is that this is not only a remake of ""Manhunter""! This is a disaster! What makes ""Manhunter"" what it is, is probably because of Michael Mann, the man behind ""Miami Vice"". Like ""Miami Vice"", ""Manhunter"" has a special feeling to it. This is a story told for those interested to watch it, not because it is about a 3 hours long movie, but it is told the way it is. What makes ""Manhunter"" the better version of this movie is that the story is not short and cut off like ""Red Dragon"" is. This remake feels more like Anthony Hopkins wanted to play Hannibal once again only because Brian Cox did it in ""Manhunter"". The thing is that I have seen Edward Norton doing a great job in ""American History X"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Primal Fear"" and I am ashamed of what I have seen here. This remake feels cut off. Most of the original story is missing, the important stuff like who is Will Graham and what does he do? I noticed that clues that kind of melts in and slowly shows up in ""Manhunter"" are just there in ""Red Dragon"", this is bad. No, I didn't see it. I stared at the screen and could still not see it. Where was it and what was it. Now this makes me mad! I have always been a huge fan of most of the big names in ""Red Dragon"", Anthony Hopkins used to do such a great job, but now he feels more like a slob. Brian Cox is doing a lot better because Hannibal is supposed to be ice cold and selfish. Ralph Fiennes, I saw ""The Constant Gardener"" just the other day and loved it. I have seen other movies as well with him, but he to made me very disappointed here. His role as Francis Dolarhyde was not very convincing in my opinion and he didn't manage to scare me one bit. His eyes may be to honest or something, but it didn't his the right spot. In order to see my point here, you need to see ""Manhunter"". I promise after seeing ""Manhunter"" 5 or 6 times and now this disaster twice, I tried to not look to much on ""Manhunter"" story, but it is impossible to not see all the things that is missing, cut away and the new stuff added that feels like a huge mistake. The ending was different from ""Manhunter"", but not really to the better. So many things are not right here! Why make a bad remake of something brilliant?",Red Dragon
297,pinkeye,"Good, but not nearly as good as Manhunter.",6,4 October 2002,"Yes, this film had a lot more money and it had Anthony Hopkins but the film that it remade, Manhunter was just superior. I thought William Peterson made a much better Will Grahm, I just felt him a lot more...also Tom Noonan made a MUCH creepier Francis Dolarhyde. If I had never seen the original I would have thought Red Dragon was excellent but there was a vibe in Manhunter that Red Dragon just didn't have.",Red Dragon
298,tenn-noodlehead,Enjoyable movie overall,9,6 October 2002,"Okay, Red Dragon was the only one of the Thomas Harris books I've ever read, and that was a long time ago.  I also caught Manhunter one night on satellite.  I remember it as being a good movie, but it's been awhile.  I went into this movie with expecting a lot and I think it delivered.  The cast is excellent, the pacing good.  The villains are creepy and Norton does a good performance, although not his best.  I think this movie was much better than Hannibal, although maybe not as good as Silence.",Red Dragon
299,Bgb217,"Excellent film, also an excellent adaption of the book.",10,10 November 2002,"Well I finally saw Red Dragon, and having the book be one of the best I've ever read, I was wary of seeing it. I never really cared for Manhunter, but boy did I get a surprise with this version, a version that actually cared enough about the original work to call it by that name, obviously Red Dragon. I also thought that they would change it around to put more of everybody's favorite cannibal in, which they really didn't. So he's in the beginning more, but that was what basically happened in flashback in the book, they only drew it out more in the movie. And the other scenes with Hannibal that were added helped to cover all the ground they needed to do with the story, and they worked perfectly. Let me explain. Who woulda thunk it that Ed Norton would be the perfect fit for Will Graham? I didn't, but he was. I think he's such an incredible actor, and he more than proves it here, bringing the character to a great and realistic life. Of course we need not say anything about Anthony Hopkins, who is more than the brillant fit for Hannibal Lector. But Ralph Fiennes as Dolarhyde? I thought that was a really bad choice-- I was proved wrong there again. He gives such a performance as the Tooth Fairy that I now believe he was perfect, and did perfect in, for the part. Emily Watson as Reba was also incredible, as was all the other supporters. The actual shots of the movie were incredible, and along with the rather brillaint script it worked perfectly. Of course some things were changed, but little things, and not much. And not a single changed thing took away from the original story, I am astounded at how good an adaption this turned out to be. (And I usually am very unforgiving with film versions of great books).  In conclusion, Red Dragon is a great film. Brilliant performances and an excellent adaption of a screenplay play out perfectly in this incredible film. Did the novel it's very deserved justice in my opinion. And the ending, the final part, of course it wasn't in the book, but that was incredible! Loved what they did there!",Red Dragon
300,jerieg,Let's go to the scoreboard..,5,6 October 2002,"Without any point of reference, Red Dragon the movie is a quite forgettable little thriller that just doesn't quite work.Taken in context however, since one cannot help but compare it with either the novel Red Dragon, or the movie Manhunter, or both, the movie Red Dragon becomes just an excuse to parade Anthony Hopkins out once again as Hannibal Lector. I can't compare him to Brian Cox, who played Hannibal in Manhunter, since Anthony got some bigger scenes to chew on. Anthony wins by default..Will Graham, who, as written, and as should be played, is an intense, quiet man almost literally haunted by his preternaturally empathic abilities. Ed Norton plays him as Beaver Cleaver channeling Clarice Starling. William Peterson one, Ed Norton, nothing..Harvey Keitel and Mary Louise Parker are as forgettable here as the actors who played the same characters in Manhunter. Tie score 0-0..Emily Watson and Joan Allen? Both fine with what little they had to do, although I know the tiger scene was infinitely sexier, darker and deeper in Manhunter than in Red Dragon...so Manhunter hits the home run while Red Dragon strikes out.Now on the field, Dolarhyde. As played by Tom Noonan in Manhunter, he was a shy, sensitive, insecure, seemingly sweet big hunk of a lunk who had no clue that women found him attractive. One could feel his growing trust and attachment to Joan Allen's character; one could see that he was tearing himself apart with his old and new agendas.....as played by Ralph Fiennes, Dolarhyde is a cold, imperious, socially impaired, openly hostile snob nobody would ever want to sleep with or talk to, much less deal with in the capacity of the relatively high level job he is supposed to have. Gooooooooooooooooooooooal, Tom.Philip Seymour Hoffman loses screen time in Red Dragon compared to whoever played the character in Manhunter, thus loses any chance of being memorable, since I did actually forget about him till now.All in all, a rather lame game played for Lector appeal and little else. And the whole point is that I really didn't like Manhunter all that much to begin with. But Red Dragon has made me realize how good a movie Manhunter was, false ending and all.",Red Dragon

Pros: * Fun to see dr Lecter again * Some good acting (Edward Norton, Emily Watson and the excellent PhilipSeymour Hoffman) * Nice cinematography. Same look and feel as ""Silence of the Lambs"" Cons: * Sloppy, cliché-ridden script. * Ralph Fiennes as the villain: not scary, just boring. * Anthony Hopkins does seem a little tired. * Guy who plays Dr Chilton is really ridiculous.

The soundtrack perfect, and of course, Anthony Hopkins flawless as the too-easy-for-him-to-play Hannibal Lechter.  What a racket for him!

Outstanding performances by some outstanding actors top to bottom.Hopkins, Norton, Fiennes are absolutely awesome in this. Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Phillip Seymore Hoffman also add some nice performances.I think Hollywood didn't give enough acclaim to this movie because Brett Ratner is such a young and unproven director (and it closely follows the book), but he nailed this one.If you haven't seen this and you enjoyed any of the others, do yourself a favor and watch it.

It's great seeing Hoffmann inject a few smiles into a film with no laughs.I was left feeling an outstanding cast had just earned their daily bread with little to write home about.

310,mjanky,"Not bad, but certainly not great",7,20 October 2002,"I purposefully did not read any reviews of Red Dragon, professional or amateur, simply because I wanted to experience it with no knowledge of the plot, so I won't give anything away here. SOTL is one of my top ten of all time and hold it as the standard that all psyche-thrillers are held to, and while Red Dragon isn't a bad movie, it pales in comparison to SOTL. Edward Norton in the lead role as Will Graham, an FBI profiler, does a good job, but never really seems very emotional about everything going on around him. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lechter, who is, with the exception of Dracula, probably the most sinister film character of all time, but here he doesn't seem as dangerous, just conniving. It's almost as though he's someone else doing an Anthony Hopkins impersonation of Lechter. At least this performance wasn't as cartoon-y as it was in 'Hannibal' the second installment of the trilogy. Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford replaces Scott Glenn and he's missed. I'm a big Keitel fan, but he's kind of wasted here. Ralph Feinnes is pretty good as 'The Tooth Fairy' the killer, but again he doesn't seem nearly as demented as Buffalo Bill from Lambs. The brightest spots of the movie are Emily Watson's performance as Reba McClane, Feinne's love interest and Phillip Seymore Hoffman as Feddy Lounds a sleazy tabloid reporter.The movie tells a good story but the acting seems to hold it back. It's definitely suspenseful, but not eerie, which Lambs did such a good job of combining. I hate to keep comparing the two movies, but if the film-makers want to sell the movie as good as Silence Of The Lambs, it seems they could and should have worked harder. 7 of 10 stars.",Red Dragon
311,Ziman,Great 1st part of the trilogy,8,6 October 2002,"First up, let me say that Red Dragon is improperly being defined as a prequel. Yes, it's true that it takes place in the early-80s, before the events of Silence of the Lambs, but with the exception of one small moment in the film, there is no plotline to suggest a connection with it's 1991 counterpart. - Red Dragon is a story that stands alone.In fact, it's better defined as a remake. a remake of an even earlier film, Manhunter --the 1986 movie also based on Thomas Harris' novel, Red Dragon. But more to how it compares to Manhunter later...Red Dragon depicts story of Will Graham, a former FBI agent whose profiling skills made it possible to capture the notorious Hannibal Lecter. Graham is asked by the FBI to assist in a case of recent family killings by an unknown assailant dubbed as `The Tooth Fairy'. Graham facilitates Lecter's psychoanalysis expertise to attempt to find the person responsible for these killings.When the film project for Red Dragon was announced, not long after the release of Hannibal last year, Anthony Hopkins originally turned down the part of Hannibal Lecter, and the role was rumoured to have been filled by Jude Law. However to audiences, Hopkins *IS* Hannibal Lecter. He made the role what it is, and what we expect. Not to Law's discredit, but to please audiences, he would only have to imitate Hopkins' performance, and that would cheapen the role. VERY fortunately Hopkins reconsidered and chose to play the role again for Red Dragon. The charisma and distinctiveness he gave Lecter in Silence of the Lambs (which somehow got lost in Hannibal) he has brought front and center again in Red Dragon.As for the other roles in the film; Edward Norton plays a very convincing and determined Will Graham, ex-FBI agent who reluctantly returns under the FBI employ one more time. Emily Watson plays her role of a blind woman quite believably (I even noticed the attention to detail in her dilated pupils, even during bright light conditions, which brought a hint of realism and made the role that much more convincing -- and serves to offer an undertone of how wide open her eyes are, but cannot see what's directly in front of her). However the true shine in this film is Ralph (Pronounced 'Rafe') Fiennes. He plays his role superbly. There exists a lot of passion, and mental anguish within his character, but Fiennes makes it all 100% believable. Arguably, this is Fiennes' best on-screen performance.
Red Dragon brings to us the type of thriller that Silence of the Lambs was known for and that we were denied of in Hannibal. As I mentioned, it's a remake of Manhunter... but it's much more than a remake.
The 1986 Manhunter has been floating around on VHS rental shelves for years, but was little known until Hannibal was about to be released in theatres last year. The idea to capitalize on the Hannibal franchise spawned Anchor Bay to release a 2-disc DVD limited edition, and a VHS re-release of Manhunter.Red Dragon is a remake of Manhunter similar to how Gus Van Sant remade Psycho in 1998. Van Sant made a shot-for-shot, and line-for-line remake of Psycho, and Red Dragon seemingly remakes some of the shots from Manhunter... but only because those particular shots happen to work in its favour.In fact, I'd argue that Red Dragon takes all of the best elements of Manhunter, and improves on them. It also uses some of the same effective dialogue, but since the source material for both IS Harris' novel, it stands to reason. However it discards what I recall as the weak components from Manhunter and recreates some of it's own, going over the top to give us the thriller we've been expecting since the anticipation of Hannibal (which to me was a mere gore and action flick).I saw Manhunter about 6 or 7 years ago... and as such I already knew how the story was to unfold as I was viewing Red Dragon. However, I still found myself chilled at the imagery and at the revelations of the story as it was being told.If you have already seen Manhunter, you'll see reflections of it in Red Dragon, but you will be watching a much better film at the same time. If you have not yet seen Manhunter, then I suggest you avoid it all together, and go straight to see Red Dragon. It's a much better written, better acted, and all around better telling of the same story.Perhaps, if you're really interested in comparing the two, rent a copy of Manhunter on your way home from seeing Red Dragon.What I also found interesting, in relation to the franchise, is that Red Dragon could EASILY be placed before Silence of the Lambs... but NOT as a prequel, but rather as a movie that preceded it. Red Dragon is much more like the first of a trilogy, and that Silence of the Lambs is a sequel to it. (Note the difference: a prequel is positioned into the time-line after the fact and feeds on information from the stories we already know will follow it -- whereas a sequel feeds on the story the came before it, often borrowing from and re-creating familiarities we have of it.)
Red Dragon sets the tone for what Silence of the Lambs would follow in sequence, format, and style but it does not show the 'roots' of where Silence of the Lambs would lead, as a prequel would require. I found Red Dragon to be VERY cleverly written and produced and it pulls off its placement as the first of the trilogy VERY nicely, even though it may not have been the original intent. Red Dragon is a definite must-see. and doubly-so if you are a fan of Silence of the Lambs.",Red Dragon
312,guy_lazarus,A nearly scene-for-scene remake of Manhunter disappoints despite stellar cast,5,18 November 2004,"I can't believe that the reviewers who have also seen Michael Mann's 1986 version of Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon fail to point out that, except for the ending, this movie is a nearly scene-for-scene remake of the Mann flick. I watched Manhunter after Red Dragon, and I was shocked by how blatant the remake was; except for fleshing out the relationship between Graham and Lecktor/Lecter and adding a flashback to their joint past, this movie IS Manhunter, right down to the flaming body in the wheelchair and listening to the heartbeat of the tiger. I cannot believe that Michael Mann does not get a writing credit on this film since many of the lines in the two films are identical. I feel that Manhunter is the superior film, but Red Dragon was a good view, though it ultimately proved disappointing despite its stellar cast. Anticipating something wonderful when thinking of this great cast with at least 10 Oscar nominations between the five lead players, I was dismayed that Red Dragon didn't deliver more.I rate this two and a-half stars (5 out of 10) while Manhunter came in at three to three and a-half (8 out of 10). Face it: Michael Mann is a much better director than Brett Ratner, and the journeyman William Petersen is just more comfortable, just more right playing an FBI agent than is Edward Norton. Norton is a potentially great actor, but he just doesn't have the cajonnnes in this incarnation to make a convincing cop. He was too flighty, too lightweight; he would have been better in the role if he had pumped up, like his memorable turn in American History X.That said, Anthony Hopkins was BORN to play Hannibal Lecter. He elevates the role to something Shakespearian, and the film would be worth seeing just for that.",Red Dragon
313,existenz-6,Mediocre Through and Through,1,4 October 2002,"Although technically competent, this thriller in no way lives up to the precedents set by ""Manhunter"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"".  Yes, it's better than the incredibly inept ""Hannibal"", but that doesn't mean anything in my book.  A lot of movies are better than ""Hannibal"".  A lot of BAD movies are better than ""Hannibal"".  Including this one.If you haven't seen this movie, skip it.  Go rent ""Manhunter"" instead. It's a much better adaptation of the novel, imbued with the stylish touch of director Michael Mann.  Brett Ratner's ""Red Dragon"" is an unambitious adaptation that stays true to book on a literal level, while forgetting to include all the character turmoil that makes these kinds of movies compelling.  Here's a good analogy:  which adaptation of ""The Shining"" was better -- Kubrick's version with Jack Nicholson, or the Stephen King-approved TV miniseries from a few years ago?  Kubrick's, of course. The miniseries stayed closer to the book, as does ""Red Dragon"", but it didn't have style, it didn't have a soul, and it wasn't scary.  ""Red Dragon"" shares all of these problems.  It isn't the kind of movie you will think about after you leave the theatre.Here's my specific complaints about the movie:Edward Norton was completely miscast.  He doesn't come across as a tough, tormented FBI agent with an ability (or should I say a ""curse"") to empathize with serial killers.  Instead he seems like a smart but wimpy guy who isn't really sure why he is here.  He isn't a haunted character at all. William Petersen was perfect in this role, and I can imagine plenty of other leading men who could take it on.  Edward Norton's a great actor, but he doesn't fit.Ralph Fiennes isn't scary.  The movie spends more time empathizing with him, and showing him to be an okay guy, than it does establishing how horrible he is.  We see him romance Emily Watson, even bringing her to a zoo so she can pet (or should I say grope) a sleeping tiger.  He is a killer because he was abused, of course, and the only two people we actually see him kill are unlikable people anyway.  The two families that he kills are forgotten by the middle of the movie.  I'm not saying bad guys should be 100% evil, but by the end of the movie I thought he just a few psychiatry sessions away from being normal again.  Compare that to Tom Noonan in ""Manhunter"" -- no amount of therapy would fix that dude, only a well-aimed bullet.The movie has no visual flair.  Nice colors, nice composition, but the visuals don't have any depth or reverberance.  The burning wheelchair scene is incredibly bland.Hopkins is better than he was in ""Hannibal"", but he still hams it up. This character just isn't scary any more.  Still, he'd be an amusing party guest.",Red Dragon
314,yucel81x,A semi-biased review...,5,18 October 2002,"""Red Dragon"" is the second attempt at a film adaptation of the first book in Thomas Harris' ""Hannibal Lecter"" trilogy...the first being ""Manhunter,"" from 1986. Since I am a fan of ""Manhunter,"" comparisons were inevitable for me...so I have to say right away that this review will be biased and somewhat scathing to ""Red Dragon.""First the pros: -The production...as dark and as macabre as ""Silence of the Lambs."" Director Brett Ratner has successful captured the decrepit atmosphere of the now-classic ""Silence..."" perfectly, from the semi-decaying settings to the intense contrast between light and dark. -Ralph Fiennes is wonderful as the psychopathic Francis Dollarhyde. From his blank facial expressions to the huge tattoo on his back and the scar on his lip, to his mannerisms and speech, he is playing a perfect psycho. He is far scarier than Anthony Hopkins is.Those are the only good things I can really think of...now for the cons: -Bad portrayal of the characters. Edward Norton as Will Graham is set up from the very beginning to be a psychologically troubled, slightly crazy investigator, but he fails to deliver. As the man who caught Hannibal Lecter (rather bloodily), and who went to a mental ward subsequently (as told by press clippings in the opening credits), you'd think he would be more morbid and introspective...not the case. Instead, he seems very enthusiastic about solving the case and getting to the end. His conversations with Lecter are not nearly as tense as they should be. His apprehension about returning to the FBI is not as heartfelt as it should be. Overall, the character was turned from a very intense one into the quintessential cop. Harvey Keitel is competent as Jack Crawford, but rather uninteresting...he seems in the background most of the time and hardly active at all. And Anthony Hopkins is too comfortable in the role of Hannibal. From the past two movies, we know what to expect from him. His scary expressions and actions are no longer scary...rather, they invoke a smile and even a chuckle from the audience. He's too charming, too witty, too...too Hannibal. It's just not scary anymore. And Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the part of Freddie Lounds (who was supposed to be a loud-mouth, annoying jerk) as if he were half asleep. He is the least interesting character overall. -Not sure if it was a bad script or bad direction. Much of the dialogue is the same as in the book and in ""Manhunter,"" but it does not come across nearly as well as it should. It seems uninteresting and bland. One might think I feel this way because I know it from the book and ""Manhunter,"" but everytime I go back to them, it always seems worth reading and hearing...in ""Red Dragon,"" it's quite the opposite. -Different ending. The ending in ""Red Dragon"" is rather typical...just when you think the bad guy is dead, he comes back. Just when you think his evil has been established, we invoke a moment of sympathy where we're supposed to feel sorry for him (Norton's character certainly did), and it's all done in a blaze of fire and gunshots. -Final con...when I saw the film, the audience was mostly 30-40-year-olds...you know there's a problem when a movie that's supposed to be psychologically disturbing makes this crowd bust out laughing.""Manhunter"" may have suffered from the dated '80's atmosphere, but it stands the test of time. The script is so well-adapted and the characters so three-dimensional that even though we know the outcome, it's always interesting and satisfying. The scene where Will Graham discovers how Dollarhyde picks his victims is so quick and unspectacular in ""Red Dragon,"" that one wonders if it was worth the trouble. In ""Manhunter,"" it is a highpoint of the movie when Will uses his skills of deduction to realize this crucial element to catching the killer. The scene when Dollarhyde tortures Lounds is silently frightening in ""Manhunter,"" whereas here, the scene had to be made weirder by taking Lounds' clothes off. As if the soliloquoy from Dollarhyde about being ""The Dragon"" wasn't strange and scary enough?Comparisons aside, ""Red Dragon"" is a movie to see if you haven't seen ""Manhunter"" or read the book. Without this bias, it can seem like a rather enjoyable and even scary movie. However, most people I know who've seen ""Manhunter"" love it despite the dated nature of the production design (seem director of photography Dante Spinotti worked on both versions).

316,christinedesler,Soooooo cool!,10,5 October 2002,"""Man Hunter"" was a total bombshell.  A total fluke.  Red Dragon is the exact opposite!  I'm sure I may be a little biased.  I saw both ""Silence of the lambs"" and ""hannibal"" before I saw ""Man hunter"", and the fact that Anthony Hopkins is in this one certainly had something to do with my insistency on seeing this movie opening weekend *Grins*This movie has everything the first one didn't.  Top-rate acting, a true feeling of suspense, and just more LECTER!!!!!!!!!There are such funny parts.  Such as Hannibal trying to make a joke about what is in some certain food he's made fot the board of the Philamonic orchestra... and then of course in the end where doctor Chilton tells Hannibal he has a certain female visitor.  Oh, I hope that everyone goes out and loves it as much as I did!  The adds were right.  I didn't have high hopes for this movie, but seeing it with another Lecterfile certainly helped me a bit.

317,imdbfilmcricket,"It's ok, but it can't stand up against ""Lambs""",7,5 October 2002,"Red Dragon is remarkably faithful to Thomas Harris' best-selling novel but that's probably the best thing I can say about it.  It may be unfair to compare it to Jonathan Demme's excellent Silence of the Lambs but this being real life, there's no way it will escape (or survive) that comparison. That's a shame, because it's not a bad film.  It's ok, but naturally we prefer to see things that are better than just ok.Why does it suffer so much in comparison?  Acting, direction and script. Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) in Lambs is presented as someone with whom we can empathize.  Her struggles and her fears are ours.  That is not the case with Dragon's Will Graham (Edward Norton).  Even though Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) almost kills Graham about 10 minutes into the film, the subsequent meetings between the two lack the intensity and power that Demme brought to comparable interactions between his two leading actors.
Director Brett Ratner does a workman-like job but this film simply does not have the necessary depth or resonance to involve us.",Red Dragon
318,ravenwood80,The Prequel,8,11 January 2007,"Finally Managed to watch this thriller from the mind of Thomas Harris this week. I am a great fan of the original, Manhunter, so was in two minds about watching this. I was actually happy with this film, its both quite close to the Michael Mann picture, but with enough differences to keep you watching. The Movie stars some of the worlds very best actors. Ed Norton is his usual brilliant self as the young and brilliant detective Will Graham. Hopkins is great as the menacing Hannibal, and Fiennes is great as the puddled tooth fairy. Brett Ratner has remade the film well, and even though the the film isn't as dark as the 80's original it still stands well. Having said all this I still prefer Manhunter as It was quite a scary thriller when I was young, but this movie is highly recommended, for those who have or haven't seen Manhunter.",Red Dragon

He has ZERO charisma with his wife, a key plot ingredient. In ""Manhunter"" this was a very powerful plot stimulus.. The early years of Lector were very effective. I gave this a five, not because it was so bad, but because it could have easily been so much better.Norton sucks, everybody else GREAT!",Red Dragon
320,couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn,Movie worthy of being the prequel to 'Silence of the Lambs',9,1 October 2002,"As a big fan of the movie 'Silence of the Lambs', I was very excited to see in the preview that 'Red Dragon' had recruited the acting talents of Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes. I had little fear that they would disappoint me, and upon finishing the movie, I can say that my guess was right.
The movie is about the investigation of a serial killer(Francis Dolarhyde, played by Ralph Fiennes) by the reluctant FBI agent who put Lecter behind his glass cage(Will Graham, played by Edward Norton). Pressed for time before the serial killer sets his eyes on another family to slaughter, Graham is asked to consult with Lecter to try to help understand the motives of the serial killer. But rather than freeing him of the responsibilities of the case, Graham becomes more involved with the investigation with Lecter's involvement. With his efforts at investigation, Graham manages to anger Dolarhyde, who sets his sights on destroying Graham and his family.
Almost everything about 'Red Dragon' was perfect. The director, the actors, and the music score was especially excellent. The pacing and all the aforementioned qualities kept me engrossed in the movie at all times. One of the things that helped me appreciate the movie was that 'Red Dragon' shares many of the unique qualities of 'Silence of the Lambs'. Other people might dislike the obvious similarities such as the fact that both movies introduced a serial killer who wanted to become something else than what they already were, and that both has a hero/heroin who wants Lecter's cooperation during their investigation into the serial killers. The similarities are also present in the investigations themselves, which are the plot and the pace of both 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. The cycle of bribes and visits to Lecter, Lecter's hints, and discovery of new revelations seem familiar. But the prequel also has the good character developments and interesting twists that helps it to distinguish itself from 'Silence of the Lambs'. Even the old character of Hannibal Lecter shows a different side of himself in dealing with a rival who put him away, rather than a inexperienced female intern in the FBI.The main fault in the movie, in my opinion, lies in the somewhat weak script. It was ok enough to hold up most of the movie without much problems, but it fell short when they needed to develop the character of the serial killer. The story involves a needless romance between Dolarhyde and a blind woman(Reba McClane, played by Emily Watson), which seems to create a deviation from the insane man who is consumed by a desire to become a god. Maybe they meant to show the side of the killer that is still in reality, who still wants to care for someone--but the romance is abrupt and short, which makes me doubt that it would have any positive effect toward the man gone crazy enough to start killing whole families just to have an audience when he kills his women victims.Another little complaint that I had was that there could have been a better ending. Unlike the shocking twist at the end of the 'Silence of the Lambs', the ending was somewhat predictable. Although I think it could have been sufficient to end the movie, personally, I thought it could have been more interesting.But overall, it was an excellent movie. I had an enjoyable movie experience that'll stay in my memory for sometime. My neck muscles are still tense from watching the movie. Definitely go see it.",Red Dragon
321,Bobzilla85,Reviews show how cynical (and bad) the critics on this website are...,9,7 November 2002,"Reviews for this film on IMDb have gone from positive at the start to a current onslaught of trite and negative comments - half the people reviewing havn't even bothered READING the book most likely, and don't realize that Red Dragon was more faithful to the original text than Manhunt of 1986.  So please, quit calling this an inferior prequel, or saying Anthony Hopkins has passed his prime (he was excellent in this film IMO, as in all of his work). All the acting talent involved in this film did a superb job, three cheers to Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson for their portrayals of the predator and innocent prey, along with Edward Norton in a fine (if somewhat subdued) portrayal of Agent Graham.  The same can be said for the directing, some say Brett Ratner wasnt up to the job but this critic sees Red Dragon as a masterpiece of suspense and drama.  Its too bad that Red Dragon has dropped to 7.8, I myself gave the film a rating of 9 right around when it premiered and wish I could vote again to help raise it to the top 250, where it belongs.",Red Dragon

323,Shadowman82,A good thriller,8,15 May 2003,This adaption of Thomas Harris'novel ( I don't want to call it a remake of Manhunter ) is a step up from Hannibal . Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal and he is creppier than he was in Hannibal which is good but it's a bit hard to accept that this movie is supposed to take place before Silence of The Lambs with Hopkins looking considerably older here.Ed Norton plays an FBI agent who like Clarice has to enlist the help of Lecter to find the serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy . The difference here is that Norton's character is the one that put Hannibal behind bars or glass rather . The rest of the cast is also good .Director Brett Ratner is going for suspense and he succeeds allthough the film isn't quite as good as Silence .More good news comes from composer Danny Elfman who delivers a good score.,Red Dragon

Still, it did manage to keep me hooked for a long part of the way and I'm glad for that. Edward Norton and Anthony Hopkins are both good, though Feinnes as the Rad Dragon is really no great shakes. Loved that first conversation between Hopkins and Norton about the tastiest parts of the human body. I don't know if the cable version I saw had any scenes deleted because I really found nothing very gruesome in this movie, nnless it's the very idea of the killer finishing off whole families. I guess I've been spoilt by movies like Seven. And, of course, the truly horrific ending in Hannibal.",Red Dragon
325,Gordon_Six_Echo,"Good and Effective, but nowhere near Manhunter...",7,9 October 2002,"I saw ""Red Dragon"" over the weekend, and I must say that I was surprised by good it was. This has always been my favorite of the Lecter trilogy, dating back to the original novel. However, I just read the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly, which has a cover story on the making of the movie, and was jaw-droppingly displeased by some of the comments of director Brett Ratner, who seems to be going out of his way to claim himself as the greatest director alive, since he's directed the two ""Rush Hour"" movies, and now done a more ""faithful"" adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel. Ratner has made five movies, which also include 1997's ""Money Talks"" and 2000's ""The Family Man"", which I still find to be his best film to date. I think he's a talented director, but after reading this article, my admiration immediately started to decline.Ratner, who went so far as to slam director Michael Mann's far superior ""Manhunter"", the first film version of the novel that was released in 1986. Mann's movie was well received by critics, but didn't find an audience until years later on video and on DVD. I don't know if Ratner has a distaste for Mr. Mann, or any of his films, but I feel that if you're a young filmmaker, and the big break of your career happens to be that of a remake of another movie, which is in this case not a bad movie by any means, you shouldn't stick it in the original director's face. One of Ratner's comments was ""Nobody knows that movie(Manhunter)"". It was that comment alone that made me react with instant anger. Mr. Ratner, I do know the movie, because it happens to be in my DVD library.I will confess that I have been a long time fan of Michael Mann, and have found him to be one of the most bold and original directors of our time. He scopes his movies like no other director, and he pours his heart and soul into every single one of his projects. I simply think it was unfair of Mr. Ratner for saying what he said. He should appreciate the original film version and not try to act as if the movie he's made makes him better by comparison, because it doesn't.Aside from that, ""Red Dragon"" is worth seeing for it's astounding ensemble cast, particularly that of Hopkins, whom without his participation the movie would've never been done in the first place. But as for the future films of Brett Ratner, it'll have to sell itself good to make me want to see it.",Red Dragon
326,Anton_Klink,"The milking of Hopkin's Lecter does not make a movie, watch ""Manhunter"" instead",5,17 January 2003,"Having seen the two previous Lecter movies, but not having read any of the novels, I watched ""Red Dragon"" and ""Manhunter"" in a row (as you might already know, both of these movies are based on the same novel).As a movie, ""Manhunter"" was A LOT better. ""Red Dragon"" was disjointed, forced & artificial, while ""Manhunter"" was smooth, logical and stylish.""Red Dragon"" felt like the makers were desperate to cash in on Hopkin's Lecter - and indeed, Lecter was the highlight of the movie with Hopkins delivering the most chilling Lecter to date. The role has really grown to him and in ""Red Dragon"" he refines it to chilling perfection.The rest of the movie however felt like idle filling between sparse (and very obviously forcibly lengthened) Lecter scenes. Which was all the more annoying, as Lecter was in fact only a minor subplot in the move.In almost everything that ""Red Dragon"" differed from ""Manhunter"" plotwise, it was worse. While watching ""Red Dragon"", I can't remember how many times I said to myself ""that's stupid! that just doesn't happen!"" or ""that's weird? how come he got from A to B without any logical explanation?"".

328,Raiderofthelastfries,Dissapointing,1,7 October 2002,"A flat, dull move. Its loathsome the way Anthony Hopkins has turned Hannibal Lecter into a camp caricature (and casts a pall on the great Silence, more so than his performance in Hannibal because this movie is practically the same as the original). Edward Norton gives a merely okay performance that has nothing on William Peterson's superior turn in Manhunter. Quite simply he isn't developed enough for us to care much about him anyway. In order to justice to do the novel, a Red Dragon movie would have to be at least three and a half hours to cover both Graham's, and Dolarhyde's (well played by Fiennes here, though again, Tom Noonan in the original is a helluva lot more menacing) unique psychological idiosyncrasies... DO LET THE BAD REVIEWS SCARE YOU OFF. Sadly there's nothing here that hasn't been picked over in the decades since Red Dragon's publication in tv shows, or that wasn't done much better in Silence of the Lambs.

329,Raiderofthelastfries,Rise of the Faux-great movie continues,1,6 October 2002,"Red Dragon has a solid script, and a great cast but its not a great movie. It is however a good example of a faux-great movie (X-men, Signs, The Others are other examples). Faux-greats are the other type of movie that Hollywood is becoming known for after dumb, multimillion dollar blockbusters. While they appear to walk the walk, and talk the talk, they'll never amount to anything either; no matter how intelligent they seem they're still crap(movies like Fight Club, or Requiem for a Dream are superior, not simply because of their substance, but because of their style. No longer are fast cuts, and flashy visuals merely used to attract the MTV addicted; they're actually being used to tell the story). The casual viewer however may confuse Red Dragon with quality entertainment because the characters, as well as story are developed by a seemingly anonymous director (its called a Brett Ratner film, but does it have his unmistakable imprematuer? No. He's a vacuum. His style is basically ""point, shoot, and may God make the movie a hit"") in the same calm, unhurried, didactic manner as Post-Silence of the Lambs early nineties cop thrillers, or a movie of the week. Sure the snail pace, flat direction, and boring production design may seem like a relief from the more colorful styles on the rise (at least to older viewers), but the catch is that both the story and characters being developed are as fresh as the hooker with heart of gold concept. Or the gay man with aids concept. Or the psycho gay man. Or the saintly, put-upon gay man. You get the picture. This not so startling lack of imagination puts Red Dragon in a class not only well below the original Silence, but even an enjoyable, cartoony sci-fi flick like the Matrix(the only movie with bullet time, and an all black leather wardrobe I will ever acknowledge. Sorry Hollywood. You don't get kudos for stealing a look, then proceeding to overdo it like Charles Whitman on a shooting spree. Will somebody please put the color back into the X-mens' outfits?). So don't be fooled. Make this movie a flop, and you'll be rewarded ten-fold when Hollywood realizes it can't keep peddling the same stuff to us anymore. The reason this new breed of Faux-Greats imitate the more slow-burn, classical film styles of the Old, True Greats like North by Northwest, or the original Haunting is because the hacks doing the films are probably pretentious film buffs that don't realize the movies they idolize are considered great because they were actually innovative trailblazers in their time. When the Exorcist opened it sent shockwaves throughout the nation; it was a searing, bold new vision. Today its slow. It will never be shocking again, even if the story does hold up well today. Faux-Great film makers should take note of this, and maybe moviegoing today will be less like choosing the lesser of two evils: Suffer through the movie with Modren Hollywood cliches, or the one that lick Ingmar Bergman's ass (Or Hitchcock's, or Kubrick's, or are simply movies that develop all-too familiar characters slowly in an continuing effort to bottle, and mass market what Hollywood believes is the seal of true quality) and think they've created an enduring masterpiece of their own. Either way, their just going through the motions. SIDENOTE:Depressingly, the closest the nineties ever flirted with a exciting new storytelling technique was in Pulp Fiction, and Fight Club. While the existence of Requiem for a Dream, and Memento leaves me with SOME hope for the movies of this new decade, we at least will always have the power to vote with our dollars for what we want in the multiplexes. Don't cast a ballot for Red Dragon. Go see Manhunter, the original version instead. Lets all yawn in the industry's face. They've certainly had it coming.",Red Dragon
330,livstrongeva,This movie is seen differently depending if you read the book or watched Hannibal TV show.,7,24 August 2013,"After reading Hannibal's trilogy I was really looking forward to watching Red Dragon as I saw Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal before. I was surprised that Red Dragon was made later than those two movies, but I was even more surprised that they still took Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal. Don't get me wrong, Anthony Hopkins was and ever will be the perfect choice for Hannibal, but this was story before the Silence of the Lambs and well he does not look as a character from a pre-story.The movie is about how there is a murderer who targets families with beautiful mothers and kills them with smashed mirror pieces. So in order to capture the villain, FBI calls to their talented psychopath seeker Will Graham who previously had encountered and has been scarred by doctor Hannibal Lecter. Will Graham required Hannibal's help on capturing the villain so we see the two communicating quite a lot.I really would like to congratulate on choosing Ralph Fiennes on playing the bad guy. When there's a bad guy in a movie he is one of the best choices because he can portray the complexity of a maniac in all levels as here it all was because of physical looks which caused insecurity and later lead to a violent life. Which really gets me thinking how people's insecurities can run soooo deep that for them the only chance to feel happy and powerful are hurting other people. The fight for power is a dangerous thing as we are reminded here.I did not like however that they changed the ending from the book. I don't understand why there always has to be a need for a happy ending. Or the want to change the book. If there is a bad ending, it is there for a reason and sometimes it is more powerful and satisfying film-wise than the happy ending.Other than that it was quite difficult to watch this movie after watching Hannibal TV series because my mind kept drifting how it would have been portrayed with the same actors as in the TV show. But maybe we will find that out later if there will be a remake or something will be shown in the series.All in all, the movie was good, but it could have been better in my opinion.",Red Dragon

334,robertodandi,not satisfied,6,4 November 2002,"I'm not satisfied. ""The silence of the lamb"" and ""Hannibal"" are both better than this prequel. Why? First the story: is that new? I'm not referring to the fact that this is a remake of a movie (Manhunter) but that the story itself is quite dejà-vu. We have Hannibal again as a consultant, the hero that does not want to come back to work but finally he accept to exploit his great skills and courage. We have stupid ways to make the audience shocked (when the hero - Norton - checks the victims house he thinks of the murder and suddenly there are few shots with shouts and blood; when the hero interviews Hannibal when he is having a walk outside of the cell Hannibal tries to shock him - and the audience - with a simulation of a bite. Folks, here we are at the BOOO-level!!). The acting: Hannibal has no more the charme of the first Hannibal. I don't know, probably he says things I have already heard in the first two movies. Norton: I couldn't image him in the role of the good boy and maybe it is a bias I have. However his acting for the first time is not so exceptional. His character is not so... Norton, I mean it could be anyone, not Edward Norton, one of the best actor I have ever seen. Fiennes as the monster is very good, as good as Emily Watson, whose character is truly sweet and during the film we all prey God to not let her die. The final has nothing so special. It is only a link with ""The silence of the lamb"". I think ""Silence"" is the best of the trilogy, ""Hannibal"" the second best (at least is quite different from the first and there are a lot of incredibly gore deaths).

Discuss in less than 1,000 wordsI found myself going through this hypothetical as I watched the latest Lector opus 'Red Dragon'. Has old Hannibal become less of a bogeyman and more of a stand-up. One can imagine his character prowling the stage at a Vegas casino like Don Rickles handing out quips to the audience and still living off the chianti line from 'Lambs'.Perhaps I am being unfair. After this, the second sequel (or prequel or whatever), any film that follows 'Lambs' will suffer in comparison. The only immediate comparisons we can make with 'Red Dragon' is with the superior 1986 movie 'Manhunter'.At least with this version of the story, we now know how Hannibal was captured and sent Will around the bend. Some of the story elements were still the same...the video film, the tree, the fate of the reptilian journalist Lounds (better done in 'Manhunter' by the way), the blind girl romance.But Hollywood being what it is could not leave the final confrontation alone and ended up being more reminiscent of your average slasher movie with the 'twist' ending I could see coming a mile away. Also what was the deal with that final scene. My god, that brought a new definition to the word contrivance. Perhaps it was a joke between Ted Tally, Hopkins and the director that was too inside for your average audience and felt too tacked on, as if only to exploit a rather weak joke.Speaking of direction, there was no thrill element to this movie. Director Ratner seems to have no way of building up tension which is central to movie like this. I felt more tension in a wet flannel. 'Lambs' and 'Manhunter' built up this tension because you did not know what coming next. This is why the fate of Lounds was better handled in 'Manhunter' than in this movie. Build-up friends, build-up. In this version, Lounds' final fate looked more like a rag stunt gone hideously wrong.At least I could not fault the acting which was pretty good all round. Edward Norton was pretty good playing a tortured soul, but who also did silly things. Do forensic detectives actually go around redundant crime scenes at 2 'o' clock in the morning. Ralph Fiennes did psycho pretty well and played the role of sympathetic monster rather good.But if I had to compare this to the 1986 movie, I'd rather buy that version on DVD than this.Six out of ten",Red Dragon

FBI Agent Graham is repainted as fallible and vulnerable.  Tooth Fairy Dolarhyde is repainted as an abused and schizophrenic child.  Harvey Keitel adds a nice catalyst ingredient to stoke the conflict between the two.The gore is downgraded from ""Silence of the Lambs"", but there is plenty of creepy factor from the suggestive camera angles and anxious off-camera implications of horror.(Gads.  I, for one, will never send home videos to be developed at a photo lab ever again.)Extra cool: there are elements in Red Dragon that weave it nicely with Silence of the Lambs.In all: I recommend this film to all Hannibal Lecter fans.  I would rate it par with Manhunter, and one notch down from Silence of the Lambs.  It blows ""Hannibal"" away for creepy factor.8 kernels of popcorn out of 10.",Red Dragon
342,maple_leafs_kickass,Outstanding,8,10 July 2006,Anthony Hopkins reprises his Oscar winning role once more in this prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. Though it does not meet the expectations of the Silence it is truly a fine picture with Hopkins once again giving us a perfect performance as the brilliant and twisted Hannibal Lecter. Edward Norton was great as the agent with a psychological gift and Ralph Fiennes was terrifying. Still got that same chill that The Silence of the Lambs had with a terrific musical score by Danny Elfman. The story is good piecing itself together as the film carries on with a great supporting cast. All in all it's definitely worth a look.,Red Dragon
343,leereed2009,Very Good Norton and Hopkins!!!,8,16 June 2009,"This movie was just very entertaining and fun to watch. Having seen it a bunch of times and loving it every time, I know what I am talking about when I say that it keeps you entertained and having a great time. It brings back one of the most and epic and disturbingly lovable characters in cinema history, 'Dr. Hannibal Lecter', and we also get the bonus, and it's a big bonus, of Edward Norton's amazing acting skills. Why hasn't he been given an Oscar yet? Anyway, watch it and you will be in for quite a treat. Also, I read a review that said, ""better than 'Hannibal', not as good as 'Silence of the Lambs'"". Well, that is comparing apples and oranges.",Red Dragon
344,plu4085,A worthy variation,8,12 March 2006,"""Red Dragon"" was clearly better than I expected. At least around here its reception was lukewarm, both critically and commercially, and I assumed it was a case of tired Hollywood recycling. As a great fan of Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" the idea of a lame remake annoyed me quite a bit. But when I finally got around to view ""Red Dragon"", I have to say that the lack of enthusiasm for it is more puzzling than the fact that someone remade a less than 20 years old classic.The 2002 movie plot line follows the Thomas Harris' novel more closely, which is most obvious in the much more detailed account of the serial killer's background and profile. The William Blake theme is almost entirely buried in Mann's movie (perhaps too buried) while ""Red Dragon"" uses it, and the strong visual power of the painting, to great effect. The storyline is different at some crucial junctures, which makes it easier to regard them as two different movies.In favor of the original ""Manhunter"", Michael Mann's direction has a lot of flair and self-confidence, while ""Red dragon"" is less stylized and, at times, direction-by-numbers. Mann skipped the NYC museum excursion altogether, while ""Red dragon"" retains it, and it's bordering on over-plotting with this tangent. On the other hand, ""Red dragon"" benefits from a more detailed account of the FBI investigation techniques, which Mann didn't care much for.The casting isn't perfect in either movie; William Petersen was a little bland, while Edward Norton seems too young. Ralph Fiennes is an interesting choice for the ""tooth-fairy"", but despite some make-up is still too ordinary-looking for the part -- I prefer Mann's more radical choice (this point is arguable). Joan Allen was great in Mann's movie, while Emily Watson does OK, but seems a little lost.I was happy to see that Brett Ratner had the courage to retain and closely parallel the beautiful scene with the tiger; it's a highpoint in both movies, and could make for interesting detailed comparisons.All over, ""Red dragon"" stands very well on its own, and is only slightly less successful (due mainly to conservative direction) than ""Manhunter"". Those who haven't seen Mann's movie may find ""Red dragon"" even better than I did. Over time, both movies will be seen as fine works, working from a terrific novel, and taking it down somewhat different paths.",Red Dragon

346,hughchilles,Best Prequel,8,27 August 2021,"Whilst it retreads some of the plot points of the first movie this movie succeeds in creating a suspensful prequel, which is hard to do knowing Hannibal can't die. It does this by making Edward Norton into Clarice and the Raph Fiennes into the Transgender guy from the first one and combining the action of the second movie with the psychological side of the first movie. I usually hate prequels but this one was surprisingly effective and had a strong twist I didn't see coming.",Red Dragon
347,Faye-9,Red Dragon is Excellent!!!,10,16 April 2003,"I thought this was one of the best horror films anyone ever made, and I loathe violence in film of any kind.  The average viewer does NOT want more ghastly, blood-curdling, violent scenes, even if they depict fact.  It's like sex, the more you leave to the imagination the more class you add to your output.  Something must be said for ""tasteful"".  The pyscho serial killer *IS* still a human being with some good buried deep inside of him/her no matter what how minute and no matter what crimes they commit.  To not expect a film like this to explore that side and make the audience feel sympathy is shallow.  I am intelligent enough to know that many of these killers do what they do because of some horrendous event in their past...usually their childhood.  Most of them are not enjoying what they do...they can't help themselves.  Abuse IS the curse of our species. Allowing or encouraging us to be sympathetic to this type of behavior is not wrong as long as it does not encourage us to tolerate their behavior out of that sympathy.  I'm applying this theory to real life murderers, because, let's face it... don't you suppose that there's a human walking the face of the earth who could mirror any fictitional character somewhere, sometime, somehow?  Odds are - yes.",Red Dragon
348,Cathz,As good as horror gets for me **may be spoilers**,7,20 October 2002,"OK, I'll admit it right away, I'm pathetic with horror movies & throughout this film at the cinema, I had my jacket on my lap, ready to cover my eyes at any moment!  I was much relieved then that 'Red Dragon' very much saved me the bother - it wasn't too scary at all.  From me, this is not a criticism, it actually meant I could enjoy the movie rather than sit there scared out of my wits.I knew it was going to be a decent film as soon as the credits came up on the screen - I never imagined such a vast array of talented actors would appear in a prequel to such a controversial horror flick, but then I guess that's the pull of SOTL these days.  As usual we have two fantastic British guys as the main 'baddies', a clean-cut Edward Norton as the sympathetic lead.  All were exceptional, including Emily Watson, as usual excelling in a difficult role, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a perfectly wimpering 'loser' - even Harvey Keitel with his minimal screen-time was able to show great presence. In my opinion, both Norton & Keitel's roles should have been more along the lines of Tommy Lee Jones in 'The Fugitive' - an intense and energetic detective intent on catching his villain.  With the lack of intensity in 'Red Dragon', (more the script's fault than the actors' I think) the film somewhat lost what could have been a nail-biting edge, particularly in the middle stages.  With a rather terrifying beginning few scenes, showing the bloody scene of the first crimes, the director didn't seem to capitalize on the thrilling pace which had built up (perhaps he didn't have the balls!)  Instead, the film seemed to drift off into too many broad daylight scenes with as much suspense as a Sunday morning in a market town.  Perfect viewing for a wimp like me!Some elements of the film really did work for me, others completely baffled me.  The idea of incorporating William Blake's paintings & poems was interesting and added an extra dimension to the plot, however it does seems rather unfair on Blake himself to label his imagination as the work of a maniac.  His pictures, though fantastical, may now be seen in a somewhat evil light to those viewers of the film who are not familiar with his work, which to me is rather wrong.  But that is beside the point - it was a clever touch, and one of many.Things which flummoxed me were: 1) how on earth *2* people could escape from a building high in flames, much unscathed  2) what possessed Will & his family to return to live in their Florida home, not only when Hannibal has their postcode at the ready, but before the bones in the fire had been confirmed as those of insane serial killer Dolarhyde, (is it just me or is that is just too unbelievably stupid?) and, 3) why Hannibal seemingly had a supernatural hold over one of the musicians, at the very start of the film. Since I've never seen SOTL I am quite fascinated as to this point - if anyone wants to e-mail me the answer, I'd be most grateful!Anyhow, that's my opinion, a good horror film which wasn't too scary for me - not a common thing! 7/10",Red Dragon

351,a brave fan,as good as the book,9,12 October 2002,"When I heard they were making Red Dragon into a movie my first thought was they have to make it as good as the book. The book freaked me out and I had to stop reading it at night.  The movie was just as freaky and good.  Edward Norton is great (again).  Anthony Hopkins is good also but he will never be able to capture the same Hannibal as in Silence of the Lambs.  My only fault with the movie is Scott Glenn not returning to play Crawford. Harvey Keitel was good but he did not capture the character as well as Scott Glenn did in Silence of the Lambs.  I wish they could have gone into more detail on the tooth fairy and what made him so ""insane"" but they did a great job without making the movie too long. I was not thrilled with the movie Hannibal or the book, but Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were both excellent books and both movies did them justice.  It is great to have a movie follow the book well.  There have been rare instances when the movie was better than the book (Forest Gump) but most often the movie is never as good as the book. Thankfully this movie is, I was sitting on the edge of my seat and I knew what was going to happen. I would recommend this movie to anyone that liked Silence of the Lambs.",Red Dragon
352,sevenof9fl,"Well, it ain't ""Manhunter""",1,6 March 2005,"A huge budget, a cast full of big-name actors, and virtually unlimited time to film this remake of Michael Man's ""Manhunter"" probably holds interest for those who haven't seen the original, but offers nothing but disappointment for those who've seen William Peterson's exceptional turn as Agent Will Graham, and therein lies the downfall of this movie.I watched this movie twice, to be sure of my reaction before posting comments, wondering if I'd gone into it with perhaps too high a set of expectations. My thinking was that Ed Norton, while not my favorite of actors, could at least muster some of the intensity and conflict of Agent Graham,however, Norton sleepwalks through the role.**potential spoiler here**I also expected a further fleshing out of Reba and Dolarhyde's characters, but alas, that didn't happen, either. In point of fact, one scene crucial to the relationship between Dolarhyde and Reba was so mishandled in this version that they might as well have left it on the cutting room floor: the tiger scene. In the original version, Reba (portrayed expertly by Joan Allen) exhibits no fear of the tiger, caressing it's fur, running her hands along it's body, even to it's face and around it's mouth, finally lying her head down on it's body to listen to it's heartbeat, obviously showing no fear, while a transfixed and obviously aroused Dolarhyde watches. In this version, Reba is timid and somewhat reluctant to touch the beast, leaving me to wonder why Dolarhyde bothered with her at all, and most of all, wondering why they bothered to leave the scene in the film at all.Michale Mann captured more of the relationship between the two characters with this 30 seconds of film than was explained by Ratner in a solid hour.Not even Hopkin's repeat of Lector saved this film from falling into the ""why'd they do it?"" realm of film making.Ralf Fiennes is OK as Dolarhyde; and some of the scenes and particularly the sets did benefit from updating, however, the heart of the story is supposed to be Agent Graham's tortured and conflicted pursuit of the Tooth Fairy, and unfortunately, the heart isn't beating in this rendition. While Norton is barely watchable, you can barely look away from Petersen.And to add insult to injury, I don't see why or how Ted Tally got any credit for the screenplay, because with very few exceptions, the dialog and scenes matched almost word for word with Mann's. If you've seen Manhunter, don't bother with this version of the story unless you're just a fan of Hopkins as Lector; and if you haven't seen Manhunter, give it a chance.Despite the very 80's look, it stands the test of time.",Red Dragon
353,pieterwesselsbiz,Terrible,3,31 May 2018,"The headline says it all. It looks good and has a cast of top notch actors.

355,fredsab,An inferior remake of Manhunter,6,12 October 2019,"Red Dragon is based on the Thomas Harris book of the same name, which was previously brought to the screen by filmmaker Michael Mann as Manhunter. While Red Dragon is a workman-like film with some very good qualities - and a great cast - it lacks the cinematic edge of Mann's film.The first and biggest problem is Ed Norton. I think the world of him as an actor, and while he has proven he can play comedy (Keeping the Faith), cunning (Primal Fear and The Score) and drama (American History X, The Painted Veil) he is just not quite right for the role of Will Graham. William Peterson brilliantly captured Graham in Manhunter as a man who could go over the edge at any minute because the dark feelings and obsessions he has are essentially the same as the psychopathic killers he tracks. One of the great lines uttered by Lecter in Manhunter (paraphrased) is ""You want to get the scent back? Smell yourself.""Which leads to the second problem: Too much Lecter. In Manhunter, Lecter (played by the chilling Brian Cox) is onscreen for a very short period, and in The Silence of the Lambs Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for just less than 25 minutes of screen time. Examples of too much Lecter are this film and - even worse - Hannibal. The more of Hannibal Lecter that is left to the imagination, the better.This trait also symbolizes the last problem with this film - more is not better. Bigger stars in the cast, more expansive sets (compare Lecter's cell between the two films), fancy lighting , special effects, more overt violence and other Hollywood touches don't necessarily make for a better film. After the characters are introduced and the plot is set, you never have a doubt about this film's ending. The most suspenseful scenes merely serve to delay the conclusion you know is coming.In sum, not a bad film and worth seeing for completeness particularly if you enjoy Mr. Hopkins over-the-top work as Hannibal Lecter. But do yourself a favor and also watch Manhunter again, or see it for the first time if you haven't already.",Red Dragon
356,piasa84047,Stands up favorably to the others in the series.,6,13 October 2002,"It seems some reviewers went in expecting this to be a Hannibal Lecter film. He is a character in this movie, but make no mistake about it, this is Edward Norton's film. He does his usual fine job of playing the beleaguered every man. Hopkins, as usual, is great. To think that there is no acting going on because some cannot see it is preposterous. Notice how he goes through most scenes without blinking. His trademark monotone voice in this character teeters between genius and insanity. Harvey Keitel and Ralph Fiennes give great performances. As does Emily Watson. Watch as she looks in a direction and never focuses her eyes on a particular object. That is great subtle acting at its best. Anthony Heald makes a tragically comical appearance, because we already know his fate in ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Frankie Faison makes his third Lecter film in this series and his fourth overall. Mary Louise Parker gets a minor role, but makes the most of it. As for the person singing the praises of Philip Seymour Hoffman, of course he is good at playing the no good reporter. It is the only role that he ever plays. His limited range is ultimately what hurts this film. We have seen him play this character time and again and by now we have all stopped caring what happens to him. They could have made this with Jude Law as Lecter, since it is a prequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (not to mention a remake of ""Manhunter""). But Hopkins created this character and plays him so well that he won best actor for the first film even though he was really in the supporting role. And why do people go to see this picture? Because Hopkins has created a character that has become larger than life through popular osmosis. 8 of 10",Red Dragon

He has, obviously, become the franchise.  As a result, the rest of the story (the core of the story) suffers.Hopkins does a decent job, and Edward Norton is (predictably) very good. However, due primarily to all the time spent on Lechter (a character we all already know well), this movie's killer (played by Ralph Fiennes (sp?)) is far too shallow.  All we really find out is that he has a tender side...I think...and that he is angry at the world because he was (gasp!) abused...but that is only hinted at, and never expanded.I was mildly entertained.

His recent role as a magician in ""The Illunionist"" gives credence to that fact. However, in the 2002 thriller ""Red Dragon"", he plays the role of Will Graham ( a retired FBI agent who comes out of retirement to apprehend a serial killer) about as flat as an out of tune key on a baby grand piano. It seems as though he was just going through the motions. His expression never seems to change under any circumstance, a totally wooden performance. Maybe they should have cast William Petersen to reprise the role that he played in 1986's more polished ""Manhunter"". In that version William Peterson made audiences believe that he could actually look into the mind of a killer. So much that it appeared to be affecting him physically and emotionally. That role should have led to more prominent roles for him in my opinion. Aside from this casting mistake, ""Red Dragon"" is a very enjoyable chapter in the Thomas Harris saga.",Red Dragon

I definitely enjoyed Anthony Hopkins' performance, surprising since I thought I would be getting sick of Hannibal by now.  The rest of the cast was excellent, as would be expected from the stockpiling of Oscar nominees.  But overall, I felt like it didn't have anything new to say and came off as cliched in many scenes--the confused profiler hitting on the key piece of info with a shocked pause and ""wait a minute!""; the scenes of the serial killer pouring over his newspaper clippings; etc.  All in all, I thought the original Manhunter created greater chills and was a better look at the whole process of creating a profile.",Red Dragon
362,morgan1976,Better than Hannibal.,8,20 August 2004,"I was pretty disappointed when they said they were filming this.  Originally filmed as ""Manhunter"" (before ""Silence of the Lambs""), without Anthony Hopkins, I thought the original was good and didn't warrant a remake--Hollywood just wanted to make more money off the Hannibal Lecter 'trilogy' (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal).  And after the not-so-great ""Hannibal"", I was expecting the worst.  Although it looks like a shiny, expensive Hollywood film; it's really pretty good.  Not as great as it's predecessors, but very watchable.  Ted Tally returns as script-writer (he did ""Silence..."" as well), and he knows how to adapt Harris' novels--I just wonder why he didn't decide to adapt ""Hannibal"", which could have been much better.  The acting is better than good, but I can't say great and I can't exactly put my finger on why that is.  Everyone is good in their roles, although there's something about Watson's American accent that rubs me the wrong way and I think it hinders her performance a little bit (it's akin to Kate Winslet's in ""Titanic""...ugh!).  I don't think ""Red Dragon"" has the rewatchability as ""Silence..."" but it's still certainly good enough to watch more than once.  I recommend it in addition to ""Silence..."", but ""Hannibal"" is skippable.",Red Dragon

364,invincible_seattle,"Very well made, but not as good as ""Manhunter""",8,9 October 2002,"I suppose I viewed this film with the bias of knowing what was going to happen before it did, for I had already seen the film ""Manhunter.""""Red Dragon"" is indeed a remake of the 1986 thriller directed by Michael Mann.  One of the greatest advantages the 2002 film has is that it can be compared pre-release to the first take, and made better.On a more technical note, the fact that this movie was filmed in 2.35:1 was a pleasant surprise.  I feel that ""Hannibal"" was wrongly filmed in a 1.85:1 ratio, but the wide look of ""Red Dragon"" made the movie come all the more alive with background action and more color in closeups.Among its improvements is the first scenes, describing the events up to and including FBI agent Will Graham's capturing of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Another good thing about this film is the fact that Lecter is played by the same actor as in the two sequels.  Brian Cox was good as the vicious psychopath in the 1986 film, but the sheer look of Sir Anthony Hopkins alone surpasses the fear Cox was able to deliver.Which leads to the down points.  The actors in the 1986 film were not well-known and frequently seen actors at that time.  William Peterson, who played Graham, is now seen weekly on the television show ""CSI,"" but at the time was a relatively unknown actor.  Cox has always taken smaller roles in his films, and still does to a great extent; while Hopkins is at the front line of Hollywood's most popular faces.  And Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford was totally damaging to the role.  Most people can't see Keitel as anything new anymore, considering the vast extent of his career in huge cult-favorites.  Dennis Farina was far more passionate in his portrayal.Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson are the only exceptions, far exceeding the terrifying and lovable performances by Tom Noonan and Joan Allen, respectively.The scope of ""Red Dragon"" is far better than ""Manhunter"" in that it better incorporates deeper aspects to each of the characters.  The film also spends more to develop the history and psychosis of Francis Dolarhyde, which is a very good improvement.  But, to accomodate more screen time for Dolarhyde, the film either shortens or leaves out a lot of the more tedious investigative work seen in the original film, which makes it more suspenseful and enjoyable.The fact that ""Red Dragon"" ends with Dr. Chilton (ironically, still played by Anthony Heald, who was Chilton in ""Silence of the Lambs"") telling Lecter that Clarice Starling was there to see him joins the films together very well, but it left me thinking that right after the ""Tooth Fairy"" crime story the ""Buffalo Bill"" crimes began to be investigated.  It seemed too close together, but that's just my assessment.Overall, I rated this film an 8, but rated ""Manhunter"" a 9.  If you haven't seen it, rent it.  The similarities are striking, while the differences are dazzlingly entertaining.",Red Dragon

It can be seen that this novel really provided the template for the superior sequel which followed.The plot follows a very similiar structure to 'Silence...'.  An FBI agent plays mind games with Hannibal Lecter in an attempt to obtain clues that are needed in order to capture another serial killer who is active 'on the outside'.  I think Edward Norton is the fines actor of his age in the world, but the script and Brett Ratner's direction doesn't really give him much room to manouevre. Ralph Fiennes' maniac gravitates between schizophrenia and a quasi-Norman Bates grandmother complex.But the real killer about this movie is that, for a suspense movie, there is a real lack of suspense.  Particularly with Lecter, we know roughly how the characters will end up to be in 'position' for Silence of the Lambs.  This removes a great deal of menace from the scenes with Hopkins, which is not the fault of any of the participants.SPOILER ALERT!!Some good work all round, but all the actors in the film have much better performances to their credit, in the end the climax is surprisingly formulaic, and the final scene is only successful at provoking a wry smile with its reference to much superior 1991 movie.",Red Dragon

The acting performances were also good, especially Anthony Hopkins (Of course) and Ralph Fiennes. I think Ralph Fiennes even deserved an Oscar nomination.

368,DwightLynn,Mediocre,5,14 January 2020,"Red Dragon is the second on screen adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel of the same name. The first adaptation from 1986, titled Manhunter, had a completely different cast and crew than the later famous entry in the Hannibal Lecter series, Silence of the Lambs.After the huge success of Silence of the Lambs, the producers were eager to rake in as much cash as possible. They begged Thomas Harris to write a sequel book to SOTL, which ended up being basis for the meh film, Hannibal. One year later and starving for cash, the producers gave up waiting for Thomas Harris to make any new material and they made the desperate move of forcing another adaptation of 'Red Dragon', and here we are.I think the biggest problem with this adaptation is that not only is it not as good as the book, but it is not even as good as the first adaptation, Manhunter from 1986. Manhunter adapts the same story and has such an interesting style to it. The music is hypnotizing, the performances are more subtle, and you can tell that Manhunter comes from someone's vision.Red Dragon on the other hand is dull. It comes from no creative spark; director Brett Ratner simply has no style to speak of. Every film he touches turns to mediocrity, and he is not up to snuff compared to directors like Michael Mann and Jonathan Demme who, by contrast, really knew how to elevate and capture Thomas Harris' material.With how great Manhunter was, I do not see the point of adapting Red Dragon again (besides the obvious monetary incentive). At least when the excellent Hannibal TV series adapted the Red Dragon storyline they put a unique spin on things by shifting plot points around. The only reason I could see anyone wanting to see this film is because it has Anthony Hopkins in it.Unfortunately, Anthony Hopkins is not very good in the movie. The reason Hopkins worked so well in the Silence of the Lambs is because he was used sparingly. In that film, Lecter only showed up to either add to the plot, or to have insightful character interaction with the main character, Clarice.In this movie, Lecter is used way too much and loses much of his mystery and allure. Rather than add to anything, the producers asked for more Hannibal Lecter at the expense of the movie's pacing. Lecter is just a way scarier character when he isn't used unnecessarily. This is something Harris knew when writing the original book, and something Michael Mann understood when he made Manhunter.Brian Cox's Hannibal Lecter is only in Manhunter for like 3 scenes, and despite his more subdued performance, Brian Cox is much more memorable in that film than Anthony Hopkins could ever hope to be in this. In here, Hopkins is shown like a circus animal. He doesn't need to be there, he likely doesn't want to be, and the more he's brought up, the worse you feel. He just drags the story out and makes the film more tedious.There isn't much to say about the lead, Edward Norton. I think Norton is a fantastic actor, and he shows his stellar acting chops in movies like Fight Club and Primal Fear. However in this film, he really underplays his character. Will Graham is supposed to be constantly on the edge, always on the edge of sanity; something actor Hugh Dancy captured really well on the Hannibal TV show. In this film, likely because of poor direction, Norton does not attempt to play his character as being on edge, which is strange because his crazy characters are Norton's best. Without this element of the character, Will Graham is just terribly dull and the story loses much of what makes it interesting.The one positive about this film is the depiction of the main villain, played by Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is an amazing actor and in this film he really shines. He really captures the three dimensional nature of the character and he is paired with another wonderful performer, Emily Watson. Their scenes are the only consistently good things about the film, but a few good scenes do not make a good film.This movie is ultimately pointless. If you want to get the best experience with this story, read the original book, watch Manhunter, or watch the Hannibal tv series. Ralph Fiennes is great, but even an actor as fun to watch as him cannot save this uninspired, pointless motion picture.",Red Dragon
369,Buddybaba,A Great Disappointment,5,6 October 2002,"I just came back from ""Red Dragon"" and I have to say it is time for a great actor, Anthony Hopkins, to take a break and then come back as something other than a ""Cannibal Clown"" The audience I was with laughed through most of the film. From the tired ""who are we having for dinner"" opening to the ""music goes up when we see a broken mirror behind a door"" suspense film cliched ending, I was bored. Nine bucks for what? Read the book.",Red Dragon
370,Cinemaquebecois,This movie is not a book !,6,5 October 2002,"Ok !  Let's be clear on something: the screenplay of RED DRAGON is excellent and brilliant. But, and that's where the problem is, it doesn't mean you have a good film at the end. When i go see an adaptation i like to be suprise by the vision of the director. I was amaze by THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and satisfy with the gruesome HANNIBAL (the book wasn't that great either). But RED DRAGON was a very very good book and a tought the film will live up to it. But it didn't. And who's to blame ? Brett Ratner. His directing is a lazzy one. There is no atmosphere, there is no real fear and mostly, there is no vision. Only a by-the-book-movie very predictable film with actors not giving there best performance (Hopkins is a caricature of himself, Norton is suprisingly very ordinairy, Keitel play the only character he knows, himself) except for Fiennes and Watson who are terrific.
So a the end, what do we have ? A good popcorn flick but we are a long way from the masterpiece of Jonathan Demme. Please, read the book again, it will be better !",Red Dragon
371,FLY-9,90 mil to make such a movie?,5,6 November 2002,"I guess probably 60 mil went to the cast, the rest of the 30 mil was spent on production. This movie is *NOT* original at all. It's a combination of 'The Silence Of The Lambs', ""Psycho"" (the old woman), SEVEN (the ""dragon"" metaphore in this movie), and other classic movies. Absolutely NO NEW ideas at all. I guess I was expecting too much as the average rating on imdb.com of this movie is around 8?? What a big disappointment. :(Well, at least the actors tried their very best, although, again, good acting (they tried), but just NOT convincing!! Edward Norton do not look like a agent, Ralph Flennes, boy, would you believe such a handsome guy who would become insane just because of the tiny mark on his face? I don't think so. And Emily Watson is a bit too ""pretty"" for her role, I mean, come on guys, would you believe a blind pretty woman like ""she"" would have such character and working for the kind of job that she had?? The only character that is conviencing is, again, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), but then again, boy, he had played this type of characters for so many times that it is simply not original or new to the audience at all. **1/2 out of *****",Red Dragon

I went to this one with I suppose a disdainful attitude and happily I have been greatly surprised and impressed. This film had me gripped from the moment Lector winces at the flute player right through to the climax.The performances of Hopkins, Emily Lloyd and Ralph Fiennes are absolutley superb. The play between Lloyd and Fiennes especially so.*small spoilers*The one sour note is the performance of Edward Norton, somehow he just sleep walks through this one. Seeing as others are giving great performances this cant be blamed on the director. Maybe it could have been the misjudgment of the casting crew. Norton suits the role of psychopath much better. Overall William L. Petersen IMO was a more convincing Will Graham. On the upside Nortons exchange with Fiennes in the film was damned fine!!Another negative was Mary Louise Parker as Grahams wife also doesnt fit the role and alas there seems little spark between Norton and Parker.Even so I still rate this an excellent film and one I would throughly recommend.",Red Dragon
374,photoscots,Mediocre Sequel,6,9 November 2002,"I am not a connoisseur of mainstream movie making in general but the 'Hannibal' series has been the exception to the rule, mainly due to the magnetism of Anthony Hopkins the actor. I always thought Silence of the Lambs was an unworthy oscar winner but still entertaining despite the irritating Jody Foster, Jonathan Demme did a good job on this one.Ridley Scott went for thrills in the sequal 'Hannibal' and succeeded to revolt us in a gore fest where we get to see the untethered Hannibal in action. More entertaining than 'Silence'? Definetly!And so I went along to the cinema one evening seeking out the cheap thrills that the first two films provided. There were 5 people in the audience. Just the way I like it.Red Dragon started excitingly with Hopkins hamming it up around the dinner table, some action ensued and all was looking good. Then 'Hannibal' was locked up and the disenfranchised Hopkin's character brought the entertainment to an end. The story became a tired and exhaustive introspective of the Norton character. He was a bit lightweight for this role but the story also became entangled with him and his wife discussing his involvement in the case. Boring!The most positive aspect of the film was Ralph Fiennes, who seemed to carry on his techniques of acting the psycho from the Cronenberg film 'Spider'. He was convincing and entertaining, interacting superbly with the blind girl.However, the direction of the film by Brett Ratner was sterile. He had a tough act to follow in two talented directors but ultimately the Producers are to blame for employing him. The film is overall downbeat with a few scenes of violence which fail to lift the film.I left the cinema feeling conned by this one as it failed to entertain. I won't part with my cash so readily for the next film.",Red Dragon
375,imdb1-1,Tired Performances,4,8 October 2002,"Better than Hannibal, well below Silence of the Lambs. Both Ed Norton and Anthony Hopkins turn in tired performances. Oddly, Hannibal is left to look far older than he appears in either predecessor movie and this is supposed to be the first in the series.But let's get to the movie. Yes, the killer is interesting and Fiennes gives the best performance of any actor in the film. However, the unique quality of this series is the Hannibal character and not the typical ""let's go find the serial killer"" routine. Strangely enough, Red Dragon does not capitalize on our getting to know more about Dr. Lector and more on the routine and predictable plot. But that is what it is and you are left with dozens of dialogue and lines you've all heard before. How sloppy is the script? I remember Hannibal using the word ""messily"" in his dialogue with Will Graham -- is that a word anyone would even remotely equate with the brilliant genius Dr. Lector?The movie on the IMDB is HIGHLY overrated. If you are walking into the theatre hoping to see a top 250 movie, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for some good mindless fun for 2 hours, you will be entertained and the production is better than average. But let's not fool ourselves -- this was a project to cash in on the predecessors and it doesn't even deliver Hannibal the way you'd probably expect. The beauty of Silence of the Lambs was that there was a high tension between the innocence of Clarice and that of the evil Lector. The relationship of Graham to Lector is not exploited and the scenes with them are very tired and not the nail biting encounters of Silence. It's inferior, although entertaining. See it for the fine performance of Fiennes. Warning... predictable....",Red Dragon
376,Kurzbein,I like the first ending best,9,14 October 2002,"Say what you want about ""Hannibal"", at least it had an unforeseen and satisfying ending.  If ""Red Dragon"" had aimed for the same target it would be a front runner for the Best Picture Oscar.  Instead, ""RD"" has what amounts to two endings.  I haven't read Harris's book and don't know how it ends, but the second ending seems like stock Hollywood stuff.The fine performances in this film are many, and they're what raise ""RD"" to a high level.  Everyone knows how terrific Hopkins has been as Lecter, and he does not disappoint here.  Similarly satisfying is Ralph Fiennes, who creates an almost sympathetic killer, someone for whom we can empathize in spite of his unspeakable deeds.  He's paired with the excellent Emily Watson, who plays his blind co-worker.  Every scene they have together is intense and moving, but there's a scene near the film's end that is simply fabulous because of their performances.  Put any average actors into this scene, and it becomes melodrama.  Watson and Fiennes elevate it to a moving, emotional scene.  Edward Norton quietly creates a distinct character as the FBI investigator, one who's foremost weapon is his mind.  Norton captures the sensitivity that someone with his talents would possess.  He matches Hopkins' intensity in their shared scenes and then tones things down just enough in scenes with FBI personnel.  Norton convinces us that his character could solve this case in spite of his trepidation.Even the smaller roles are populated by high-quality actors.  Harvey Keitel doesn't mail in his performance, something he could easily do given that it's the kind of role he's played seemingly a thousand times.  His FBI Chief is in control but not controlling, demanding but not unreasonable. Phillip Seymour Hoffman avoids playing a caricature in his roll as an Enquirer-type tabloid journalist, and he deftly combines fear with a manipulative character trait in a key scene with Fiennes.  Mary-Louise Parker doesn't get much screen time, but she captures both the fear she has for what her husband is about to do with understanding that this is work he needs to do.Director Brett Ratner doesn't make a misstep until the very end.  The decision he makes there changes the character of the story and to a large extent undermines Fiennes' efforts in creating a complex, sympathetic character.  Perhaps Ratner was fearful of being accused of copying the premise behind the ending of ""Hannibal"", but that risk was worth taking given the benefits.",Red Dragon
377,JulietV,And I thought Manhunter was good...,10,5 October 2002,"Excellent movie!  It should be a real redeemer for those who didn't like Hannibal (although I'd give Hannibal a ""9."") This was even better.At some parts, I was able to predict what would happen, but then with another twist and turn, I'd be surprised again.Ralph Finnes will give me nightmares.  He can really play creepy.  He was nearly (but not quite) as scary as Lecter was.And then, Edward Norton, it goes without saying that he's always fantastic in everything he's in (barring, ""Everyone Says I Love You."")Phillip Seymour Hoffman gave another fine performance, I couldn't help but appreciate his resemblance to the National Enquirer's Mike Walker.Like Hannibal, this may be sized up with Silence of the Lambs and miss out on awards, ...I suggest you compare it to all the other movies you've seen over the past year or two... it's up there with the best of them.

Pretty good, but I just think ""Red Dragon"" had much less towork with than did ""Silence of Lambs""; a cast of cookie cutter crimenovel characters (even Hannibal is considerably weaker in thisincarnation)  and a super formulaic plot. I think having a loveinterest for the killer was kind of insulting to the viewers(/readers)intelligence, as I think Fiennes did a very good job of making thecharacter as sympathetic as possible. Ed Norton is good, but I agree that he was a little too green andmilquetoast-y for what should have been a grittier role.  After all,despite the past Oscars, etc etc, the hannibal trilogy are serialkiller flicks, and, by definition have the right to be a over the top.

379,duggie_666,See Manhunter Instead,6,30 October 2002,Just back from seeing Red Dragon and i have to say im disapointed. 2 weeks ago i saw Manhunter for the first time and really liked it. As i eagerly awaited Red Dragon i was told that it was better then Manhunter. What a load of B.S. Let me explain it this way I'll start off by saying what was good and bad about Red Dragon. Good: Anthony Hopkins is the best thing about this movie. Just as good a performance as Silence Of The Lambs.  Ralph Fiennes is brilliant a really creepy character that you totally believe. Bad: pretty much everything else. Ed Norton is good and i really like him but William Peterson is way better in Manhunter and all Norton really seems to do is copy him action for action word for word.  Thats the main problem with Red Dragon. Its a direct copy even rip off of Manhunter.  Yes i am well aware that RD is a remake but it copies Manhunter to a T so much that RD is just boring after seeing Manhunter. The only real fault with Manhunter is that Hannibal is really bad.  Brian Cox did a really bad job with the character. Theres only one Hannibal and thats Tony Hopkins. Bottom line take this advice. If your the kinda person that more likes recent movies then old ones (your a fool for that) then go see Red Dragon but do not watch Manhunter before seeing RD or ever after that. If you have better taste and appreciate a more original movie then see Manhunter i promise you wont regret it.,Red Dragon
380,mrow,"Entertaining film, but I think Norton might have been miscast.",7,27 October 2002,"Since my only reference point for this film was ""Silence of the Lambs"" (I did not see the original ""Manhunter"")I felt that it would provide a good overall film fix and it did.  Oddly, although I enjoy Ed Norton's work, I didn't think he was right for this particular part of Special Agent Graham. There are a number of male leads who could have done it more convincingly and to me he just seemed unnatural in the role. Even his reading seemed stilted.  Conversely, Feinnes was excellent as Dolarhyde (Oscar stuff) and I was wondering if the roles should have been switched, as I believe Feinnes could have done equally well in the opposing role.  Feinnes would probably disagree.   I usually do not have a bone to pick with casting; the people who do it are usually quite able. Other than hearing the brief remarks of Ebert and Roeper, I have not read any real reviews of the film and do not know if this was noted by anyone else.  The film itself was fine and worked just as it should.  Anthony Hopkins seemed to be enjoying the part a little too much but I would have to go back and compare his earlier versions of Lechter to verify this.  I had to laugh when, in one particular scene, Feinnes' cleft-lip prosthesis appeared as though he had a very bad head-cold. In other scenes, it was completely convincing. Nitpicking aside, this was an entertaining thriller and I would recommend it on that basis alone.",Red Dragon

However, having seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"" I couldn't help but think I had already seen most of the movie.Norton is an excellent actor, and easily masters this role.  Fiennes is also quite haunting as a tortured soul, and it is easy to relate to almost all characters involved, even the reporter.  But Hopkins seems to be imitating his role in ""Silence of the Lambs"", rather than actually playing the character.  The scenes in the basement were almost silly, like a Saturday Night Live skit or something from Loaded Weapon I.  But maybe it's just because the scenes have been recreated so much, they don't hold the same meaning as they did when Silence first came out.possible spoilers----The plot moves well, and keeps the tension alive, but the predictability was a bit annoying.  Part of the problem was that the plot imitates previous movies (Hannibal bargaining with clues to get more freedoms from ""Silence of the Lambs"", Dee acting like Bates from ""Psycho"") and so many other aspects (victims' home movies, diary of clippings and drawing, using personals to send messages, murders relating to dolls) that the movie seems somewhat recycled.  But since the style and suspense was more than adequate, I will overlook the lack of originality. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!! Just one last note (and spoiler, but this is bothering me) - If Dolarhyde did not shoot himself toward the end (in the fire), where did the splatter of blood come from?  Did he just throw a glass full of blood on her face or something?",Red Dragon

Not that I thought it wouldn't be any good - I just didn't think it would be as good as it was.  Anthony Hopkins brings new depth to the character of Hannibal Lecter.  We see him with a demeanor that is more of an angry one than what we have seen in the past. Ralph Fiennes brings immense depth to his character.  The viewer can't help to want him killed, while at the same time having compassion for him.  The film returned to the more realistic atmosphere that made Silence of the Lambs such a great success.

However, one must feel like too much exploration was done.But one can't help but know in the back of their minds that this film was made simply to let you see Hopkins re praise his infamous Lecter role.When talking about the book Red Dragon, Lecter played a very small role, only appearing in the book a couple of times. However in this film, he appears numerous times, shifting the focus away from Will Graham and toward the man himself; this killed the fear that was Hannibal Lecter.The complexity of the relationship between the cannibal and his captor is an interesting one, the two men are so different but so the same.I praise Hopkins's performance in this film, Ratner however ruined the whole ""Lecter feel"". There was no enigmatic brilliance that was in Silence of the Lambs.Overall, this was a good movie. Not anything like Silence, but not as morbidly tasteless as Hannibal or Hannibal Rising.8/10 is what I give it.",Red Dragon

Without going into spoiler details, I will simply say I felt Red Dragon managed a fine balance between the relationship of the profiler to Hannibal Lector and the search for the serial killer. This is what Silence excelled at, and I think fans of Silence will be pleased with Read Dragon. My only criticism is the killer seemed a bit too hard to actually kill, coming back a bit more like a cartoon villain than a 'human being.' But the acting of the excellent cast more than makes up for that. And to give it one of my ultimate compliments: the movie makes me want to read the book, because there's so much going on in it, that you know there's got to be even more in the book.",Red Dragon
387,gorflax,A good addition to the series by Brett Rattner,8,5 October 2002,"I went in to see this film with very low expectations.  I was not sure whether the man who brought us the Rush Hour series would be able to make a serious movie about serial killers, let alone a prequel to the great Silence of the Lambs.  While there are flaws this film is definitely worth seeing. Edward Norton is right on as a detective with a gift for getting into the heads of killers.  Anthony Hopkins presents a decent performance as Lecter. His heart seemed more in the role when he did Silence of the Lambs.  I have not read the book so I'm not sure if the movie is accurate.  The movie does present a very straight forward style and shows us all the characters with no mystery as to who the toothfairy character is.  The psychological aspect of Dolarhyde's character are interesting, but they have been done before. Psycho was the first film to present us with the abused killer and he is presented here.  Brett Rattner unfortunately goes for the cheap noise scares which drops this movie a notch below Silence of the Lambs.  Visually it is a standard film which unfortunately makes it pale in comparison next to the stunning visuals of Hannibal which itself had the problem of being a beatiful film to watch yet leaves the audience with nothing to think about. I recommend this movie to fans of the series and to anyone who did not like Hannibal this one may make up for that.",Red Dragon
388,JT-Saint,Surprisingly good!,8,30 September 2002,"Manhunter has been a favourite of mine for many years and I approached this 'remake' with a fair amount of cynicism. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see the return of many of the cast from 'Silence of the Lambs', although after such effort in 'pre-continuity', it was a little discerning seeing Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford.This gripe aside, the film is well executed and acted, with commendable performaces from Norton, Hopkins and Feinnes as the 'Toothfairy' (although none of the performances are outstanding by any means).The story varies slightly from that of Manhunter and gives us more background on the 'Toothfairy' and more of the Dr Lecktor we know and love, even though Hopkins is looking a tad too old.The film has a similar feel to Silence, enhanced by the excellent score and succeeds in keeping us entertained until it's climax.Certainly more accomplished than 'Hannibal' and a worthy prequel to 'Silence of the Lambs', 'Red Dragon' is a retelling of Harris' excellent novel and not a remake of Manhunter. In my opinion, it works!7.5/10",Red Dragon

390,Suzie70287,Very good but still...,9,18 October 2002,"I thought that this movie was very good but, there were a couple parts that disappointed me. I read this book about a year ago and was looking forward to seeing this movie. I was very happy to see that this movie followed along with the book very well, i even recognized some dialog from it.Most of the actors/actresses are very well casted. Although, I think that Harvey Keitel is a little ruff-looking to be Jack Crawford unlike Scott Glen was in 'The Silence of the Lambs'. Also when ever i saw Ralph Finnies playing Francis Dolarhyde i couldn't help but think of the oh-so lovable Charles Van Doren from 'Quiz Show'. But, he was a rather intimidating Dolarhyde. Edward Norton is a very likeable Will Graham, which I was glad to see since I really liked Will in the book.The only problem I had with this movie are two certain scenes which I thought, should have been accredited with more time. In the book, when Will finds the can of soda and then looks up in the tree, it is a very powerful moment in the book when he sees the writing in the tree and the sawing off of the branches, etc. and pieces it together. In the movie they rushed that right along as if they don't want you to look back on that later-it's just a detail to them. The other scene I thought they rushed through was when they find the note that the 'Tooth-Fairy' gives to Hannibal. I remember being so excited of that part in the book. But I think they didn't treat those two scenes with the proper amount of respect it deserved.I think that the editors should have added about 5 minutes for those two scenes so that you could understand the intensity of it. Also if they wanted to keep it the same amount of time-to replace that extra time, they could have cut out the scene where Hannibal and Will are walking around the room together. That part is not in the book, Will only sees Hannibal, I think, two times. I guess they wanted Anthony Hopkins, as the chilling-ever-so-popular Hannibal to have a bigger part but, they shouldn't have made it a big deal that he was in it to begin with.
So overall I give this movie: 9/10",Red Dragon
391,l_a_t_e_r_a_l_u_s,Much better than expected,9,5 October 2002,"Was it as good as Hannibal? It was a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot better than Hannibal. Was it as good as Silence of the Lambs? Well, no. But were you expecting it to be? It is, actually, in my opinion, scarier than Silence of the Lambs. And also it has a better villain I think. The directing is actually pretty good. Wasn't expecting a good job like that from the guy who directed the Rush Hour movies, but I got one. Now to get to the acting. I am a huge Edward Norton fan, but honestly, I felt that he really could have been better though. He was good, but not as good as he can be. But it's not so much his fault as it is the fault of the dialogue he was given. Harvey Keitel is good and convincing, as usual. Emily Watson does really good in this one as the blind Reba McClane. Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal Lecter, and steals the show whenever he is on screen. Some great moments in the cell come from Hannibal Lecter in Red Dragon, some of which are even comparable to those in Silence of the Lambs. Didn't say better, I just said comparable. But, in my eyes, the show stealer in this movie is Ralph Fiennes, who plays the psychotic (and boy is he psychotic) title character. As a matter of fact, I personally thinks he turns in the best performance by a supporting actor so far this year.Bottom line: Red Dragon is well worth the price of admission. Good acting, good directing, good story, a few really creepy scenes (including one scene that...well, you'll see...). An all-around great movie. Highly recommended. It's the best thing in theaters now besides One Hour Photo, and is the third-best movie of the year so far (after One Hour Photo and Minority Report.). Go see it, but in case there is actually a pathetic soul out there who has not seen The Silence of the Lambs, I suggest you do so before seeing Dragon. Well, you really don't have to, but the very last line in the movie will make you smile if you do. Or at least I smiled.",Red Dragon

Whereas Silence focused on the relationship between Starling and Lecter (winning two Oscars for the principles) this film is more diffuse, looking at the violence and fear from many different angles.

393,K_Molen,An Excellent Follow-Up,8,15 October 2002,"After the trash that was ""Hannibal"" it was nice to see this much better film do the Lecter franchise justice. While many moviegoers, myself included, will list Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) as one of their all-time favourite movie villains, ""Hannibal"" was simply too much of a good thing. In ""Red Dragon"" Lecter is once again in the supporting role where he belongs. The focus of the film is instead on Will Graham's (Norton) efforts at tracking down a serial killer specializing in families. The killer goes by the name Francis ""The Toothfairy"" Dollarhyde (Fiennes) and is just as creepy but more multi-dimensional than ""Buffalo Bill"" from ""The Silence of the Lambs."" The cast is of exceptional quality and are all turning in great performances. Some of them (Keitel) may have less to work with than others (Fiennes) but there are no rough spots to be found in the acting. The directing is spot-on too, even if it is a little bit of a homage/rip-off of ""The Silence of the Lambs.""If there are any bad things to be said about ""Red Dragon"" it is that it perhaps is *too* similar to ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" but I for one have no problems with that.Oh, and finally I suppose I should also mention ""Manhunter,"" the earlier film based on the same book (""Red Dragon""). I saw ""Red Dragon"" and ""Manhunter"" for the first time on the same day, within half-an-hour of each other, and I must say that I prefer ""Red Dragon."" This is partly because ""Manhunter,"" a movie filmed in the eighties, has not aged very well at all. It is also because of the higher caliber actors involved in the ""Red Dragon"" project. That being said, I can certainly see why people love ""Manhunter"" and why someone might prefer that version of the story.Overall I can heartily recommend ""Red Dragon"" to anyone, fan of the series or not.8/10",Red Dragon

My only disappointments were in the casting of Ralph Fiennes as Dolarhyde (much to small a man to fit the true description of Dolarhyde), and Anthony Hopkins did not have the same level of subtle darkness that existed in Silence of the Lambs.

That is, the quality will start to go down.  Hopkins plays Hannibal more for laughs here than for menace. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie to watch, but it could have been better.  Edward Norton is good as the somewhat innocent good guy who goes chasing after monsters.  However, I think this movie would have been a hundred times better if it had concentrated more on Ralph Fiennes character, perhaps showing some of the pathos as to how he became so insane.

399,madheed,great,10,13 October 2002,I found myself to be in quite a good possition to watch this film.  I was too young to watch Silence of the lambs when it was released. and when Hannibal came out i just couldn't be arsed.  When i saw the trailer i thought i'm not going to see that untill ive watched the first two.  It wasn't untill a friend explained that this was actually the first of the series.  So i decided to go along.  I thought is was great.  Anthony Hopkins plays a really cool character.  It is amusing in what and how Dr. Hannibal Lector uses his words.  the way he speaks being so sarcastic makes me giggle.  the film itself was fantastic. plently of action as well of mysteries.  I never got bored and was intersted in everything that happened before my eyes. 10/10  I will definatley be watching Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal now!!!!!!,Red Dragon

401,DarkFire639,"As Time Magazine put it ""Brilliant""",9,4 October 2002,"Red Dragon is what I would consider a masterpiece in the ""Thriller"" genre. All of the suspense needed to scare you and keep you interested is there. Although, I do believe that Red Dragon is not as good as The Silence Of The Lambs (Really, no thriller can compare to it) it is one of the best suspense films to come out since Silence. Anthony Hopkins, looking slightly older, but not as much so as some of these comments may have you believing, keeps this film together and adds the comical relief needed after some of the horrifying scenes in the movie. Edward Norton portrays Will Graham with Academy Award winning ability. Yet, even after all of this praise for the film, I believe there were two actors that should be rewarded the most. Ralph Fiennes acted the part of Frances Dolorhyde extremely well. This is the only part of the film that I believe was better than The Silence Of The Lambs. Dolorhyde was hands down a better villain than Buffalo Bill. And finally, Emily Watson, who I believe should at the very least be nominated for Best Supporting Actress when the time comes. Her performance was really the stand-out of the film. In the end, after leaving the theater, I do believe that Red Dragon is well worth the time and money it takes to see it.

402,deimos47ca,Best prequel I've ever seen,9,8 March 2006,"Making a sequel or prequel is very difficult. Arguably, harder than making the original. Silence of the Lambs had a unique atmosphere of fragility and sexual inequality. You COULD just copy that, but it would just be a re-hash of the same old thing. Unfortunately, in Silence of the Lambs, all the attention was on Agent Stirling, and the audience barely got to know the killer - they were just added to the stereotypical group of serial killer... Red Dragon changes that. Not only do we learn more about Lecter's mutual relationship with Dr. Chilton and Barney (caretaker), but Red Dragon's antagonist, the ""Toothfairy"", also shows a rare glimpse into how delicate the balance is between sanity and psychopathy. He wasn't born a dysfunctional anti-social predator - he was made one through years of abuse. Yet in the movie is constantly at odds with himself, watching normal families, trying to lead a normal relationship, going to great lengths to find a balance between Agent Graham's repulsion of his artistic talent, and Lecter's complete embrace with his darker animal side.This is definitely one of those movies that just keeps on giving, and you discover more each time you watch it.

I would also say that this film is close to Oscar material, and Edward Norton did an excellent job in acting.  No, he wasn't Jodie Foster, but he played his part in this film.  Of course, Anthony Hopkins oplayed his part as well, and did an excellent job as Hannibal. Ralph Fiennes also did a fine job.  Not to forget, so did Mary Louise Parker, who did an outstanding job.  These characters were so believeable, and it didn't really seem like a film, but almost like ral life.  The cinematography to this film was great, it really helped portray the characters.

The ending was slightly different, but didn't change to the extreme like Hanibal did. The actors, Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton played great parts in this movie. It isn't really about Hanibal, besides him helping the detective on a seriel killer case. The Red Dragon was incredibly powerful in his character role, but as you learn more about him it makes you pity him. Not at all like Verger on Hanibal. The killer in this movie has his unique way of slaughtering people. But you don't feel sorry for him in the same way as you do Verger. I thought Red Dragon gave an excellent performance and I gave it a 10 because it was so close to the actual story line. I give it 2 thumbs up. I recommend you all to see this movie, if you are a fan of the Haniabal triology.",Red Dragon
405,kgaard,Worth a look,6,18 October 2002,"Not a bad film, though not nearly a great one. Part of the problem is that it is largely the same story as in Silence of the Lambs--killer on the loose, FBI agent needs Lecter to help crack the case. Even the transformation theme of the killer is the same. The one major difference that makes Silence a superior story (and thus, perhaps inevitably, a superior movie) is that in Red Dragon Will Graham has something concrete to protect: his family. Clarice Starling, on the other hand, has no such interests, and so the psychological dynamic between her and Lecter can be much more intense, more personal. That connection never develops here because the relationship between Graham and Lecter remains much more adversarial (not surprising, considering the way the film begins). Ratner is at least somewhat handcuffed by a story that is not as character-oriented as Silence was.Still, the second half of the movie is much better than the first (which is filled with too many ham-handed lines), and the Dolarhyde-Reba relationship is well played by Fiennes and Watson. Norton is still a superior performer although it seemed he was sometimes fighting his lines.I would suggest that the faux climax is superior to the actual climax. Someday someone will realize it's okay to stop there. (Although in fairness, I assume the book didn't stop there.)6/10",Red Dragon

410,sungwon444,A creepy terrifying movie that keeps you thinking,9,11 October 2002,"I hadn't expected so much out of Red Dragon before checking this movie out. But the movie turned out to be top quality notch, a supreme suspense movie, and a horrifying movie that keeps you glue to your seat, as your heart keeps pounding.Most of my friends didn't consider this a horror movie, but I would say this is a crime-suspense-horror movie, all three put together. I know I'm going to have nightmares after seeing this one.The plot is very interesting, creepy, and intricate, which is definitely a plus. This movie starts out with the introduction of Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), and we have a glimpse of what a horrific beast this guy is. His name, ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" is after all, very suitable. However, the name ""Tooth Fairy"" is not appropriate, as viewers will find out...because the Red Dragon (played by Ralph Fiennes) is the ultimate evil carnage. Now, after two gruesome murders of innocent families, it's up to Detective Graham (Edward Norton) to track this killer down.
What the movie Red Dragon does is portray evil. Basically, this movie is about evil, a study of evil. Yes, i have to admit, it was a very disturbing, unsettling for the movie to be so gruesome, so terrifying, and the whole evil...thing in the movie can really disturb viewers. So I strongly advise that people who cannot handle gruesome images and situations to not watch this movie. But if you can handle the plot about evil, and the horrifying images, then, watch it! It's a top notch quality film, that has a great plot, and ends very satisfyingly.Yes, the movie scared the crap out of me. Along with a great director, Brett Ratner, the movie boasts terrific actors and actresses!! Hooray for Edward Norton especially, who deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. I think he played his role magnificently. Also...wow, Ralph Fiennes creeped me out. His sensitive and mysterious personality was scary. Of course, Anthony Hopkins did good, as usual, and so did Emily Watson.That's my review.

I can understand how many of the reviews by others might think it not a bad film comparing it to Silence of the Lambs and being the so-called Prequil to that movie.Watch Manhunter and realize what a piece of tripe Red Dragon really is. Despite having copied almost everything in Manhunter, the film misses the point completely as do many of the reviewers commenting on it here. The story is Not! about Hannibal Lecter. It is about the mind of the investigator which struggles against the realization that he is closer to the mind of the killer than is normal or acceptable. There is always the feeling that he could go over the edge and become a killer himself. Superbly brought out in Manhunter, totally lost in Red Dragon.What I find most pathetic about Red Dragon is that no one involved in the film, director and actors included, have had the grace to give Michael Mann the Director of Manhunter any credit whatsoever.Shame on them!",Red Dragon
412,JackStallion,this is a truly excellent film.,10,26 January 2008,"I felt the need to comment on this film after reading several negative opinions of it on the 'Manhunter' boards. 'Red Dragon' is, in my opinion, the better of the two. As well as the second best of all the Lecter films. I think we can all agree how great 'Silence of the Lambs' was. Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were tremendous. Hopkins has the meatier role, so tends to get the press, but Foster's vulnerable portrayal is truly what sells the film. Then, along came 'Hannibal'. The less said about that cartoon the better. So, my hopes weren't very high for 'Red Dragon'. Especially with Mr. Rush Hour at the helm. But, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. It's a very nuanced film that builds upon who Hannibal Lecter really is. The opening scenes with Lecter at the symphony, hearing those off notes; then later his sly, evil, bourgeoisie charm at the dinner party is in full effect. It gives a rich portrait of the man. And, the scene in the study with Norton and Hopkins is fabulous. The back and forth between the two is fascinating. Edward Norton has this boyish, world weary maturity that suits the character so well. And, most people fail to mention how truly terrifying and gentle Ralph Fiennes makes his Dolyrhyde. The scene where he eats the red dragon painting is fantastic. The cast on a whole is wonderful. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the perfect sleaze tabloid reporter. You just can't wait for his liver to be served with some Chianti. All in all, I've seen this film four or five times and come to appreciate it more and more.

Bereft of any soul, investment or urgency they seem to merely 'say the lines' as they appear in the script. Not one of them meets, let alone exceeds the performances of thier counterparts in Manhunter.Because of this, the whole movie seems flat and pointless. Critical moments are robbed of their impact because not only do the actors not seem to care about what is happening, neither do I.I was not impressed to see Dollarhyde's character turned into a cheap Norman Bates rip-off, although I haven't read the book so perhaps this is how he was written? I'm really not a fan of the new ending either, but again, perhaps this is nearer to the book?On the plus-side(!), the early scenes between Lector and Graham in Lector's office were new and added something to the story.In summary, go and watch Manhunter instead. Although definately pinned in the 1980's (not such a bad thing IMHO), it is immesurably better than Red Dragon in every respect.

415,lloyd dobler,Garbage,2,4 October 2002,"What a supreme waste of talent.  Dull line after dull line mixed in with unstimulating performances. This wasnt creepy, this didn't put me on the edge of my seat and that's what I came for. I came for a Thriller/Horror/Mystery/Crime movie. **SPOILER** There's one scare in it. And it's not even at the unavoidable climax where the killer isnt really dead... he's back, dum dum dahhhh. By God it wasnt even suspenseful, we know his kids not going to die and even if he does who cares, we don't know him. He was never established, It could've been the kid next door's best friend from summer camp as far as I was concerned. Basically I'm upset cause Norton, Fiennes, Watson,Hopkins and Hoffman are all fantastic actors, but you wouldn't know it from this film. Fiennes is the only one who gets a chance to stretch but even his character in Quiz Show was more exciting and that was a Drama.Anyways, I hope they did it because they wanted to work with or close to Dr. Lecter, maybe even for the money, but please not cause they thought it was going to be a great film. Brett Ratner's name should never be so close to  Michael Mann, Ridley Scott and of course Jonathan Demme's masterpiece which will never be beaten, so why bother? Stop. Kill Hannibal Lecter.  Put movies to sleep after they win best picture cause odds are it isn't going to get any better. Two more personal things that chap my ass. Why are dad's always such professional camera men in home videos? Why don't they just give it to the actor and let him shoot it, at least it would be realistic instead of having a huge steadicam or dolly shot follow a dog through two rooms.

416,kevhol2000,A very good film (from a Manhunter Fan's perspective),8,12 October 2002,"**Attention Spoilers***
""Red Dragon"" is a very good film. A dramatic retelling of a book that has inspired the imaginations of many readers. It is also, as many have already described, a book that has already been made into a controversial yet brilliant film entitled ""Manhunter"".I personally feel that both films are equally good. ""Red Dragon"" improves many of the inadaquacies of ""Manhunter"" while not really touching that film's brilliant flouishes. Put simply, ""Manhunter"" seems to be a director's movie while ""Red Dragon"" favors actor and story. I feel almost honored to see two interpretations of such a great novel.I will not describe the plot, but I will just say that I believe it is the best of the Hannabal Lecter stories, much better than ""Silence of the Lambs"". I think ""Silence"" is a great film, but it suffers from a lackluster villain (Buffalo Bill) who doesn't even compare to the Tooth Fairy. Francis Dolarhyde is a remarkable villian, an evil man yet strangely worthy of our sympathy, or at least our empathy. Ralph Fiennes plays this role perfectly. You can sense the evil in his tortured presence. Yet, much like Dr. Lecter, we still want him to break out of his bondage with the Red Dragon, and run away with true love. Emily Watson is also wonderful. You can sense her need for affection and belonging. Its a great performance, Oscar worthy.
Edward Norton and Harvey Keitel are also good in their respective roles, and Anthony Hopkins is great as always. I enjoyed Norton, but this film doesn't belong to him. The scenes in the film that will become embedded in my memory are the scenes with Francis Dolarhyde and Hannabal Lecter. This film is about tortured people, who are chained to the monsterous chasm of their very soul.""Manhunter"", by contrast, was a film about a man who must look into the depths of this chasm to find these tortured people. William Peterson's performance and Michael Mann's stylish direction was the key to that film. Although Brian Cox and Tom Noonan were good in their respective roles, we never really got to glimpse into their madness. The direction ""Red Dragon"" takes is the opposite. And we, as the audience, are given two great films as a result.Score: 7.5 Grade: B+",Red Dragon
417,carsonhuelle,Red Dragon Review,5,21 July 2018,"Red Dragon takes place before Silence of the Lambs, and I must say, this movie surprised me. There are moments in this movie that remind of Silence of the Lambs. Will Graham (Edward Norton) is reminiscent of Clarice Starling being the ""middle man"". Anthony Hopkins is back in his role as Hannibal Lecter. And our main antagonist, ""The Tooth Fairy"" is played by Ralph Fiennes similar to ""Buffalo Bill"". Together these three make up the plot, Will Graham needs Hannibal's intellectual help to stop the ""Tooth Fairy"" from murdering families. The balance between these three characters at times is great up until Francis Dolarhyde, ""The Tooth Fairy"" finds a love interest. Reba McClane (Emily Watson), a blind girl who falls for him, not for his looks but for what is inside. This whole subplot goes way too in depth and is hard to take seriously. The more the story goes into the relationship the less we connect Graham, Lecter and Dolarhyde. Furthermore, this creates a longer run time (2hr 4min) which could have been easily avoided if you take out the whole relationship subplot. The movie does recovery with a good third act, which ties all loose ends up and references Silence of the Lambs in the process. Red Dragon is a far better movie than Hannibal and is worth the watch for any Silence of the Lambs fans.",Red Dragon
418,Sarlic,"The Silence isn't Broken, but it comes darn close!",8,4 October 2002,"""Red Dragon,"" the first in the time-line of Lecter movies and the last to be made, stacks up well with its brethen.  While vastly superior to the over-the-top, though 'good' ""Hannibal,"" it falls short of obtaining the thrill that ""Silence of the Lambs"" gives the audience.  This is not to say, however, that ""Dragon"" isn't a good movie; the truth is quite the opposite. If you liked ""Silence"" you'll like this.  While not breaking ""Silence's"" peak of cinema achievements, it is a more-than-worthy prequel.Short summary:  Will Graham (Norton), the agent who originally captured Dr. Lecter (Hopkins), has retired after his gruesome confrontation with the Doctor.  Jack Crawford (Keitel)visits Graham at his house in Florida to ask him to help the bureau in the case of the Tooth Fairy (Fiennes), a serial killer who murders entire families at a time.  Much to the chagrin of Molly, Graham's wife (Parker), Graham agrees.  It isn't long before Graham realizes that the best way to catch the Tooth Fairy is to team up with Lecter, who worked as a Bureau Psychiatrist with Graham before being incarcerated. And the dance begins!Hopkins portrayal of Lecter is, as always, over-the-top, but this is what we expect -- and love -- about the devious character/portrayal.  Lecter's charm masks his monstrous mind, creating a character that intrigues the audience to no end.  Like in ""Silence,"" there is that palpable POTENTIAL in Lecter to be the monster we know he is.  ""Red Dragon"" uses that potential to create the tension between Lecter and his captors.  The character returns to the taunting, sarcastic genius that originally ingratiated him into the minds of the audience in ""Silence.""  ""Hannibal"" failed merely because the Potential was being realized -- it was not caged.  Lecter's interaction with Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald)in ""Red Dragon"" are often times very humorous, lending a few lighter moments to an otherwise very dark character. Lecter's arrogance, and Chilton's desire for celebrity, make this quite the duo, and Heald pulls of the role as perfectly as he did in ""Silence.""  Hopkins delivers the Hannibal we all know and love.Norton plays a convincing Will Graham, and the rest of the cast does well in their roles as well.  I personally would have liked to have seen Scott Glenn return as Crawford, but Harvey Keitel did a fantastic job.  Watson, who plays the Tooth Fairy's love interest also assumes the role beautifully.The standout, however, would have to be Fiennes as Dolarhyde, the Tooth Fairy.  This character is so deep, so demented, and Fiennes plays him with restraint, like a quiet animal in mid spring that can leap into violence at any given moment.  This is not Tom Noonan's hulking psychotic in the original ""Manhunter,"" but a very sympathetic and oft-times gentle portrayal of a very, very tortured man.  A mere look from Fiennes speaks volumes. One cannot help at times loathe and pity the killer here.  Out of the three criminals (Buffalo Bill, Dolarhyde 1, and Dollarhyde 2) Fiennes takes the cake.Ratner's direction is very well done.  It seems very reminiscent of Demme's ""Silence.""  The Score jumps out at times, and though not on par with Howard Shore's in ""Silence,"" is excellent with the mood of the picture.In comparing this with Michael Mann's ""Manhunter,"" which is of course inevitable, I would pick this one, if only for the reason that it follows the book much more closely.  William Peterson's portrayal of Will Graham is just as good as Norton's.  But the overall feel of ""Manhunter"" has too much ""Miami Vice"" in it for it to be a good, tension-filled thriller.  ""Red Dragon"" has the feel of a good thriller, more like ""Silence of the Lambs."" And, while many say Brian Cox's portrayal of Lecter is superior to Hopkins, I'm sorry -- Hopkins' is just too much fun to watch.  I'll pick ""Red Dragon"" over ""Manhunter"" just for that.The only complaint I have about this is the pacing.  It seems to go too fast in the beginning -- I don't feel Graham's unwillingness to return to duty like I did in ""Manhunter.""  Also, the ending, while very clever, needs to be more clear -- it is obvious that quite a bit of time passes between one scene and the next, and the only indication of this would be to consider the healing of certain wounds -- and I don't want to go into much more detail than that for fear of spoiling some of it for you.Overall?  As good as ""Silence,"" no.  As good as ""Hannibal?""  Better.  This is right behind ""Silence"" in my book, but it's hard to compare to the what, number 8 movie in the IMDb top 250?  ""Red Dragon"" certainly will make its mark, however.  Audiences will love Lecter and see any movie Hopkins reprises the role in -- we're just too darn in love with the guy!  One can only hope that Hopkins will give it one last go and we can perhaps see Starling and Graham go after Hannibal together.  Wishful thinking, I guess.With the loads of crap that Hollywood has been putting out recently, ""Red Dragon"" is a breath of fresh air.  Go see it!  You're in for a real treat.

I found the movie to be intellectual and cunning in its own terms but I was a bit grossed out by this movie because of all the gruesome mutilations and bloodbaths but I guess that's what this trilogy is about right? Ralph Fiennes was a great actor in this movie as he usually is (The English Patient, Schindler's List- for some reason i remember him as being in a remake of Lawrence of Arabia possibly?) and he was quite disturbing as Mr. D, or Red Dragon with his back all tatooed and his habit of breaking all the mirrors that he can reach, then sticking mirror pieces in his victims eyes. The rest of the cast were a fine addition (besides Loudon the reporter guy no offence to him meant) and overall I found this movie to be a good, thinker's movie but I was grossed out a lot and that gave me a worse impression of the movie than I thought I would have had in general. I give this movie a well earned 7 out of 10 stars for it's tense moments, great music and acting, and the thinking put into the murders. Oh and especially the character of the intelligent yet psychotic Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Good work Mr. Hopkins!",Red Dragon
423,marksnakehandler,"""Vastly inferior to the entire Hannibal Lecter series.""- Tom Millan ""Kindred Gem Films 1998""",1,29 March 2007,"Don't even get me started on the inconsistencies of this film compared to ""Hannibal"". The directing was one dimensional. The writing was good but poorly executed by director Ratner. Performances by Hopkins (Hannibal) and Keitel (Crawford) were good but not good enough to save the film as it drowned. The technical was for the birds- the music and visuals looked and sounded like a rushed 'made for T.V. movie'. People found ""Red Dragon"" to be better than ""Hannibal"" because ""Red Dragon"" was more simple and less gory. Sorry but those kinds of reviews are void. ""Hannibal"" was a deeply refined and complex movie that people just didn't get- especially the Academy Awards. Ed Norton bombed badly, compared to William Petersen who played FBI agent Graham in ""Manhunter"". The continuity of ""Red Dragon"", seeing as how it took place in 1987, also drifted from actual continuity requirements. The film should have taken place in 1986 as did ""Manhunter"" and people should have dressed more like the eighties styles of clothes,hair, etc. There was no smoking in the film. None. Hmmm. Funny. For a film that takes place in 1987, where smoking was still a norm and everywhere including on Graham and Crawford, how oh how there was a subtle ""no smoking"" ""2002"" policy in the film. It boggles my mind to no end as 'non smokers' have nothing better to do with their time like saving the environment or something. Enough of this ""health Nazi""/ ""anti smoking"" garbage. If you do a movie that takes place in a certain era, for God sakes, have the continuity FIT the era without any 21st century political garbage. Then the epilogue, the worst scene in the film, gives ""credit"" and ""discreet"" worship to the 'vastly and extremely over-rated' ""Silence Of The Lambs"". Absurd. What ever happened to being a ""stand alone"" film? How did Will Graham go from a believable and rough edged/ focused cop in ""Manhunter"" (played by William Petersen) to an 'unconvincing'/ 'pencil necked'/ 'squeaky voiced wimp' in ""Red Dragon"" (played by Ed Norton)?? Norton is a good actor, but not here. ""Red Dragon"" is a sloppy, poorly directed, poorly acted (except Keitel and Hopkins) cheesy remake. Erase this entry into the Dr. Lecter series, please. Maybe, Ratner should re-edit the film and turn it into a satire of the series like ""Silence Of The Hams"". ""Red Dragon"" is simply garbage. Erase it from the series.Tom Millan ""Kindred Gem Films 1998""",Red Dragon
424,pharaoh_hatshepsut,a bad movie,3,8 October 2002,"Why is it the worst movies succeed at the box office?  The most shocking thing about this movie was how weak Edward Norton's performance was.  The plot was predictable and the characters were not believable.  The movie was not suspenseful or scary.  It just failed to deliver on every account.  The build up (or explanation) of how the red dragon's past turned him into the red dragon was laughable at best. ""If you dirty your sheet one more time, i'll cut it off!"" LOL!Every bit as bad as the 2nd one in the Hannibal series.",Red Dragon
425,janmorren,Great actors,9,18 October 2002,"Red Dragon stroke me by its suspense. Norton, Hopkins, Fiennes and Keitel are magnificent in their roles. A few details are not okay: Hopkins (Lecter) is older than in Silence of The Lambs, and you see that. Also his doctor in jail looks different, older, fatter. But the beginning of the movie is waoow!  In a few minutes you know a great deal of what has preceeded Silence of the Lambs. Fiennes isn't frightening enough to my humble opinion. But he does some freaky stuff, to get you chilled :-) The plot is somewhat forseeable. I knew exactly what had happened. And that wiped away my movie-experience, but I found it a good movie after all.Four great actors make this movie worthwhile to see. At moments I sat in suspense on the corner of my chair.In my second humble opinion: David Fincher would have been the right director for this movie. It could be a lot darker...",Red Dragon
426,Dorrito79,A decent movie with a lovable baddie,8,6 July 2010,"I saw this movie a few years ago and revisited it last week. The one thing I remembered about it was Ralph Fiennes and after watching it again, it is still only Ralph Fiennes standing out about it. First of all, the choice of Edward Norton as the empathyically supercharged cop was a complete nonsense. As much as I love Ed Norton, it was like using a Ferrari to nip out for a pint of milk to the corner shop. He is way too good for a minor role like this. The story revolved around him, but the script was just too strict for him to build any kind of connection with the viewers; we never get to care about him too much, neutral is the most I feel about his character. Except for the scene where he finally meets his arch enemy, he had no opportunity to expand his role and show off his considerable acting skills. What a waste of talent... Fiennes, on the other hand, shines as the unsociable, delusional serial killer. He steals every frame, and oozes masculinity and craziness. We get to know him so deeply that we even root for him to have a little romance with Emily Watson. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal is fab as always. I love the fact that this is the second movie that Ed Norton and Philip Seymour Hoffman do together; it made me smile. Hoffman made even a small role like his so clear-cut and individual that looking it, no one could have made such a good job with it. The cinematography is really spot on, dark, recognisable and memorable. The story, along with the director's work, is very good, although I would not put this on my all time favourite's list.",Red Dragon

428,samkrainak,a well made prequel and remake of Manhunter.,10,11 December 2005,"The prequel of Silence of the lambs is well done film. its less about Lecter and more about the nature of human evil. 16 years prior to this film was man hunter, the first movie to the adaptation of the novel. This one is better made, better of the based off the novel. you are about to meet Franices Dahlrahyde, an unspeakable human monster, who became that way threw years child abuse. The FBI nicked named him the tooth fairy. Franices hates that, because he says he becoming the RED DRAGEN. We see Dahlrahyde as a shy, very strong,heres voices of the red dragon,his abusive grandma, and a John doe serial killer, who believes he's ugly and wants to change. When fellow co-worker Reba, who's blind, gets romantically close Dahlrahyde she sees him as a human bean. This changes him, because she dose not see is ugliness. we also meet FBI agent Will graham, who has a brilliant gift of entering a killers mind. He's experienced because he captured the en genus and infamous Lector. We also meet Lecter when Will captures him, and visits him. lecter gives Will little clues to the tooth fairy because Lecter is more curious of Will s mind. The crime scene's are wickedly evil.

429,GrungeFan1996,"Great cast, great acting, but somewhat boring story.",6,24 March 2017,"Red Dragon is the prequel to the 1991 classic, The Silence Of The Lambs. Red Dragon is about an FBI agent named Will Graham (Edward Norton) who is investigating a murder pulled off by a notorious killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), and seeks advice from his old friend and imprisoned cannibal, Doctor Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Ralph Fiennes totally steals the show with his performance of The Tooth Fairy, a killer who suffered psychological damage as a child from years of abuse from his mother, who is voiced by Ellen Burstyn. He is pure evil, but was transformed into a monster from the abuse he suffered, not born one. Without question, Ralph Fiennes delivers the strongest performance in the whole film. While the film has an an amazing all star cast and great acting, Red Dragon just doesn't deliver the dark, eerie, ominous vibe that The Silence Of The Lambs did, and the story just didn't really pull me in at all. Also, I didn't like the ending at all, to me it felt forced, and was extremely cheesy. The Silence Of The Lambs is one of my favorite crime thrillers of all time, so I had high expectations for this film, yet was left feeling a bit disappointed. Red Dragon is a very well acted film, yet doesn't even come close to The Silence Of The Lambs in terms of creepiness, and the story just isn't all that interesting. I am recommending it for the amazing performances, but I feel the story could have been much better. 6.5/10.",Red Dragon

431,The Technology Teddy-Bear,Absolutely Delicious ...and I knew what it beforehand.,9,6 October 2002,"The opening scene, now apparently leaked by the studio as well as being made quite obvious within the scene itself, says everything about the movie. Absolutely delicious!Admittedly, I had very high expectations for this production, given the incredible ensemble cast (and it truly was an ensemble performance), but the finished meal is always better than the recipe (more food analogy. Sorry) ""Red Dragon"" proves once again that what makes an incredible movie is not action, stunts, and special effects, but well developed believable characters, incredible story, an original plot, and a journey.  ""Red Dragon"" was an incredible journey.  There were so many major elements to love as well as nuances to savor.  The cast, again, was incredible.  I couldn't have imagined anyone else but these seven spectacular actors playing these characters.  The story and screenplay each are examples of the best of American literature and cinema.  Danny Elfman's score, like perfect seasoning, only enhanced everything else.  The photography and cinematography were breathtaking. I even loved the ""costumes"".  I rarely even care about wardrobe and costumes in plays and movies, but even that element was exemplary.  This is what going to the movies is supposed to be like.  A joy, a sensational experience, pure entertainment, and a temporary suspension of reality in exchange for the reality being projected on the screen.  Granted, I anticipated a great deal to begin with, but my expectations were significantly exceeded.  Surely, I could mention nuances that, perhaps, could have been changed, but they would be on the magnitude of a fork being set slightly crooked at the table setting of the best dinner you've ever had in your entire life.  What is it about this movie's relationship with food and dining?  Oh that's right.  It's absolutely delicious.If you don't see ""Red Dragon"", you're truly starving yourself.  Go.

Anthony Hopkins revels at playing Hannibal, and I don't think he even had to try this time. It's clear he knows him. As do we, which makes the movie have an element of fun it.",Red Dragon
434,loix,"call me shallow, but this remake is an improvement",8,12 October 2002,"When I first looked up ""Red Dragon"" on IMDb, I also got hits for ""Manhunter"", which I promptly looked up. I was very much impressed with the good reviews this predecessor had garnered, and almost had second thoughts about seeing the remake. But after watching both versions a week apart from each other, I have to disagree with the numerous critics and admit that ""Red Dragon"" is a justifiable remake (unlike so many others).Here's a (hopefully) politically correct way to put the comparison: ""Manhunter"" looks like a decent play, and ""Red Dragon"" is the better motion picture. I must admit I very much enjoyed the modern-looking and extremely tailored feel of the sets in ""Manhunter""; the attention to the slightest detail (and lights, colors, etc) is palpable, in fact almost oppressive, and distracts one's attention from the characters, which might or not be a good thing.But I couldn't help but miss the dear old Hannibal Lecter of the Hannibal trilogy, so masterfully--some people call it jadedly, but I don't agree--played by Sir Hopkins. His Hannibal Lecter has an intimacy in his tone, in keeping with someone who can see through people and privy to their most fiercely guarded secrets, and the threat that intimacy creates is so delicious. The rest of the cast on ""Red Dragon"" also delivered what could be expected from their stellar resumes, and didn't give off the feel of moving about a sterile stage set, weighting every single word in their lines (a second suffocating factor in ""Manhunter"").On the other hand, I disagree with the critics' dogged recitation of the resumes of each person involved in the two projects, especially the directors. Some critics blame the ""Red Dragon"" on the director, whose ""oeuvres"" include the likes of ""Rush Hour"". While I couldn't sing praises of the directing (which I don't feel too strongly about either way), I prefer the organization of ""Red Dragon"", especially the pre-credit sequence, which I found very funny (no spoilers here), and the (beginning) credits themselves, where the story of the denouement of Graham's previous episode with Lecter is told through newspaper clips, as collected by Dolarhyde. These effects were achieved, maybe not as interestingly, by the heart-to-heart father-and-son talk in ""Manhunter"".The music of ""Red Dragon"" is also much less in-your-face than the one of ""Manhunter"", and very much different in style. (The friend I went to see ""Red Dragon"" with disagrees on this point, but then she hasn't seen ""Manhunter""!)There are some cheap shots in the plot of ""Red Dragon"", which I cannot disclose without spoiling the movie for future viewers (and I won't), but even these flaws are part of what one can expect from a regular Hollywood movie and therefore forgivable. If one is ever in the terrible bind where one has to choose between the two movies, I'd recommend ""Red Dragon"" any day.",Red Dragon

It surpassed my expectations, hands down.This movie is great, with no light use of the word. I would love to go into far and heavy detail about the plot and the climax, but anything I may say could give some of the movie away.Just know that Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Watson, Ralph Fiennes and Harvey Keitel give an all-star effort and you will not be let down.

438,cstead,"Excellent Movie, fails at last hurdle.",8,20 October 2002,"In a recent poll by US magazine Entertainment Weekly, Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins' Oscar winning connoisseur of Homosapien buffet, was voted the most popular villain of all time. In this, the third Hopkins Hannibal film and prequel to the Oscar winning Silence of the Lambs, it is this infamy, along with two diverging story lines, which plague an otherwise entertaining and excellently portrayed study of the criminally insane.Edward Norton plays FBI agent Will Graham, a brilliant psychological detective and family man trying to escape the demons of his gift. After a successful career that included the capture of his ex-mentor (Hopkins), he is lured from retirement by boss (Keitel) to solve the mysterious murderous deeds of the Tooth Fairy (Fiennes). Utilizing a script by Silence scribe, Ted Tally and based on the first Thomas Harris Lecter novel (previously filmed as Manhunter), Red Dragon gives a younger Hannibal a different feed in the form of Norton's intelligent and experienced Graham, providing a magnificent piece of entertainment in the process and adding meat to the tentative relationships which surround Lecter.However, Lecter cannot be the star. In Silence he was the second story, drawn into the conflict of Starling and Buffalo Bill, yet he emerged as the most compelling character. Thus, in Hannibal, he was reborn as the star, but the audience was not willing to accept Lecter as the gore-soaked anti-hero indulging in the wicked  ways we had unwillingly imagined in Silence. In Red Dragon, Lecter is restored back to his Silence incarnation, but the audience is lost in no-mans land. Where Hannibal reduced the psychological fear to visual trickery and the nervous Starling played victim to his unrivaled menace, we are left wanting more. The problem is, Hannibal can never be more than he was in Silence, so with each visit to the famous cell block, that steely glare peering out at us from the celluloid begins to come across contrived.This is not to say that Hopkins fails as the much younger Hannibal, as he is excellent again, enthusing more play and bounce into a personification of the character, still in the early stages of his sentence. Norton, as always, is excellent, believable in his uncanny knack for criminal understanding while brilliantly unfolding Grahams shift from flippant to determined. However, it is Fiennes and Watson who steal the show. As the tormented Tooth Fairy and his blind (if randomly blinking) work colleague, Fiennes and Watson's sub-plot are the core of Red Dragon's success. In fact, it is from their relationship that the true quality of Tally's script surfaces as it explores the 'normal' manifestation of the serial killer. At this level, Red Dragon can stand on it's own from Silence as a great film,Where Dragon fails against Silence is in its ability to hold the suspense. The immediate threat on Buffalo Bill's victim is not present here and the climax is split between it's two stories, leaving it wanting. Ratner (of Rush Hour fame) was an odd choice as director and although he conjures some excellent performances and some brilliant imagery, he over steps his bounds when trying to juggle the need to conclude two endings, while keeping his audience on the edge of their seat.Tally understands the character he created and delivers what the audience missed in Hannibal. Excellent performances herald a triumphant return for the most popular villain of all time, allowing the avid fan an intriguing new perspective on the world of Lecter and the casual viewer a cracking psychological drama. It falls short of Silences astounding impact in its lack of climatic focus and the impossibility of trying to make Hannibal anymore than he already was. However, the question remains, had this been released before Silence, where would cinematic history stand now? A fine return to form.",Red Dragon
439,badguy-1,"Not as good as ""SILENCE..."", but better than ""HANNIBAL"".",8,4 October 2002,"Only having seen ""Manhunter"" once, years ago, and not remembering much about it, I won't attempt to compare that film to it's remake, ""Red Dragon"". I've also never read any of the Thomas Harris novels that they are based on, so I won't compare them to the books either. But I will compare it to the other, more recent films in the Hannibal Lecter series, ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"".I think most would agree that, ""Silence..."" is a classic. It's one of those movies where everything came together beautifully. The director, the actors, the story, etc. It's to serial killer, suspense films as ""The Godfather"" is to mafia movies. I feel the only other movie of it's type to have even come close after ""Silence of the Lambs""' release was ""Se7en"" with Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt. So, it was with a lot of disappointment that I left the theater after seeing the long awaited sequel to ""SOTL"",  ""Hannibal"". Jodie Foster didn't return to play the part of Clarice Starling, Jonathon Demme didn't direct, and worst of all, Sir Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter was almost cartoonish. On top of that, the film was just ""ugly"". It felt nastier and dirtier than it's predecessor. More concerned with gore and blood than telling a decent story.Well, I'm happy to report that ""Red Dragon"" has put the series back on track. This time around, Hopkins plays Hannibal, more as we first remember seeing him in ""SOTL"". meaning more subtlety and slyness and less of the scenery chewing and over-acting that went on in ""Hannibal"". Edward Norton is just fine as FBI agent, Will Graham, who puts Lecter behind bars and then comes out of retirement to help solve the case of ""The Tooth Fairy"". Ralph Fiennes gives a very creepy and effective performance as Francis Dolarhyde, so good is he IMHO, that I expect him to get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor next year. It helps that his character is more fleshed out, pardon the pun, than Ted Levine's serial killer in ""SOTL"".The director, Brett Ratner, has done a fine job of ending, (hopefully), this series on a high note. I say, hopefully, because as much as I enjoyed ""SOTL"" and now, ""Red Dragon"", one more trip to this well, will probably produce nothing but mud.The only thing that stands in the way of higher praise on my part, is that it's a sequel, er prequel, to a well loved and admired film. We've seen some of these characters and situations before. The meetings between Graham and Lecter are good, but they don't enthrall me the way they did between Starling and Lecter. All in all, a  fine job on everyone's part. It may not be as groundbreaking as the original ""SOTL"", but it has helped to wash away the ""bad taste"", sorry, left behind by ""Hannibal"".",Red Dragon
440,gabrielbergmoser,Unnecessary,6,6 April 2007,"There are many reasons for remaking a classic, apart from just making money. These reasons include contemporary relevance (War of the Worlds), the original was the directors favorite film (King Kong), experimentation (Psycho), re imagining the original (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and a 6/6/06 release date (The Omen). However, one of the worst reasons ever is so that Anthony Hopkins can replace Brian Cox and take the originals place in a classic horror franchise.Manhunter is a classic, as is The Silence of the Lambs. The problem is that Anthony Hopkins is more well known as Hannibal Lecter, and as such he needs to appear in the 'official' Manhunter remake, rendering the original obsolete in the series.So how is the film anyway? Well, it goes without saying that Manhunter was far better. As far as remakes go, Red Dragon is OK, but nowhere near as good as the original two.Anthony Hopkins is terribly overused. His performance is good, but his effect in the previous films came from his hardly appearing.Edward Norton is good in his simple everyman role, and Harvey Keitel brings a solid supporting character. Ralph Fiennes is an excellent villain, easy to both detest and feel sorry for.The direction is par, without any of the style of the previous films.

442,Last Tango,An excellent thriller highlighted by an outstanding Ralph Fiennes performance,7,6 October 2002,"Red Dragon is more in the vein of Silence of the Lambs than Hannibal and this works in its favour. Ridley Scott's Hannibal has its strong points and certainly is not as bad as some would hove you believe but this movie brings Hannibal back to his subtler roots. Norton gives another great performance and shows no signs of slowing down. Hopkins simply can't have a bad performance. He injects so much life into Lector's character that we root for him even though we know we shouldn't. Keitel turns in a great performance in his small role. I wish he would have more star vehicles though. By far though, the best performance in the movie goes to Ralph Fiennes. Sometimes his face says everything most actors couldn't even portray with the best of scripts. I seriously hope this Fiennes performance does not go unnoticed at the Academies, but hell, his performance in Spider will probably get him lots of attention anyway. Red Dragon, overall, is outstanding, on par with its big brother Silence of the Lambs. No reason to give it any less than 9.5 out of 10.",Red Dragon
443,barracuta9,A total thrill ride from the first five minutes.,10,5 October 2002,"After the mildly mediocre script and directing of `Hannibal', by Ridley Scott, I was going into `Red Dragon' with mixed expectations. Having read the novel by Thomas Harris, I was both anxious yet weary as to how Ratner would make the transition from book to film.While staying loyal to the novel, Red Dragon has taken many different elements and placed them out of order. In favor of the slow building suspense Harris built in his novel, Scott dives right into the action. Edward Norton gives a glamorous performance as the retired FBI Agent Will Graham, and as always, Sir Anthony Hopkins captivates both our minds and our emotions as the blood chilling and meticulous Hannibal Lector, who is in a similar situation as he was in Silence of the Lambs. A startling amazing performance is given by Ralph Feinnes as the jaded and schizophrenic Francis Dolarhyde. Ratner is able to place us inside Dolarhyde's head by use of simple dialogue and simple passions in a way that Scott failed miserably to do in `Hannibal' with his portrayal of Mason Verger as a shallow, two-dimensional villain.This is a must see movie. Ratner has learned from Scott's mistakes, and has not repeated them. This movie WILL be nominated for just about every Academy Award possible, as a thrill ride of this psychological magnitude has not graced our movie screens since the original Silence of the Lambs.",Red Dragon
444,brakhoed,Blabla of the Lambs,7,12 January 2003,"Red Dragon is yet another Hannibal movie. For me, the fun of watching these movies lies in the marvelous Hannibal/Anthony Hopkins. Only  Silence of the Lambs is a complete story in which all characters fit perfectly, and the story keeps a terrific, mindblowing pace. I like Edward Norton in Fight Club, Death to Smoochy, The Score, but I don't think he should have taken this role. Though he lifts the character beyond your average FBI cop, that's all he can do: I can't help concluding that the character, as it is written, isn't interesting enough, at least not like Clarice Starling is. And Harvey Keitel should never again be casted in a supporting role. And then there is Philip Seymour Hoffman, I think this movie doesn't serve his talent: his character is too supporting. For instance in Magnolia he also has a supporting role, but more time to do his job well. Concluding: I think the director let a chance go by to introduce some talented new actors to do the job, and that the story all together is slightly over-estimated.",Red Dragon
445,mentorrus,Almost rivals Silence of The Lambs.,10,31 October 2002,"Brett Ratner's prequel to Silence of The Lambs is so good that it almost rivals Jonathan Denme's original film. The reason being is the fact that almost every thing here works in such a top notch manner that it almost too good to be true. Anthony Hopkins returns in top form as Hannibal Lector, and he is join this time by Edward Norton who plays Agent Will Graham. Will Graham is the man who captured Lector and put him away for all those years. That of course did come with a hefty cost to his own well being.  It's now a few years latter, and a serial Killer named the tooth fairy is running a state by state murder spree, and the F.B.I only choice for the job of catching this killer is poor retired Will Graham who would rather do anything other than deal with Serial Killers. After much thought, Will does reluctantly return to the bureau but in time realizes that he must again confront what he fears most, and talk to the good Doctor himself. What makes this film so great is the sparks create By Hopkins and Norton who take their rivalry in new directions, and comes up with an interesting twist to their relationship. Hannibal Hates Will with such passion that the viewer can almost taste it. Hannibal Sees Will as his equal and in Hannibal's mind no one should be his equal. Will on the other hand Sees Hannibal as the dark side of himself, and that alone scares him because of the tightrope he crosses every time he enters the mind of one of the monsters he has to catch.  Add to the mix, The serial Killer called The Tooth Fairy, who rather be known as The Red Dragon, who's very image hangs in his home as sick inspiration for his crimes. Ralph Fiennes Plays Francis Dolarhyde, the sick and sad killer who rather be a good person but always ends up listening to his dark inner self in order to find some kind of meaning in his life. Fiennes Is so good that he almost Steals the movie away from Norton and Hopkins with a very tight and modulated performance that is sad and utter frightening at the same time.All of this and a great script makes this not only a worthy entry in this series, but it might also be the best suspends film since it's forefather, The Silence of the Lambs.On a side note, The Movie called Manhunter was the first adaptation of Thomas Harris novel Red Dragon, but compared to this film, the movie does not come close to it's excellence.",Red Dragon

The culprit working in a photo shop, a victim in a wheelchair, the almost gothic house where the murderer lived ... all in both films.

447,Facehugger2K8,Simply Amazing!!!,9,13 September 2004,"I just rented ""Red Dragon"", and let me just say that I have just spent the best two hours I have ever spent watching a movie in a long time. This is probably one of the best prequels that have ever entered the realm of cinema, as it delves deeper into the mind of serial killer, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). The movie stars Edward Norton, as an FBI agent researching a murder case, with the help of Dr. Lecter, not knowing that the latter is the one whom he seeks, until they put up a brawl and both come out wounded. Lecter is imprisoned and Graham (Edward Norton) is hospitalized. Graham then decides that it is time for him to stop putting his family at risk and worry and be there for them, therefore retiring from the FBI.This retirement doesn't last long though, as similar murders to Dr. Lecter's start to arise in different cities, Graham's expertise is then again sought to catch this killer, identified as 'The Tooth Fairy'/Francis Dolarhyde, excellently performed by Ralph Fiennes, whose character's childhood has been violated by the apparent grandmother. But this killer starts to overcome his instincts as he starts to fall in love with a blind co-worker (played by Emily Watson), who seems to be the complete opposite of everything he thought about life. It then becomes a psychological battle between Dolarhyde and the Red Dragon, putting more than one life at the stake, including Graham's family. This movie is a perfect example of remarkable acting, excellent character development, plot continuation, and outstanding direction. It lives up to 'The Silence of the Lambs', giving us a better understanding of Hannibal 'The Cannibal', continuing the mentor-student relationship between Graham and Lecter, as it did with Jodie Foster in 'Lambs'. Simply excellent. 4 out of 5 stars.",Red Dragon

I know it has that Miami Vice 1980's look but the movie is a lot more tense.  This felt a little bit like watching a serial killer paint by numbers set.  Nothing was shocking, nothing was scary, nothing much happened that wasn't totally expected. Which is too bad because I love all these actors, Ed Norton in particular.",Red Dragon
451,AKIRA-24,Before Hopkins get old...,6,5 November 2002,"Well, another unnecessary prequel.Unfortunately for the producers, Hannibal Lecter was not the main character in the original book, But they were trying very hard to make this happen. In my opinion this is the first mistake for this movie. They got a great character: Francis Dolarhyde ""The dragon"". And a formidable actor: Ralph Fiennes. But no! The audience will come to see Lecter so give the audience what they want. BIG MISTAKE!!!Hopkins character is not as natural as in the other two. In Silence of the lambs we see  a Hannibal well delineated, and in the right place. A very twisted man, perverse, manipulator and with a very deep weakness:  Clarice Starling.In fact the main character of this great Thriller. And gratefully in Hannibal we see a Dr. Lecter liberated, in his own arena, showing us the ""Psychotic-gory-gentleman"" he presumed to be since SOTL. And  deeply in love. This last thing shows a very sad part of the character. In my personal point of view this is the best Hannibal Lecter in the trilogy. At least the one I enjoy the most. But in Red Dragon Hopkins felt so pretty self sure of the character that he forgot to propose something new. To me it looks like a bad imitation of the first interpretation in SOTL. An is it clear to me that Ratner never decided if he wants to make a prequel or a complete different movie from the other two. Well, maybe to much Laurentis pressure.What separates a great Film director from a common one? Well the difference between Ridley Scott and Brett Ratner is that the first one dares to make a complete different sequel movie from a very successful first part. And the second just try to make the homework without propose something new. Bret Ratner risk anything!Great cast don't make great movies. And this one is a great example. Edward Norton is good but just that. Hopkins is not as good as before. Harvey Keitel is a great actor but I think this one was Scott Glenn Character. Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson are the best interpretations in this movie. And precisely here is when I note the worst Ratner's mistakes to tell this story. This is the ""story"" that needs focus. Is it a great one. But it hasn't the necessary attention because: O God! we need to see Hannibal!Is it clear to me with the opening sequence, and the ridiculous closing one with that obvious and unnecessary reference to SOTL, they were forcing a situation the book never gave to. Pretty sad but true.And of course. They needed to make this movie before Hopkins get old or noticed the big mistake. An just a Director like Ratner (famous for the Rush Our movies and Family man) can accept to make a movie with a pressure of time like this one. Come on! Hannibal was in theaters just a year and a months ago.",Red Dragon
452,CambelIMDB,bad adaptation,6,29 March 2005,Especially after watching Michael Mann's Manhunter.. you can understand how bad this film is. They even couldn't decide which character they will focus.Actors' performances are OK but you know this story should not be Hannibal centered. It's more about the others. Dragon character was also not a well drown.For me this movie is just another excuse for making money over the legendary Hannibal character. I wish Hopkins wouldn't accept to be in this movie. However there is not anything to blame the director Brett Ratner. As far as I saw he tried to do his best. The script is the bad part.,Red Dragon

Luckily, my school had an advanced screening for this movie last night. This movie blew me away.  Every actor in this film fits their role to a T. It has to be the best movie I've seen all year. Comparing it to ""Silence of the Lambs"" however is a bit harder. ""Silence"" is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made and ""Red Dragon"" is great but not quite that good. It is MUCH better than Hannibal however. Overall it is a great movie and I highly recommend that you see it.",Red Dragon

The original 1986 Michael Mann ""Manhunter"", made from the book ""Red Dragon"" is the one to see. ""Red Dragon"" is a better book than ""Silence of the Lambs"", and ""Manhunter"" is a better movie than ""Silence of the Lambs"".I don't believe for a second that Ed Norton's Will Graham in this ""Red Dragon"" had the guts or the chops to identify and catch Lector, yet we're told that he did. I might come back and flesh out this review, but for now just watch ""Manhunter"" and ""Red Dragon"" (in no particular order) and see if you don't agree.",Red Dragon
456,Crystanubis,The direction of SILENCE with the budget of HANNIBAL,6,13 May 2003,"Score: 6/10 When the first trailers and posters for this movie came out, everyone seemed to be asking the same question: Why? Harsh as that may seem, when one considers that RED DRAGON was already adapted into the sleeper hit MANHUNTER (directed by Michael Mann), the existence of RED DRAGON seems to be exclusively for Anthony Hopkins' benefit; whatever can be said of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and MANHUNTER, the one thing that most agree on is that while the latter is probably the better film in terms of story, Sir Hopkins has done more for the character of Lecter than anyone besides Thomas Harris could have imagined. The point is that the Hannibal Lecter trilogy is now complete and the films it contains have a slightly greater sense of unity among them. While HANNIBAL is a very different movie from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SILENCE is a very different movie from MANHUNTER. So, for a time, we had a very loose trilogy comprised of three very different movies that took three very different takes on  three books written by the same man. MANHUNTER's relative obscurity did not make the situation better. RED DRAGON, in terms of chronology, may precede SILENCE, but in terms of style, it acts as a bridge between SILENCE and HANNIBAL. That is probably the best way to look at this film. In terms of presentation and visuals: If you liked the visual directness of SILENCE, you will be slightly disappointed by RED DRAGON's occasional artfulness in its visual execution. On the other hand, if you liked the head-trip visuals of HANNIBAL, you may be wanting something more from RED DRAGON. In terms of story: If you liked the who-dunnit quality of SILENCE (considering how little we actually see of Buffalo Bill), you will be disappointed by RED DRAGON (There is no real mystery to who or what the Tooth Fairy is). On the other hand, if you liked the deep character psychology of HANNIBAL, the Tooth Fairy's profile may be a little too formulaic. In short, if you go into this film playing favorites, you will find disappointment on all fronts. At this point, we look to the film's ability to stand on its own, which it does with moderate success. It stands a perfect middle ground. The only thing that really bothered me about RED DRAGON is the opening sequence, in which a flutist of mediocre talent disappears and Hannibal serves sweetbreads to his guests. To those who have not read the books, this sequence is presented to us only as a backstory briefly described by Starling (Moore) to Krendler (Liotta) in HANNIBAL. By fleshing out this backstory (no pun intended), it seems to invalidate the rest of the movie by showing us things we already know (and can certainly imagine).FINAL STANCE: Great acting, an above-average story, and impressive production values, but overall a tad disposable. If SILENCE and HANNIBAL formed a complete enough story for you, you could live without these extra players. If you want to know more about the Thomas Harris miniverse, it is ultimately worth seeing.",Red Dragon
457,pingufreak,Excellent Movie Driven By Oscar-Worthy Performances,10,4 October 2002,"I just got back from seeing ""Red Dragon"" and I must say right off the bat, it was MUCH better than last year's ""Hannibal"" and definitely much more on par with the multi-Oscar winning ""Silence of the Lambs"". Unlike ""Hannibal"", which was primarily driven by the gore and carnage of Lecter, ""Red Dragon"" was much more driven by the performance of its tremendous ensemble cast, headlined of course by Anthony Hopkins, once again reprising his most famous role as Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. This time out, however, Hopkins' role is more of a supporting character, although he is absolutely central to the plot. Edward Norton's performance as Will Graham was tremendous to watch as well, but it was Ralph Fiennes' performance as ""The Tooth Fairy"" which truly took centre stage. Fiennes turns in a tour-de-force performance as the psychopath pursued by Graham and admirer of Lecter. He is very well complimented by Emily Watson as Fiennes' character's blind would-be girlfriend. I loved how the ending perfectly connected this film to ""Silence"", as it is definitely much closer in nature to than it is to the disasterous ""Hannibal"". Let's hope the Academy keeps this in mind at Oscar time.",Red Dragon
458,BTKrz,Nice movie,7,2 November 2002,"Hmm...where to start?Well, this was a great movie and i enjoyed it 100%, great story, acting, music and pretty much everything.But I will comment the not so good parts, because many people have already praised the movie : some scenes were just lame especially two, the scene where Will searches the first house and turnes on the lights in the parents bedroom.Just them starts a loud music to tell us what a dramatic impact the blood has on Will, but Norton's s*** scared face would have done this trick.The other one is one where Will's wife learns how to shoot, this was pathetic as you could instantly tell that in the end it is she the one that shoots The Red Dragon.In my opinion the movie is devided in two parts, each of them having two characters interacting, the first part is the Graham - Lecter conflict and the second Dolarhyde - Reba.The first one is easily the best while the second lacks something, and that is the weak characterisation of Reba, it's confusing, at one point she is the sad, kind blind woman and then she turns into a sex freak.Some more scenes with Dolarhyde's past and his deformed face would have been useful because it is clear that at the time he isn't a freak and has had corrective surgery repeatedly.The greatest scene in my opinion was the revealing of the Dragon to the reporter.10/10 because it's simply great.",Red Dragon

460,gdrg2,An immature popcorn thriller.,7,15 October 2002,"It seems that everyone is falling into 2 categories, those who think Red Dragon is great and those that know that Manhunter is far better.  I am of the latter opinion.While this latest production had no real flaws, it just didnt make what it was aiming at or should have been.  This stems from 2 things.  First, Brett Ratner is just not a sophisticated enough director to actually handle this as a dark psychological thriller (this the man who directed Rush Hour 1 & 2, both great films just leads to no surprises).  Second, Hannibal Lectre has now been made into too much of a panto-villan to have any real power in his dialogues.Ratner's directing is smooth and uses nice rich colours.  But every mechanism for suspense and thrill seems to have been done before and you never feel that you are seeing something for the first time.  The pace is too monotonous.  While a good pace, it just doesnt fluctuate to empahsize what is happening in the plot. (Michael Manns directing around the discovery of the letter in Hannibals cell was superb and so gripping).  Ratners direction turns this dark plot that should be as disturbing yet thrilling as Silence of the Lambs, into not much more than a popcorn movie for casual enjoyment.As for Hannibal... well.  Much as I love Hopkins playing this role we have just become too comfortable with him (I thought that was why Hannibal was rather a good film).  One cant help but love Lecter's hyper-astute and intelligent mind, and dare I say it charm.  But we have been allowed to grow too easy of his insane and psychotic nature.  While I watched Red Dragon, the whole audience would laugh far to much at Lecter's dark humour.  When watching Silence of the Lambs, while being vastly entertained by Hopkins' delicious dialogues with Foster, I was always nervous of him.  In Dragon this was never the case.  I think Ratner over used this, and allowed Hopkins to rather 'ham it up' for the audience.  All of this leads to a film all too easily enjoyable (which entertaining is not necessarily so), and not a film dragging you into the disturbing and haunting world of insane killers.This film seriously lacks the depth needed to do justice to its topic. Ratner didnt have the pedigree or the experience to pull this one off.Sorry, only a 6/10 from me (wish it was 8)",Red Dragon

All the rest of the cast really fits their roles and we see amazing acting especially from Hopkins and Fiennes. After watching The Hannibal TV series, it is easier to see how Graham should have been portrayed. Someone with a darker side, having his own troubles while trying to reach the criminal minds. I do like E. Norton in many other movies but if we compare to W. Graham in TV series; Norton in this movie looks like an high school teacher, someone ordinary.

I saw Manhunter right after I read Red Dragon.  What an incredible disappointment.  It had absolutely no depth what-so-ever.

468,Tuco Ramirez,The best of the bunch,8,27 September 2002,"Brett Ratner has just proved himself to all the doubters. Red Dragon is wonderfully pieced together and complemented by tremendous performances all round. Ed Norton's magnetic as Will Graham and Harvey Keitel gives one of his finest performances for years. There's no showboating here, just pure acting class. Of course, Hopkins is given a selection of the juciest lines, but Lecter's far more menacing here and less of a comedy character than in Hannibal (although still not as menacing as in Silence Of The Lambs).The time taken to develop nearly every character on show, although never at the expense of the plot, makes this film a triumph. The creepy atmosphere is overpowering and Ralph Fiennes adds a far more believable interpretation of The Tooth Fairy than we saw previously in Manhunter. Go and see Red Dragon.

470,Ergens,A solid movie with lucid performances,9,26 October 2002,"Introducing us to Dr Hannibal Lecter as he was prior to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"", the introductory sequence to ""Red Dragon"" sets the scene for a fast-paced, well structured thriller that will capture your attention right up until the film's climax. Danny Elfman's powerful, thunderous score claps and booms as newspaper clippings detailing the shamed Dr Lecter's trial and incarceration are flapped across the screen.Anthony Hopkins' performance as Dr Lecter is as rich as ever. Mary Louise Parker's performance is noteworthy. Edward Norton's acting is subtle, a striking contrast to the vicious, animalistic approach Hopkins uses. But the real talent in Red Dragon is displayed by Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of serial killer Francis Dolarhyde. Emotionally disturbed, physically deformed and beautifully tattooed, it would have been nice if his childhood was explored in greater depth, as the book did.If it weren't being compared to Silence of the Lambs, or the cheap and tacky Manhunter, Red Dragon would receive more praise from critics.

472,chrissythomster,"Miscast, poorly scripted and directed remake of superior Manhunter",3,16 March 2009,"I can't believe that this Ratner remake has a higher average score than both Ridley Scott's Hannibal and the original Manhunter. While Scott's film has been accused of being overly stylisted and self indulgent, and Manhunter a little dated, what with it's Miami Vice setting and all, both are so much better films than this weak remake. I find it very strange that Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes and Harvey Keitel, who are usually reasonable guarantees of acting quality, seem utterly bored throughout the entire film - delivering line after line of bland dialogue, devoid of any emotional depth or believability whatsoever. Norton in particularly seems to be just going through the motions, much as he did in The Italian Job, so I wonder if this was just another big payday for him to support other projects he had a genuine interest in? Apart from the fact he looks about 12 - there is no torment in his character supposedly driven to despair by this terrible talent. His lines are not said with the conviction of a man driven, compelled to do this work because that is his curse and his gift, a man emotionally shattered by what he has done and what he knows he must do. Anyone who has read the novel will surely lean much further towards William Peterson's Graham than Norton's - looking tanned, toned, with a fine head of blonde locks, with only a manly scar on a six pack to suggest any history.Similarly, Fiennes, who has made a career of playing understated and typically repressed characters, seems way out of his depth here - at least he made an attempt at emotional depth and character, though it falls way short of the power and detachment of Tom Noonan's Dollarhyde in Mann's film. I presume because Fiennes had impressively played one psychopath in Schindler's List, they he could do it here - he sure didn't get this part from The English Patient or End of the Affair.And Kietel as an FBI head honcho? He can play offbeat, he plays quirky, he plays anti-authoritarian, he's a tough guy, he's a loner chock full of barely retrained fury. He's Bad Lieutenant! What he isn't Good Jack Crawford, a suit, a leader, a worker for 'The Man'. Further more, and not being harsh to Harvey, but he never really comes across as the brightest of men, so all his lines sound rehearsed and as if they should come from someone else. Sorry, but this just ain't your bag Keitel.It is no secret that while Hopkins gladly reprised his role in this film, he was decidedly unhappy with the script and his role within it - really just re-hashing almost word for word what Brian Cox did so brilliantly in the original. Of course, he is still chilling and deserves his place as one of the most memorable film characters in movie history, but he over eggs the soufflé here resulting in a bit of campy old nonsense. The opening 10 mins was excellent, but like the rest of the main cast, boredom seems to get the better of him so his Lecter in this film is more of a pantomime villain, rather than the wonderful creepiness of his performance in Lambs or the much more restrained insanity yet genuinely sadistic as in Hannibal.Only Emily Watson and Phillip Seymour Hoffman come away with any decent acting chops here. Hoffman is brilliant in almost anything he's in, so here his smarmy, oily Tatler hack is excellent both in this film and in comparison to the character in the book and the original film.Of course, a heavy dollop of blame for all of this must be served to Bret Ratner, who for a while now seems to be on studio speed dial if they want someone to take over a tired franchise to try and eek a few more dollars out of it. His films are about as safe and mainstream as you can get. He is the epitome of the typical big budget studio director. Don't take chances. Play to the masses. Do what the studio tell you. Take your massive paycheck. And why not I guess. Fair play to him. Say what you like about Manhunter, Lambs and Hannibal, but all of them had suspense and used the plot, dialogue, cinematography and performances to capture the mood of the film and give it genuine tension - here Ratner captures none of that and thus what we see is just a watered down version of what previously was a great story with wonderfully drawn characters put in difficult situations.Finally, I have to mention the shocking editing - exactly what you would expect by a guy who made his career on action films - too fast, no time to establish and increase tension, just go straight in for the kill. About as subtle as a brick in the face. To be fair to the editor, he has cut many financially successful action films with Ratner, but any bloke who is responsible for Showgirls should not be put in charge of cutting something like this. in short.

473,pov99,RED DRAGON IS NO MANHUNTER,5,7 October 2002,"Comparing Red Dragon to Manhunter is no contest, Manhunter is always going to win hands down.Hopkins is so OTT that you'd think this followed Hannibal.  Brian Cox read his lines with genuine relish, where Hopkins seems forced.  Hopkins telephone scene just isn't cool/scary/funny, where Cox peforms this perfectly.  This scene isn't executed very well either due to Direction and Editing or perhaps even scriptwriting.Ed Norton, Harvey Kietel and Ralph Fiennes also suffer from this problem. Kietel is just underused period.  Fiennes is okay but can not compare with Tom Noonan's terrifying portrayal of Dollarhyde the Dragon.  Ed Norton is watchable as always but keeps having ideas every ten minutes that are just plain stupid.  Now William Petersens scenes were all a little slower but were much more believable.Emily Watson and Joan Allen as Reba are on par although I think Emily Watson would have performed better given more time.Now talking about time, Anthony Heald as Chilton didn't really have anything new to do and looked much older than he did in Lambs, where Hopkins was just about passable.Frankie Faison as Barney (one of my favourite characters from the books and SOTL and HANNIBAL and who played Fisk in MANHUNTER) needn't have bothered, what a waste of his time and talent.  He was filmed in shadows too, an unknown extra could have played the part and no one would ahve noticed.Underused again was Philip Seymour Hoffman, I forgot he had been in it until I saw the movie poster again leaving the theatre.  Stephen Lang was more of a greaseball in Manhunter but at least he had some script to work with.Brett Ratner, enough said.  Maybe Rush Hour 3 would be a better project for him next time.  Crap inconsistent cliff hangers aren't my bag thanks. Michael Mann is the Man!An ending stolen from The Mean Season (Kurt Russell movie) is just crap! Remember the masterful editing of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida in Manhunter.Did Will Graham have a family that anyone cared about in Red Dragon?They never seemed to have anything to do! Everything must be explained to us in Red Dragon where there was still a bit of mystery to Manhunter (lies in the newspaper, Graham and Lecters previous relations). All Lecters scenes have been extended and have left the rest of the ensemble cast with nothing to do.  Lounds burning on the wheelchair is just crap this time round.Graham time in a psychiatric unit in a hospital and Dr. Blooms warning of a relapse helped to explain how Graham could reconstruct killers fantasys in his own mind.  Was this evident in Red Dragon?No.  It was crap plain and simple.Must be time for another Will Graham brain wave.",Red Dragon

After all, Hannibal was drivel. And remaking a movie that is less than 2 decades old is usually a bad sign. And the film is directed by Brett Ratner, who's claim to fame are irrelevant, silly, often offensively bad blaxploitation action/comedies.This film absolutely blew me away.   While it lacks the shocking power and rawness of ""Silence"", compensates for that with a much more engaging villain. Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of ""D"", also known as both ""The Toothfairy"" and ""Red Dragon"", is fantastic.  Anthony Hopkins is much more at home back in his cell, and Edward Norton brings his usual likeable self to the role of Will Graham.  The film is beautifully shot and dark, though not as gritty as ""Silence"", and is genuinely creepy.  Best of all, it truly engages you with the characters, both the police, Hannibal, and the killer, a rare feat.  I highly recommend this film to any fans of suspense, murder mystery, horror, or any fans of Silence of the Lambs.",Red Dragon
475,rolo_tomassey,A Creative Remake Worth Seeing,7,8 October 2002,"I've seen some remarks about the need to redo a film that was originally made 16 years ago.  Some say it was the holy dollar that motivated Hopkins, the director, and the film company to put forth their efforts in a remake. Some say the author of the series, Thomas Harris, was never satisfied with Michael Mann's original attempt at the Red Dragon adaptation, ""Manhunter"".I would agree with the critics screaming greed, if only the film did not make artistic strides and cinematic improvements over the original.  But it does.  Director Brett Ratner's interpretation of Red Dragon results in a film that is more colorful, more suspenseful, and more artistically significant than its predecessor.  And we are treated to more screen time from Hopkins, which is a real treat.  Arguably, Hopkins as Lecter is the best casting move in film history.So if you're worried that this film is in the same category as ""Hannibal"", the second installment in the series, worry not.  This one is much better, and deserves to be packaged in a 2-DVD set with ""Lambs"".Enjoy.",Red Dragon
476,katieholmes30,amazing! Anthony Hopkins has outdone himself,10,12 October 2002,"well, first of all, I went to see this movie last night for the first time.. my friends and I went there without high hopes for the film because of the results of Hannibal,, personnaly, I thought that Hannibal ruined the series..it was atrocious! my friends and I went to see it in theaters and we almost walked out.. but anyways, back to the subject..I went to see it last night at the 7:00pm show.. and when the movie was over, I was speechless.. it was amazing!! It had the right amount of gore, suspense, and horror!! The movie is well worth seeing just for Anthony and Ralph alone..Their performances were mind blowing..and the story, the plot, everything was just so perfect!! I would even compare it to silence of the lambs, honestly! So, if you want to get a good scare or just see a great movie, do NOT miss this one!!  I give Red Dragon a 10/10!",Red Dragon

So many people are gonna feel a little lost cause THE RED DRAGON is the very beginning, and in reality we get to watch it at the very end...But thinking about it...it is not bad, EXCEPT FOR HANNIBAL THAT IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR ME...So here we go, in this order...""Red Dragon"", ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", and""Hannibal"".................",Red Dragon

I have read the book a long time ago and it was extremely frightening.

479,King_of_IMDB,"""Do you dream much Will?""",8,15 July 2003,"This movie was released with my highest of expectations after witnessing the Silence of the Lambs, one of the greatest movies ever, and Hannibal which was just gross, weak, and hard to sit through. Red Dragon delivers a masterpiece through the actors/actresses ability and Brett Ratner's unique and creative direction.Red Dragon survives solely on Edward Norton, Anthnoy Hopkins, and Ralph Fiennes stellar acting performances at spots because the plot is repetitive of Silence of the Lambs and parts of the writing were dull and weak. Edward Norton is the actor for the part of Will Graham, the hero FBI agent in this one, and he brings life to the role as did Jodie Foster 12 years ago. Emma Watson displayed brilliant talent in her role as the blind love interest of the serial killer(the Red Dragon or the Tooth Fairy). Anthony Hopkins is the greatest actor of all time, and I shuddered at the sound of Dr. Lector's voice throughout the picture. Ralph Fiennes illuminates the Red Dragon/Tooth Fairy and astonishes me with his cunning ability to act insane.Red Dragon is well- paced and has shock value. For example, when Hannibal attempts to frighten Will Graham by snapping his teeth in his face and when the killer is after Will's family in the end. The movie never leaves the audience gasping for air but never leaves the audience falling asleep either. The twist in the end is unexpected but not too far-fetched and leads to a brilliant conclusion between Will Graham(Ed Norton) and the Tooth Fairy(Ralph Fiennes.With all the elements combined Red Dragon comes through and is a solid movie I suggest to everyone who can stomach serial killers. 9/10",Red Dragon

The movie could not of gotten a better cast and this movie makes up ten times for the borefest we know as Hannibal (only the ending was amusing). I thought that with the great acting of Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton, some payed less attention to the outstanding, and sometimes chilling, performance of Ralph Fiennes as the Red Dragon, a crazed psycho killer killing innocent families to fulfill his sexual needs (see the movie if you don't understand). Emily Watson delivers as a blind woman Fiennes character cares for and the always likeable Harvey Keitel adds some flavor to an already tasty cast. Loved the movie.

482,duskeye,You owe me AWE!,10,22 September 2007,"Fantastic, and much better than Manhunter. Don't get me wrong, one of my top five favorite films of all time is 'Heat.' I much prefer Michael Mann's direction to Brett Ratner's in general. But as good a film as Manhunter is, Red Dragon is simply better. I also much prefer the performances.I'm tired of the endless negative posts about Ed Norton's performance. I for one thought he was brilliant, right on the money as Graham. Norton is such a chameleon as an actor, he completely embodies whichever character he's playing, whether it's in Fight Club, The Illusionist, Primal Fear, Larry Flynt or here.Graham is a broken cop with the 'gift' of projection, a gift that is like a living nightmare. Norton played this to perfection, he came across not as 'lazy', but world weary, vulnerable and somewhat detached, though for very human reasons. Totally nailing the Graham from the novel in my opinion. For those who heap scorn on Norton's performance, if I may borrow a line from the film - ""You looked but didn't see."" There isn't one performance in Red Dragon that wasn't absolutely top notch, particularly Fiennes, Keitel and Emily Watson. Even Parker and Hoffman shone in their relatively minor roles. And we all know Hopkins IS Lecter. His dynamic with Norton is truly fascinating. The script was spot on and there are just so many amazing scenes - ""Mrs. Jacobi changing, do you see?"" Great stuff.Red Dragon is no Silence Of The Lambs, but then again, what is? It's a very worthy sequel/predecessor and a fantastic piece of entertainment. Manhunter is a good film, but I don't feel its the classic a lot of people make it out to be. It hasn't aged terribly well, and it deviates from the book too much for my liking. Difficult to compare it to Red Dragon anyway considering they're completely different kinds of films. Just comes down to personal preference, but I'll take Red Dragon any day. 10/10",Red Dragon
483,dempseyeo,A faithful adaptation *slight spoilers*,8,14 October 2002,"The third installment in the Hannibal Lecter series sees the most impressive cast that the franchise has attracted thus far looking to recapture the horrific thrills of Silence of the Lambs, and of course to reap the plaudits and rewards as Hopkins did afterwards. To some degree they achieve this goal. Red Dragon is an efficient, well acted thriller which does provide much of the horrific excitment of it's early predecessor. Importantly it manages to steer away from the gory emptiness of Hannibal,which seemed to try to shock the audience into forgetting how vacant and unexciting the movie actually was.Edward Norton is his eternally watchable self as he expertly underplays the role of Will Graham, an FBI agent, so scarred both mentally and physically by his capture of Hannibal Lecter that he is forced to retire from the Bureau. It is this opening scene, in which Hannibal is captured, that is the only major deviation from Thomas Harris' classic upon which the movie is based. The book opens with the visit of Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) to the retired Graham in an attempt to lure him back into the fold in an attempt to track down a terrifying new serial killer, ""The Tooth Fairy"", beautifully portrayed with terrifying uncertainty by a buffed up Ralph Fiennes. Emily Watson almost steals the show as his blind love interest. But the focus of the film is most certainly on the broad shoulders of Anthony Hopkins.Perhaps it is Hannibal himself, the star of the show, who dissapoints most however. Other than in the opening scene where he is at his murderous best, he lacks the terrifying menace he showed in ""Silence"" and the sheer malevolence he displayed in Hannibal. He is let down to some extent by a lack of original direction and cinematography. The mood is very much as you were when Graham goes to question Lecter on his knowledge of the new spate of killings. The blatantly derivative nature of these scenes proving quite bland.The storyline zips along however and the audience does find itself drawn in by the horrific energy that Fiennes displays on his debut in the series as much as it is let down by Hopkins, it's veteran and star.",Red Dragon

This is a taunt, unnerving piece of filmmaking that really ranks right next to Silence of The Lambs as one of the best psychological thrillers ever made. Edward Norton is great as Will Graham and Ralph Fieness is amazing as Frances Dolarhyde and their performances alone are worth the praise alone, but it's Anthony Hopkins's third go around as Hannibal Lector that makes this film the crowd pleasers that it is. Hopkins gives a more unnerving performance than he gave with ether Silence or Hannibal that is laced with enough black humor that makes him almost disturbing to watch.  This film really shows how sinister Hannibal can truly be, especially when he wants vengeance.

This films greatest strength is in its excellent directing, which plays marvelously on a clenching screenplay. Never before have I felt such sympathy for a killer as I have in this case.

But then I am really disappointed because no other then Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lector . But he did not seem to be the Hannibal Lector I know . Watching him was like watching some other old guy doing Hannibal Lector. Now the other thing is plot is too familiar but lacks the intensity of Silence of the Lambs. The thing , that chemistry that we saw between Jodie Foster & Lector , is simply missing between Edward Norton & Lector. Now when you have great actors like Hopkins , Norton & Ralph Fiennes & you borrow plot from one of the greatest movies of all times , you ought to put more effort into it .

I am a big fan of Michael Manns 'Manhunter' and have the special edition on DVD. William Petersen was excellent as Will Graham in Manhunter, Edward Norton was good also in Red Dragon, he is one of my favorite actors, but in my opinion William Petersen did a better job. Red Dragon was not a bad movie, it was not as gory as Hannibal or as creepy, but having seen Manhunter so many times I think Red Dragon, for me had a lot to live up to. Ralph Fiennes was as usual very good, but not as creepy as Tom Noonans portrayal of Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter.

496,madtom-1,"""Red Dragon"" Has No Fire and Puts ""Hannibal"" to Shame.",1,1 October 2006,"WARNING: The following review, as carefully written as it was, may contain a spoiler. How did we go from having such strong, talented and famed directors, to such campy ones as Brett Ratner? How? How did we go from having such haunting and dreamlike scores in ""Hannibal"" and ""Silence Of The Lambs"", to some sort of flat, dry and campy ""made for T.V. movie"" dinners, with limitations!? Brett Ratner knows how to direct ""Prison Break"". But, he never should have directed this particular feature. It would be like telling somebody to drive a semi truck with a tractor trailer, and the only experience they have is with driving automobiles. The results would be disastrous. Hence we have this movie.The scenes with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford was well done and that's it. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save this ""prequel"" which, by the way, never should have happened. The music in the film is flat, dry and cheap. Except for Hopkins and Keitel, the rest of the acting is flat, almost monotone, totally unbelievable and just plain silly. Edward Norton should not have been chosen to play Will Graham. The look and feel of the character was not achieved by that actor. It looked as though he was just ""saying his lines"", instead of making the character totally believable. Instead he and Ratner made Will Graham out to be some ""flat lining"" idiotic wimp. Nicolas Cage or Russel Crowe should have played Graham. Ralph Fiennes, a good actor in any other film, came out as ""flat"" and ""unconvincing"". Emily Watson, a talented actress in other films, came across as annoying and ""unconvincing"" in this one. Philip Seymour Hoffman, another good actor in other films, came across as a ""total amateur"" who just ""said his lines"" without ""substance"". Where does all of this land? It lands on the director. He should have made extreme adjustments on these major infractions. The writing was good but poorly executed by Ratner- again his fault. Ratner could have taken these actors to so many different avenues and directions in their roles. He could have done so many different types of visual imagery and glittering details, just as ""Hannibal"" did. He did none of that, NONE. This says that he is either talentless or he should have not been hired for this project.The continuity is off and I couldn't stand that. For one, what happened to making Hopkins look younger with computer graphics? Didn't happen. The film should have taken place around the same time as ""Manhunter"" did which was in 1985 or 1986- NOT 1988 or 1989, JUST BEFORE and giving CREDENCE TO ""Silence Of The Lambs"" which was, out of all honesty and seriousness, over rated. Another thing was that there wasn't any smoking in the film- AT ALL. None. Not one iota. That is plainly wrong and rewriting history and plainly politics. Smoking was very common place back then- in malls, in restaurants, in airports and even in elevators. If you want to get a feel for the past, you have got to contain all of the past in order to believe in the past. I don't care if there were ""anti smoking issues"" in 2001 onward which was why the smoking was omitted. I don't care and I am, quite frankly, sick of hearing about it when there are far more serious issues out there. I wouldn't have done that. I would have put 'the smoking' into the motion picture because that was part of the past- period. Look, if you're going to water down a movie, don't do it at all and don't waste my time.The film, overall, should not have ever happened. It was big mistake. The technical was 'okay' but the choreography was for the birds. The feeling I got was that I was watching a ""made for T.V. movie"". More viewers took to ""Red Dragon"" than ""Hannibal"" for all the wrong reasons. The film's violence wasn't as visceral or graphic as ""Hannibal"", which was why they liked ""Red Dragon"". Well, that kind of review is wrong.. Another reason why viewers liked ""Red Dragon"" over ""Hannibal"" was because ""Red Dragon"" was more ""simple"" and ""easier to understand"", compared to ""Hannibal"". Well, that type of review is also wrong and void. I think the movie ""Red Dragon"" should be erased from movie history. Maybe the film, if Ratner hired an editor, could be re- edited into a comedy spoof for A & E or the Comedy Network. But, that is highly unlikely and that means that ""Red Dragon"" is out there as an annoying menace for people to waste their money on. As for the film itself, seriously?? Erase it. Lets just stay with ""Manhunter"" which was 5 stars of 5.""Red Dragon"" has no fire. If it does, the only fire it will generate will be to burn itself. Red Dragon gets 1 star out of 5.RED DRAGON (2002): 1 star of five. HANNIBAL (2001): 5 stars of five. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1990) : 4 stars of five.

497,f0o_,Cheap thrills and horrible character development,2,5 October 2002,"Let me preface this review with the following statement - I am a 22 year old male, not very religious or spiritual, and accustomed to gore.I thought Red Dragon was bad, very bad on many levels.  Crimes like this actually happen and a  movie like this cheapens murder and death to voyeuristic detached fantasies.  I could handle Hannibal, although it was a horrible movie, it seemed like a mindless slasher flick, akin to a Friday the 13th.  This movie was on an entirely different level, I watch the news at home and see things like this happening often, I don't need to go to the movies and have it slammed into me even further.  If a film studio wants to try and tackle subjects like this, show some respect.  What if your mother was raped and murdered?Secondly the Tooth fairy subplot could have been so much more.  Here we are given an insight into his mind, his struggle between being human and defeating the Red Dragon, and in the end the carpet is completely pulled out from under the audience, and surprise all of that build up meant nothing, he IS just some psycho killer.  Why even have the scene with the tiger, and the uncomfortable conversations, if in the end the amount to nothing.
I think as a person I have just found myself evolving over movies like this. If you want to do a movie with a serious subject matter than treat it with respect and dignity see Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line, or even the movie that started this all The Silence of the Lambs.",Red Dragon

Anthony Hopkins is back for the last time as the Psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter and he's still as captivating as ever. Even though Mr Hopkins has aged 11 years since Silence of the lambs and 1 year since Hannibal, he still looks great and I couldn't imagine anybody else playing the role of Dr Lecter. Do you put this at the beginning of your trilogy or at the end though? That is the question. To make the Hannibal trilogy make any sense, put it at the beginning. That is of course how it should have been but things happening as they did, Manhunter appeared first and then Silence of the lambs....the rest is history.

It is just like Silence of the Lambs all over again. However when I left the theater I was thoroughly impressed. The ending of the movie distinguished itself enough from Silence of the Lambs to make it a more than worth while viewing. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the movie is good, but it just seemed to much like the original.Now lets get to what excited me originally to go see the movie, the cast. Anthony Hopkins can play Hannible without lifting a finger by now. So he was not my primary concern. Edward Norton gave another solid performance as FBI agent Will Graham. That guy simply can not do anything badly. However I was most impressed with Ralph Fiennes as the villain in the story. He played him with a level of complexity that gave one an understanding of his mind. To round out the cast there was Harvey Keitel and Philip Seymour Hoffman, both extraordinary talent.Overall, this was a very worthy prequel but not as good as the original. However its biggest downfall is that it has to be compared to Lambs, if it was compared to any other modern day scary thriller it would easily surpass any of them. Behind Lambs it could be the second best there is, but because it has to live in the shadow of its predecessor it will never get the credit it deserves.",Red Dragon
501,jle2,Red Dragon: A Disappointing Remake of Manhunter,3,7 October 2002,"Despite an intriguing beginning, the rest was mostly disappointing.  Of course, Hopkins was good but there was no real chemistry between Keitel and Norton -- at times they appeared to be mouthing their lines and Keitel seemed to have as much air time as Norton.  Was that because Norton couldn't effectively carry the role of Graham?  Norton simply does much better as ""the bad guy.""  In Red Dragon, he lacked the authentic sensitivity of his character, a sensitivity well-captured by Petersen in the earlier Manhunter film, of which this is generally a poor remake.One example of the difference is that in Manhunter, Director Michael Mann did many shots with Blake's Red Dragon painted and re-painted in different ways on the body of Noonan, who played the psychotic Dolarhyde in that film. In the end, however, Mann decided that the painting trivialised the character.  Looking back at the Red Dragon, despite the attempts to use audio to make it seem like ""a terribly horrible sort of thing,"" the body painting made Dolarhyde into a bit of a cartoon character.  An equally poignant example of the difference is the cinematography in Manhunter: the camera work, lightening, colours and music that Mann, working with Dante Spinotti, used in the film was far superior to anything Red Dragon had to offer.""Save your money, see them all [but Red Dragon]!""",Red Dragon

And let me be among hundreds (on this site) that wrote a positive review for a great follow-up to cult classic ""Silence of the Lambs"".When I watched Silence, I thought it was extraordinary and deep, with wonderful interactions between the characters (particularly between Clarice(Jodie Foster) and Lecter(Ser Anthony Hopkins) and an eerie, yet victimized antagonist(Ted Levine). The movie was dark and suspenseful and gave me something to think about and appreciate. However, it wasn't the movie itself that drew me in to see Red Dragon. I won't say WHAT it was, but I skipped over Hannibal and went straight to Dragon, so I was spared the agony of a horrendous sequel and got to see an amazing prequel, instead. And I've got to say I was very impressed. First of all, it was interesting to see a different relationship between Lecter and another person - instead of intimidation, Lecter was more lax and ""friendly"" with Will Graham(Edward Norton), who also did a brilliant job playing a cop out of retirement. Without giving away spoilers, I'll just commend Ralph Fiennes for playing another creepy, yet tortured antagonist and Emily Watson for playing his blind ""girlfriend"". Also tip my hat to Philip Seymour Hoffman who plays his part to perfection.

504,malemonkley,Dude...,10,6 October 2002,"What can I say about this, other than this thing deserves Best Picture! Not since Titantic, has a movie such as this come out.  For those of you who don't know yet, Red Dragon is the prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"", and ""Hannibal"".  However, unlike some prequels *CoughPhantomMenaceCough* this one may actually outdo its successor.  Anthony Hopkins is incredible as Hannibal, and though he isn't as big of character as Edward Norton, everytime he's on screen he outshines everyone, with his combination of dry wit, hatred, and quiet patronizing.  Edward Norton himself is great as the tortured FBI official Graham, tired and brooding, but not overly so. Together, Hopkins and Norton are incredible onscreen together.  If any director/producer out there is listening to this one random guys voice, they should consider putting these two together again.  Awesome movie.",Red Dragon
505,twisted_firestarter_,A classic masterpiece,10,24 October 2002,"Red Dragon is the best of the trilogy for many reasons but mainly because of the brilliant actors. Edward Norton and Anthony Hopkins provide the greatest screen battle of all time. Mary Louise Parker and Harvey Keitel beautifully support the film. However it is the two Britons, Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson who centre the film. Not only do their performances hold up the film but they leave the strongest mark in your mind. Ralph Fiennes maybe the villain but he brings tears to the eye. Way to go Ratner! A definite classic!",Red Dragon

508,JU5T1CE,Top Remake,8,29 September 2002,"Being a fan of the original adaptation (Michael Manns' ""Manhunter"") I was interested in how a bigger budget/bigger name version would compare.I have to say, ""Quite Well"".Hopkins, once again gives an excellent performance as Doctor Hannibal Lecter which seems darker and more on par with ""The Silence of the Lambs"" than the lack lustred and somewhat hammed up ""Hannibal""Ed Norton is teriffic in the role of Will Graham, but seems not as disturbed as the character played in the original by Bill Petersen.The film is well paced, gets a little draggy in the middle, coming to a spectacular finish which is not spoiled by already knowing the ending from the book or from Manhunter.All in all - scarey as hell and LOVED the touch on the closing scene with Hannibal... actually made me laugh.I think that the Hopkins/Lecter story-line is nicely tied up in this (now complete) Trilogy.It would be a shame to make another Lecter film.",Red Dragon

I would recommend this to everyone, there is not alot of gore like everyone complains about, a bit of blood but that factor makes the killer seem more dangerous and make the movie more intense. GO SEE IT NOW!!",Red Dragon
510,teacher_ged,A film without a centre,3,19 March 2014,"""Silence of the Lambs"" was an outstanding, unforgettable movie. What went wrong with this prequel? Though there are problems at many levels, including casting and acting, the central failure of this movie is that it doesn't have a centre.In SOTL, there is never any doubt about what's important and why it's important. The centre of that movie is the relationship between Lecter and Starling. That's, quite simply, what the movie is about. To make that relationship believable, however, we need to feel the sense of anguish and urgency Starling feels as the countdown to the death of the next victim ticks on. We need the threat to be real, and terrifying, to justify her taking so many risks. To that end, we are given a really creepy, but at the same time utterly believable, villain, and we are shown what a dead body pulled out of a river looks (and smells) like. Every detail of that movie adds something to the central tension that drives it forward. It knows where it's going, every minute of the way.What is ""Red Dragon"" really about? Your guess is as good as mine. Is it about the pathology of the serial killer? Clearly not. Not only does no one know why Lecter eats people, no one apparently cares (unlike in Lambs). As for the Tooth Fairy, no one even bothers to explain (or even ask the question) why he kills on full moons, or why Blake's painting means so much to him (where he first saw it, what he sees in it now, or why he likes the idea of being a Chinese character on a Mah Jong piece, and what this has to do with the painting other than the dragon coincidence). Fiennes does the best he can with the script, but it does him no favours, denying him any opportunity of developing the promising strand of his feelings towards his sadistic grandmother: her influence is clumsily referenced in one scene, but not developed. Just telling us the character had some sort of childhood trauma "" and that's why he's a monster"" just doesn't cut it: we need to see and feel it to believe it.And in any case, he's not really a monster at all. In fact, Dolarhyde comes across as a gauche but charming and likable young man who just has this unfortunate habit - scarcely a tic, really - of occasionally slaughtering families. As for the journalist - well, he has ""glue me to an antique wheelchair and set fire to me, please"" practically written on his forehead from the moment he appears. You can't really blame Fiennes' character for taking him up on it. Certainly, his credentials as a terrifying serial killer pale before Buffalo Bill's. Oh, and the scene where he shows off the tattoos on his back and then looks over his shoulder at the wheelchair-bound reporter made me think of Monty Python's naked organ player. This is the kind of mess-up you really want to avoid in a serious movie.So it's not about the killers. Is it about the detective, then? ""Manhunter"" chose to focus on the tortured psyche of the detective who has to place himself in the mind of a monster in order to second-guess him. In this movie, the only ""guesses"" Will makes are obvious ones. Lecter tells him he has a ""troubling"" gift, but we see absolutely no evidence of this. The insights he achieves are those any competent detective would come round to, given the evidence. So all we get there is a miscast actor with a leaden script, who at the end of the movie manages to disappoint by not ending up with the horrifically disfigured face (""like Picasso painted him"") Harris tells us about in the book.So is it about the killer's potentially redeeming relationship with a woman? This is the best developed strand (and Watson's by far the best performance in the movie), but once again, it fails because the script doesn't let Fiennes really work out the inner conflict Dolarhyde feels with regard to her. In the crucial scene, he seems to be genuinely struggling with his feelings, but a moment later, he's cynically faking his own death and rushing off to carry out a revenge murder. He just doesn't get the chance to turn this extremely complex character into something believable, so the relationship in turn falls flat. And the tiger scene, which could be a marvellous set-piece, is wasted. Apparently the director couldn't quite figure out what he wanted the audience to feel there, beyond ""ooh, she's touching a dangerous animal"".In all, you get the feeling that the director tries to pack in as many marketable elements as possible: procedural drama, psychology, horror, a little blood, a well known villain, a touch of romance, an explosion or two, etc. but without allowing any of these to take control of the film and bring the rest into line. So we get the typical dud movie that tries to do too much at once and ends up doing nothing at all.",Red Dragon

513,Rogthepost,"Forget Manhunter, this is the real deal.",9,15 May 2004,"Ignore all the hype that says Manhunter and Brian Cox are the definitive Hannibal Lecter pairing. Red Dragon was always my favourite book of the Thomas Harris trilogy, and this version didn't disappoint. We were spared the cop-out ending of Manhunter and were treated to a faithful reproduction of the original novel. Cox is a fine actor, but pales in comparison to Anthony Hopkins. He's been likened to a cartoon character, but is he really that different to the Hannibal Lecter we first saw in Silence of the Lambs? Then, almost everyone agreed, his performance was ground-breaking. Now, they harp back to Manhunter, a decent enough film, but not in the same league as this version.I'm sure Thomas Harris has now closed the Hannibal Lecter file and is wise in doing so. I feel in going out with Red Dragon, he's leaving on a high with probably the best of the Hopkins/Lecter movies. A strong nine out of ten.",Red Dragon

They were in the lunch break . Stupid .Another donut : that Graham dude seems to be indestructible .Knifes , bullets , nothing can kill him . Oh yeah , i forgot , Dr Lecter is a dog . The scene where he recognize the perfume of the Graham dude is stupid .And looks like they cut it from first episodes .Or maybe i'm wrong and Graham stinks so bad and Lecter recognize him easily . Let's say that the introduction , with the ""angry"" wife who looks concerned for her ass more than for his husband life , it's bad too . Probably they can make another 10 movies ( episodes ) with the same stupid theme . IN REAL LIFE A SERIAL KILLER IS CAUGHT AFTER 10-20 YEARS OR NEVER .

515,rikrobo,No Comparison,3,2 July 2014,"I find it odd that both movies based on the same book have the same rating of 7.2 - Manhunter is a far superior movie. The stories are basically the same, but Manhunter plays out in a much more suspenseful and interesting manner. Micheal Mann did a much better job of directing and the acting in Manhunter is a lot more believable, while the acting in Red Dragon is atrocious. The actors in Red Dragon seem like they are sleepwalking through the movie and doing little more than reading their lines. Brian Cox was a much more believable Hannibal Lecter while Anthony Hopkins portrayed him like he was a cartoon character, amplifying the falseness of the character from The Silence of the Lambs. The ending of Manhunter was much better also, even though it deviates from the book more than Red Dragon does. If you want to see the best portrayal of this story on film, see Manhunter.",Red Dragon
516,goldsmith71,"Very good, falling short of great",7,4 October 2002,"Red Dragon is well worth going to see and will no doubt out gross (financially) the other three Lecter films.  The superb cast carries the film and thats what makes it exceptional.  I also believe that Ted Tally doing the screenplay brings a different element to the film. As I understand it, Thomas Harris had a good bit of input to the dialogue as well, and I think that is evident too.  I think they could of done a better job making the Hannibal character look younger given today's technology, but none the less Hopkins as Lector is still as spooky and chilling as he ever was. Ralph Fiennes undoubtedly steals the movie and should get oscar consideration for his role.  Other notable performances were logged in by Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel and Mary Louise Parker.  Ed Norton was excellent and we have come to expect no less from such a gifted actor.  I highly recommend this picture and I think it will be well received by movie fans all over the world.  For those who haven't done so see ""Manhunter"" it is as good a Lecter flick as any of the others, and it brings a different aspect to Thomas Harris' writing then any of the other three.",Red Dragon
517,Jean-Luc-3,Uninspired.,1,20 October 2002,"Director Brett Ratner doesn't put any effort into building up the drama, the suspense, or any other emotion in this mundane, direct-by-the-numbers bore. Most of the dialogue is lifted straight from Michael Mann's Manhunter; the acting is uninspired, especially Harvey Keitel's and Philip Hoffman's flat and uninteresting characters; Edward Norton's character remains distant and unlikeable for the entire movie. The script has just enough holes and is inconsistent enough to be compared to cheese, and the beginning that everyone raves ""...has a set-up during the opening credits that will stun you with its ferocious power..."" (John TD Keyes) is so predictable that it will fail to impress anyone other than the average couch potato.Having said that, there are some interesting points to the movie; Ralph Finnes' acting effectively leans towards the creepy, Anthony Hopkins still manages to play very well the psychopathic genius character he first developed ten years ago, and the movie, although uninspired, moved at a fair pace. Altogether, however, this movie can't be recommended, and pails in comparison to Silence of the Lambs, and the original Manhunter.",Red Dragon
518,pep3,"What the heck were they thinking when they but the director of the ""Rush Hour"" films at the helm of ""Red Dragon""?",5,5 October 2002,"I was entertained by ""Red Dragon"", but after thinking about it for awhile, I must say that the movie was average at best.  The performances of all the leads are rather flat.  Keitel is especially lifeless, Hopkins goes way overboard, and Fiennes just didn't get it right.  These are all fine actors so I believe that the director is at fault.  The fascination of Hannibal is that he is elegant and intelligent 99% of the time but is capable of the most appalling violence the other 1%.  In Red Dragon, he just comes across as vulgar most of the time.  Sure his antics get a few laughs from the audience, but this material deserves more respect.  I'm surprised to find myself thinking that ""Manhunter"", despite its ""Miami Vice"" veneer, is the better film.  In ""Hannibal"", Hopkins was still dead-on in his characterization, and the movie as a whole is superior.  In the end, ""Red Dragon"" helps to confirm that ""Silence of the Lambs"" is an absolute masterpiece.  Too bad Deme didn't direct this one. What the heck were they thinking when they but the director of the ""Rush Hour"" films at the helm of ""Red Dragon""?",Red Dragon
519,tvamp1,Better Than The Original,10,1 October 2002,"From the very beginning of this movie it is clear the audience will be taken on one hell of roller coaster ride.  ""The Red Dragon"" is in itself unique. Sure, it is essentially a 'remake' of Michael Mann's 1986 'Manhunter', (our first introduction to Hannibal Lecter - then played by Brian Cox) 'Dragon' is by far a better and different interpretation on Thomas Harris' book. Yes, there are some familiar tag lines and scenes between the two, but that is to be expected since they are taking license from the same place.  This time around however, with Ted Tally at the helm as the screenwriter, there is much more meat to sink our teeth into (pardon the pun).  Anthony Hopkins of course is at the forefront as everyone's favorite cannibal (Lecter also has the prestigious honor of being the most frightening villian in cinematic history - according to numerous magazine and internet polls).  This time around Hannibal is a bit different.  A little more emotional than we've seen him before.  He's angry.  Will Graham, played perfectly by Edward Norton, has put the cannibal behind bars, and Lecter's not happy about his new surroundings.  This time around, we see how.  It is a stunning revelation, and one of the most intense scenes on screen. This has only been alluded to in the book.  'Red Dragon,' boasts one of the best ensemble casts we've seen in quite some time.  They definitely got this one right.  Harvey Keitel (Jack Crawford) Philip Seymour Hoffman (reporter Freddy Lounds) Emily Watson (Reba McClane) and Ralph Fiennes (Francis Dolyerhyde - is the most stunning of them all).  Fiennes is perfect, menacing, and quite unnerving as Dolyerhyde, the Tooth Fairy.  He's the really 'killing' ingredient in this stew.  It is this pyschological  killer that brings Graham back out of retirement with a little coaxing from Crawford.  But it's not your usual mind game.  It is the FBI's and Graham's frustration that brings him once again face to face with Lecter for a profile of the killer.  For anyone who saw 'Manhunter' or read the book 'Red Dragon' know that Lecter had a very small part.  To Tally's credit and imagination, Lecter is once again larger than life, thanks to Hopkins steller performance.  It is hard to imagine a movie as sharp or as good as 'The Silence Of The Lambs,' but, if this doesn't beat it, it comes awfully close.  Admittedly, I really enjoyed 'Hannibal,' though I know it was largely dismissed by some critics. Though $165 Million at the box office is hard to ignore, Hannibal himself is not so quite over the top this time.  There is a wonderful balance between characterization and really good storytelling. It is not merely a new Hannibal vehicle.  Graham, Lecter and Dolyerhyde share the screen with wonderful results. This film however is not for the squeamish.  There are quite a few jolts along the way.  Brett Ratner as director has done an excellent job in capturing the creepy atmosphere of the material and nailed it on the head.  For those detractors that were concerned about his qualifications in regards to directing a 'thriller,' there is no need for concern.  His Hitchcocking approach is a perfect fit and closer to the original book than the first movie.   All in all, 'Red Dragon,' is worth the two hours you will spend.  But more importantly, it's worth the $8.00 to $10.00 for a ticket.  There are very few films I can honestly say that about.Tina Mrazik",Red Dragon

521,dawg2k,The doctor is back. Goody Goody,10,5 October 2002,"First of all I must say Trailer Alert. This movie loses a lot of its good one-liners in the trailer but the one thing the trailer doesn't spoil are the plot twists and the surprise ending. In comparison to the Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, Red Dragon is by far superior. This was a riveting movie that won't make you cringe in disgust or jump in fear but will make you think. Don't overanalyze, but details are critical in this psychological thriller.The acting is absolutely phenomenal. Not Oscar worthy but still impressive. Ralph Fiennes plays the ""Tooth Fairy"" to perfection. He is an insane serial killer who kills entire families. Sir Anthony Hopkins allows us to see what a genius Hannibal Lecter is, which was first shown in Silence of The Lambs but later lost in Hannibal. Edward Norton as always puts out a brilliant performance as the FBI agent who thinks out of the box and who uses his imagination to catch master serial killers. In Red Dragon the audience fears Dr. Lecter more and more despite him being in a secure cell. His diction and tone are perfect and when he speaks you see what a complex character he is. He is insane yet brilliant and watching him work with the detective that caught him makes this manhunt even more exciting.Most people see movies for the laughs or the blood and gore but if you enjoy seeing movies that make you think even after you have left the theater, Red Dragon is a good choice. This year I have only enjoyed 3 movies; Minority Report, The Count of Monte Cristo and Red Dragon. Blockbusters like Mr. Deeds, Star Wars, Spiderman and MIB2 have all been disappointing for me. So if you are tired of special effects and hundred million dollar productions and you just want to see a movie that will truly be worth the ridiculous admission, see Red Dragon.",Red Dragon

523,tomcwark,The Death of Cinema,1,5 October 2002,"At some point all artists and creative types begin to consider their legacy, to consider the body of work they will leave behind. It's a natural progression in one's career. Clearly, no one associated with this movie has reached that point in their career. Otherwise this finger painting of a film would never have been made. Among the few intriguing elements of this prequel to the stunning ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the length to which the screenwriter, direrctor and producers go in attempting to place nothing original before the eyes of the audience. Everything was hung solidly upon ""Silence.."", from the characters and plot to the direction and acting. It is not an easy task to so studiously yank every morsel of originality out of a 2 hour film. Yet here it was done. Watching this thing the audience will be torn in deciding whether the overwelmingly bad acting was a result of fine actors choosing to phone in their work or if it was the horrendous and laughable script they were saddled with. This reviewer is willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the actors. Among the consistently bad acting, only Emily Watson stood out. Her portrayal of the innocent among the monsters who overcomes the terror that can result from blind faith is remarkable. Nevertheless, her effort is tarnished by being on the same piece of film with the rest of the crew who should have known better when they read this script. One can appreciate the temptation that comes with being offered the chance to star in a new ""Hannibal"" film. The franchise has guarnanteed a wide audience and outstanding exposure for those who would appear on the same screen as the Monster. Still, this doesn't explain how Edward Norton, Ralph Finnes, Harvey Keitel and Mary-Louise Paker justified their decision to take the job. Norton's cache of talent is deep and wide. Primal Fear, American History X and Rounders are testament to his place among our finest acting talent.  Yet here, as the gifted and driven dedective, Norton is so flat, so one dimensional that one is tempted to write him off. Again, the ridicoulous script saves him. Keitel simply look dead. Was he reading from a telepromter as he stared glassy-faced delivering his lines? Finnes underplayed his role as the Hannibal protege. As for his character and the plot through which it stumbled, there was never any question as to its fate. Even the attempt at redeaming this gross characature of Hannibal was bungled. Never was the possibility of his resuce at the hands of the blind and bawdy Watson even close to believable. Then there is Anthony Hopkins, reprising his role as Hannibal the Cannibal: a plastic attempt at reproducing the stately connnoisseur we meet in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and who is far more interesting and believable in ""Hannibal."" What a shame. We can only assume Hopkins was more concerned with giving the producers and director what they wanted than sinking his teeth into the opportunity and giving even greater depth to one of Hollywood's greatest monsters. Upon exiting the theatre one could only assume they had witnessed the death of cinema. Yes, it will rise again. It will bring us pleasure again, allow us to lose ourselves in the darkness, teach us lessons, and bring us closer to what it means to be human. But in the case of ""Red Dragon"" we are shown that an entire art form can be so currupted and destoyed as to be no more than a monument to the death of the art form.",Red Dragon
524,filmversteher,Thrilling and adequate adaptation of a great novel.,7,1 October 2002,"I've just attended an early press screening of 'Red Dragon' (in Germany - wow, they're getting faster over here!) and I must say I'm quite satisfied.Since I'm a true admirer of both the original novel by Thomas Harris and Michael Mann's scarcely noticed 'Manhunter' (1986) I was really looking forward to finally watch this movie. Reluctantly, I had to lower my expectations after I'd learned that none other than Brett 'Rush Hour' Ratner would be the director of 'Red Dragon'.But this one is by far his best work yet - which is amazing considering that it's indeed Ratner's first trip to the suspense thriller genre. Of course, he got help from some of the most important crew members of 'Silence Of The Lambs': Screenwriter Ted Tally does another adequate adaptation of the great novel by Thomas Harris (which, by the way, is hardly transferable into a film without losing some of those intense psychological twists of the book). Production Designer Kristi Zea comes back with her astonishing prison sets which are frighteningly close to those of the former film.But most importantly, cinematographer Dante Spinotti returns from 'Manhunter' for another splendid visual adaptation of the book and makes you forget his already superior work back in the 80's!Additionally, Ratner assembled one helluva cast containing some of Hollywood's most distinguished actors around: Sir Anthony Hopkins (who else??) again impersonating Mr Lecter, Ed Norton playing FBI agent Graham and Ralph Fiennes as the serial killer hunted by police. Besides, there are exceptional cast of supporting actors like Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson and the great Philip Seymour Hoffman - only to name a few! And because Tally's screenplay isn't focused on Hannibal Lecter only, each of them have their moments.Certainly, if you've read the book or seen 'Manhunter' you probably won't be scared too often - but those 'Red Dragon'-virgins out there: Be prepared for an entertaining and thrilling ride through the evil mind of Hannibal The Cannibal!07/10",Red Dragon

It completely lacks, what good serial-killer thriller are made of: bad weather, good characters and, finally, a good story. Instead, ""Red Dragon"" is a lame copy of ""Psycho"" and relies on some sort of ""Silence of the Lambs""-nostalgia, which is nice though, but still is not enough to make a good movie.Hannibal Lector's advises make no sense, the movie raises a lot of questions but answers none of them, and it completely lacks the psychological depth one might have expected.

But this movie left me with nothing...The story was ok the acting was pretty good and thats it.  There really wasnt anything special.  In Silence of the Lambs we really went into the mind of Lecter. In Hannibal we were treated to a gross-out killing spree.  But in Red Dragon we are only treated to another generic Cop-Drama.  Dont get me wrong it was better than most but Hopkins didnt have the same charm he did in the others and Norton (whom is one of my favorite actors) was kind of bland.  But I am not sure if this was all their fault.  I think the most detrimental parts of this film lie with Brett Ratner's directing and Danny Elfman's score.
Ratner is a very typical director.  I cant imagine him doing anything that requires too imagination.  Im really worried what he is going to do with superman.  Dont get me wrong I liked both Rush Hours, The Family Man, and Money Talks.  Those were good mindless comedies.  Red Dragon needed something so much more than that.  With a little bit of originality it could have been a much bigger treat.Now Elfman's score had the same problem...GENERIC.  I mean the studio should have just saved a bunch of money and used prerecorded music from other thrillers for its scenes.  Again nothing special.  I also dont like much of Elfman's other works.***POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING***
What made me the most annoyed was the HUGE GAPING PLOT HOLE AND UTTER NONSENSE near the end.  Was Fiennes character supposed to trick his blind friend or something.  It seemed that the last scene was added last minute and for cheap thrills.  In my opinion it would have been cool if he killed Grahm and his whole family.

Perhaps the narrative's more dynamic, but the screenplay is 4 times less technical than the original. Personally I love Manhunter and I don't think we'll see something like it in years.",Red Dragon

The music by red7, the delayed lines that not only added depth to the character but also made the viewer feel the mental battle Will was going through. This version is utterly awful. The power of the touch of a tiger to someone blind was annhilated as the music was almost disney like. The most powerful scenes that Manhunter depicted were failed with this version. It was void of atmosphere and suspense. Totally disgusted that this was actually produced. It feels that this film was made without ever seeing the original and only reading the script. Awful.",Red Dragon
533,frank322,Truly better than Silence,10,29 September 2002,"'Red Dragon' is an adaptation of the first novel in writer Thomas Harris' trilogy of stories that involved Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a character made infamous by Anthony Hopkins' excellent portrayal in the classic 'Silence of the Lambs' (the second novel.)The novel was originally brought to the screen by Michael Mann's 'Manhunter'. However, having also seen 'Manhunter', I must say that this version of 'Red Dragon' (which is the original title of Harris' novel) is by far a much better movie in every possible way.This film centers around Will Graham (Edward Norton) who was the one who put Dr.Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) behind bars -- or rather, glass -- in the first place. Lecter is not as prominently focused upon in this story as he was in 'Silence' and 'Hannibal', although he is certainly a significant part of the many well-written twists and turns as it progresses.The movie opens with a flashback to Graham's arrest of Lecter, specifically dating the event as taking place in 1980. This was not the intro to the novel, so it was likely added to give Lecter more screentime, but it's an effective intro to the story and does not hurt the story in any way.With a combination of some weight loss and hair styling, Hopkins even manages to believably look the part of the younger pre-'Silence' Dr.Lecter.His performance is much more chilling than it was in 'Hannibal', partly because his character's role in this story is very different. Also, Lecter's relationship to Graham is obviously very different from his relationship to Clarice Starling, so he is unique enough in his scenes in this movie to not seem like an immitation of his last two silver screen appearances.Edward Norton's acting is great as usual, but Ralph Fiennes is the one whose performance really shines here in his portrayal of the 'Red Dragon' Francis Dolarhyde. Harvey Keitel also does a good job in the part of Jack Crawford (previously played by Scott Glen in 'Silence') although he basically seems like 'typical Harvey Keitel'.Fans of the Oscar-winning classic 'Silence of the Lambs' will also not be disappointed in this adaptation -- it is far darker and more suspenseful than 'Hannibal' was, and much better than the original adaptation, 'Manhunter'.It is overall the most well-written story in the entire trilogy and very deserving of this excellent remake. It truly is what many people had hoped 'Hannibal' would be: better than 'Silence'.I strongly recommend it -- 10/10",Red Dragon
534,Alypeace,If you liked Silence Of The Lambs you'll LOVE Red Dragon!,10,7 October 2002,"From the excitement of the first scene to the thrilling ending this movie lacked NOTHING!  It wasn't campy like ""Hannibal,"" it was more along the lines of Silence of the Lambs.  The acting was superb on all accounts. The characters were believable as well as enjoyable.  I even found myself having a soft-spot for the ""villian"" characters in the movie.
The movie was well written, acted and carried out.  Anthony Hopkins was splendiferous and Ed Norton's performance was as good as his role in ""American History X.""I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so that I can own it for myself!

Hindered by poor direction and the occasionaly quirky dialogue, the film lacks the edgieness which made the first Hannibal Lecter film so great.  Despite the great cast, only Hopkins and Fiennes shine.  Norton's performance is sub-par, Watson's portaryel of a blind woman unconvincing, and Keitell's role relatively inisgnificant. ""Red Dragon"" is formulaic, unoriginal, predictable, and more low-brow than the series other films (yes, even ""Hannibal"").  It comes recommended only to those who enjoy this type of psycholical/forensic thriller and really only for Hopkin's clever lines and Fienne's excellent portayal of a profoundly disturbed characted.",Red Dragon

Edward Norton was able to connect with Hannibal as well compete with him in this movie. I mean it was his character that was able to capture Lecter. Also the villain in the movie had way more depth and was more dangerous and psychotic then Buffalo Bill. The only thing that was lacking was the suspense that Lambs had. Overall Will Graham was way better then Agent Sterling. He was a better thinker, a more fierce investigator, and he was able to compete with Lecter rather then get intimidated by him. Norton did a excellent Job portraying Will Graham. Also Ralph Fiennes did a great job portraying a man obsessed with a non human symbol. He was shown as being mentally tortured by it.

Missing that quality, ""Hannibal,"" the Lambs sequel just didn't have the depth which Lambs and now ""Red Dragon"" share. Score a quid pro quo victory for Dragon, as it lives up to the standard Lambs set.This movie will really scare the crap out of you. Especially if you don't know the story which follows closely, but with some terrific plot twists, to the 1986 ""Manhunter"" also adapted from Thomas Harris' book.Maybe the best difference between Dragon and Manhunter is that in Dragon we get to see much more of Dr. Lecter's history and how he came to be known as ""Hannibal the Cannibal."" Also, as in Lambs, we see another well developed relationship between and F.B.I. agent Will Graham (Ed Norton) and Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins). The two are perhaps even better counterparts than the Hannibal/Agent Starling (Jodi Foster) pair from Lambs because Grahm and Hannibal have much more of a history.At any rate...This is an scary, exciting and even funny thriller. And I'd give gorey details but, as Dr. Lecter says to a group of dinner guests dining on the 'catch of the day' about their meal...""You wouldn't believe me if I told you.""",Red Dragon
538,cradled_silence,"Better than Hannibal, up to par with the illustrious Silence of the Lambs; untouchable film.",10,4 October 2002,"**SPOILERS** This film, given its few flaws, was worth every second of my first viewing. The killer, more twisted and delusional than the one in silence, and also a bit more derranged than hannibal himself, was more of a killer, than 'buffalo bill.' But I wont compare two such movies, since the basis for the comparison of this film will be largely accredited to what one thinks of silence of the lambs, i will rate this film for what it was; a twisted, delusional, work of art. I must admit, bret ratner has shown us his diversity in directing, after directing two flops (rush hour series) and onto a seriously anticipated and widely respected series. He did so flawlessly, although some elements could have been further implemented, such as the  hatred for himself [Dolarhyde] because of his horrible up bringing, killing families for happiness he had never received, which i think to be a striking MO. Ed Norton, once again, proves to be a very good actor, complimented in every way by Sir Anthony Hopkins, at times during this movie, I could hardly catch my breath. Despite not going completely in depth, as the book did, this movie is the years best so far, and one of the best films i've seen in years. In short; 'they dont come much better than this.' if you've ANY time to spare this fall, see this movie. If you've got a weekend off, see this movie twice.

I never considered Michael Mann's adaption of the novel, 1986's ""Manhunter"" as a part of the series.  With respect to Mann, is adaption was lacking in all the wrong ways and suffered greatly by the superior ""Silence of the Lambs"" oscar winning adaption. This a true adaption of Thomas Harris excellent novel, ""Red Dragon"", and a great completion to the trilogy.  I liked how screenwriter Ted Tally expanded on and created new scenes for Hannibal Lecter's character, since his part in the novel is smaller.  The movie captures a great deal of what made the book so good. If there ever is a fourth Hannibal project launched I hope it will be well done and not lousy movie that destroys the effects of a nice rounded trilogy.

RD in fact was very true to Silence, as fitting a prequel as any that has been made. Anthony Hopkins, despite his age, is the only actor who would have worked in his unforgettable and clasic role. The movie's only mar was the casting of Jack Crawford, who looks nothing like his doppelganger in Silence. A must see if there ever was one.",Red Dragon
545,bigmalewuss,Red Dragon: the other side of perfection,9,4 October 2002,"Well where to begin, with the amazing success of `Hannibal' the producers began to look for a new way to tap the Hannibal money train. I recall talk of a Hannibal sequel but instead they decided to go back and start where Hopkins had been absent. Red Dragon is my favorite Harris book and is truly an amazing read.Now I am a fan of Manhunter so I was not to sure that it needed to be remade. However now having seen it I am very glad that they did. Truly for one reason: The Red Dragon. Ralph Fiennes is nothing short of astounding in his portrayal of Francis Dolarhyde. Bringing across everything that he was in the book and now I envision him when I read the pages of the story. I was also happy that for the most part the film follows the book's plot very accurately.Reading those pages I see Fiennes as Dolarhyde, Hopkins as Hannibal (who doesn't?), but not Norton as Graham. I hate to say it because I think Norton is one of the finest young actors today but this is just not his role. Now even though Fiennes has become my Dolarhyde so to speak, looking back I still see William L. Petersen (going back to Manhunter) as Graham. Truly Red Dragon is the story of Dolarhyde, as Manhunter is the story of Graham. This new film gives us great insight into the mind of our killer and shows what he goes through but Graham is very much watered down from what he was in Manhunter. Oddly enough in Manhunter it was Dolarhyde who came across as tame. As for the other parts in Manhunter and Red Dragon each have a fair share of talent but neither really out shines one or the other.So I wish that there was a middle ground between the two films, in my opinion if u could mix and match the strengths of both films you could truly come out with the perfect thriller. But either way this film is a definite must for fans of the book, the original film, or any one who would equate themselves with the Hannibal series. 8 or 9 out of 10",Red Dragon
546,wareman,"Good, but too much of a Manhunter rip off",7,8 October 2002,"The only reason I would rate ManHunter second to Silence of the Lambs is because of Anthony Hopkins' outstanding performance as Hannibal Lecter. ManHunter (1986) preceded Silence of the Lambs (1991) by 5 years. I just saw ""Red Dragon"" which was a total rip off of ManHunter. If I had never seen ManHunter then I would rate Red Dragon higher than I do. I like Edward Norton as an actor, but preferred William Peterson's role as FBI Agent Will Graham. Brian Cox's role as Hannibal Lecter was adequate, but did not have the depth of persona that Hopkins' did (particularly in ""Silence""). Hopkins does a good job of recreating Hannibal in Red Dragon. Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Francis Dolarhyde is very good, but elicits absolutely no sympathy as did Tom Noonan's fine portrayal of Dolarhyde in Manhunter. Again, if there would have been more originality in Red Dragon, I would have liked in more. It seems that Red Dragon tries to draw its appeal from a cast of high profile actors and actresses. Manhunter was just plain good film making that cast the characters well. Hats off to Michael Mann's directing. I do recommend Red Dragon. It is worth seeing. I highly recommend ManHunter, however.",Red Dragon

My main complaint with this movie is that I wish they had made it as good as the book.  When I read that book, I was terrified.  I actually had trouble sleeping at night.  The movie did not give me that effect at all.  It's entertaining, it does have some of the twists and turns but it misses the unknown magical factor that makes a movie go right over the top into near perfect.  Jonathan Demme reached that height with Silence and it has not been reached since (or before) with all the rehashing of the FBI profilers and the infamous Dr.Definitely not a waste of money, but don't go in with any comparisons of Silence in your head, or you'll end up frustrated.",Red Dragon
549,tialice2,Is it that bad ?,3,5 December 2002,"Yes it is. How is it possible with this cast and after Ridley Scott's Hannibal that proved this franchise had a lot to give in quality and quantity ? Brett Ratner´s direction is laughable and immature. He´s always trying to make sure you see it all, even when you've figured out ages ago. The exaggerated close-ups for us to understand when they´re being untrue, the eye-blinkings between the characters, oh , and since Rambo 3 that we don´t see that "" Yes, you want to be away from the danger, but I need you because you´re my best ( the only one that thinks ? ) man "" scene so basic and empty. Really, Ratner´s job is as subtil as a dinossaur jumping. I appreciate when they let me do some thinking and stop telling us what we should realize for ourselves. This isn´t a popcorn action-comedy like Brett's other films. Really a bad choice for directing, one of the worst lately. The cast. Ralph Fiennes, being the wonderful actor he already proved he is, deserved a lot more freedom and time to make his character a lot deeper and confused. Not this "" Psycho "" poor remake. Ed Norton does his job nicely, but why is there room for another agent, especially when its role will be played by the great Harvey Keitel ? Logically, there wouldn´t be enough room for both of them so in the end what we have is Norton ruling ( he has the main role )and Keitel being sacrificed. What a waste of talent. Even so, in two or three scenes when the two agents are together, Keitel really shows what he's made of and easily puts Norton in the shadow. But, that's it.Too many for such little. Hopkins... well, he is Lecter allright, but there´s nothing new here. A naturally good perfomance, but already seeming robotic and far, far away from the energy and evilness of the other movies, especially the first one. Hope he had it with this third incarnation, because that´s enough, even for fans, both of the actor and of his Lecter role. The music is really nice, very good at times, like in the intro credits and at some scary moments during the film. That´s the kind of job we expect from Danny Elfman. It could be a lot more used throughout the movie, being really turned off during a long part of the film. Another example of wasting genius. In the end, for the ones who liked the psicological fear and introspective thriller of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" this should be avoided, because there is no intelligence and no finesse in ""Red Dragon"". It´s all obvious and simplistic, Hopkins isn´t the same and Clarice doesn´t live here yet. For the ones who preferred ""Hannibal"", it´s even worst, because there´s no real fear in this movie, and never that sense of visual horror, disturbing imagery of Ridley Scott's film. Resuming, was this worth it ? No. For me, Lecter's adventures will always be resumed to the first two films. Two masterpieces, each one in its different kind of approach to the evil and horror. To avoid at all costs. Really bad, especially if you use your mind. 3/10.",Red Dragon

It's almost mesmerising seeing a film so comprehensively inferior to its original, it feels like Michael Mann had someone on the inside to deliberately sabotage proceedings - the nearest comparison I can think of was Van Sant's remake of Psycho, but even that had the merit of adding one interesting subliminal image to leaven its awesome crappiness.Some incomprehensible omissions for a film which is ostensibly more faithful to the novel than Manhunter, too - for some reason they don't show Graham placing his hand on Lounds in the Tattler photo (that's the entire point), and they completely eliminate all the tensions in Graham's family (again, that's kind of the point). Lecter is so up his own fundament in this film it's unbelievable: in the novels he's clearly fallible for all his brilliance and makes calculated errors at least some of the time, but in this one he's like some kind of pantomime wizard.Even the music is off - Danny Elfman, for goodness' sake?

Different maybe, better paid definitely, but not better. Overall, the newer, film, while visually and technically stunning is flawed and often clumsy and seems to be just a remake for the money, rather than for the art. For example, MANHUNTER'S very original sleeping tiger and blind victim scene was much better executed and much more powerful. While RED DRAGON'S version came across as an obligatory walk-through.

559,tinmra,This first serving of Hannibal may prove to be the best,9,2 October 2002,"The movie going public is obviously well acquainted with the most famous serial killer, cannibal, in cinematic history, Hannibal Lecter.  In 2002's 'RED DRAGON,' Hannibal is back with force and vengeance, thanks to the brilliant portrayal of Sir Anthony Hopkins and inspired writing of screenwriter Ted Tally.  He's got some of the best lines in the business. 'RED DRAGON,' for the most part is a remake of Michael Mann's 1986 'Manhunter.'  Obviously there isn't a lot of variation between the two since they are both adaptations of Thomas Harris' book 'RED DRAGON.'  But that is were the simularity ends.  Sure, some scenes are structed the same, but to be fair this latest installment is closer and more true to the novel.  For those that read the book or saw 'Manhunter,' it's no surprise that Hannibal had a rather small role.  Ted Tally took some license and beefed up the character for some crucial scenes, adding a very interesting and inventive twist.  From the onset, we see the capture of Hannibal by FBI Agent Will Graham, played flawlessly this time around by Edward Norton.  We are also privy to a rather more intense Lecter, anger and resentment for being caught and put away.  Hopkins doesn't need to do much to convey his distaste for Graham, the true talent of an excellent actor.  Lecter is not over the top as many say he was in the third film 'HANNIBAL.'  But this is really not a Lecter story.  It is focused more on Graham and the new killer on the block, Francis Dolarhyde (played to an eeriely perfection by Ralph Fiennes).  One not of advisement, if 'The Silence Of The Lambs', or 'Hannibal,' gave you nightmares, you may not be prepared for 'Dragon.'  It is absolutely brutal in it's visuals and psychological mind games.  Dolarhyde, aka the 'Tooth Fairy' is a brutal serial killer who has killed two families and may be on the hunt for a third.  It is this that brings Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) on the quest to seek out a retired Graham.  Reluctantly, Graham decides to help with the investigation.  Graham does possess a certain gift, he can think like the killer.  But it does cause a dilemma.  The one person that could really give our detective the insight he needs is the one man who tried to kill him, Lector.  As Clarice in 'Silence' Graham must once again delve into Lecter's world of the asylum.  Frederick Chilton is back as the head of the asylum, again played by Anthony Heald (the 'old friend for dinner' guy).  Heald is an absolute delight in a awkward sort of way.  He's definetly a one off.  Basically, he's not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.  Possibly the most disturbing character of the film is played by Fiennes.  He is essentially a sympathetic killer, and yet you really want to see this guy go down.  Fiennes is stunning in this role and adds his own spark to the role.  Emily Watson plays Fiennes uninformed love interest who happens to be blind, lucky for her.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is the sleazy tabloid reporter who in time is destined to get his comupance.  It is really unfortunate that the Academy Awards does not hand out status to ensemble casts.  If they did, 'RED DRAGON,' would probably be the only nomination in the catagory.  There hasn't been a cast like this in many years.  There is an equal balance between the three main characters, Lecter, Graham, and Dolarhyde.  Lecter was in it just enough to keep it constantly fresh and on edge.  Dolarhyde takes it over the edge and Graham brings it subtly back.  Brett Ratner as the director did an excellent job in setting the scenes, the creepy atmosphere, and letting the actors do what they do best.  This film is a winner all the way around.  If any thriller were put up against 'Silence,' this may be the one that could surpass it in regards to thrills, chills and just plain excellent storytelling.  Though the 4 movies are destined to be lumped together, 'Manhunter,' 'The Silence Of The Lambs,' 'Hannibal,' and now 'The Red Dragon,' which is completely understandable, 'Dragon' stands on it's own.  And does so extremely well. This movie is obviously not for everyone.  There is graphic violence that is disturbing.  Yet in this vehicle it is not overplayed as say, your average slasher movie.  If you're going to plunk down your hard earned cash for a movie, 'Red Dragon,' is the one.  It is a good solid interesting movie that never lets go.  Once it's got you, it's got you.  And that ride starts as the lights in the theater go down.  There's not too many movies that can boast that.T. Mrazik",Red Dragon

562,vocation_spiky,a movie to remember,9,21 April 2006,I think that this movie is really awesome.Ralph Fiennes was so cute although so devilish!!!!I think it's hard for an actor who almost all the time performs romance movies to perform such a role. Edward Norton was also good and he was so rational;he had good brains!!I also liked the character of that blind woman.The relationship between her and Ralph really touched me.I felt sorry for him.That conflict between his love to the blind woman and his desire to kill her and to kill people is wonderfully drawn.I also loved the scene when the blind woman tries to put her hands on Ralph's face.I could actually feel the tremble of his body when she did so.All these things add to the movie and make it much better than previous movies.,Red Dragon

The film has the same darkness that can be found in Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. Hopkins, not surprisingly, pulls of the role of Dr. Hannibal Lecter amazingly. Ralph Fiennes does very well with Dolarhyde, he portrayed the character exactly as I had imagined him while I read the book. Finally, I was also very happy with how Edward Norton portrayed Will Graham, who I have seen recently in the Illusionist. He had some amazing scenes in the movie, I also believe he interacted well with Hopkin's Hannibal Lastly, I would definitely recommend this movie to any fans of the book or those just interested in staying home one night to watch an exciting thriller. 9/10",Red Dragon

Brett Ratner was asleep at the wheel. As a director he'd make a good dishwasher. Edward Norton was woefully miscast. He was little more than a perky Cub scout -- no sense at all that this was a world weary investigator who had been nearly murdered by a psychopath a few years prior. Anthony Hopkins was beyond campy. He certainly wasn't scary. When detectives conversed about about the serial killer, the mood was about as frightening intense as a bubble gum blowing contest. I've seen high school plays with stronger acting. Seemed like a cash run for all involved. I turned it off about 2/3rds of the way through.My advice: Read the book.

What i got was far greater an experience than i could have imagined.  This film is definitely one of the most entertaining, well directed and well acted movies of this year, by far.  Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins and Ralph Fiennes are great in this movie, and you believe them in their respective roles every second they are on screen. The excitement and classy, gruesome, gut-spilling, will keep you on the tip of you seat the whole 2 hour running time.

It is a bit bloody, and has some sexual content, but I love it nevertheless. It starts out with a great mystery that immediately gets you into the story. Through-out the movie it never gets boring..... The blind girl that is in love with the murderer gives it a strange twist. The co-star with Anthony Hopkins is talented, and makes the movie even better. The ending is surprising, I'm sure, to most, even though I predicted it :). Altogether, it's a great movie if you want adventure and mystery. It's a great movie to watch if you want to see good acting, and a good play-write. I would also recommend that it is watched before Silence of the Lambs, even though it was made after it.TM",Red Dragon
569,greenandgold,What were the producers thinking?,6,22 October 2002,What on earth were the producers of this film thinking when they decided to let a virtual novice helm the remake of one of the greatest thrillers there is? It is as simple as this: Rush Hour 1 & 2 are crap. How could studio heads possibly have expected the director of these Hollywood trash films to even come close to making as good a film as Mann's original (which it must be compared to)?

Don't miss the opening credits. The acting is superb as Fienes, Norton and Parker are as good or better than Hopkins. The acting carries this one.",Red Dragon
575,andrewosnardmi6,An Unneeded Remake,5,5 October 2002,"While ""Red Dragon"" was a moderately entertaining popcorn film, it in no way overtook the first (and best, in my mind) Hannibal Lector movie, Michael Mann's 1986 ""Manhunter,"" also based on the novel ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris.  Since Brett Ratner has so savagely criticized the original film, a comparison is certainly in order.Most of what Ratner gets right can be found in Manhunter, as about 65% of the dialogue is identical.  Ratner questioned the faithfulness of Mann's work to the novel, and he does add two scenes that Mann omitted: a trip by the killer Dollarhyde to the Brooklyn Museum, and the film's ending (more on that later).  The former does add some artistic value to the picture; however given how Mann structured his script I don't know how he could have fit it in.  Ratner also included the Red Dragon tattoo on the body of the killer; Mann shot those scenes with the tattoo and without, but concluded that it was cheesy.  I think the tattoo should have been left in, but its omission certainly doesn't hurt ""Manhunter"" too much.Then we get to the bad, which is considerable.  Simply put, the lead, Edward Norton, is terrible.  He sounds like he's reading off cue cards, he has zero chemistry with Hopkins, and he doesn't convince the viewer of either his singular gift for entering the minds of killers, or how this gift tortures him.  William Peterson, the original Will Graham, did a wonderful job with the character, and made him much more three dimensional (although Mann's script certainly does a better job of fleshing out Graham than Ted Tally's).Ralph Fiennes, although good as killer Francis Dolarhyde, is physically inappropriate for the role.  Although the extra muscle he put on helps, his good looks completely nullify the character's outsider status.  Mann cut out Dolarhyde's back story, the history of abuse by his grandmother, but all Ratner does is shoe it in with some voice overs and a little speech by Graham.  Although Mann doesn't delve into Dolarhyde's orgins, the brilliant preformance of giant Tom Noonan fully captures the essence of a man so utterly convinced of his worthlessness that he must slaughter entire familes to become whole again.  Noonan is able to convey the power of the Dragon and the weakness of Dolarhyde in a much more convincing way than Fiennes.Although many reviewers, even those who pan the movie, praise Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of tabloid reporter Freddie Lounds, I found him bland.  It seemed like he felt mumbling his lines would add depth to the character.  He was decent when he was captured by Dolarhyde, but he came nowhere near to matching Stephen Lang, who oozed sleeze out of every pore, while maintaining a trace of humanity in his ordeal.Both Harvey Keitel and Emily Watson turn in fine jobs as Agent Crawford and Reba McClane, but so did Dennis Farina and Joan Allen 16 years ago.That brings us to the man himself, Hannibal Lector, played by Anthony Hopkins.  Although his Lector is now one of the screen's most infamous characters, it seems to me like his performance seems more and more like a James Bond villian with every film.  He wildly overplays many scenes, and the audience in my theatre seemed more amused than scared of him.  Brian Cox, who played Lecktor (that's how Mann spelled it) in ""Manhunter,"" gave a nuanced and intelligent portrayal that was quietly menacing.The fact that an A-list cast failed to deliver must fall at the feet of director Ratner, who has shot his mouth off about Manhunter.  His direction is basic and plain, and he fails to infuse in his film the visual flair, professionalism and tension of Mann's work.  Instead, he opts for cheap scare tactics and telegraphing every plot devlopment so that he guarantees the audience picks up on it.  He should go back to directing Rush Hour movies (which, with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, direct themselves), and stay the hell away from Superman.The ending to Red Dragon was more faithful to the book, although not completely, and while the book suggested a careful, thought-out plan on the part of Dolarhyde, in the film it seems rushed together.  It also comes across as the ending to a slasher film, which is probably while Mann altered it to a more conventional (albeit visually and musically innovative) climax featuring the Iron Butterfly song ""In A Gadda Da Vida.""When doing a remake, there should generally be some compelling reason. The one for this one seems clear: to cash in on the star power of Hopkins as Lecter.  But as an attempt to supercede ""Manhunter,"" ""Red Dragon"" fails on nearly every level.",Red Dragon

580,mrversace,Dino De Laurentiis looking only to make some extra $$$ and nothing more.,4,28 October 2002,"Red Dragon is nothing more than a routine thriller with all the expected unoriginal twists and scares you would expect from this kind of picture. Edward Norton was not convincing as a highly intelligent FBI agent (unlike William Peterson's performance in Manhunter, which had so much more depth & believability. He's so good at these roles, he's now permanently type cast; hence his role in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Not an FBI agent, but a highly intelligent, intuative forensic scientist). Edward Norton's portrayal of Will Graham is rather embarrasing.  He's nothing but a scared agent who's psychologicaly scarred due to Lector almost killing him.  Very much a pansy. William Peterson's portrayal in Manhunter is a lot more complicated. He's a character that gets so involved in his work, he starts to think and act like the people he's hunting.  It begins to affect his mental stability, and THAT is a much more convincing reason to leave the FBI.Harvey Keitel simply makes a special guest appearance.  Ralph Fiennes tries so hard to make us feel for him (unsuccessfully).  Mary Louise Parker is simply annoying.  Dante Spinotti's usual glorious colorful cinematography is non existant.  Danny Elfman's music has non of his touches and Brett Ratner's direction is devoid of any moments of tension or suspense, which isn't surprising for a director who films include Rush Hour 1, 2, & 3!! What was Dino thinking??",Red Dragon
581,shlonneger,Comparable to Silence of the Lambs,8,10 October 2002,"Finally there's something to compare to Silence of the Lambs.  Red Dragon is an excellent film that provides the viewer with an overall sense of satisfaction with the series.  The movie Hannibal was a disgrace to the character of Hannibal Lecter.  It portrayed him as being a savage beast driven by his lust for murder and cannibalism.  However, his character is actually much smarter and well-refined than that.  Red Dragon stayed truer to the Hannibal character as was presented in the Silence of the Lambs. Ralph Fiennes did an excellent job as the Tooth Fairy killer.  I like the way that this movie presented us with the killer's identity very early on but it still left the overall character mysterious.  Excellent excellent makeup job on the full body tattoo of the dragon.  It makes me want to get a tattoo.  Edward Norton, as always, did an excellent job portraying a former FBI Agent haunted by his past yet forced to face it in the present. Finally, Emily Watson's portrayal of a blind woman falling in love with a serial killer was top notch.  The use of blindness to create suspense has not been used for a while in movies.  I think it's a great idea that will put any viewer on the edge of his or her seat.  Overall, this was a great film that just shows us the talent of director Brett Ratner.  His past films, which include Rush Hour, Rush Hour 2, and The Family Man, are extraordinarily hilarious but this goes to show that he has the talent to go beyond the realm of comedies and hook viewers through suspense/thriller movies.  I hope to see more from him.  I loved this movie but it still doesn't top The Silence of the Lambs.",Red Dragon

583,grabanales,Best as Silence of the Lambs,8,28 October 2002,"This movie is a good prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, including best characters (specially Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson). The only problem is the absence of more details about the origin of the Tooth Fairy. I've read the book (my favorite of the trilogy) and I'm satisfied of the adaptation, except for this detail.

When I found out that there was a version of 'Red Dragon' being made, and another one, called 'Man Hunter'. When I watched it, it was alright, but parts were so poorly done that it was just pathetic.Just today, I saw a sneak preview of the new 'Red Dragon' at the local movie theater. I was absolutely stunned by it. The acting and direction were on par with Silence. It is nearly as suspenseful, and while obviously aging, Anthony Hopkins shows no mercy yet again as the vicious sociopath Hannibal Lector.Not only was the film fairly true to the book (or at least how I remember the book, it has been several years since I last read it), but it even went a step further, delving a little more into Hannibal's capture prior to the events of the first movie even.My only complaint is the fact that it is supposed to take place in the 1980's or so, but it is not obvious watching the movie. Overall, it ranks high up there, dwarfing the disgusting mess that was 'Hannibal' and while not as good as 'Silence' it definitely gives a great show",Red Dragon

There was no reason for this film other than to get Hopkins showing as Hannibal - and his role was minor. Watching Ed Norton mimic William Petersen's lines verbatim was painful. Someone of Norton's caliber should have played the character differently but all he could muster was an imitation. At the very least a new dialogue would have freshened it up. Ralph Fiennes is a poor replacement for Tom Noonan's terrifying killer - he is not at all believable. Hollywood has run out of good writers apparently and all they can do is remake quality films into trash.And Brett Ratner - what can I say?

Academy award winning performances in my opinion. Although Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton give exquisite performances, I especially enjoyed Ralph Finnes as Francis Dolarhyde. Finnes had a very challenging role to present and he pulled it off amazingly well. He makes you fear his character through the majority of the movie, but during some parts you want to love his character because of sympathy you have for him. Over all, Red Dragon is an excellent movie that everyone should see.

I was shocked when I came out of the movie COMPLETELY satisfied. I LOVED it. It followed the book so closely, and was done so artistically I almost couldn't believe I had seen a ""Hannibal"" movie. This went all for story and NOT for gore, the opposite of what was done with ""Hannibal"", the movie based on Thomas Harris' book of the same name. It kept all of the characters the way they should have been, and amazingly did not over use the character Hannibal, which was my biggest fear of how the movie was going to be. Instead, I was able to sit and recite the lines along with the movie the first time I saw it because it was STRAIGHT from the book. Like I've said before and I will say again, stick to what Thomas Harris writes and you'll get a good movie, don't and you get junk!! (Like Hannibal).

It was a bit more serious than Hannibal and more along the lines of Silence of the Lambs.  If you enjoyed Silence.... then you will enjoy Red Dragon.

Norton and Hopkins have a different relationship, than the previous F.B.I investigators, I felt Hopkin's role was somewhat in the backdrop, but was played masterfully, and was very pleased at how thought out this movie was produced.I would definitely recommend this movie, to both Silence of the Lambs fans and those who have never watched either linking movies (is that really even possible?) the movie will make you think about why some of the things are the way they are in the other 2 lechter movies, but is universal enough for everyone to enjoy.",Red Dragon

Edward Norton's portrayal of Will Grahm is superb, he brought elements of the character from both the book and Manhunter, the original movie. My favorite part of film, however, was the opening. This seen has a high level of dramatic impact, and if you have not seen the movie, it is worth seeing just for this. Ralph Fiennes may be too attractive for Dolarhyde, but he puts on a stunning performance as well. His part definitely tops that of Ted Levine's as Jame Gumb.  Comparing this movie to Manhunter is quite an experience. It is much more developed, yet the director, Brett Ratner, obviously looked to this movie for reference. This is most noticeable in the beach house scenes. Overall, this was the best movie I have seen in theaters in a long time. Well worth the money and the time.

There are many psycologically scary moments, and even some unintended laughs along the way. You know what I'm talking about. :DThe one and only thing that really irked me about the film was how it was marketed as a ""Hannibal Lector"" movie. It didn't feel at all as if we were watching a movie about him. He was just a side character (in my opinion) and Anthony Hopkins is even given the first name in the credits. How unjust. ;)I'd give the film 5/5 if it weren't for the periodic lulls here and there. And I'm really not going to decrease my rating because it's from the director of Rush Hour. If anything, I should increase it, because Ratner has done an incredible job, and it's a big step up.

I was ready for action and suspense that would sell out the dramatic effect of Hannibal (2001). The movie delivered an interesting pace of tense emotions, and climaxed very well with plenty of graphics to show. The directing failed to achieve anything above average, though it maintained the feeling of the movie. I wanted more from an experienced Brett Ratner that could rival Hannibal. Though his resources were seemingly endless and the publicity self-serving, Ratner never went out on a limb. I was astounded at how Harvey Keitel and Mrs. Graham never developed into people. I felt like there was a connection to be made that would exemplify each character, but it never blossomed. The chemistry that holds this type of cast together was weak, too.

I had seen both Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, and after viewing 'Dragon', I wanted to take a look at Michael Mann's Manhunter.****SPOILER**** ******DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN RED DRAGON & MANHUNTER!!******After seeing both movies based on the novel by Thomas Harris, my opinion is that Red Dragon is by far, the better one.  For instance, the character of William Graham in Manhunter is a rip-off of Don Johnson.  Graham has the scruffy unshaven look and even wears some ultra-ugly PURPLE short-shorts. I'm not sure if Michael Mann wanted Peterson to act like Don Johnson, or if Peterson just uses Johnson's style on his own.  I also noticed that in Manhunter, Will Graham actually wanted to see Lector...while Graham in Red Dragon did not.  It makes more sense that he initially didn't want to see Dr. Lector (since he didn't even want the ""Tooth Fairy"" case in the first place.)People have already said that Red Dragon is more of a story about Francis Dolarhyde, and Manhunter is about Will Graham.  I think it makes more sense and is more effective to put a lot of focus on Francis ""The Tooth Fairy"" Dolarhyde.  In Manhunter, which runs about 1 hr. and 50 minutes, they cram as much as they can about Dolarhyde into the last twenty minutes.  Red Dragon brings Dolarhyde in after about a half an hour and it allows more focus on him.  They try showing how he's becoming the ""Dragon"", yet he's still a man.  You actually do start feeling sorry for him in a slight way.The thing that really did it for me in Red Dragon was the ending.  It was so much more effective than Manhunter's.  Dolarhyde brings Ralph's body with him to his house and shoots the dead Ralph, and you think he actually shot himself.  Then he tracks Graham to his house for the big payoff- the showdown between Graham and Dolarhyde.  However in Manhunter, Graham just jumps through the window and gets slashed with a piece of glass....only to shoot him a few minutes later.  How ANTI-CLIMATIC CAN YOU GET?!  See Red Dragon, don't waste your hard-earned money on a snooze-fest like Manhunter.",Red Dragon
597,kfergusonut,In the spirit of 'Silence of the Lambs',9,2 October 2002,"What I love about this movie, is it gets back to what 'Silence of the Lambs' was all about. 'Hannibal' was just for the money. It took liberties with the character and played out the story, because America wanted to see Hopkins free and roaming the world. 'Red Dragon,' on the other hand, returns to the style of 'Silence.' Brett Ratner has done an excellent job recreating Demme's style, while adding some of his own. Although Hopkins and Norton are excellent, my favorite performance was by far Ralph Fienes, who garnered much more screen time than I expected and gave his best performance ever. Check this one out.",Red Dragon
598,edories,Actors vs script,7,2 October 2002,"Class actors (Norton, Keitel, Hopkins, Fiennes) and a brilliant director trying to make the best from a bad script in which they succeeded. The directing was done in the same style as Silence of the Lambs, some scenes were very similar, which in this case contributed to the movie. In contradict, the script will ruin its success, very predictable, many cliches.",Red Dragon
599,bhisurfer,Finally a good modern thriller,10,1 October 2002,"Red Dragon carves up Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs and takes the cake as the scariest movie of modern times. Exactly how cunning is Lechter? Exactly how sick can people be? Remember these characters are based in truth! So if you don't need any more stress in your life, don't see this movie, otherwise, sweet dreams...",Red Dragon
600,jhenle2,"Thank god, it didn't turn out like Manhunter!",10,4 October 2002,"This movie was great.  It was completely upsetting...in a good way of course.  Coming into it I was worried about lots of cheap thrills and underdeveloped characters, not to mention how I loathed Manhunter.  But to my delight, it was honestly really disturbing, and frightening, and overall very well done.  Some people are already saying that the relation between Ed Norton's character and Lechtor is just a rehash of Silence of the Lambs, ignore them, the story is completely new and extremely engaging.  The acting was wonderful, I think even award worthy in some instances. And thank goodness we return to the mysterious version of Hannibal, unlike the demystified Lechtor in ""Hannibal.""  The only real quarrel I had with it was that the killer's journal looked a little to much like Jon Doe's notebooks from SE7EN, but it really wasn't that big a deal.  It's so good to finally come out of a theater completely taken by a movie again.",Red Dragon
601,Matrix_330,Better than Silence of the Lambs!!!,10,5 October 2002,"I was really suprised on how great this movie was, I guess the directors learned what to do and what not to do from Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. I had just finished the book today, then went to see the movie, but honestly, I think that the book WAS better, but that's what everyone says, the book is always better. But everyone I went with said that they were suprised!!!! After seeing Hannibal, I didn't think that any other movie that followed for the same base line would be good, but boy was I wrong. I also think that Edward Norton needs to be in more movies, because he is an EXCELLENT actor, in every movie he's been in! This is definitely one of my favorite movies now!! And they couldn't have found someone to be better portraying Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector as Anthony Hopkins. He was definitely  better in this movie than the last two as well, in my personal opinion!",Red Dragon
602,RichieCunningham123,Almost as good as Silence.... but not quite,9,30 September 2002,"Well I must say this movie is definetely up until now one of the better movies of the year!  Hopkins, Norton and even Fiennes give remarkable performances and really bring the characters out of the book to the screen very well!!  And give Ratner credit for setting up gripping and suspenseful scenes - some which can rival those of Silence!  Although we don't get as much Lecter in this movie - it is still a pleasure every time he is onscreen, talking his riddles and swooning his wit.  My only problem with this movie was it's Hollywoodesque type ending... but I don't think they had any choice but to have it end the way it did =( .Any fan of Silence MUST watch this ASAP - a pure treat as delectable as fava beans and a fine chianti!",Red Dragon
603,Desdinova_BOC,Manhunter for the new millennium,8,14 October 2002,"After 30 minutes of adverts(!) I was already in a bad mood. Unsettling thoughts began to creep in. ""Why was I about to watch a dodgy Hollywood remake of a great film and book?Lousy Hopkins probably crack some dodgy joke that makes me sick."" Then the film started. Pretty stylish! Well cast,acted, and with a fine score by Danny Elfman. Definitely on par with the original, and a whole staircase up from Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins was slightly formulaic, but I can dig that. They changed the ending as well, but not too much. Despite the 15 rating, it didn't seem to be heavily cut. Ralph Fiennes was a perfect Francis, with Edward Norton surprisingly well as Will Graham. I'll give it 8/10.",Red Dragon
604,Clyde_Frog,ohmygod,8,5 October 2002,"i got to preview this movie the day before it was released and i was blown away. maybe i just wasnt expecting much after Hannibal *gag* but this was a great movie. ralph finnes and anthony hopkins are their usual outstanding selves. i usually love edward norton in everything, but it seemed like he was maybe miscast for this role. he is good in this, but i think maybe someone like matt damon or george clooney could have done it better. but thats just me. anyway. kick ass! easily one of the 5 best movies i will see this year. run, do not walk, go watch this!",Red Dragon
605,michaellagon,"Quite surprised with this one, Possible Spoilers",8,29 September 2002,"After the disappointing Hannibal release, I had low expectations before watching Red Dragon.  Luckily, Red Dragon focuses more on the suspense and character development, rather than the pointless gore of the previous movie. The plot flowed well, although it is similar to The Silence Of The Lambs. There are some gruesome scenes, but nothing over the top.  Good character development, especially with Anthony Hopkins' and Ralph Fiennes' characters. Edward Norton's character wasn't quite as strong as I hoped it would be. This movie has enough to stand on its own, but also sets up nicely as a prequel for The Silence Of The Lambs.  Overall an enjoyable serial killer flick, which far surpasses it's predecessor.",Red Dragon
606,gdorff,"Excellent thriller, with Hannibal Lecter as a bonus",9,7 October 2002,"Possibly the best part of the movie is the first ten minutes, but the remainder is still excellent by itself.  A very suspenseful plot, with some sexual tension thrown in for good measure.The villain's roots are understood and although he says very little in the movie, he still comes across as a believable and even sympathetic character.I thought all the performances were strong, the camera work and editing exciting without being choppy.  I didn't notice the music, which is surprising to me because Danny Elfman's movie scores have always been so unique.  This one wasn't, but it didn't detract from the movie, either.All in all, an excellent movie, and very enjoyable.",Red Dragon
607,deaddude4ever,Like the original but better with Hopkins,7,1 October 2002,Follows the original plot but becomes more terrifying with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. The beginning and the ending has changed a little but only for the better. Edward Norton is fine as Will Graham the former FBI agent but it feels like he is holding back a little to let Hopkins play out. A good remake of a great original.,Red Dragon
608,kflockhart,Superb!,10,2 October 2002,"I felt that 'Silence Of The Lambs' was a really good movie. 'Hannibal' fell seriously short, but 'Red Dragon' has to be the best of the 'Hannibal Lecter' films. It kept you in suspense the whole way through, superb acting, production & editing! A real winner!",Red Dragon
609,adamajohnston,Why bother?,5,28 September 2002,"I'll need to go find Manhunter again and give it a second look after seeing this. The acting is watchable rather than great. The protagonists (i.e. Will Graham and Dolarhyde) just don't engage or feel as threatening and unstable as those in Manhunter, although Hopkins is as good as ever as Dr Lector. The direction is also fine but perhaps not as adventurous as Manhunter (loved those shots through the eyes of the dragon!). Some people will like the references between this and the last two films featuring Dr Lector, but apart from that, there's nothing new to see here. I haven't read the book so i don't know whether this is more faithful to the story than Manhunter. Even if it is, and even if Manhunter was a terrible film (which it isn't) I'm still not sure that's it worth paying all that money to remake it 15 years later.",Red Dragon
610,cherylm24,Absolutely Perfect!,10,13 October 2002,"Though I enjoyed the Manhunter interpretation, I have to admit after seeing Silence of the Lambs and reading Red Dragon, I longed for two things: (1) a more book-faithful story (particularly the ending) and (2) to see Anthony Hopkins portray the part of Hannibal Lecter.  And, for the past year, I have anticipated the release of this film account of my favorite of the three novels.I was not disappointed.  Hopkins was, of course, tremendous.  But Ed Norton stole the show. In the book, Will Graham was brilliant, yet vulnerable. A haunted man frightened of his psychic connection with Lecter and his own abilities.  Norton WAS, indeed, Will Graham, weaving all his complexities into one fantastic performance.Fiennes as Dolarhyde was also a demonstration of the flawless casting.For me, the film was absolutely perfect.  I went with two people who also very much enjoyed the book, and our assessment was unanimous:  We wouldn't change a thing.",Red Dragon
611,nvr,Better than Hanibal but not as gory!,9,2 October 2002,This flick was excellent. Had the chance to preview it at a private screening and it reminded me of silence of the lambs. Not really Hanibal which I felt was not nearly as good as the original so congrats on heading back more toward the original plot. Not as much in the way of violent images as I expected but an all round decent movie with a good but expected plot. Worth seeing.,Red Dragon
612,pat_acer,Entertaining and chilling...,8,6 October 2002,"A worthy prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter provides yet another brilliant performance. The story begins with Dr. Lecter serving his guests a delicious meal, contents quite unknown. Post the meal, he is consulted by an FBI officer Will Graham (Edward Norton), investigating a few grisly murders. Ed Norton gives a riveting performance throughout the movie. The horror of Dr. Lecter is brought to the audience only through newspaper headlines of his tale as he is put in high security prison. Later, there are more murders and Graham is brought back from retirement to help track another cannibal. He asks Dr. Lecter to help him, but the relationship is tenuous as Graham is the one who's put Lecter into prison. Ralph Fiennes also gives a good performance as the Red Dragon. His duality of character is well portrayed. For all those who were disappointed by Hannibal, the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, this is the movie that will make you feel good again. Three good actors bring life to this chilling tale and the movie has excellent dialogue delivery. The script and the editing are also excellent.",Red Dragon
613,RunaraSedai,On the mark,10,1 October 2002,"After Hannibal did not go over as well without Foster in it and an ending that disappointed most people, Red Dragon will be a refreshing treat. For those that read the novel they will be pleased to see how close to the storyline the movie is. They did a better job on this than they did for the previous film made off of the book, Manhunter. The performances were excellent, the scenery close to what I had imagined and the ending truly something that had the audience laughing. I am glad that I made the effort to see it beforehand than wait until it had come out this friday. However I do plan on seeing it again as I doubt that I will tire from it.",Red Dragon
614,mag_xpm,"All I can say is, wow..",8,4 October 2002,"I just saw this movie last night at a sneak preview and it was definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year.  Not only have I been waiting for this movie to come out for some time (because I've read the book), but the Hannibal/Silence dvdpack just came out and it just made my anticipation even stronger.  First off, as far as continuations or prequels go in other movies, this one is by far the best I've seen in a while.  The visual effects, words for Hopkins, ideas, etc.. all amazing and mind bending.  If you were a fan of Silence alone or Hannibal as well, this movie just makes your mind go even more nuts.  It's like running thru hell really fast and taking all the really cool ideas to put into a movie and calling it Red Dragon. I'll admit there were some cheesy parts (not gonna say what they are, yer gonna have to see it for yourself!), but overall it was done very well. Hopkins does yet another amazing job and Ralph Fiennes was great. Just go see it is basically what I'm summing up.",Red Dragon
615,domyates,Nice Beginning - Tasty Ending !,8,4 October 2002,"The penchant of film makers at the moment seems to be to make prequels to already successful movie franchises, Star Wars, The Blair Witch and the Exorcist to name but a few.  Step away from the perceptions that you have about shoddy money spinning ventures and sit down to Red Dragon to really see an early depiction of Hannibal at his best.The Red Dragon script is top notch making unintentional or purposeful references to the latter two films that really would only be understood had they previously been seen.Again the acting from Anthony Hopkins is excellent but Edward Norton excels as the Retired FBI agent forced back into the fold to satisfy a love for the thrill of the chase.If you haven't seen this movie... why not?Dominic Yates.",Red Dragon
616,kajetan,Smart detective hunts down insane family killer,7,4 October 2002,"This movie is certainly not dull. I liked that the killings were not shown in explicit detail, photos were the basis of the detective's work nearly all the time. It was exciting watching the plot unfold, though there were no complete surprises. In total: Worth watching.",Red Dragon
617,yves-7,Back to the mode of success!,9,4 October 2002,"The movie was outstanding.  The characters were well developed and intricately interwoven.  Just one question.....  why does a blind woman wear a regular wristwatch?  Other than that one minor lapse, I think this movie gives Silence of the Lambs a run for the money, yet in the end, it can't quite surpass the original's introduction of Hannibal as we know and ""love"" him today.  Frances Dollarhyde.....  Eat your heart out!  Hannibal rules!",Red Dragon
618,Shawn_1967,Francis Dolarhyde,10,5 October 2002,"I think Red Dragon is the best of the three.Hannibal is very evil as usual,but I think Dolarhyde steals the show.Ralph Fiennes does a great job at playing the truely demented Dolarhyde.At one point in the movie,I actually started to feel sorry for this man,regardles of his evil deeds.There is also some very graphic scenes,so if you have a weak stomach,dont see it.",Red Dragon

620,Tuco22,is the best movie of 2002,10,8 October 2002,I enjoyed the film very much.  I didn't think that Brett Ratner could pull it off but boy did he do a good job.  I loved the beginning and the end with Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald)telling Lecter (Hopkins)that there was a female FBI agent there to ask him questions.I also thought going into the film that Edward Norton wasn't going to do that good of a job as Will Graham but he did a great job. Anthony Hopkins once again delivered a great performance as the DoctorThe two best performances came from Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dolarhyde and Emily Watson as Reba McClane.  They both did great and deserve an Academy Award Nomination.,Red Dragon
621,butlera-1,A poor pastiche that is cashing in on previous genius,5,9 October 2002,"I see people saying this film is a great film, an award winner, better than SOTL (a film that changed the face of thrillers forever) ... Did I see the same film? This, given today's production capabilities and audiences with a slightly more sophisticated palate, was a poor attempt to create a Hopkins DVD Box set. SOTL is a stand alone thriller, a 'complete' movie that satisfies the viewer on multitude of levels. Hannibal, whilst slashing away at the some of the wonderful quirks Harris's novel laid out, was a beautiful production, a veritable assault on the senses. Red Dragon had neither the dark edginess of Manhunter, the skilled tension of SOTL nor the sheer elegance of Hannibal.
Sorry to rain on Red Dragons' parade but I'd recommend you rent or buy this one when it hits DVD. An entertaining piece for fans of Mr Lecter, a let down for the fans of true cinema...",Red Dragon
622,coupdegrace,***Possible Spoilers***,9,13 October 2002,"I read the book about four years ago and absolutely loved it, even more so than Silence. I was thrilled to hear that they were remaking the movie, and even more thrilled when I heard the cast and crew. I knew bringing Ted Tally back to do convert it to a script was a great plan, as he stayed very close to the original story with Silence. Plus, I'm a huge Ed Norton fan. But I was still a little skeptical that they'd pull it off well.So did they? Yeah, I'd say so. There was some stuff they left out of the book that I wish they hadn't, probably for length reasons, such as the fact that Willy wasn't Will's son, but Molly's dead husband's. Plus, they failed to go more into Dolarhyde's past, which I loved in the book because it made me almost feel sorry for him instead of seeing him as pure evil, as most stories often make the bad guy out to be. Plus they changed the ending. Call me cynical, but the ending in the book was better, even though it wasn't a happy one (Will gets stabbed in the face and Molly leaves him for Willy's sake, knowing that Lector may send someone else after them).Anyway, as much as I love Norton, he underplayed Graham a bit. Fiennes was wonderful, as was Philip Seymour Hoffman, who couldn't have played a better slimeball. And even though I normally hate suspenseful movies that add sudden loud noises or things jumping out at you for a cheap scare, all that type of stuff fits pretty well, I think. Overall, being one for movies like Silence or Seven, I think this definitely added to my list of favorites in the genre.",Red Dragon

It actually had me 'on the edge of my seat' more than once, where as is in ""Lambs"" the only time I felt suspense was when Clarice was in the completely darkened basement at the end of the flick.  Also, the main characters seem 'fleshed-out' more and so are more interesting.  Definitely a better-acted and more intriguing film than ""Lambs.""  Even Hannible seems scarier!",Red Dragon
625,Jack85,Pretty Good,8,1 November 2002,"I've never seen Manhunter by Mann, but I think that Red Dragon is a very good film, expecially if compared with the precedent Hannibal, which I didn't like at all. Hopkins is a great actor, and when he plays this part he shows him at his better; I liked also Ralph Fiennes, but I think he's not that believable, as I think he's not too ugly (or not like Noonan). Graham's performance has disappointed me, like Keitel's. Ivan Reitman is a good director, but can't be compared with people like Scott and Demme; he may be too young, we'd better wait for his Superman.Well, a very good film, one of the most important of this season.",Red Dragon

I thought it was another failure, on top of Hannibal. The movie starts in an interresting way, it lets you meet dr.Lecter again and it all looks oke. But as soon as Edwart Norton decides to help the FBI with their investigation, it all takes a turn for the worst. The storyline starts to degrade to a very predictable level, the acting degrates, all of the susspense that made ""silence of the lambs"" so good is taken away by showing to much of the killer and his deeds. The ending of the movie is really dreadfull, it was so predictable that I could have told it before I'd seen the movie. It really is a sad thing to see the charisma of one of my favorite movies ever:""silence of the lambs"" to be degrated to a level of mere cashcow. It could have been so good, but I guess in the end money wins. Sir A.Hopkins you're still my hero, but only because of your earlier work.

This movie is one of my favorites, although I have to admit I like them all, even the dreaded Hannibal. Red Dragon is faithful to the novel, and once you are into the movie, you can't let it go. I know some people, mostly critics, have a thing against the director, Brett Ratner, but that is not my problem. For me, this is the one. 
Even though Manhunter was the 1st film adaption of the Thomas Harris novel, it is a different movie altogether, moody, dark...and totally different than the novel, to the extent that the Hannibal character is almost not important. So there you go: #1: Silence and #2: Red Dragon.",Red Dragon

634,dcg0587,Made me Happy!!,9,11 May 2004,"The movie Red Dragon was a great movie to watch. It was scary when it needed to be and tender at other moments. It shows that a serial killer does still have feelings and is not just a machine. I enjoyed this movie very much. I feel that the movie should have come out before the other two movies, because it may confuse people. I almost cried when Hannibal Lecter got shot at the beginning, i thought for sure that he was dead, but thankfully he survived. I find it amusing that the tooth fairy was asking for approval from Lecter. In a way hannibal could be a father figure to him. I was saddened when i heard the grandmother's voice saying those horrible things. It really made me think of what happens to people who really have guardians like that. I very much enjoyed this movie.",Red Dragon
635,sooneron,Grest casting and big budgets do not equal perfection,4,27 May 2004,"I approached Red Dragon with a little trepidation. I really enjoyed the original ""Manhunter"". I am really not sure why they made this movie. It's not as if they were remaking a movie from 30 years ago. People rag on Michael Mann forMiami Vice, but if there is one thing that Mann does well, it's characterdevelopment, just watch movies such as ; Heat and The Insider. He knowscharacter/script driven film. Brett Rattner did the rush Hour movies, films that rest on actors and quick predictable banter. Stuff that Joe Lunchpail eats up. This is something of , more of the same. He just went more high-brow this time. Thecast is first rate with Hopkins, Norton, Fiennes, Hoffman, Keitel, and Watson. I won't even touch ML Parker as Norton's wife, she's utilized as the typicalHollywood prop wife. Hopkins seems to be doing just what the studio asked of him, give the idiots in the seats what they want, the same old Hannibal. Now I know what he (Hopkins) is talking about when he refers to occasionally doing the ""BIG"" Hollywood films for the money. Ratner seems to have decided not to regress Hannibal to a role that would have grown into the latter Hannibal. I guess he substantiates this lack of initiative by having Red Dragon roll right into TSOTL, chronologicallyspeaking. Whereas, in Manhunter and the book, the story takes place 6 yearsprior to Silence, Dragon ends with Starling's arrival. We never see her, ofcourse, ooh! Chills! I guess this makes the ""fans"" of the series feel like they're privy to something. Norton's presence begs for attention, but it seems that Ratner didn't seem to challenge him. He does an OK performance, but he feels a little hollow andthere are glances at what Graham could have been. Which leads to Keitel's role as Crawford. I never felt like I could sense his manipulation of Graham. It seems that Ratner asked him to play his cop role from Thelma and Louise with a touch of Bad Lieutenant thrown in (not enough). Fiennes portrayal of Dolarhyde is the best of the film. This isn't saying a lot, as the other actors seem to be efforting a little more than nothing. Possibly, with the exception of Watson. Fiennes really seemed to immerse himself in the role of a tortured sociopath. I think that this was Ratner's biggest area of focus. Just bring in Harvey,Tony and Ed and let them fend for themselves and do what they do. Ralph's performance really lets you inside the mind of a psycho and he'sbelievable. I gained new respect for him. You can really see something behind his eyes that something's not right about him. Nice job. This is possibly the only thing that I can see that's really better than the original. Although, Tom Noonan would get more than a passing grade for his turn as Dolarhyde.Emily Watson does a decent job as Dolarhyde's love-interest. It sometimes feels like she's doing her turn in Wait Until Dark. A fine and another believableperformance in the cast. Hoffman's performance is OK, but you want more of him as the disgustingtabloid reporter. The film seems to repeatedly pick up steam and then vanquish it. Ratner shows some proclivity for creating suspense, but it falls to the side with hollowperformances by the protagonists. The writer took a lot of license by including Lector more. The scene at the beginning where Lector is caught by Graham istotally useless. It's not in the book or in Manhunter. More of the studio line of, ""Give the adoring public what they want."" It could have been better served as glimpses of a flashback. Nothing brings out curiosity and disdain like a scar and the one that Graham is rendered with could have served that purpose just byshowing it and referring to it. This film isn't as stylish or intelligent as the original or Silence. Sometimes the public thinks that it's an intelligent film if it's about smart people that say witty lines from time to time. This is one of those films. With the cast involved, it deserves to be a better film. But I have to question why make this film in the first place? Manhunter stands alone on it's own feet. Oh yeah, the almighty dollar that comes with a Hollywood franchise can answer that question. That, and I guess the Entertainment Weekly, Access Hollywood following public had to see Hopkins in the Lector role in this one.",Red Dragon
636,ei00003,Excellent movie!,8,24 August 2004,"It's really a good movie. Keeping the mystery, the fear and suspense 'till the end. Anthony Hopkins is definitely in his best as Dr. Lecter. Great performance of Edward Norton too. Also, Ralph Fiennes did good with the ""psycho"" paper. My favorite parts of the movie were the beginning of the investigation at the Leeds house when Graham imagines the crime scenes in the killers mind, and the end of the movie, when the killer burns the house and ""kills"" himself.The only thing I can understand completely is how could the killer be alive to try to murder Graham's family if he committed suicide? He was dead on the floor with a shot in the head! Could it be another body? Could it be the guy he shot in the head at the blind girl's house?Anyway, a must see!",Red Dragon
637,AClockworkDietOrange,What frightens me the most is some people's reaction commenting this movie,5,31 December 2004,"... As it is a ""horror, suspense masterpiece"". It's alright to check it out on cable during a sleepless night if you don't have anything to do the morning after. But, seriously... as a sequel, a prequel, squirrel, or whatever you want to call it, it barely functions, failing gradually as the plots starts to intensify: the way the investigators try to decipher the whole subtle codes both the Dragon & Lecter share is shown quickly, without further explanations, taking for granted any intention of the viewers to really understand the genius behind Lecter's madness. The whole William Blake poems & drawings (plus, the tattoo on the Red Dragon's back) is nothing but a cheap & sad attempt to put any cultural reference in a really insipid detective movie, just like the reference of the demon Azazel works in that movie with Denzel Washington, ""Fallen"". What I was guessing as the ""end"" of the movie (what I least tried to visualize as a reasonable end for such an obvious plot), when Dolarhyde ""commits"" suicide in front of his blind girlfriend, is followed by a really stupid, predictable & cheesy epilogue! We actually saw how the blind chick's face was splashed with blood from the supposed ""suicide"" of Dolarhyde. And yet, what happened is the guy actually survived, & the head blown corpse corresponded to Ralph Mandy. So we have to actually suppose that Ralph Mandy's corpse was sitting in that couch waiting to be shot after dead in the head again, just to fool a blind woman character who actually is completely irrelevant in the whole plot. Anyway, you gotta give credit, at the end, for that remarkable tattoo resembling Blake's fantastic painting. I am kinda disappointed, even though, to see how Edward Norton chose such an uninteresting character to portray.",Red Dragon

639,Exothokman,"Engaging, Exiciting, Explosions, What More Do You Want!",7,20 July 2018,"We've seen it before, just executed with tonal difference and a lighter budget. 'Red Dragon' is entertaining and engaging from start to finish, but not as suspenseful as 'Manhunter', the 1986 original adaptation of the story. Anthony Hopkins gives a great performance in this movie, but not as unsettling as he was in 'Silence of the Lambs'. Perhaps this movie belongs to Edward Norton and his character Will Graham, and his performance is equally as good as William Peterson's. Another great performance here is Emily Watson as Reba, a blind lady who is ready to find partnership with someone she can relate to. As for Ralph Fiennes acting he was supurb as well, yet I perfer the Francis Dolarhyde found in 'Manhunter', as he was much emotionally off the wall and ultimately resentful, which overall gave more suspense to the movie. The cinamatography and the score are expected from this sort of movie, nothing out of the ordinary and done competently. But the burning man in a wheelchair was definitely done to great effect (spoiler?) While I have not read 'Red Dragon', I liked the plot of 'Manhunter' over this one (especially the ending), but I thought the writing in this movie better fleshed out every character in the movie. There were more scenes with Hannibal Lecktor, Mr. D, and Reba, which is a good enough tradeoff for me. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in thrillers.",Red Dragon

641,mr-seductivesiren,Watchable Thriller and better than Hannibal 2001,7,31 August 2018,"I watched this movie after watching the Silence of the Lambs to complete the Trilogy. I didn't even watched it's trailers just to keep myself more open to surprises.Red Dragon is a good thriller with a good cast and story. Though it is a remake of ""Manhunter"" 1986 movie. If you haven't watched it yet then please don't read the below review as it contains spoilers.Movie starts with Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) hosting a dinner party to some of his friends and when the party is over Dr. Lecter is visited by a FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) who starts discussing about a serial killer whom he is chasing. After a while Graham figures out that Dr. Lecter is the serial killer and gets stabs by Dr. Lecter while taking out his gun. Anyhow, Graham stabs Dr. Lecter with some arrows in an act of defense after that the casting starts and story continues.What point I wanted to make here according to the above intro is... The moment I had seen Edward Norton I realized that this movie is going to be awesome but once he got stabbed I thought that his character is very short lived. But, in the casting I came to know that his character has got more screen time.Overall the movie is pretty watchable keeps you grounded and the end is satisfying.I rated 7 stars because there were some ups and downs in the movie.",Red Dragon
642,edina-topic,"""Red dragon""",10,27 June 2005,"'Red dragon' is a masterpiece in many aspects: screenplay, directing, and most of all, superb acting. Mr. Hopkins once again proved that he is a 'true hog of Epicure's herd'. R. Fiennes was stellar, however I can't resist being very partial - the best ever accomplishment of Edward Norton is definitely this movie (hope to see him more in a roles such as this one - positive and splendid.) This movie more than the previous two ('Silence of the Lambs' and 'Hanibal') focuses on the technique used in tracking and dismantling criminals, but also goes further in psycho-analysis of the causes of their mental state and reasons motivating them to commit crimes. That is the special value of this movie which makes it not just fun or pastime, but makes it a drive compelling you to think about what you saw after it's over. It is a glorious composition of dramatic, still and eerie scenes (music deserves special compliments) that exchange in a rhythm which simply keeps you alert all the way from the beginning to the end.'The silence of the lambs is too dark and tense. 'Hanibal' is too 'to the point' and too romantic to be experienced as a horror, but 'Red dragon' has all those elements together. It's the best in the trilogy and I look forward to the fourth part which is already underway. I think that the same crew should do it. Edina",Red Dragon
643,duttasanjiv,Regained my trust in Movies!,10,11 November 2020,"This is what I call a true movie. Of course, it is not a serious film, those I would call 'great movies'. But yes, this movie has the true soul & spirit of a movie ... or the magic of it, in another word. This is a great entertainment I would say. The guys knew how to use the elements in a movie! And believe me, no foul language, no abundance of violence (but whatever is there, will really make you jump off the couch! ) , no mindless nudity & sexuality (again, there is , but no one will find it obscene or superficial at all). Full of drama, suspense, riddles, great background music and on top of that, clever dialogues and great acting by everyone!
If you started to believe commercial movie means superficial CGI & effects, and ridiculous, science defying action (or should I say circus?), then I recommend to watch this...and regain your trust in good entertaining movies!",Red Dragon

645,howietwins,Release date question,6,5 October 2005,"I saw on my DVD that the movie copyright date was 2002. Was it released later in USA, earlier somewhere else?Re the movie itself, it did not grab my attention as well as the book. In fact, the movie played more like a standard mystery movie or a good ""Law and Order, Special Victims Unit"".Casting was great--how could it not be with those names? BUT, the Tooth Fairy casting missed the book's depiction of a genuinely fierce, muscular man with a readily noticed facial disfigurement. Too, the movie Tooth Fairy seemed to wear his ""good"" teeth most of the time, lessening his shock effect.This movie shows how really good ""Manhuner"" really was. I first saw ""Manhunter"" about 1991 while off sick from work, drifting through daytime t. v. channels. That made me a Thomas Harris fan at once. ""Red Dragon"" would not do the same.",Red Dragon
646,AddeColciago,"Great film, but suffers from the Lambs being even greater!",8,18 October 2006,"When I was around eight or nine years old, The Silence of the Lambs was aired on the Swedish television. For once my mom let me stay up and watch it. And boy, I was scared.I've bought the film on DVD a couple of weeks ago, and I realized that I might exaggerated as a boy. Even though it wasn't as scary as I expected, I loved it! Anthony Hopkins performance is by far one of the best I've ever seen.Now, what does this have to do with Red Dragon? A lot, actually..Suddenly Hopkins becomes a weight for the film, as he's no way near the creepy Hannibal from the Silence. The scenes were he's smelling Grahams after-shave, and keeps on nagging about it for one and one and one.. That really bugs me! There are a lot of those things.And all this is just because of his GREAT performance in the Lambs! You can say that this movie suffers from having such a great preceding movie. Or else I must say I really adored the film! The scenes were Hannibal is walking around in the room with a chain attached to him, is great. And all of Edward Nortons performance is even more great! 10 stars to Norton! He really lifts the film. The thing I thought Hopkins would do",Red Dragon

648,denmag-1,Character Benjamin Raspel,9,2 November 2005,"Love all the Lecter movies.....But did anyone notice the problem with Benjamin Raspel between the Red Dragon and Silence of the lambs? In ""Silence"", it was Benjamin Raspel's head in the jar that Clarice found in the storage garage and it was a seemingly young person with curly black hair and a moustache. Lecter said that he didn't kill him but that it was the best thing for him because his therapy was going nowhere.........Lecter also describes him as a garden variety homosexual ( or was it transvestite?). Any way, in Red Dragon, (the third movie, but the first book)Benjamin Raspel is a balding clarinet player who Lecter has obviously killed and fed to his dinner party.It just seems like such an obvious and careless mistake to make from one film to the other.............it's like someone didn't do their homework.",Red Dragon
649,xhtm,It's No Silence of the Lambs,5,28 November 2005,"When I heard that Universal Studios was making a prequel to Silence of the Lambs, I'll admit that I was a little skeptical. Throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which, more or less, is what this prequel was. Caddyshack II, Godfather III, and Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, all horrible follow ups to great films. So naturally I was a little worried that the film Red Dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film. Any movie that follows a great film like Silence of the Lambs has a lot to live up to. Personally, I thought that the first sequel to Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, didn't quite achieve that, and neither did Red Dragon. It was a decent movie, but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first. Don't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value, but since it didn't come first I had already come to expect that. I thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films, but clearly their work shows otherwise.All in all, this movie disappointed me for several reasons. As I mentioned before, the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that I, as a fan of the films, had come to expect. But mostly, it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors. I've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception.",Red Dragon
