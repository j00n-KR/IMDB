0,TheLittleSongbird,The most moving masterpiece of all time!,10,9 February 2009,"You have got to love the Elephant Man. There isn't one scene that doesn't move me. It is also underrated, as it is very difficult to find, and is hardly on TV. The cinematography was beautiful, and the subject matter about a doctor treating a heavily-disfigured man is so sensitively handled I felt I was there. One of the most moving scenes, was right at the beginning when Treves sees Merrick for the first time, and a tear rolls down his cheek.Extraordinary! The scene with Treve's wife is so sad that I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the movie. When he cries, ""I am not an animal, I am a human being,"" I was actually sobbing. i really was. The ending, with the lovely Adagio for Strings(the only time it has been played well) was so poignant, as was the scene in the theatre, with the Tchaikovsky-like music, and Merrick enjoying himself like a 6 year old boy. The music is very haunting, as made apparent in the crowd scene mocking Merrick in the hospital. Don't criticise the beginning, or the end, because David Lynch was trying to create images of pure sadness and inner beauty, and they were very powerful images. As for the performances, never have I seen Anthony Hopkins more sensitive than he was here(well except for the final scene of Shadowlands). His performance was actually one of the main reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The best performance, without a doubt, is the heart-rending performance of John Hurt as John Merrick. Almost unrecognisable, but so magnificent, especially when he recited the psalm without the help of Treves. It is also incredibly difficult to speak with a lopsided mouth, and John Hurt mastered it. Other notable performances are from Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud. Anyone who gave this a 1/10, what is wrong with you? This is an absolute masterpiece, without question! 10/10. Bethany Cox",The Elephant Man
1,Leofwine_draca,Unmissable...and heartbreaking,8,4 March 2014,"A biopic of one of the most tragic people to ever exist, THE ELEPHANT MAN is a heartbreaking example of cinema at its finest. It's a film that uses the subject matter at hand to explore the human condition in all of its forms, so we get to see characters who are empathetic and selfish and everything between at various stages.This utterly poignant film - and believe me, you'll need to have tissues to hand when watching - is directed by David Lynch, who may just be the most obscure choice for a director that there could have been. Nonetheless, aside from a couple of book-ending arty shots, this is very well directed indeed and Freddie Francis's crisp black-and-white photography is something to behold.As with all good films, much of the success comes down to the actors. John Hurt is the real star here in a moving role that even outdoes his one in 10 RILLINGTON PLACE. He's unrecognisable throughout, and doesn't put a foot wrong. Anthony Hopkins is also very good, although as he commented his character is a little dull and doesn't have too much depth. There's also a nice bastardly turn from Michael Elphick, but really this is a film where everybody from the cast and crew is on top form.",The Elephant Man
2,SnoopyStyle,very slow with an interesting performance from John Hurt,6,27 September 2014,"London surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) tries to see the Elephant Man in a freak show. The police closes down the show for being degrading. Bytes (Freddie Jones) is the man in charge of John Merrick (John Hurt). Treves is able to pay Bytes to let him see Merrick. A drunken Bytes brutally beats Merrick and Treves brings him back to the hospital. He scares the nurses and is an oddity for his colleges. Everybody assumes Merrick to be an idiot. The drunk Bytes demands to have his meal ticket Merrick back. Treves convinces the hospital governor Carr-Gomm (John Gielgud) to allow Merrick to stay. It turns out that Merrick is quite a well spoken man. Famous actress Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft) is fascinated with news story of Merrick while the hospital's low life Night Porter brings people over to gawk at him.There is a lot to admire about this movie. John Hurt is able to project innocence through all that makeup. Hopkins is fine but I kept wondering what the movie is trying to say. There is a lot missing from this. The twisted style of David Lynch is missing. The black and white looks good but it doesn't elevate the style. The story lacks tension. It's all very flat. And the movie is horribly slow. I imagine if this movie was in color, the critical raves would disappear. I think the black and white simply covered up a lot of bland movie-making with an artistic veneer.",The Elephant Man
3,Hitchcoc,The Need to Go On,9,5 April 2006,"This is a masterful portrayal of one of the most interesting characters in history, John Merrick, the Elephant Man. Through the incredible performance of John Hurt, we get to see this as a person, not a sideshow freak, although that element was always there. As the movie evolves, he becomes more than we think he will, actually attaining celebrity. But, like Eric Stoltz, in ""Mask,"" society is there to pull him back. He can't be what he wants to be, try as he might. There is rampant cruelty throughout the world and Merrick lived it every day. I know that Roger Ebert leveled a charge of manipulation and sentimentality against this film. This is probably true. Filmmakers can't seem to resist the rather trite emotional tricks at times. The fact that Merrick was rebuilt to some extent for the film may be worthy of criticism. Maybe they did him a disservice by making him a bit more palatable for the movie audience. I don't know. We create fictions in film all the time. If we have a cancer patient, should we show them with pustules braking on their bodies. Perhaps we should to create an accurate portrayal. Perhaps today, the Elephant Man may be more graphic, more difficult to look at. Perhaps that would make a better film. I just know that sentimentality aside, this is a pretty good one.",The Elephant Man
4,Prismark10,The Elephant Man,8,3 May 2020,"Director David Lynch has made a moving film. Mainly because he chose to film this in black and white and added some surreal touches to it.It lends the film weight when it easily could be turned into a mawkish drama.Surrounded by top class talent. Freddie Francis was the cinematographer who had won an Oscar for his black and white movies. Anne Coates has won an Oscar for editing Lawrence of Arabia.John Merrick (John Hurt) was severely disfigured and exhibited in Victorian fairground shows. He was cruelly mistreated until rescued by Dr Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins.)Under his care, Merrick could express himself and even moved in London society circles. However there were always those who looked on him as a freak to be paraded in front of the public.Hurt gives an astonishing performance under layers of make up which took hours to apply. The make up is so effective and again the monochrome photography works so well with it.Hopkins also gives a compassionate performance, someone who sees Merrick as human but he is also negligent as well.Dr Treves might have just moved Merrick on to being a freak in polite society instead. He also had no inkling as to what was happening in the hospital in the evenings and Merrick was not telling.A lot of the story is made up, which is a weak point of the The Elephant Man. Token villains in order for it to have a three act structure.",The Elephant Man
5,classicsoncall,"""I am not an animal. I am a human being.""",8,31 October 2017,"As compelling and at times, inspirational as the movie is, I was left somewhat disappointed with the film after I looked up some information on the real John Merrick. His real name was Joseph Carey Merrick, and it's true that he was born with severe deformities; if you look up a picture of the man, you'll realize what an outstanding job the filmmakers achieved here with the makeup for the character of The Elephant Man, portrayed by John Hurt. The movie John Merrick looks exactly like the real John Merrick.Why director David Lynch decided to go with the opening sequence hinting at the origins of Merrick are simply confounding to me. It actually bothered me because there's no semblance of reality to it. In life, Merrick was not abandoned at birth, though his mother died when he was only nine years old. When his father remarried, both he and his stepmother rejected him. Leaving school at the age of thirteen and finding it difficult to find employment, he entered the Leicester Union Workhouse where he remained for four years until the age of seventeen.It was actually Merrick himself who sought out a showman in order to be exhibited. While on a tour in Brussels, he was robbed and abandoned by his manager, eventually finding his way back to London. It's at this point in the movie when his association with Dr. Frederick Treves really began, although Treves first met him some time earlier when he lived at a shop across the street from The London Hospital.If one allows for the historical inaccuracies, the movie can be a really touching experience, and I found myself definitely inspired by John Merrick's humanity and nobility of spirit. The film forces one to consider whether you could have summoned up the same amount of compassion for the kind of person Merrick was that Dr. Treves came by so naturally. One might ask one's self the same question Treves did at one point - ""Am I a good man, or am I a bad man?"" Be that as it may, if you go by what's presented on screen, the movie definitely commands accolades. Director Lynch treats his subject with the same care and compassion that Treves showed The Elephant Man. The real John Merrick only lived to the age of twenty seven, and his cause of death is hinted at near the end of the film, with Merrick's haunting study of a picture depicting a girl sleeping in bed. Earlier in the story, Merrick expressed his desire that he could sleep like a normal person. Because of his deformities he had to sleep sitting up, but when his death occurred, the official cause was noted as asphyxia. However an autopsy by Dr. Treves revealed a dislocated neck. It caused this viewer to consider whether Merrick intentionally brought about a resolution to the quality of his life as a spectacle.",The Elephant Man
6,gavin6942,Lynch's Best Work in a Serious Vein,8,24 July 2013,"A Victorian surgeon (Anthony Hopkins) rescues a heavily disfigured man (John Hurt) who is mistreated while scraping a living as a side-show freak. Behind his monstrous facade, there is revealed a person of intelligence and sensitivity.First of all, Mel Brooks produced this? And was able to convince the studio to let it be filmed in black and white (which was a great choice)? Well played, Brooks. You deserve far more respect than you are already given just for this.Second of all, John or Joseph? The film calls him John Merrick, but apparently his name was really Joseph Merrrick. Why the discrepancy? Is he called John in the memoirs? This is confusing, and strange that (probably because of the film) he is now universally remembered as John.While this is not Lynch's masterpiece (that has to go to ""Blue Velvet""), it is possibly his best work critically. Obviously the Academy thought so. And apart from the fact it features a deformed man, there is nothing strange about the plot or themes. This may be Lynch's most ""real"" film, as even ""The Straight Story"" is pretty odd in a number of ways.",The Elephant Man
7,lee_eisenberg,"An elephant never forgets, and ""The Elephant Man"" is unforgettable.",10,19 December 2005,"Anthony Hopkins is so associated with Hannibal Lecter, that we almost forget that he did star in movies before that. ""The Elephant Man"", for example. It's sort of hard to determine whether the main character is disfigured John Merrick (John Hurt) or Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins). Either way, it's the movie's plot that's important. The plot of course shows how Merrick has been treated as a monster all his life and Treves tries to cure him. As for the possibility that the movie may have revered its subject too much...well, would you feel comfortable mocking him? A particularly interesting combo is the people behind the movie: director David Lynch and executive producer Mel Brooks (Brooks' wife Anne Bancroft appears as an actress). The former is synonymous with deliberately weird cinema, while the latter is synonymous with silliness. Both men show a different side here. All in all, this is definitely a movie that everyone should see.",The Elephant Man
8,jboothmillard,The Elephant Man,10,13 July 2005,"I remember seeing this during my time at college, and when I got the chance to see it again, that was when I realised what a masterpiece it truly is, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive). The film opens with a flashy scene seeing a (pregnant) woman being attacked by an elephant, before it moves to the main time of 19th Century, Victorian London, England. Dr. Frederick 'Freddie' Treves (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is exploring the urban carnival freak show, and he pays owner Bytes (Freddie Jones) for a private viewing of the most hideous of all of his ""creatures"", known only as 'The Elephant Man'. He pays him also to allow him to examine him for the Pathological Society, and after returning back to Bytes, being beaten severely and suffering bronchitis, Treves takes him back to be treated in the hospital. Knwoing his true name, John Merrick (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated John Hurt), Treves finds out slowly that he does not need to learn to speak, he is already able to read, write and speak already, he was just afraid. Merrick's tragic condition of deformity is caused by 14 overgrown tumours on his body, face and hands, and he can only sleep sitting up or he will die suffocating from the weight of his head. Most of the hospital staff, including Governor Carr Gomm (Sir John Gielgud) and matron Mothershead (Wendy Hiller), accept him being a permanent patient, and slowly Treves introduces John to London society. The starts with a meeting with Mrs. Treves (Hannah Gordon), and the local newspaper report allows John to meet famous stage actress Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft). Then one night, the greedy Night porter (Michael Elphick) has many drunk people paying him to see the freak, and amongst the people is Bytes who kidnaps John taking him to France. So once again, sick and neglected, John is put on show as The Elephant Man, but Bytes' son (a very young Snatch's Dexter Fletcher) and the other carnival performers release him. John is happy to return to the safety of the hospital with Treves, and they both know John doesn't have long to live, so they go to the theatre where Mrs. Kendal dedicates the performance to him. The final scene sees John's finished castle model, before he discards all the pillows to sleep lying down where he dies and his Mother (Phoebe Nicholls) welcomes him into Heaven. Also starring Helen Ryan as Princess Alex and Star Wars' Kenny Baker (R2-D2) as Plumed Dwarf. With reliable and magnificent British talent like Hopkins, Bancroft and Gielgud you can't go wrong, but this film obviously belongs to the superb and unrecognisable (apart from the voice and eyes) Hurt. Lynch makes sure that this biographical drama pulls at all your heart strings, with the great atmospheric music, great special effects make-up, and even the black and white colour adds something, it is one of the only films I know that makes you feel sympathy for a (real) character the whole way through, that's what makes it a masterpiece. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Morris, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Production Design/Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, John Hurt was number 27, and Hopkins number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Hopkins was also number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers. Outstanding!",The Elephant Man
9,ccthemovieman-1,Almost Too Heart-Wrenching To Watch,9,1 November 2005,"Man, this is a powerful and great movie. We are all moved different degrees by different things, but to witness sincerely nice people being treated cruelly always bothers me big- time....so this film is tough to watch in spots. Some scenes are just painful and depressing to view. Whatever your sensitivity, the movie is very involving and hauntingly shown with eerie black-and-white photography. Eerie, and downright beautiful camera-work in here, so kudos to cinematographer Freddie Francis, one of the best in the business.A young Anthony Hopkins is very likable and John Hurt is, well, someone you won't soon forget as John Merrick, ""The Elephant Man.""This is an uplifting movie at times, too, not just a tear-jerker or horrific in showing man's cruelty to man. Be prepared for an emotional experience and an amazing story.",The Elephant Man
10,rmax304823,One of Us.,8,14 August 2008,"This has to be the only totally straight movie that David Lynch ever put his fingers on. And at that, it's not entirely straight, but it seldom edges into Lynch's private vision, or through the looking glass, or down the rabbit hole, or into The Garden of Earthly Delights or the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir, or wherever it is that his other films, beginning with ""Eraserhead"", have voyaged into.I should note that all of David Lynch's movies are eerie and ominous, but that the atmosphere isn't created by directorial fireworks. The techniques are classical -- no instant cutting, no slow motion, no ghoulish colors, no funny camera work, although the lens may occasionally plumb the auditory canal of a severed ear. Instead, what makes his work exception is his control of the images and sound. The art direction, set decoration, the architecture and textures, and the sound are as filled with impact as the story itself. It's a sentimental and ultimately tragic story naturally. John Merrick, the elephant man of the title, was a rude lump of foul deformity, a simulacrum of a human being. What else could they do, turn it into a comedy? A werewolf movie? John Hurt is Merrick, kept in thrall by Bytes (Freddie Jones) who exhibits him to the public in a freak show in Victorian London. Merrick is rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who sneaks him into a hospital run by Carr Gomm (John Gielgud) where he is tended by nurses who are frightened of him. All the nurses except their chief, Mothershead. Mothershead is enacted by a starchy Wendy Hiller.Here's how a director with a case of arrested aesthetic development and a craving for commercial success would have first revealed the hideous half-human that was John Merrick. Generic suspense music, please. A frightened nurse open Merrick's door, she drops the plates and shrieks while the camera zooms into her terrified face. Then -- a cut, and the camera whips up to Merrick's deformed face, accompanied by a loud, dissonant sting on the sound track -- WHAMMMMM! Not here though.Gradually the staff come to realize that despite his disfigurement, Merrick is really a sweet and gentle soul, forgiving and grateful for the smallest of kindnesses. Warmth replaces fear. And when Treves takes Merrick home to meet his wife (Hannah Gordon), this caprice of nature begins to sob quietly, saying, ""I've never been treated so well by a lovely woman."" Imagine how much worse it could have been. Instead of being barely able to hiss his lines -- instead of producing mediocre sketches -- instead of merely building a model cathedral out of match sticks -- the script could have turned him into a genius! How inspiring? Elephant Man rescued from freak show writes a smash hit Broadway play? Paints the Mona Lisa of 1890? Mentally extends pi to 23 digits in ten seconds? Invents Leggos? No. The only thing Merrick has going for him is his utter joy at being treated humanely. Thank God he's just a nice guy, not a saint.The rest of the principles are frankly splendid. Models of acting, really, with not a sour note being struck. Especially interesting is Hannah Gordon's portrayal of Treve's wife. She's not a dazzling beauty but has one of the most expressive faces on screen. She tells us everything we need to know by just lifting an eyebrow. (What Freddy Jones could have learned from her!) Hannah Gordon doesn't have that much screen time here but catch her, if you can, in ""Miss Morrison's Ghosts,"" in which she plays opposite Wendy Hiller, to see a true professional at her best.The director, David Lynch, keeps his act together in this relatively straightforward story but it wouldn't have been made quite this oddly by anyone else. I mean, the film opens with a scene of Merrick's mother being run down and trampled by a herd of screaming, stampeding elephants. What the hell does that have to do with the movie? It's never mentioned in the script. It's certainly not Merrick's fantasy. And there's no reason to believe that his mother really WAS frightened by elephants.Although Lynch doesn't use many tricky codes in the movie, he rarely passes up a chance to show us the grimy perineum of Victorian London -- the basement fires being stoked, the black smoke billowing from the chimney, the intricate reticula of a lace curtain stirring in the open window, the slick wet bricks of an industrializing city gone berserk, the iron webbing across Victoria Station's glass roof. Texture piled on texture, and all of it somehow ominous. He does for man's indifferent artifacts what Peter Weir and Nicholas Roeg did for Australia's natural features. He's invested them with dread.It occurred to me while watching this that Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is usually described as drawing the audience into Jimmy Stewart's voyeurism and thus making us as guilty as he is, of snooping into others' lives. What does ""The Elephant Man"" do to ITS audience then? Turn us into gawkers at a carnival freak show? I wonder how many of us went to see this movie when it was released, not so much to watch an enjoyable and well-done film, but to see what all the fuss was about? Lynch takes it easy on the audience in that regard. Merrick is horrifyingly deformed but there are no cheap shocks. Lynch gives us his appearance little by little until, by the time we see him in his awesome ugliness, we've gotten to know him a bit and to empathize with him. And why shouldn't we admire and respect him? We may look better than Merrick, but he'd be hard for any of us to beat in a contest of soul against soul.",The Elephant Man
11,moonspinner55,"Somber, graceful, eloquent--if not always moving",7,16 October 2007,"Filmmaker David Lynch sees the beauty in misfits, whether it be a disfigured saint such as David Merrick in ""The Elephant Man"" or the bizarre carny folk who make up the traveling sideshows, though he shows no interest in plucking our heart-strings over them, or in being emotionally prodding. While this is often a big plus, Lynch's non-sentimental take on Merrick's story keeps the movie grounded when it should soar. True story of a horribly disfigured British man at the turn of the century who is rescued from a freak show by a sympathetic doctor is layered with a dreamy atmosphere but also anchored by serious, intelligent performances by John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins. However, once Merrick is brought out into a curious high society, one feels that the director's dramatic resources have been tapped out, and the last act plays like an afterthought. Certainly this is a fine piece of cinema, adapted by Lynch and others from two books on Merrick; it is graceful and deliberately downbeat (appropriately so), though its technical finesse ultimately presses out the emotion. *** from ****",The Elephant Man
12,Quinoa1984,"An amazing drama, one of the best of its kind",9,14 December 2000,David Lynch brings some great atmosphere in this updated Elephant Man film. It is a drama filled with true compassion that makes you think and draws you in with great cinematography and black and white film.  The story is about a deformed man (John Hurt in his best performance in incredible makeup) who gets some help after years of torture by a doctor (Sir Anthony Hopkins in a early and good performance).  Real emotion is evoked here and it works as it is one of the best Lynch films and the 1980's films.  Biggest surprise- film is produced by Mel Brooks and his Brooksfilms productions.

13,michaelRokeefe,A poignant and empowering biography.,8,12 December 2000,"Director David Lynch presents the criticly acclaimed story of a severely deformed man, John Merrick(John Hurt)AKA 'The Elephant Man'. A caring and sympathetic doctor/surgeon(Anthony Hopkins)takes Merrick from the degrading life of freak shows and integrates him into British high society.

14,sunwarrior13,A David Lynch Masterpiece And Must-See,10,24 October 2012,"The Elephant Man is a drama based on the true story of Joseph Merrick,who is called John Merrick in the film and a severely deformed man in 19th century London. The film was directed by David Lynch and the screenplay was adapted by Lynch, Christopher De Vore, and Eric Bergren from the books namely: The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences by Sir Frederick Treves and The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity by Ashley Montagu. It was shot in black-and-white and it stars John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Michael Elphick, Hannah Gordon, and Freddie Jones co-star to play key supporting roles.It was shot in black-and-white.Treated as a sideshow freak, Merrick is assumed to be retarded as well as misshapen because of his inability to speak coherently. In fact, he is highly intelligent and sensitive, a fact made public when one Dr. Frederick Treves rescues Merrick from a carnival and brings him to a hospital for analysis. Alas, even after being recognized as a man of advanced intellect, Merrick is still treated like a freak; no matter his station in life, he will forever be a prisoner of his own malformed body.You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive orbs earned John Hurt a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his moving portrayal of John Merrick.Lynch's relatively straight second feature finds an admirable synthesis of compassion and restraint in treating its subject, and features outstanding performances by the cast.Added to that,it exposes undercurrents of anguish along with an emotionally accessible tale of Merrick's nobility which is characterized by a Victorian morality play disguised as an elegy to freakishness.Also,it includes includes several benchmarks from Lynch such hissing noises, nightmare sequences, and moments of deadly quiet which makes it is a masterpiece and a must-see.",The Elephant Man
15,Theo Robertson,One Of Us,9,19 March 2017,"Last Thursday I was at a film class at Edinburgh Uni where the subject was the filmography of David Lynch. I'll spare you all the negative details but INLAND EMPIRE was a film so poorly regarded even its title would have made even the most cowardly reactionary in to a rabid anti-imperialist while I described Lynch as ""The windsock director"". Not to be too negative I did add at one point that I liked THE ELEPHANT MAN a lot. So I thought I'd watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered. I was not disappointed by this tribute to the triumph of the human spirit Mawkish ? Manipulative? Yes but also magnificent. I'm always the first person to be fuelled up on outrage when a film based on real life events has to constantly embellish things in order to make a ""better film"" but this film is so hauntingly beautiful on both a narrative and aesthetic level that any and every dramatic airbrushing is justified It's impossible not to feel sorry for the plight of Merrick .One should perhaps feel sorry for the film itself since it- BAFTA wins aside - was rather unrewarded upon its release . 8 Oscar noms but no wins. In 1980 Hopkins was a name actor but almost 40 years later his performance as the humane Treves remains a career highlight. It's impossible of course not to mention the brilliant John Hurt who as in THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT brings a supernatural empathy to his character and manages to convey this character to the audience I should also praise director David Lynch. Pithy , biting remarks in film classes is sometimes justified but one can't fault what Lynch has done here and thankfully he holds back on some of the abstract pretension that often dominates much of his work. He does bookend the film with this type of arty imagery along with the theatre montage sequence but this only adds to the story instead of overwhelming it. His talent seen here is amplified by the cinematography of Freddie Francis It's probably not all that difficult to make this big boy cry but it's not often a film brings tears to my cheeks. This is down to the mind-set I have of ""It's only a movie"" but THE ELEPHANT MAN achieved this which says a lot to its haunting powerful beauty",The Elephant Man
16,Hey_Sweden,"""Touching"" doesn't begin to describe it.",10,13 May 2015,"This wonderful, heartrending drama stands tall as one of the finest hours for filmmaker David Lynch and actors Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. Hopkins stars as Frederick Treves, an eminent surgeon in Victorian era London. While attending a carnival, he becomes aware of the existence of a sideshow attraction, John Merrick (John Hurt). Merricks' face is grotesquely distorted due to a congenital disease, and Treves's heart goes out to the poor man. He tries to give Merrick every comfort he can, and for the first time in Merricks' life, he's treated with respect and caring by people. Of course, there will still be those damnable individuals who merely seek to exploit Merrick for their own selfish reasons.Hopkins is absolutely great, but it's Hurt who commands your attention, and for good reason. He plays Mr. Merrick as a kind, gentle soul, who struggles mightily to maintain some dignity yet has a heartbreaking vulnerability about him. He also does an impressive job of conveying emotion beneath the amazing cranial makeup devised by Christopher Tucker. Hopkins and Hurt are supported by a peerless, mostly British cast, although Anne Bancrofts' role as stage star Mrs. Kendal is really no more than an extended cameo. John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller are particularly fine as the supportive Mr. Carr Gomm and the head nurse Mothershead. And on the other side of the coin, where we see ""humanity"" at its worst, we have solid performances by Freddie Jones as the possessive Mr. Bytes and Michael Elphick as the sleazy night porter.The film is well made in every respect, with Lynch and his crew creating a very rich and powerful period atmosphere. It's beautifully shot in black & white and Panavision by the great Freddie Francis, and receives a lovely music score by John Morris.Long but engrossing, ""The Elephant Man"" earns its emotional responses from the audience in an honest and memorable way.Unrelated to any previous telling of the real-life story or to the Broadway play.10 out of 10.",The Elephant Man

It's easily his most accessible film and along with cinematographer Freddie Francis presents us with a gritty and grimy Victorian England. It was shot in black and white which fits the story perfectly. Hurt is wonderful in the title role. He was buried under tons of makeup but he still manages to convey what he's feeling.

Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft play their roles with engaging sincerity - very ably supported by Sir John Gielgud and Dame Wendy Hiller. Prosthetics aside, John Hurt captures both the despair and optimism of Merrick with empathetic style; and Freddie Jones is just downright evil as ""Bytes"". His son Toby was at the screening and I couldn't help but wonder when he watched this portrayal by his father whether the pride in the performance must have been tempered by a disgust in the character, itself!!

19,Boba_Fett1138,A well constructed movie but not as good and interesting as Joseph Merrick's real life-story.,7,11 February 2006,"""The Elephant Man"" is certainly an above average biographic movie about Joseph ""John"" Merrick, better known as the elephant man. The movie takes lots of liberties and of course over-dramatizes at times. I never have anything against altering a true story, as long as the movie and its storytelling benefits from it. In this case however, the truth was better than the fiction of this movie.As a movie it is well constructed and it's atmospheric. The black & white cinematography makes this movie feel like a 'horror-monster' movie from the '30's and early '40's, like for instance ""Frankenstein"". Through its style it makes us realize and aware of it, that we look same upon John Merrick, as we do on the Frankenstein creature. We're disgust and frightened. At first sight we don't bother and fail to really see the wonderful personality and qualities of the person. In a way it makes us more monsters than Joseph Merrick ever was.It's especially the cinematography and way of storytelling that contributes to the movie its style and quality. Director of photography Freddie Francis is a well known name in the horror business so his style and experience is notable and adds to the good of the atmosphere. If you really didn't knew any better you would really think that the movie was made in the '30's or '40's of the last century. Also the sets and costumes and of course make-up, add to the 'feeling' of the movie.But now the negative aspects of the movie. Main problem for me was that I didn't really got emotionally involved with the movie and its characters. The explanation for this is however simple I think. I personally was already quite familiar with the true story of Joseph Merrick, his life and his condition. So nothing in the movie came as a real surprise to me and I already knew how it would end and most of what happened in between. Still I felt that the character lacked real depth and were perhaps even a bit underdeveloped. For instance we never really get to fully understand what drove Dr. Frederick Treves, or what went on in John Merrick's head (especially in the beginning of the movie.).The movie truly could had been a more powerful one if it had sticked more closely to the truth. For instance the interesting aspect of Merrick being a suspect in the Jack the Ripper case was left entirely out of the movie. If they had put it in the movie it would had been more and better shown how the general public, in that time period, thought and felt about Merrick. It really is a movie filled with some missed opportunities and that is the reason for me why I regard this movie not as a perfect or emotional one. But I'm convinced of it that persons without too much knowledge about the story and appearance of Merrick will find this movie a satisfying and emotional moving one. In that case I would advice you to just ignore this comment and simply go and watch this movie for yourself, because it almost most certainly will be worth your time.It's a good looking, well acted and nicely constructed movie but honestly, if you want to learn about Joseph Merrick's life and condition I still recommend you watch a good documentary about him instead.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Elephant Man
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"A hard movie to watch, but a truly great one as well",9,5 December 2004,"I haven't read or heard anything about the story of Joseph Carey Merrick, aka John Merrick, aka The Elephant Man before seeing this movie, so I can't say if it's accurate or not. However, from everything I've heard, it seems to be as close to the original story as it can get. I hadn't seen any other films by David Lynch when I sat down to watch this, so I was quite excited to see if it really lived up to all the hype surrounding it. It does. The film is excellent and nearly perfect. However, there are small imperfections that pull it just below a perfect rating, but it's very close. The plot is very good, and the way we learn of The Elephant Man is great. The way Lynch builds up suspense for the first few minutes, luring us with the promise of seeing something bizarre. When that promise is not kept, we are only more interested in seeing this, this creature that they speak of. But Lynch drags this even further... in fact, we don't get a good look at The Elephant Man for the first half hour... and even then, it's just in a flash. From there, we slowly see more and more of him, but somehow we never manage to truly get used to him. This is brilliant directing from one of the best directors out there, because obviously he would lose effect should we ever actually get used to his looks. The acting is great. I don't think I found one single character to be poorly performed. However, those that stand out the most are definitely Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. Hopkins is great as the doctor who is amazed at this new phenomenon and is instantly intrigued in the physique of this man. Hurt is astounding as John Merrick, The Elephant Man. He brings such an innocence and purity to his character that we can't help but feel sorry for this man, as he is treated horribly by the majority of those he meet or who see him. I didn't cry during this film, but it was more close than I thought possible. For a film that deals with such a delicate subject, it has no actual sap or sentimentality... only sadness. Pure sadness. Near the ending, there is a powerful scene that shows, in a non-preachy fashion, the point of the film; it is not his looks that make him an animal, if he ever was one... it was the reactions of other men. The ending is beautiful. No other way to put it. Simply beautiful. As for those small imperfections I mentioned... I can't quite put my finger on what it is, specifically, but it just seems like something was missing... maybe I just felt that the film was too sad, maybe it was that the few attempts at lightening the mood fell flat and seemed out of place... maybe I just wasn't prepared for this moving experience. I don't know. I am honestly not sure. But while I found this movie to be great, excellent even, I have to say that there are better films. Not far better, no... but slightly better. There are films where all of the elements come together more perfectly and create a better movie overall. This one is worth watching, though, and should be seen by anyone who feels they would benefit from it on a personal or emotional level. It's a masterpiece. I recommend this movie to anyone mature enough to understand it. Yes. There is no 'definite' group of people that will get more out of this film than any other... except those that are intelligent and mature enough to understand and appreciate it. If you are one of those, and you have not yet seen this movie, go out and get it. You won't regret it. 9/10",The Elephant Man

22,view_and_review,The Evils That Men Do,8,8 January 2020,"Years ago, I saw the movie ""Mask"" about a boy named Rocky Dennis who had a congenital disease that disfigured his face. It was a touching movie and a bit sad. Elephant Man was more touching and sadder.The Elephant Man in this movie was a man named John Merrick (John Hurt). He was a circus attraction for the financial benefit of the proprietor and the morbid curiosity of the paying viewers. That is where Dr. Frederick (Anthony Hopkins) found him and took an instant interest in him. Dr. Frederick took him from the circus to care for him at London Hospital. But, were Dr. Frederick's actions altruistic or just as selfish as the circus proprietor?That's what ate at Dr. Frederick and it is something that has probably plagued everyone of us at some time or another. How many of us fixed our intentions upon doing a noble deed then reaped some worldly benefit from it just to then be conflicted about what we appreciated more from the honorable action. The heart is like that-- it sways to and fro and it takes our wants and desires with it.Naturally, in ""The Elephant Man"" we see unspeakable cruelty from incorrigible profiteers and ignorant jerks. It was something he would never be free from as long as he lived. But we also got to see true love and kindness that warms the heart and restores hope in humanity.",The Elephant Man
23,neil-476,A wonderful film,9,19 March 2011,"Which to consider first, the story or the film? The story is a true one. John Merrick, horrifically disfigured by a rare medical condition, is rescued from circus freakdom and given a secure place to live by surgeon Frederick Treves, where he enjoys some real friendship before his relatively young death.This sad but moving story features some terrific performances. Anne Bancroft's Mrs Kendal is full of grace, Anthony Hopkins' Treves is dignified and compassionate if somewhat dour, but the ace in the pack is John Hurt's Merrick. Hurt himself more or less disappears beneath the prosthetics of Merrick's disfigurements, which makes his performance of quiet gentleness all the more remarkable.More remarkable still is the fact that this film is made by David Lynch. Known at this point for making films which were - how can I say this - off the wall, out of the mainstream, and difficult, it was a revelation to discover that Lynch had it in him to make a film which told a straightforward story as well as this one does.",The Elephant Man
24,evanston_dad,One of Lynch's Most Mainstream Films Is Also One of His Best,10,5 December 2007,"This lacerating film about John Merrick, a man in 19th century England who suffered from a terrible physical deformity and was treated as a circus sideshow by a public who did not understand his condition, proves that David Lynch is as adept at mainstream, linear storytelling as he is at putting miraculous fever dreams on the screen. I experienced ""The Elephant Man"" as something physical; my heart literally ached while watching this profoundly sad yet oddly exhilarating film.People may not think of Lynch as an especially emotional director; his experimental approach at film-making may leave some feeling detached. But the more I see of his films, the more I come to appreciate that all of his films have a strong emotional core to them, so it doesn't surprise me that he would do so well with this story. He films in beautiful black and white, which gives the film an old-fashioned look that feels right for its time period and subject matter, and he makes use of a brilliant musical score. All of the actors are terrific, but especially John Hurt, who is able to act through heaps of prosthetic makeup (the actor himself is completely unrecognizable), to deliver a powerhouse performance. I defy even the most cold-hearted cinephile to watch his final scene and not have to sniffle back at least a tear or two.What a wonderful, wonderful movie.Grade: A+",The Elephant Man
25,HotToastyRag,Great but heavy,7,19 September 2020,"In one of the greatest Oscar travesties, there was no category honoring outstanding makeup until the year after the incredible makeup used on John Hurt in The Elephant Man. They couldn't have added the category in time, could they? I've always found it grossly unfair, a pattern repeated from when they added the category of Special Effects the year after The Good Earth and The Hurricane were released.This incredibly heavy drama was nominated for eight Oscars and didn't take home any gold. When you watch it, you'll scratch your head wondering how that's possible. John Hurt's heartbreaking performance, his dedicated and sensitive doctor, Anthony Hopkins, the beautiful period costumes and thoughtful black-and-white art direction, couldn't have been better. Even Anne Bancroft is wonderful, and she's only onscreen for ten minutes or so. But perhaps it wasn't the right time. Perhaps audiences leaving ten years of the wild 1970s craved a bit of angst before they settled into a historical drama. If you think you can handle this, go out and rent it. You'll be rewarded, but you need to go into it knowing it's upsetting.",The Elephant Man
26,Wuchakk,The ultimate outcast,7,2 July 2020,"In 1884 London, a doctor (Anthony Hopkins) meets Joseph Merrick, aka The Elephant Man (wrongly called John Merrick in the film) who was being exploited as a freak show attraction. Treves (Hopkins) tries to help Merrick (John Hurt) for the last six years of the latter's life wherein he becomes cultured, but he inevitably remains an object of curiosity, to high society as well as low society. Anne Bancroft plays a winsome entertainer who is warm toward Merrick.Directed by David Lynch and shot in B&W, ""The Elephant Man"" (1980) is a melancholic biographical movie, and understandably so, but Merrick's story is worth checking out despite the fact that it inspires pity. It calls into question the concept of beauty: Natural beauty is something one is born with and did nothing to acquire, but so is physical unattractiveness. Then there's inner beauty. The charismatic actress (Bancroft) displays both. Of course there's also inner ugliness, like the carnival huckster.A myth developed about Merrick's disfigurement that his mother was raped by an elephant, probably started by sideshow hawkers. The opening conveys this in an artistic manner, but it's not to be taken literally, which is why it's surreal. Meanwhile the factory scenes with the pipes and corresponding dangers exhibit the reality for workers in Victorian times.The score by John Morris is noteworthy with one piece being ripped-off for the moving parts of ""Platoon"" (1986), e.g. Elias' melodramatic death scene.The film runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot entirely in London and nearby Shepperton Studios, just west of the city.GRADE: B",The Elephant Man
27,The_Void,A heartbreaking expose of society,8,22 December 2004,"Nobody but Lynch could have directed this movie and made it the masterpiece that it is. Where other people would have gone for fake sentimentality and/or gruesome imagery; Lynch just presents the story how it is. The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it's credit. It is, however, utterly repulsive. The black and white cinematography enforces this. There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it's title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be. On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it's title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking. The movie sets itself up for this early on; the scene in which the Elephant Man is introduced is most of the most gut wrenching ever committed to film. As the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) sees the freak rise up and realises the extent of his deformity...a tear slowly form and rolls down his cheek. From this, you can see the pity that he feels for this man who has drawn the lot of a lowly circus freak; just from that one shot of a tear, David Lynch shows us the sorrow and the pity, and that's all he needs. Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that's all it needs, so that's all it gets. And that is the mark of a great director. Something that David Lynch most certainly is.The film is also ironic. Aside from it's visuals that link to the title character, it also observes how society is not unlike a circus. The good doctor has taken the Elephant Man away from the glares and the scowls of the circus audience, the exploitation that he's had to face, and put him a kinder and more loving environment; only now the scowls and stares come not from the circus audience, but from society's upper crust, who want to exploit the Elephant Man themselves for their own selfish reasons - to impress their friends. The Elephant Man is not merely a horror story of the life of a very unfortunate man; it's a story of love, a story of acceptance. Despite being taken from one circus to another, the Elephant Man is happier and more fulfilled than he ever was; he doesn't care about the looks and the exploitation, he merely wants to be loved. By 'normal' people, this is taken for granted; but The Elephant Man shows us that love and acceptance isn't something that can be taken for granted. As one doctor notes in the film, ""we can't imagine the life he's had"". We can't.David Lynch also succeeds in making voyeurs out of his audience. Just like the various audiences in the film; we too want to see the Elephant Man, and yet are utterly repulsed and disgusted by him. With this, David Lynch makes a mockery out of today's society, without ever making a mockery out of the character upon which this film is based. The Elephant Man himself is a perfectly balanced example of how pathos can be achieved. Not only is this man seen as a monster, but his character is pathetic also. With The Elephant Man, Lynch is saying to the world that it is society that is the monster, not the freaks that live within it.To put it simply: David Lynch has taken a story that could have easily been told simply and expanded it to take in themes that are outside of the central premise. This small story of one unfortunate man has been moulded into a striking comment on society. And all in all; it's a masterpiece.",The Elephant Man

29,JamesHitchcock,An inversion of the traditional horror story,9,22 September 2008,"""The Elephant Man"" is based upon the true story of Joseph Merrick (1862-90), although he is referred to as ""John"" in this film. Merrick suffered from hideous facial deformities and as a result was compelled to earn a living in a freak show where, according to the film, he was cruelly ill-treated. The film tells the story of how he was rescued by a surgeon named Frederick Treves and of how he spent the rest of his life living at the London Hospital. He is at first wrongly believed to be mentally as well as physically handicapped, but it is later discovered that he is not only sensitive and intelligent but also well-educated. (John Hurt plays him as a gentle young man, speaking throughout in a cultured voice). He becomes a minor celebrity in late Victorian England, and is befriended by an actress named Mrs Kendal and the Princess of Wales (the future Queen Alexandra).The roles of Merrick and Treves are taken by two of Britain's leading actors, John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. In the case of Hurt, this was undoubtedly his finest film performance. In the case of Hopkins I am not so sure- not because he is bad in this film (indeed, he is very good), but because he has given so many great performances that it would be difficult to single any one of them out as his greatest. (""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""Howard's End"", ""Shadowlands"" and ""Amistad"" are others that come to mind). What stands out about his performance here is the way in which he brings out the conflict in Treves' mind and his uncertainty about his own motives. Ostensibly, the gentlemanly, Christian Treves is motivated by compassion for Merrick's plight. Lurking at the back of his mind, however, is the fear that his compassion may be mixed with a baser motive- the desire for the scientific and academic fame that a study of Merrick's case might bring him.What makes Hurt's performance so extraordinary is that, because of the elaborate make-up he had to wear for the role, he was unable to use facial expression- normally one of an actor's most important tools- in order to convey Merrick's personality and so had to rely on voice and gesture alone. He was deservedly nominated for a ""Best Actor"" Oscar, but lost out to another great performance, Robert de Niro's in ""Raging Bull"". Hurt and Hopkins received great support from the rest of the cast, especially John Gielgud as Treves's older colleague Dr Carr Gomm, Michael Elphick as the hospital porter who tries to exploit Merrick by charging people to see him, Anne Bancroft as Mrs Kendal and Wendy Hillier as the hospital Matron Mrs Mothershead.Few films in the eighties were made in black-and-white, but ""The Elephant Man"" was one of the few exceptions. (""Raging Bull"", of course, was another). Director David Lynch seems to have been aiming for a look based upon the horror films of the thirties. The film can, in fact, be seen as a sort of inversion of the traditional horror story. In many of the classic horror tales of the past- ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"", ""Frankenstein"", ""The Phantom of the Opera""- ugliness and deformity are associated with moral evil. Hyde is evil by nature, whereas the Phantom and Frankenstein's monster become evil because they are rejected or ill-treated by society. Merrick, although he is frequently ill-treated, remains gentle and noble in nature and, as a result, is eventually accepted by society. Lynch has taken the raw material of horror, but has used it not to horrify but to make a film about pity and compassion.The film can therefore be seen as a quasi-religious parable about the ability of good to overcome evil and injustice; those critics who only see it as sentimental are missing its deeper significance. Although it was made by an American director, and is officially classified as a US/UK co-production, ""The Elephant Man"" deserves to be ranked, alongside the likes of ""Gregory's Girl"", Chariots of Fire"", ""Gandhi"" and ""The Missionary"", as one of the great films to come out of the great British cinema revival of the early eighties. 9/10",The Elephant Man
30,MovieAddict2016,"A beautiful, strange, touching, bittersweet and ultimately haunting true story, well-told and respectful of Merrick without ""cheapening"" the tale.",10,29 September 2005,"Few films capture ""true stories"" as well as The Elephant Man. Although there were, of course, certain artistic liberties drawn (as with any film based on actual events), David Lynch respects Joseph Merrick enough not to present him as a monstrous caricature of a man. (You may be wondering why I do not refer to Joseph Merrick as John Merrick...well, his real name was actually Joseph, but was changed for the film as its screenplay was based on correspondence letters between Dr. Frederick Treves and Joseph. For some reason, he altered Joseph's name in the letters to ""John"" at some point in time. No one's sure why.) John/Joseph Merrick had a rare disease called Proteus Disease, a congenital condition. It made him appear hideously deformed and unrecognizable as a man.Of course, in today's age of scientific reasoning, Joseph would have been provided with great care; however, in 19th century Victorian England there was still a heavy reliance upon superstition and, to a certain extent, religious influence upon the public's perception. Because Joseph was so disfigured, everyone figured he was either being punished by God or he was a murderous monster. (In fact, at one time he was a potential suspect in the Jack the Ripper killings in Whitechapel, based simply on his physical appearance. It's actually an interesting theory they proposed - that he had taken out his sexual frustration upon prostitutes who rejected him - but the simple fact remains that no one in Joseph's condition could have ever managed to perform those murders. Still, it's an interesting addition to the legend and John/Joseph can even be seen briefly in the Johnny Depp film ""From Hell,"" which is based upon the Jack the Ripper case.) John Hurt does a truly wonderful job portraying Joseph Merrick. His performance is captivating because it hints at innocence beneath the hideous appearance - proving the age-old saying ""beauty lies on the inside""...it's a touching performance and one of the few that brought me close to tears. For what it's worth, as convincing as the makeup effects are in this film, the real Joseph Merrick was far worse looking. There is actually a picture available on Google Image search; if you take the liberty of looking for it, you may be shocked.The real Joseph Merrick was born in Leicester in 1862 and began showing signs of deformity at age two. He was eventually forced to live with his father, who did not want the child, and sent him out onto the streets to earn money.Because no one would hire him, he decided to star in a carnival attraction as ""The Elephant Man."" When sideshows were outlawed in the UK in 1886 he traveled to Belgium to find work and was mistreated by a showman.In due time gained a friendship with Dr. Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins in the film), a physician at London Hospital. He was finally given proper care and actually ended up drawing the attention of many rich Victorians of the time, including the Queen herself.Joseph died in his sleep in 1890. Because of the size of his head he could not sleep horizontally, but the film proposes he tried to just once in order to imitate normal sleeping patterns of other humans. Others claim he was trying to commit suicide, which I somewhat doubt.In July 2003, a doctor named Charis Eng took samples of Merrick's hair and bone and determined that he had suffered from Proteus syndrome, and not neurofibromatosis, as initially suspected.Of interesting note, although Merrick's skeletal remains are now on display at London Hospital, Michael Jackson reportedly tried to purchase Joseph's remains in 1985 to add to his ""private collection."" The less said about this, the better.David Lynch seems an odd choice to direct this tale for obvious reasons - he is typically associated with the more bizarre, but The Elephant Man is actually quite Lynchian. Its cold, macabre layering provides a nice texture to the film. It's not unabashedly sentimental. It doesn't pull any cheap tricks. Lynch, as usual, keeps a certain distance from the viewer...and for once it pays off in a drama and makes The Elephant Man seem like a sort of macabre tale - which works to the film's advantage because it IS a rather macabre and depressing (if bittersweet) tale.This is my favorite Lynch film that I have seen so far and it's a pity that it isn't more highly regarded by those in the film industry. Although it made a bit of a fuss when it came out in 1980, it seems by today's standards it has drifted into semi-obscurity and its influence speaks more than the film itself.However, I think this should be required viewing for any film lovers. Technically it's beautiful - the black and white compliments the eerie undercurrents and the direction and performances (particularly Hurt and Hopkins) are very good.On another level (as an emotional experience) it doesn't resort to the type of controlling sentimentality that, say, a film such as Forrest Gump might. It is less manipulative, and as a result, far more honest.",The Elephant Man
31,Red-Barracuda,"A heartbreaking and horrible story, beautifully told",9,30 April 2010,"Who could possibly have thought that the young director David Lynch would have made a film like The Elephant Man? The director's only previous feature film was the utterly bizarre Eraserhead. There are similarities or course – the grotesque subject matter, some surreal details and the black and white presentation – but it's the differences that are so incredible. Unlike Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is a character-driven biopic with a clear narrative and powerful emotional core. It has a string of world-class British actors and strong production values. It certainly seems like producer Mel Brooks took an incredibly risky gamble in his choice of director for this project. History has shown, however, that it was a gamble, to Brooks's eternal credit, that paid off handsomely. The young avant-garde director proved himself to be far more than a one-note merchant; he in fact showed that he was an artist of incredible skill, capable of not only astonishing experimental weirdness but also linear story-telling of the highest calibre.Lynch handles the heartbreaking story of the famous 19th century circus freak John Merrick with both delicate care and unflinching disgust. His approach avoids saccharine sentiment in favour of a more genuine emotional approach. Not only does he ask us to pity Merrick and despise those that abuse him but he also actively invites us to look at this appallingly deformed man. So we as an audience are confronted with questions of ourselves, as we too want to see 'the terrible Elephant Man'. Dr Treeves himself wrestles with such demons – is he using Merrick too? As the film develops we share the character's emotional responses to John Merrick from outright disgust to warm affection. There is something of a build up to us actually seeing Merrick; we catch little glimpses and details, until he is revealed in a simple shot that is simultaneously shocking and understated.The acting is universally of the highest standard. John Hurt has been given much deserved praise for his portrayal of the title character but Anthony Hopkins as Dr Treeves is at least as good. Hopkins gives a perfectly pitched performance in a quite complex role that is extremely believable. Visually and aurally the film is beautifully conceived. The black and white photography from Freddie Francis is exquisite and the accompanying hum of machinery not only puts us in the world of the Industrial Revolution but also is a hallmark of Lynch in general. The director does keep his usual eccentric flourishes mainly in check but when he does add surreal imagery – such as the opening elephant attack and Merrick's dream – the imagery is highly original and adds immeasurably to the final whole.The Elephant Man comes highly recommended to everyone who loves cinema. It's one of the most genuinely moving stories ever committed to film by one of the indisputable masters of the medium.",The Elephant Man

This is one of the saddest movies I have ever seen and yet it is so good. My heart goes out to Merrick - he had to endure so much in his life.The Elephant Man is filmed in black and white - which is perfect for the film. The black and white gives the viewer a feeling of being a much older film than it actually is.

33,sddavis63,This Is Perhaps The Most Emotionally Moving Movie Ever Made,10,28 December 2010,"Watching this movie is a powerful emotional experience. In an era in which movies are increasingly appreciated more for their action and special effects than anything else, here we have a simple human drama drawn from real life - the story of John Merrick (whose real name was Joseph), known to late 19th century England as ""The Elephant Man."" As is perfectly normal with this type of movie, the story uses dramatic license in some things. In particular, there's apparently no evidence that Merrick ever met ""Mrs. Kendal"" (played by Ann Bancroft) although she did take quite an interest in his case. Basically, though, this is a reasonably accurate portrayal of Merrick's early life as an attraction in a freak show, and his later life in the London Hospital, his friendship with Dr. Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) and his growing acceptance by London's high society, including the Princess of Wales (played by Helen Ryan.)The movie is moving. One can't help but be saddened by the conditions Merrick (who was played brilliantly and sensitively by John Hurt) had to live in and by the way he was treated by many of those around him. The movie also raises a lot of thought-provoking questions. The nature and role of freak shows is front and centre in the first half or so of this movie. We in the modern world think of such exhibitions as repulsive, and yet in the context of the times they did provide a way for those who were ""different"" and likely to be rejected by society to survive and earn some sort of living. And while the movie depicts Bytes (Freddie Jones) - the operator of the freak show - as an entirely unpleasant character, Tom Norman (the real name of the freak show operator) denied this, and there's some question about how Merrick was treated in the show. There's also the question of his acceptance by high society. Was this acceptance sincere, or was Merrick simply transformed into a somewhat higher class freak show for the satisfaction of the rich and powerful? Probably the answer was a bit of both.The most unsettling scene in the movie is probably that in which the Night Porter at the hospital brings a bunch of his pub friends to get a look at Merrick (after charging them a significant fee to do so) and the hideous way in which he's treated during that encounter. That may have been more dramatic licence (and therefore, because of the response it brings forth, a bit manipulative.) Merrick's ultimate death (he either asphyxiated himself or died of a broken neck while trying to sleep lying down like ""other people - he had to sleep sitting up because of the weight of his head) is extremely sad.This is a first-rate movie. The performances from everyone were superb and the decision by director David Lynch to film this in black and white reminds us that these events were from a different time and seem to re- enforce somehow the emotional power of the movie. Excellent work - a must see movie!",The Elephant Man
34,ElMaruecan82,"The 3 ""S"" that damaged the story: Sentimentalism, Symbolism and Simplification ...",8,15 November 2012,"The shadowy black and white photography communicates all the horror of John Merrick's condition and the darkness of an era where people were incapable to see inner humanity behind a hideous deformity (and it conveniently made the make-up more realistic). John Morris' score, haunting and playful, echoes the seemingly reason-to-be of John Merrick in life: suffering and entertaining. John Hurt powerfully communicates the vibrating despair of a trapped soul and if it wasn't for Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull"", he probably would have deserved the Oscar. And Anthony Hopkins is good as the well meaning, but not without flaws, doctor Treves. There is also something effective in the way Merrick's scariness is asserted, David Lynch waits until almost twenty minutes to reveal his face: we see a woman crying in the Carnival, Treves with that deadpan expression and tears coming through his eyes, the iconic mask exuding mysterious breath noises, the shadowy silhouette while he's exhibited to the Medical assembly, and the whole mystery surrounding his look pinnacles with the genuine horrified reaction of Nora, the nurse, a shrill scream, Merrick's first effect on people. At the end, he escapes from his evil master Bytes (Freddie Jones) and is chased in the train station to end up cornered in the toilets, then he finally screams: ""I'm not an animal! I'm a human being! I'm a man!"" At that point, his character's arc is closed; he went from a horrifying freak to a man who is capable to protest, to proclaim his legitimate right for respect and dignity. This is the true courage of John Merrick, this climactic moment when he confronts, alone, a crowd of so-called civilized people.The entrance of ""The Elephant Man"" is a masterpiece of build-up; the climactic cry is his triumph. Yet the evolution between the two moments isn't as fluid as it should be. He goes from a patient who can barely speak to one who recites the Bible quite fluently. Naturally, it would have been infuriating if the doctors never noticed his intelligence, but the moment when Carr-Gomm (John Gielgud) is disappointed by Merrick's aptitudes is immediately followed by the pivotal recitation. It's like Lynch was in an urge to show Merrick's progress. I personally wouldn't have minded if the film was half-an-hour longer for a more realistic evolution. The psalm recitation is rewarded by an immersion in society, during which Merricks prove to be an extremely lovable character, eager to please and impress. There is a childish pride in the way he exhibits the picture of his mother and Hurt is so compelling that you can even feel in his voice, the guilt of not matching his mother's looks. At that part, you can tell that Merrick is still imprisoned in his own perceptions and can't help but see himself as a freak on a reverse way since the irony of his intelligence is that it makes his condition even more intriguing. As Treves said: ""Pray to God he is an idiot"" But the film unsubtly divides people into two categories: those who see the monster and those who see the angel. Regarding the villains, Lynch had the bad taste to trade realism for a sort of Dickens-like atmosphere, which didn't fit Merrick's existential dilemma. I didn't like the party scene because it was cruel but because it was over the top, with the whole kissing, dancing, and alcohol soaking. Now, wasn't the most disturbing part when the guard showed the mirror to Merrick? Hurt's scream was devastating, but it was covered by the noisy ambiance so we didn't have time to grab the true horror of the situation. That moment alone was enough to make the scene painful to watch, Merrick seeing his own face. And it would have made the ""I'm a man!"" more significant because he would know he didn't look like a man. But he also spoiled the straight-forward realism of the story with exaggeratedly good characters, like Mrs Kendal (Anne Bancroft) who reads ""Romeo and Juliet"" with Merrick and kisses him. Why the rush? Think about it, would she have done that to a 'normal' person? If it was a compassionate kiss, then it's still pity, if it was not, it would have looked more genuine and maybe more sincere if it happened later. If Bancroft was supposed to play a character that would spontaneously kiss a man like Merrick, then she deserved more scenes. It seems like Lynch didn't trust our patience. In a nutshell, it's ""Merrick, the Elephant Man"" before, ""Merrick, the Man"" after, and in-between, he swings back and forth from excessively good or excessively bad people. Maybe it's to highlight Merrick's tragic condition, to be always seen as a monster, no matter what reactions he inspires, there is always pity. Maybe that's the conflict that tortures Treves when he wonders to which extent he's different from Bytes. By the way, I'm not implying that every supporting character was one-dimensional, Wendy Hiller was terrific as Mrs Mothershead and the funny way she hit the guard on the head. And I thought the standing ovation in the theater damaged the powerful effect of the ""I'm a man!"" The same defensive (but courageous) mindset should have made him say something like ""I want to enjoy the show, what have I ever done to deserve your applause, please stop it."" After all, no one deserves praise for suffering, or should be considered as a hero because of a handicap. Just give him a break, and this applies to Lynch himself, who thought he could get all mystic about Merrick, with the first vision of a woman trampled (or raped) by an elephant or the ending with all the stars and symbolism. He was so restrained in the directing that the whole surrealistic undertones were totally unnecessary.",The Elephant Man
35,ThomasDrufke,"""I am a human being!""",8,28 July 2014,"In what may be the ultimate Hollywood film about dignity and triumph over all evil, David Lynch directs the story of a disfigured man who gets brutally tortured and sold for laughs. It is truly hard to believe this is partially based on a true story. But even in a story that seems to be far from a human tale, it's the closest thing to showing all of us how good people do exist.I hadn't seen any of Lynch's previously work so I had only heard of his greatness. But I wasn't overly impressed with his style. I found too many scenes to be cut away far too soon. This story has several moments of great emotional impact, but when the scenes are cut to a different area it loses the gravitas. But Lynch did bring the most out of the actors involved and the devastating script. Some of the villains I found to be a bit too one note though, which wasn't a deal breaker, just more or less annoying.Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt worked well together and overall will be what I remember this movie for. Well and of course the famous scene under the train station when John yells the line ""I am not an animal, I AM A HUMAN BEING!"". There aren't many movies that made me think more than The Elephant Man, even if I didn't feel the emotional weight that I had wanted to.+Legendary performances +Stunning makeup work +More relatable than you may think +Good always triumphs -Wanted more emotional gravitas -Too many scenes cut away too soon 8.3/10",The Elephant Man

37,g-bodyl,Keep The Tissues Handy!,9,2 July 2014,"The Elephant Man is truly a moving story that is earnest and throughout the film, it makes the point that humans are not animals, no matter the dysfunctions or handicaps. In the case of John Merrick, he is revolting to look at because of an terrible accident, but he makes clear to all the people wanting to use him or gape at him, he is a human just like the rest of them. No matter who you are, it will be impossible not to cry at some point. That's how emotionally-affecting this film is.Directed by David Lynch, this is one of his more conventional films, but the subject matter is still very intense. This film is about a surgeon at a London hospital named Frederick Treves who discovers a ""freak"" named John Merrick and he rescues Merrick from a freakshow, thus allowing Merrick to live at the hospital and have a life of his own.The acting is excellent. John Hurt delivers a stirring performance as Merrick. I was not able to recognize underneath all that makeup, but he delivers a tour de force performance. Anthony Hopkins also does a really good job as the first man to have truly shown Merrick kindness.Overall, The Elephant Man is a film that believe that all people should be treated equally, no matter what he or she looks like. From a technical standpoint, this film is excellent. I liked how it was filmed in black and white because it captures the essence of the Victorian era. A really emotional film and while it's really sad, there are glimmers of hope here shown by Merrick. This is very fine filmmaking. I rate this film 9/10.",The Elephant Man

What really was shocking was when he got kidnapped and was brought back to the circus again. Then of course, the most shocking part of the movie was when the gang with their women just tormented him by making fun of him and lying to him that they weren't gonna hurt him in which they were very much. I felt I just wanted to kick the hell out of Bytes gang and treat them on what they did to Merrick.

40,ironhorse_iv,Let's talk about the Elephant Man in the room,9,21 February 2013,"'I'm not a animal, I'm a human being!' screams out John Merrick surrounded by a crowd looking at his face at the train station. One of the most powerful lines in movie history was born and it's just heartbreaking to watch. The onlookers, so stifled by the conformity of their Victorian age, gather around in their top hats and well trimmed mustaches for a rare glimpse of ""abnormality"" that evaded the circus, the hospital and the madhouse. The prudish judges of normality are still everywhere even today, judging by and how some people still look down on deformities. John Merrick was human, and not only that a truly great intelligent man. The movie starts out with London surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) discovers John Merrick (John Hurt) in at freak show where he is managed by a brutal man by the name of Bytes. Frederick Treves tries to help the man, with not only his condition, but also to escape from the exploitations of Bytes. On the way, Merrick is both love and look upon by the public. Merrick is so deformed to the point that he must wear a hood and cap when in public due to Merrick's most life-threatening deformity, his abnormally large skull, which compels him to sleep with his head resting upon his knees, as the weight of his skull would asphyxiate him if he were to ever lie down. John Merrick tries everything to try to be normal. He talks in a sophisticated and articulate matter, he appears at operas, does art, reads, makes model and every looking for true happiness. Directed by one of the greatest directors, David Lynch, the movie works in every level. The black and white gives the film, its serious tone, while also giving the film, it's creepiest. The dream like scenes are chilling reminds me of his work on 'Eraserhead'. As clichéd as it might sound, about an hour into the movie, I didn't even really notice Joseph's deformities. At first, I was somewhat intimidated, but after a while, I focused more on who he was as a person and David Lynch makes you see him more like a human being by giving him depth. It would have been an astonishing act if the writers decided to show the true reaction of complete submission and self degradation of the Elephant-Man. I think David Lynch could have easily directed this alternative twist as well. The music of the film is ground-breaking. Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber or Andre Previn gives the movie, its tragedy ending, while the theme song composed by John Morris gives the film, it's haunting score. The Victorian sets are has never looked so convincing on screen, yet with that nightmarish quality that defines most of the movie. Anthony Hopkin are well-acted, but I have to give it to John Hurt, You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive eyes does a masterful job in creating a sympathetic character out of a man who is at first glance a monster. I think ""Elephant Man"" not getting an award lead to the creation of the annual award for best makeup. Prior, makeup awards were given rarely, I believe. Just on special occasions. But when ""Elephant Man"" didn't get any nods for it, people rightfully complained and the academy then created the annual makeup award the next year. Still, the movie has it faults, first off John Merrick is really Joseph Merrick in real life. Dr. Treves' reminiscences mistakenly names Joseph Merrick as John Merrick, an error widely recirculated by biographers of Merrick. The film was based on Treves memoirs, and in them he crosses out ''Joseph'' and writes in ''John'' above - hence the confusion. No one knows the reason for the ''deliberate mistake'', because everyone knew Joseph was called Joseph, plus its written on his birth certificate,and he signed his only surviving letter ''Joseph Merrick'. There are many things that did not actually happen in the movie. Such as the beatings from Tom Norman AKA Bytes who treated Joseph Merrick with great care and respect in reality. Why would they beat him if they are making a lot of money off of him? We are also to believe that Joseph's mother never did love him in the film, in true, he was rejected by his father and stepmother, not his mother. John suffered from a rare, degenerative and progressive disease (Proteus Syndrome, I believe), and Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was ""stripped naked, and felt like an animal in a cattle market' by Treves. So there is a lot of information that is left out. Period films are hard to pull off convincingly and here we are plunged into this utterly alien world but the story is never depressing nor preachy. Still poignant , deep,﻿perfect illustration of human flaws and human kindness. Such a gentle soul filled with deep inner beauty and not a mean bone in his body despite all of the painful horrors inflicted on him by a so called civilized society. There is a lesson to be learned about the dignity this one of a kind man maintained in a world that judged him on the texture of his outward appearance such so that he went through life with his head held up high even when he was sleeping. Bless you Joseph Merrick your inner beauty trumped all.",The Elephant Man

Monochrome cinematography and chiarascuro lighting throw harsh shadows into every part of the frame, constantly reminding the viewer of the dark and unknown. John Merrick is a mystery, shown first as an anonymous silhouette and revealed only in small doses.

43,Dr_Coulardeau,Joseph Merrick was more complex but this film is a masterpiece,10,19 July 2015,"This film is a masterpiece for various and very simple reasons.First it is a real case, a real man, a real disease. The man is Joseph Merrick (called John Merrick in the film) and he was taken care of at the end of his life by the Royal London Hospital and this particular doctor Frederick Treves. His bones have been studied recently and the disease has been identified, including the cause of his death, asphyxiation.Second it reveals two dimensions of Victorian society. The exploitation of horrible facts and beings, what they call freaks, that can inspire horror in the public. Exploitation in carnivals and funfairs, but also exploitation in everyday society in both cases by some greedy people who make money on these ""freaks."" In reality Joseph Merrick was exploiting the public for his own survival because he was willing to do it to make the money he needed to take care of himself. The second dimension is the benevolence and empathy of this Victorian society, I mean here the doctors and medical personnel on one hand and the ""good"" society on the other hand to show they are ""good,"" for most of them, but for a few to prove to themselves they are human, humane, and for many of these few good Christians (the religious aspect that the film misses completely). Third it also reveals that the medical personnel was ready to get out of their way to help a fellow human being who was in a state of suffering that deserved some help, and in this case we are beyond plain suffering and beyond any kind of cure and even help. Let's say then some alleviating support. It is true too that the doctors might have done it for the advancement of their own career, but that's part of the game, isn't it?The film cheats on some details. How could Joseph Merrick have learned Shakespeare or the Bible if he had been the ""possession"" of his carnival master? How could Joseph Merrick have carried on himself the portrait of his mother if he had been the possession of his carnival master? How did Jospeh Merrick get into that position of being a show animal in carnivals (which he was not in real life since he made it a career)? Finally the escape to Belgium, or the abduction to Belgium, and then the return to England shows clearly he was considered as a fellow ""artist"" by the other carnival attractions, but it forgets to mention the fact that his employer abandoned him in Belgium after robbing his fifty pounds, a real fortune at the time, that he had accumulated in time.But the film remains a masterpiece of empathy and humane social thinking with the extraordinary case of the London stage actress who finds the power and courage to dedicate a show to Joseph Merrick in extremely valorizing circumstances, valorizing for Joseph Merrick, and so much so that he will decide to go to sleep like any normal person though he knew he would not wake up on the following morning.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Elephant Man
44,poe426,Quintessential Lynch...,10,22 April 2015,"FREAKS was the undoing of director Tod Browning; it touched a nerve, let's say. THE ELEPHANT MAN, not unlike FREAKS, touches a nerve or two, as well. And it's quintessential David Lynch. I was already a fan by the time THE ELEPHANT MAN saw release: I'd seen ERASERHEAD at several Midnight showings and had hunted down and seen on a college campus two of his shorts, THE ALPHABET and THE GRANDMOTHER. Going in, I was pretty sure I knew what to expect. I was wrong. Eschewing the surrealistic touches that made his previous endeavors so quintessentially quirky, he opted this time around to tell a straightforward tale of the Human Heart. ""Abominable things, these machines,"" Hopkins as Treves says when first we meet him, treating a burn victim: ""You can't reason with them."" In ERASERHEAD, the dark, industrial landscape through which Jack Nance as Henry moves is every bit as uncompromising as the Industrial England of Merrick's time. This integration of the Industrial with the Human would continue full blown in DUNE and, to a much lesser degree, in TWIN PEAKS- which boasted an ""industrial soundtrack."" David Cronenberg pioneered Biological Horror; Lynch, a type of Twisted Industrial Surrealism. (I wanted to see a Bernie Wrightson black and white comic book adaptation of THE ELEPHANT MAN, but, alas, 'twas not to be.)

47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Fascinating story exploring humanity through a rare example,10,6 September 2009,"""Looks are deceiving"" would be an adequate way to describe the ""The Elephant Man"" as a film from the outside, but it would be a horribly amateur way to describe its message. David Lynch's film soars beyond mere pity for those with life-altering physical abnormalities and serves as more than just a slap on the wrist to a generally unsympathetic public. It is a study of the human condition and Lynch's camera a microscope examining one of its most fragile examples.Taking place in Victorian London and filmed like a classic '30s or '40s film in black and white, ""The Elephant Man"" carries that classic naive sensibility that combined with the hideous deformities of its central character, creates a bit of horror and suspense before it appeals to our better nature by eliciting sympathy and understanding.John Merrick (John Hurt) is ""The Elephant Man"" to the abusive owner exploiting him in a freak show, but when Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a doctor studying anatomy, finds him and sees him for the first time, a tear runs down Hopkins' face in a powerful close-up and the doctor brings him to hospital, nursing him to health and soon socializing him.It's a fascinating story. For the first half hour we're hooked by sheer curiosity over what John looks like and how he came to be, a technique that catches one of our most unflattering flaws in that we gape at the unknown and the abnormal. It then shows us more and more of John, slowly unveiling his humanity, and suddenly we're converted and incredibly protective of this unusual character.The film provides an array of human reactions to seeing/meeting someone so terribly disfigured. Treves' wife, for example, cries uncontrollably out of pity, a famous actress treats him like a fascinating human being, a nurse screams at the sight of him and sadly many exploit him. This broad spectrum fully puts you in John's shoes and leaves you with incredible insight into his unique situation.As a filmmaker, Lynch leads us quite easily to our own discoveries about what John's story teaches us. He nudges us toward symbolism without beating us with it and cuts away from scenes just as we react to them instead of giving moments of pause and total resolution. This creates a totally different reaction to what happens in a scene. It's raw, unresolved, maybe even troubling -- but it works and we manage to understand the significance better because he pulls us away at a moment of tension.There are some abstract techniques and shots bookending the film in short scenes with John's mother, but little else is cryptic. Lynch really draws out the similarities and differences between John as an uncared for circus attraction and John as the fascinating man everyone wants to meet, which is the heart of both our and Treves' moral dilemma. Then, as John runs away from a mob at a London train station, we get that simple but powerful line: ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a man!"" and suddenly it all clicks. Now that's fantastic film-making. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",The Elephant Man

49,Vartiainen,Beautiful and thought-provoking film,5,16 December 2012,"David Lynch has a talent of holding up a mirror. The audience is allowed or even forced to confront its own flaws, its numerous shortcomings. Yet the undertone is more often than not the one of hope, that we still have the chance to learn. Some could even claim that in some respect this film is educational. It certainly has a moral lesson. That pity rarely is the right answer, as it is nothing more than the grudging nod of a supposedly superior being towards a lesser man. Rather we should learn to respect and accepts others as equals, worthy of our time and their own individuality. It is a difficult lesson to teach without preaching or pointing fingers, but I rather think that this film accomplishes just that and it accomplishes it with beauty and grace.The brilliance of using a character like John Merrick, played by John Hurt, is that he's such a shocking figure. And the movie plays with our expectations and our ingrained need to gawk and whisper. Our glimpses of Merrick are controlled and shrouded for a long time and when we finally see him it's such a sterile experience that we're forced to ask ourselves what all the fuss was about. And right after that Merrick starts to grow as a character and I honestly felt rather awful later on when I realized that I had immediately dismissed this man and his nature just because I had been so interested in how they had managed to make him look. It's a skillful trap and one that many will fall into, which helps to teach you the lesson.Though speaking of Merrick's appearance, I must commend the makeup department, as he really looks hideous. There's an immediate reaction of repulsion when you first lay eyes on him, even though the shot itself is such a sterile one. And that repulsion is of course the fact why the need to respect this man needs even to be taught. You absolutely wouldn't expect such a kind soul from a body like that, but as always, you cannot judge book by its covers. In this case ugliness only goes skin deep and in time I learned to greatly respect and even admire Merrick's character and his willingness to endure.A film with just Merrick in it would hardly be adequate, however. Thus I am glad that they managed to get someone like Anthony Hopkins to play the part of Frederick Treves as he is an important audience-surrogate. We feel and process our emotions provoked by this film by watching and learning from his reactions. The initial sick wonderment, the horror of realization, the misguided pity, the shame, the willingness to know better and the eventual respect. It is a staggering amount of emotions and subtle nuances to express, but Hopkins manages it with ease and aside from Merrick, his role is easily the most captivating in the entire film.I would however slightly criticize just how saint-like Merrick has been made in this film. In some ways it works for the film's favour as the lesson gets taught much better when the contrast is as clear as possible without being naive. But the real-life John Merrick - yes, this is based on real people and events - was by all accounts a man, he had his flaws. Not numerous, but flaws nonetheless. Merrick's only real flaw in this film would seem to be his inability to stand up for himself, which makes him more rounded and more identifiable - plus it helps with the pity - but it's still a minor issue, at least for me. Treves is also given a much nicer role to play in Merrick's life, while his initial ""handler"" is greatly vilified, but I can recognize that the film works much better this way rather than if the real-life events had been perfectly replicated.On the technical side of things, this is a remarkably well-made film. The shots and settings have themes and ideas behind them, they're not just random shots of hospitals and the streets of London. The black and white aesthetic also works really well with the Victorian setting, plus I bet that it helps to disguise the rubbery texture of Merrick's face. The music and the pacing also work rather well, but it's the visual side where this film really shines, aside from the story of course.I admire this film. It doesn't feel like it's trying to force you to some conclusion or another. In retrospect you can of course see that you were guided, but it felt natural and I was allowed to draw my own conclusion. I had to gaze into my own person, my own soul, and allowed to decide whether or not I liked what I saw or not. And that's the strength of this film. It wants you to better yourselves, to show you that you still have some ways to go and that the society of today is not without any flaws. It's a beautiful film.",The Elephant Man

His works are a true classic. When the cruel Mr. Bytes(Freddie Jones) claims him back, everyone in the carnival, turned on him and helped Merrick back into society. It was a very strong point where John lashed out at the crowd saying, ""I am not a monster! I am not an animal!"" ""I am a human being!"" He proved his point down outright!

51,billcr12,Hurt is perfect,9,10 April 2012,"John Hurt gives one of the greatest performances ever captured on film as John Merrick in The Elephant Man. David Lynch is very hands off as director and allows Mr. Hurt to portray the tortured soul with such deep emotion and grace. Merrick is abused by a freak show handler named Bytes, a man without a soul who treats his subject like an animal. A Dr. Treves(Anthony Hopkins) sees him at the show and takes him to London Hospital for medical study. The deformities are so horrific that Merrick wears a mask in order to appear in public and the doctors who at first believed that he also suffered from mental defects are astounded to hear him reciting the 23rd psalm. While at the hospital, he reads and proves to be a talented artist, drawing sketches and even building a beautiful replica of a church. He eventually becomes so well known that Queen Victoria is told of his plight and arranges permanent care for Merrick at the hospital. His caretakers take him to an opera house to attend a musical and when he is introduced to the audience, they give him a standing ovation. He finally, for the first time in his life, has a brief moment of happiness. Lynch uses black and white to create a mood which sets the right tone and The Elephant Man is his best work.",The Elephant Man
52,ackstasis,"Flawlessly acted and directed, but just falls short of perfection",10,20 December 2006,"Rarely has a film touched me so deeply, and kept me simply mesmerised for the entire running time. I found myself simply unable to drag my eyes from the screen, but I wouldn't want to, anyway. The character of John Merrick (based on the real-life ""Elephant Man"" Joseph Carey Merrick), whilst initially repulsive to the eye, has an aura of beauty about him. The sheer courage of this man - in the face of unimaginable discrimination and adversity - left me in constant awe, and the moment when the hideous ""imbecile"" is revealed to be an intelligent and sensitive being is truly a memorable moment.The acting is simply superb. Anthony Hopkins, who would rise to fame a decade later in the chilling 'The Silence of the Lambs,' is brilliant as Frederick Treves, a doctor who initially exploits Merrick's condition to advance his career, but inevitably falls in love with the man. Likewise, John Hurt is so perfect as John ""The Elephant Man"" Merrick that I feel I don't even need to express how good he was! The famous scene in which Merrick, unfairly cornered at a train station by a mob of angry men, desperately cries ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!"" is one of the great moments in cinema.I would consider this film to be absolutely perfect, but for the very end. As Merrick lays himself down on the bed, determined to sleep and die as a normal man, I would have been blissfully content with a brief pan to his mother's photograph, a pause of several seconds and a soft fade into black. However, we instead have the stars in the sky flying past the camera and, as I interpreted it, the spirit of Merrick's beautiful mother offering him comfort in his final moments. Perhaps I am missing the significance of this final scene, but I simply felt it was unnecessary.We shouldn't let this minor nitpick detract too much from the brilliance of the film. Afterall, it is not often that I am so completely captivated by a film. Not since 'Apocalypse Now' (a completely different film, I realise) have I been left in such awe as the credits begin to roll. Of course, considerable credit should be given to David Lynch. 'The Elephant Man,' his second film, is my first exploration into the films of Lynch, and it certainly will not be the last!",The Elephant Man
53,mjneu59,"a heartbreaking story, brilliantly told",9,15 November 2010,"The story of John Merrick, crippled from birth by a hideous deformity that left him a carnival side-show attraction for most of his life, would seem a natural choice of subject for director David Lynch's first commercial feature following the cult success of 'Eraserhead'. But it's doubtful many people would have anticipated the rare maturity he exhibits here, a combination of forthright compassion with an admirable sense of understatement. Lynch presents Merrick as the ugliest duckling ever, cultured and polite beneath his grotesque appearance, but resigned to a life of misery before his rescue from the freak show by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) and his eventual introduction to London society. The true story may not have been so poignant, but this is still a striking film, with its empathetic cast, evocative music score, atypical editing scheme, and magnificent black and white photography (courtesy of old pro Freddie Francis), capturing all the soot and steam of England's Industrial Revolution.",The Elephant Man
54,FilmCriticLalitRao,The Elephant Man: A David Lynch film about the eternal triumph of inner beauty.,8,28 January 2009,"It can rightly be said about ""The Elephant Man"" that all those viewers who did not get a chance to see this film in 1980 when it was released will surely have troubles trying to ascertain its sense of purpose if they decide to watch it in the present era.This because these days it is difficult rather impossible to find even a single film which has attempted to portray the difficult life of a man who was mocked by all and sundry solely due to an inexplicable deformity of his face.By making this film,American director David Lynch has hinted at the concept of inner beauty which counts more than anything else.This is the reason why the high society of ancient times wanted to be in the company of ""The Elephant Man"" as he appeared to them as an absolutely normal person who revealed more of his inner thoughts in order to lead a normal life.The Elephant Man is not an entertainment film if a viewer is able to read between the lines.It is a more of a social document about hideous old times which were truly horrible in which a human being had no qualms about making mockery of another human being for commercial,monetary gains.It was a tough time for mankind as people were always curious to know more about phenomenon beyond their control thereby wallowing in morbid curiosity à la high society.The Elephant Man is a hard to categorize film which needs to be seen more than once to explore its hidden meanings and motivations.",The Elephant Man
55,GiraffeDoor,"You have to see this. Even if you hate Lynch's other stuff, just do.",8,18 February 2019,"I adore this movie.From it's first scene I was captivated. I wish more movies would start with an abstract sequence. I rewatched that scene twice when I was done. It was hypnotic, delicate yet quite terrifying in a unique way.It doesn't disappoint when the movie begins properly. The stark black and white cinematography paint a vivid picture of industrial pictorial London. It feels like a fantasy but that's the charm. I think they did use Ultra high frequency so it's TECHNICALLY in colour, just the only colours black, white and grey. The effect is a crystal clear picture of a world that swings between immovably clinical and sordid.There is a fairy tail feel as Joseph is rescued from his cruel owner (not historically accurate, the freak show owner was a friend to Joseph, but who cares), built not from magic but a story of victim of a cruel nature finding tenderness.It would be so easy to make a story that felt exploitative, or trite or both with this premise but the handling is delicate enough to appeal to cynical pretentious teens (like I was) and find a real pathos, never quite losing its dark power.Perhaps I'm a little biased by the make up. It is endlessly fascinating to watch John Hurt in make up and listen to him speak in that magically refined yet impedimented voice. I thought the movie would just be unsettling and I was indeed quite terrified of the build up to seeing Joseph. The essence of it though is a dignified message of enduring humanity in a dark world that never gets mawkish thanks to a feather touch that rises only at just the right moment.It was the first movie to make me cry (excluding the Never ending story but I was pretty little then). It really is a beautiful experience, not surrealist exactly, but stylized in way we don't often see. It makes me wonder what other marvels Lynch could have given us if only he had been on a short leash all his career.",The Elephant Man
56,jimbo-53-186511,"Good film, but not without flaws",7,11 April 2013,"The subject of the Elephant Man has always been something that has interested me, and spotting the Elephant Man on TV recently I decided to record it. Physical deformities aside, I knew very little about John Merrick and thought it would enlighten me and help me to understand more about him. Whilst I learnt a lot about John Merrick, I couldn't help being a little disappointed by the film. Before I go into the minor negatives of the film, I will talk through the positive aspects of 'The Elephant Man'First and foremost is the acting and John Hurt (who is unrecognisable) as The Elephant was exceptional. Although he didn't speak for pretty much the first half of the film, we feel his pain at the beginning and start to warm towards The Elephant Man later in the film when we discover an articulate and gentle 'human being' and this is a testament to Hurt's acting as he makes us 'feel for' and 'relate' to the 'Elephant Man' and also feel sympathy for him. Anthony Hopkins also puts in a good performance - although it is far from his best performance in my opinion (I felt he was much better in Silence of the Lambs and more recently in Fracture). Michael Elphick also stars in a supporting role as a night porter who taunts Merrick and ends up humiliating him by charging people to see 'The Elephant Man'. Freddie Jones also stars as the evil 'Bytes' who parades Merrick around as a freak taking him on circus tours and profiting from Merrick's misery.The other impressive aspect is the story itself which is both heart wrenching (particularly in the beginning) where everyone shuns Merrick deeming him 'a freak' and an imbecile - even Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) initially calls him an 'imbecile' to the uplifting - Merrick eventually wins people over when they come to realise that he is an articulate, gentle man (although he is ugly on the outside he is pure and wholesome on the inside) and has been treated with intolerable cruelty.All of the above aspects made this film great, but there are a few aspects of the film that I didn't like i.e the implausibilities in the story - like how Merrick's room isn't guarded at the hospital making it easy for Bytes to kidnap Merrick (which also allowed the Night Porter to allow all his 'friends' to see the Elephant Man and taunt and mock him after taking money from them for the privilege of seeing him. Aside from the above gripes this is still an excellent film and if you look beyond the minor flaws you've got yourself a beautiful story with some wonderful acting and a central character who you'll really end up warming to.",The Elephant Man
57,kluseba,Timeless messages of the human condition,8,12 June 2020,"The Elephant Man is a melodrama that convinces with stunning make-up, monochrome images and splendid acting performances. It's inspired by the true story of Joseph Merrick whose body was terribly deformed by a combination of different diseases that remain uncertain until today. Ridiculed, exploited and abused by a circus owner named Bytes, the young man is studied by an ambitious doctor named Treves who initially only wants to impress his colleagues. Soon enough, the doctor discovers a wonderful human being behind the scary appearance and helps him find a home and integrate him into society. However, Joseph Merrick continues to face ridicule by a greedy night porter, is confronted by the vile circus owner and struggles to accept that there doesn't seem to be a cure for him.This movie certainly makes you think about humanity. It proves once more that you can't judge a book by its cover. The Elephant Man is the most humane character in the entire movie. On the other side, the sensationalism, prejudice and bullying he faced back in the nineteenth century still hasn't changed in our society. The character trait that human beings tend to ridicule others in order to make themselves feel better is a horror you can still witness on the news every single day.The make-up still looks haunting nowadays and has aged surprisingly well over the past four decades. The fact that the movie doesn't use any special effects makes it look very realistic. The monochrome images provide a gloomy atmosphere that is equally ancient and timeless. The acting performances are particularly strong and especially John Hurt truly became one with his character. The film features some surreal dream sequences that prove that experimental mastermind David Lynch directed this movie. The timeless soundtrack enhances the emotional story splendidly.On the negative side, the film has a few lengths and takes some time to unfold. The idea to reveal the entire appearance of the main character very early in the movie prevents the film from building anticipation. While the movie is of great emotional value, it's missing some intellectual challenge as the story is easily predictable.If you are interested in the human condition and like dramas with moving messages, you should certainly watch The Elephant Man. The professionalism, detail and dedication put into this project by make-up artists, cameramen and actors is still astonishing. This is a movie worth to be taught in school to prevent bullying.",The Elephant Man

Very generic stuff. We are supposed to feel sad for him and, of course, we do feel sad for him, but there are thousands of worse scenarios in real life, just look at the schools alone. As a person who has experienced a lot of bulling in my life and seen other people getting bullied, this movie is very weak in comparision.

John Hurt, though virtually unrecognisable, is simply amazing as the intelligent, warm-hearted and gifted man trapped in a physically horrendous body.

62,ShootingShark,He's The Greatest Freak In The World,8,29 July 2007,"Frederick Treves is a doctor in Victorian London who comes across a horribly disfigured man called John Merrick in a freakshow. Sympathy and medical interest lead him to take Merrick to hospital and try to rehabilitate him into society. His efforts succeed to some degree, but he is uncertain as to the righteousness of his actions.This is the movie by which to judge how vain you are. It's exceptionally well directed by Lynch and beautifully photographed by Freddie Francis, an unlikely but somehow perfect union of rookie thirty-something Montana geek art-graduate and veteran sixty-something London old-School cameraman, who somehow fused their skills to produce one of the very best depictions of Dickensian times in glorious black-and-white. The movie's theme is that of a debauched society struggling to pull itself out of the muck - if Treves can overcome ignorance and prejudice and make people accept Merrick as a person (and to some extent he does) then there is hope for the future. Lynch and Francis succeed on every level; the pathos rings true, the backdrop pulsates with life and the images are captivating. My reaction to Merrick is four-fold; for the first half-hour I want to see him and am teased with glimpses, for the next I gape slack-jawed at his deformity, for the next I begin to identify and empathise with him, and for the last I have all but forgotten my prejudice. This is the genius of the film, fired by the superb performances, with Hopkins at his subtlest and best, Hurt messianically emoting (his last words echo Christ) beneath impossible makeup, and Jones, Elphick and Hiller all particularly strong. The prosthetic look of Merrick by Christopher Tucker is unforgettable, and John Morris' spine-tingling, spiralling, tubular-bell score is a perfect finishing touch. A rare and richly-deserved commercial and critical success (despite being nominated for eight Oscars and winning none), based on the real-life story of Joseph Merrick, who suffered from Proteus Syndrome, a congenital chronic growth of skin, bone and fat tissue. It grabs you from the first scene and never lets you go, forcing you to confront your true feelings. Brilliantly scripted by Christopher DeVore, Eric Bergren and Lynch, with exteriors shot in and around central London, notably Southwark and Broadgate. This is one of a handful of brilliant independent eighties films financed by Mel Brooks - see also My Favourite Year, Frances and The Fly.

64,truemythmedia,Accessible Lynch,10,21 August 2019,"The main things that makes this film work so well is its theme and the way that Lynch, as a director, communicates that theme, not just verbally, but visually. The film loosely tells the story of a real man's, Joseph Merrick's, life. Luckily, Lynch understands, as do the best directors, that making a film is not about telling the facts. It is about communicating ideas and thoughts. As such, he does not confine himself to actual events, opting instead to try and communicate his own feelings about this man's life as he reacted to it.Merrick, the 'elephant man,' played by John Hurt (1984), begins the film already in a cage. He is a circus side show, only for the especially brave. His appearance remains unseen to the audience but it is so ghastly that the carnival owner treats him simply as a beast and he behaves as one. A surgeon, played by Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), buys the elephant man from the carnival owner and sets out to rehabilitate him, once he realizes that there truly is a man beneath that mass of malformed flesh.It seems the stage is set for a miracle to occur. A little love and kindness, and the most deformed and hurting among us turn from monsters into men. At least, that is how most Hollywood films would go.This is where Lynch's brilliance shines. He never lets us forget that John is a human being, but that very very few other people see him that way. As Merrick learns to dress, speak, and converse properly in society, there remains no cure for his deformity and so he simply becomes the subject of another sort of disgusting carnival show, this time playing at high society but never really belonging.Lynch is the perfect director for a task such as this. His eye hones in on all of the ways that society, the surgeon, and the carnival owner all behave like animals toward Merrick. He sees the malformed human heart and holds it out for us all to see and examine. In the end we see that the film is not about transforming a near animal into a man, but about all of the ways that we, who have no outer scar, are deeply flawed within.",The Elephant Man
65,davidmvining,Society's inability to accept,7,10 May 2021,"David Lynch's second film is held up as one of his best, but I think it's hampered a bit in a couple of spots that keeps it from greatness. There are wonderful performances from an incredible cast throughout, the production is amazing to simply look at, and the makeup effects are great, but there are also some dramatic moments introduced that feel wrong to me and the use of industrialization as a motif feels out of place where, in Eraserhead, they had felt incredibly appropriate.The story of the historical elephant man, Joseph Merrick (whom they call John, probably because of the source text written by...the man who treated him in the hospital) and his time in the London Hospital under the care of the doctor Frederick Treves, The Elephant Man is about a man who can only ever be an outsider trying to find his place in society. Hobbled by deformities across his entire body, most grotesquely on his head and face, Merrick can never be seen by society as large as any more than a freak.When Treves discovers Merrick, Merrick is a sideshow attraction under the management (perhaps ownership) of Mr. Bytes , a brutal drunk who's been struggling to maintain his existence because Merrick is so deformed as to upset local authorities. Taken into a dirty back alley, Treves sees Merrick for the first time with Mr. Bytes giving his traditional introduction that includes the fable that Merrick's mother was attacked by elephants while carrying him, which, he assures the audience of one, is the source of the deformities. After Treves convinces Mr. Bytes to allow Merrick to come to the hospital for a display to some fellow doctors (mirroring the show in a more clinical environment) Mr. Bytes beats Merrick hard enough that Treves must come to provide his services. Due to the violence of the beating, Treves brings Merrick to the hospital as a patient, underhandedly without the permission of the hospital's governor because Merrick's condition is both untreatable (the deformities, which are not the purview of the hospital) and standard (the beatings, so he should be with the regular population). Through a series of events where Merrick demonstrates his intelligence through his slurred speech as he quotes the 23rd Psalm and news reaches Queen Victoria of the hospital's generous treatment of Merrick, leading to a visit from Princess Alexandra, Merrick gains a permanent station in the hospital.Where this movie works best is where it treats the different sections of society and their views of Merrick. We start the film with Treves as he navigates the carnivalesque atmosphere where Merrick finds his home. He brings him to the hospital for doctors to gawk at. When Merrick has to justify his presence in the hospital, Treves teaches him to put on a show. When Merrick gains his place, he gains a steady stream of upper class visitors who don't seem able to stomach the view of the deformed man, but they go for social status reasons. How different is Treves at a certain point from Bytes? Instead of parading Merrick around in a cage, he's keeping Merrick in a small room in the hospital and parading the upper crust of London society to view Merrick in the same way the lower classes viewed him at the carnival. Can Merrick ever become a normal member of society? These are fascinating questions.One way that this gets played out is through the night watchman Jim. Knowing his position allows him to exploit Merrick easily to his own financial gain, he goes to his local pub and brings along a dozen or so drunken visitors to gawk at Merrick through his window every night, making a pretty penny for himself in the process. The distinction between the carnival and the hospital collapses completely when Jim shows up, in particular when he shows up with Mr. Bytes who steals Merrick away. This section of the film, late in the running time, feels false to me. It doesn't help that it didn't actually happen (but neither did Bytes' (based on the real Tom Norman) general mistreatment of Merrick, and I have no problem with that), but this sudden kidnapping feels like a distraction in the story. I'm not sure what it's supposed to contribute, but it does end with the most famous part of the film when Merrick makes it back to London with the help of the fellow freaks in Bytes' circus. Chased by the denizens of London at the sight of his freakish visage, he shouts that he is not an animal but a human being, highlighting the central tension in the film. Merrick is a human being, but he's so disfigured that society at large simply cannot accept him as just another man. Uncurable by Treves, the only place he can be treated normally is in an enclosed environment with a handful of people, almost like he is an animal. There's the tragedy of the film. I think that I would come closer to finding greatness in the film centered on that idea if it didn't take that third act detour into Bytes stealing Merrick away.I mentioned it at the beginning, but as Lynch did in Eraserhead, Lynch intercuts images of smokestacks belching black smoke with the action from time to time. I don't really see the connection between society's mistreatment of Merrick with industrialization, though. It could imply a sickness of the world, but that sickness doesn't seem tied to the technological innovation brought on by the industrial revolution, instead reflecting a more permanent state in our souls. So, I sort of get the point, but I don't think it works. He chose the wrong image to make the point.John Hurt is kind of amazing through the pounds of makeup, providing a wonderful sense of pained humanity to the deformed Merrick. Anthony Hopkins is solidly composed as Treves. John Gielgud is kind of perfect as Carr Gomm, the hospital director. Freddie Jones provides a wonderful sense of humanity to the cruel Bytes. Lynch really does have a good hand with actors, understanding how to most effectively use them within a story.Overall, I think this is a good film that takes some of its departures from the reality of the story poorly. This is a cynical look at how society treats those who are unable to help their differences, how society at large simply cannot seem to find it within itself to treat someone based on their character rather than their looks. Some of the dramatics inserted distract from that central idea. There's so much to admire, though, that the late turns in the story can only hold this movie back so much. I can understand some of the long-standing love this film gets, especially from those who are less inclined to Lynch's more surrealistic impulses, but I just don't share it, feeling a certain admiration instead of adoration.",The Elephant Man
66,onepotato2,"shallow, pathos machine",4,11 August 2009,"This is the story of Joseph Merrick (here called John Merrick). Whenever I watch this movie I appreciate that it was filmed in b&w, and I cry a bit. It always makes me consider what an unbelievably cruel god it must be to take an already difficult Victorian life, add to that poverty and abandonment, and add to that virulent tumors that misshape a man to this degree, insuring absolute cruelty from his society, and that he can never seek employment. It's why I always have a big ""No thank you"" for religion. But I'm astonished that David Lynch (!) didn't attempt more with the material than mere sentiment. He tries to squeeze tears from viewers over and over. Apparently audiences are too stupid to get a point unless he wraps pathos-scented wrapping paper around a cinder-block and drops it on your toe.The movie vacillates between two types of scenes. A) Sympathetic figures cry, or cause Merrick to cry, and b) Merrick's heartless antagonists show up at the hospital and torment him. That's 90 percent of the movie. No doubt the hospital situation was better than the sideshow mistreatment, but visitors with an agenda treat him with a treacly, phony solicitousness that must've soon become tiresome even to him. As in, ""Hey famous actress, I don't like abuse but I don't need your self-congratulatory pity either."" It always grates on me. For how little John Hurt is given to do, you could stick anyone under all that lumpy make-up. The character of Merrick is two-dimensional, if you're being generous.The movie has very low dramatic stakes. I had sympathy for Merrick before the movie existed. I don't need Lynch to pump me for more. The developments in the script are repetitive and poor. Merrick is safely sequestered from his enemies in a hospital, after the first 20 minutes, but you can't do much with that dramatically. So, the script inexplicably allows cretins to reach him in his room over and over (with and without whores). Seemingly any villain can get to him inside his confines, and at the films weakest point, when some cheap tension is needed, his antagonist just knocks on his window, and voilà, now Merrick is in some quarters on the first floor, despite early interior sequences which showed people mounting stairs to reach him. Each ward invasion is more eye-rolling than the previous one, with shouting, etc. At one point an entire drunken midnight party converges on his room, and the ten-person strong, screaming crowd still fails to awaken the hospital staff. Gee, that's some terrific security that lets people roam your building at night; and some masterful handling of conflict. Come on! The absurd, manufactured conflict becomes very trying.",The Elephant Man

The fact that The Elephant Man(1980) was directed by David Lynch and produced by Mel Brooks and his company makes it even more surreal and incredible. It may seem over-sentimental and manipulative for some viewers but it is a great movie about the unbearable, unfair human condition, about dignity and what it means to be a Human Being, a Man. David Lynch's only second feature treats its subject with compassion and restraint and features outstanding performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. B/W cinematography that brought to life the feeling of expressionistic movies from the 1920s is appropriately disturbing. And who can forget the make-up work by Christopher Tucker! It took John Hurt seven hours every day to apply it and two hours to take it off.John Merrick had lived with such deformity that forced him to sleep sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk ""waking with a broken neck"". Poor, pure John Merrick who died before his 28th birthday.

69,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A biopic that means well but misses its point by a lot,6,7 June 2012,"The elephant man has always been a marvelous character to comprehend. From the day he was born, he was doomed to live a shortened life span and that's not the worst part. He had to live as a disfigured individual and there was nothing he could do to change it. He lived in a time where cures for diseases were very rare and if they were available, it cost a fortune. So it is fair that this film will be tragic because it is explaining the life of a tragic individual. But it's the way it's portrayed that is questionable.Anthony Hopkins, an actor whose performances I've enjoyed multiple times plays Frederick Treves, a Victorian surgeon who happens to run into the elephant man while visiting a carnival event. Playing the elephant man, or by his real name, John Merrick, is John Hurt. Hurt honestly gives an emotional performance as Merrick, especially in the beginning. Merrick is quite sensitive since he never experienced any real appreciation from anybody until Treves finds him. Even more astounding is how Hurt makes his voice so gentle as if he couldn't swat a fly. That's good characterization.But what squashes this exceptional acting is how the view of John Merrick wasn't ever changed. The only people that saw the potential in the character of John Merrick were Dr. Treves and his wife. All of Dr. Treves fellow doctors took him only as a lab rat. The public viewed him as a freak. And the people that Merrick was with originally, saw him as an outcast, because to them, he didn't deserve what the upper class had. If Merrick wasn't in his room, which was specifically made for him, he never had it easy. I'm not saying life was supposed to be easy for him, but the script could have been written so society was a little more flexible.I felt that this film might explore John Merrick's nightmares but I didn't think it would drag him so far down to the point of no end. I thought this project was written in recognition of the life he lived. Not to have audience sit through two hours worth of good acting and for what? To see a man, who has a troubled life get even more complicated than it was before? It at least should have had a satisfying ending but that didn't even happen. It felt more like it was a story of humiliation more than nobility. How's that recognition?The story of John Merrick or the elephant man is a sad one, but no one said the film had to be this depressing.

The man is also an excellent story teller, as he proved with the movie ""The Straight Story"" and with this ""The Elephant Man"".This movie has been based upon the true story of John Merrick, a man who lived in Victorian England and who suffered from an awful disease which disfigured him completely. Not only was he physically in an awful state, because he was seen as an attraction and treated as an animal by several people, the man also had lost all self esteem. He doesn't even speak anymore and lets all the torture and abuse come over him. But than Dr. Frederick Treves hears about him and decides to pay the man a visit. At first he sees him as a medical curiosity, but as soon as he gets to know him better, he sees that John Merrick too is an ordinary human being with normal feelings...I don't think that I have to explain to you how original the story is. For as far as I know there has never been a movie that has talked about this Proteous Syndrome or shown someone who had it. And yes, at first you are shocked and disgusted by this strange person. But that shock is necessary, because from that moment on you are completely sucked into the movie and you start to feel one with the man. You're happy and sad when he is and as soon as you start to see the world through his eyes, you can only feel admiration for this brave man.But not only David Lynch did a wonderful job, although I want to add that his choice of filming this movie in black and white is absolutely brilliant (it gives you even more that feeling that this is a man from another era, a time in which such people couldn't be treated, but were seen as an attraction). Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt, Anne Bancroft and all the other actors, all did a wonderful job in this movie too. Without their excellent performances (and I really can't say who was the best or who was the least), this movie wouldn't have been the masterpiece that it is now. This movie doesn't deserve any less than a 9/10. But even when you give this movie the full 10/10. I can understand it without any problem. This is definitely a must-see.",The Elephant Man

74,TheUnknown837-1,an absolutely wonderful and symbolic film,8,30 November 2007,"Joseph Merrick, commonly referred to the media (this film included) as John Merrick, was a highly sympathized and intelligent man of the 19th century. He was notorious for the extreme disfiguration of his body. It was almost sickening to look at his bulbous head, arms where one was large and the other slender, and the horrible bumps down his back, as well as many other deformations in his skin. Yet, underneath, he was actually one of the most respectable and wise gentlemen of his age. David Finch's ""The Elephant Man"" is a somewhat fictionalized film that overemphasizes the suffering that Merrick went through during his career as a sideshow attraction, but still maintains the point that you should not judge a book by its cover, or in this case, judge a person by his appearance.John Hurt was perfectly cast as Joseph Merrick. It's hard to see any real expressions in his face, because enormous quantities of makeup was put upon him every day of shooting. And it was true in real life that Merrick could barely even talk, or make facial expressions. All of the acting comes from John Hurt's voice. But he does it magnificently to make the film version of Merrick a lovable character. Anthony Hopkins was appropriately cast as the quiet, intelligent, and respectable doctor Sir Frederick Treves, who found Merrick and offered his services. There were a few other characters who were made to be antagonists for the film and did not, as far as history can tell, existed or at least, interacted with Joseph Merrick. But they were necessary additions to keep the story rolling.The film is entirely shot black-and-white, despite being shot at the dawn of the 1980s, but it almost seems appropriate. I myself cannot put my finger on why it works out so well. Maybe to make it all seem ancient? To make it look like all the black-and-white photographs of Merrick, who died long before color film ever came out? Maybe it was just a creative idea by the director or cinematographer. Whatever the case, it makes the film seem even more flawless and dramatic. The opening sequence did not make a whole lot of sense to me at first and I still don't quite grasp what Finch was trying to show, but once it get pasts that, then the whole film is understandable and magnificent. The final sequence of the film is one of the most dramatic one-character scenes in any movie I've ever seen.It is a shame that Joseph Merrick had to die so young, but maybe then again, it was his own choice to die at his age. Whatever the case, David Finch's ""The Elephant Man"" is a truly remarkable achievement and although not entirely accurate, is a film that shows us to respect a person based on their moral values, not on how they appear. Because even a person who was, no offense meant, as physically hideous as Joseph Merrick, they could be, as he was, a person of sensitivity and intelligence.",The Elephant Man
75,brchthethird,An unabashedly sentimental masterpiece from David Lynch,10,14 November 2014,"THE ELEPHANT MAN is a powerful and moving story with incredible performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Based on a true story, the movie is about John Merrick, a horrifically deformed man who Anthony Hopkins' character (Frederick Treeves) finds as a sideshow freak in a carnival. Initially, he only displays him in a similar manner to his colleagues (he's a doctor), but after finding out that the man is intelligent he begins to care for him. The movie isn't quite easy to sit through, as you see the mental and physical abuse that John is put through. But for all the moments like that, there are many more touching moments that will put a smile on your face and/or a tear in your eye. I'll be honest, I cried on more than one occasion, and this has to be one of the most emotionally powerful movies I've ever seen.

76,blott2319-1,Powerful tale of a man who was treated like a monster,8,4 June 2020,"The Elephant Man is a film that tells a heavily-altered version of the true story of Joseph Merrick, a severely disfigured man who became somewhat famous in Victorian London. I know they played a bit fast-and-loose with the truth when making this film because I went down a deep internet rabbit hole reading up on this man's life after watching the film. That is typically a good sign that a biopic connected with me, when I am so touched by the story that I want to know more. It's hard not to get emotionally invested in a tale like this, particularly when we see an innocent man treated with such indignity through no fault of his own. I was hooked by the story even though it's a somewhat familiar tale. I thought the cast all did a wonderful job, especially John Hurt who had to perform with those complicated prosthetics. The villains of the story might have been a bit exaggerated, but otherwise I thought the character work was delightful.Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is when Anthony Hopkins's character is forced to look at what he is doing for his friend, and questions whether he has actually improved his situation. It makes you think a bit more about what is happening, and calls into question how people sometimes take advantage of those less fortunate than themselves. At first, I thought they might avoid ever showing us the appearance of John Merrick, and allow our imaginations to fill in the gaps, but I think the choice to present it with extreme makeup effects worked well for the kind of story they wanted to tell. Keeping him in the dark or off-screen would have dehumanized him too much, and the entire film is about showing that there was a human underneath the mask. I usually struggle to understand why modern filmmakers choose to shoot in black-and-white, and this film was no exception. I suppose it might have added to the old-timey quality of this story, but it never felt necessary. That being said, it's a high-quality film that had me on an emotional roller coaster for the full 2 hours.",The Elephant Man
77,emasterslake,A movie everyone should see.,8,26 June 2006,"I never heard of this movie till 2006.And I'm surprised I never did before. This movie is very moving and very under rated.Elephant man takes place in England during the late 1800s. A surgeon portrayed by Anthony Hopkins finds a sideshow featuring many freaks. But one of them caught the surgeons attention. The Elephant Man, a deformed human born with an unbearable face that made him inhuman.At first you'd suspect he's an abnormal monster that should be killed. But deep down he is a sensitive man named John Merdick, 21, and very well educated.Over the years he's been living it rough with his condition. He's been beaten and treated badly ever since he joined the sideshow. John only wishes he can walk in daylight with everyone else. The surgeon does not find John to be a freak of nature. So he gives him care at the hospital he works at. Only problem is John is incurable. So it's merely impossible to change his face no mater how professional a surgeon can be.With a bit of hope and care, people of England will soon see John Mereith as a Human like them.This movie has a great morale to it. And it will change the way you think of people with deformed features. Just because of their looks doesn't mean they're not human. If you get to know them more you'd find out what they're really like. Because I'm sure you'd feel the same way if you were in their shoes and face the same music they do 24/7.This movie deserves more and wish it was more well known to the public. I'd put it in any greatest drama list. It's worth seeing for those who haven't seen it or aren't familiar with the story of John Merdick.

78,Andy-296,One of Lynch's best films,9,26 January 2008,"David Lynch's finest film, alongside with perhaps Mulholland Drive. John Hurt, under tons of makeup, stars as David Merrick, the real-life grotesquely deformed individual of Victorian England that was better known as The Elephant Man. Merrick is the virtual slave of a brutish man (a great performance of Freddie Jones) that parades him as a carnival freak until he is rescued by the sensitive doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). Treves decides to put Merrick in a hospital room, winning over the initial skepticism of its director, John Gielgud. In the hospital, Merrick will start to talk for the first time, begin to regain his dignity, and eventually will become a curiosity of high society before his premature death. Shot in a delicate and expressionist black and white, the only flaw in the movie might be the performance of Ann Bancroft (producer Mel Brooks's wife) as a stage actress interested in Merrick's life. Except for the surreal opening and closing scenes (in which Merrick is born and dies, respectively), here Lynch is relatively restrained, opting for a style that could be called poetic realism. The film earned eight Oscar nominations in all, but left that race empty-handed, an earlier indication that Lynch's films would not be the typical Academy material.",The Elephant Man
79,marcin_kukuczka,Full of Surprises,8,16 August 2015,"In one of the most memorable scenes of David Lynch's film, the protagonist, John Merrick (John Hurt) utters a remarkable sentence that, in a way, seems to reveal the gist of the story. He says: ""People are frightened by what they don't understand."" Although this may directly refer to his unique story and unique suffering in a desperate quest to be noticed as a 'human being,' this may also embody the motives behind liking or disliking this film. The dilemma revolves around 'accepted' or 'not accepted.' As based on the true story of Joseph Merrick (the film changes the name deliberately as the protagonist may represent any man), the storyline develops characters from the standpoint of the protagonist, the victim of his destiny, a pitiful scapegoat of the mob's undying curiosity and a grateful receiver of the open minds around him. John Hurt portrays Merrick is a very subtle way highlighting his suffering, his despair, his little joys and...perhaps the most discussed feature, his courage. Roger Ebert in his rather critical review on the movie quotes an American novelist Wilfrid Sheed who doubts the 'true courage' from Merrick since, what he points out, 'true courage requires a degree of choice."" What choice does the protagonist have in these circumstances and what choice does anyone have? Anyone whose condition is totally beyond one's control? As more or less courage a viewer can find in the character though, one thing is certain: along with the supporting characters of the movie, we grow perceiving the protagonist more and more as a likable, even lovable human being. I would not agree with Mr Ebert and his statement of 'pure sentimentalism' but rather see certain scenes heartily where, indeed, Merrick's sense of beauty and sense of subtlety emerge. The theater scene is, perhaps, the most important to be quoted here. There is also a religious undertone in him, namely, in the quotation of Psalm 23 which appears as comforting inspiration and 'his cathedral' which occurs to symbolize his quest for spiritual heights.Clearly, the most important character except for the protagonist appears to be Dr Frederick Treves (also a historical figure) played with sheer brilliance and precision by Anthony Hopkins. In all what he does for John Merrick, we see true doctor's charisma. He tells the truth...he is not afraid of a bitter answer 'No' to a desperate question ""Can you cure me?' Yet, as he portrays a man of good intentions and right deeds, he also powerfully depicts a man of doubt. In one memorable scene with his wife, we encounter Dr Treves asking himself: ""Am I a good man?"" This modesty of his character makes him memorable and approachable. It is, finally, him who Merric calls his true friend. This certain 'bond' between the patient and his doctor is compared to Francois Truffaut's WILD CHILD by Roger Ebert and, indeed, there are certain parallels that may be drawn. However, there is one prevailing aspect between Merrick and Treves: that is confidence from the start.Sir John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft need to be mentioned as supplying the story with charm and heart. Both portraying real figures (Francis Carr Gomm and Ms Kendal), they constitute an 'oasis' of kindness and understanding to Merrick. Ms Kendal, more to say, played delicately by Ms Bancroft, represents 'mother's care.' (consider the camera-frame of the scene when she calls his 'Romeo'). The scene of gift (the dressing case) stands out as an emotional resonance. Ms Kendal On the way towards contrasting those attitudes appear to be some intentional and unintentional 'victims of sensation' like a nurse who drops Merrick's supper in shock of his looks and the mob who break in and mock. The character, the evil character of course, deprived of any sophistication is Bytes (Freddie Jones), a true tyrant for whom Merrick is a mere 'freak.' He is undeniably deprived of any psychological approach, he is wicked in the very sense of the word, a sort of evil incarnate.Apart from the characters, the film's technical aspects may satisfy even the more 'pretentious' viewers. The black and white and the camera-shots supply the film with adequate atmosphere and powerfully combine the gloom of the story with aesthetic glamor of the Victorian times. Christopher DeVore's screenplay occurs as clever.THE ELEPHANT MAN is a film worth seeing because it depicts a story of any of us, it makes us realize how important it is to perceive others with love and dignity in spite of the fact they may be very different from the image we have created in our prefabricated perceptions. Fine direction, atmospheric sets, brilliant performances and a touching story.",The Elephant Man
80,Beta_Gallinger,"A mostly solid film based on the true story of a short, sad life!",9,18 May 2008,"""The Elephant Man"" was definitely a successful film of its time, but I wasn't around to see it then, as I was born six years later. I have, however, known about the film for quite sometime now, and all along, I have been aware of the fact that it's a sad one, so when I finally actually watched it after all these years, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect. Due to what I had heard, I had high expectations, expecting an excellent, touching, and sometimes heart-wrenching film. My expectations may not have been met completely, as I couldn't always stay into it, but in the end, it still struck me as a great film! Set in Victorian England, Dr. Frederick Treves is a surgeon who works in the London Hospital. At a circus freak show, he sees John Merrick, known as the ""Terrible Elephant Man"", who is severely disfigured from a rare disease, and treated very poorly as a side-show freak. Treves is fascinated, and has Merrick sent to the London Hospital, where he studies his deformities and gives a lecture to his colleagues about them. Afterwards, Merrick returns to his ""owner"", Bytes, who beats him severely and injures him! Treves is then called back over and told that Merrick fell. The surgeon soon takes the severely deformed man back to the hospital, where he gradually learns that his patient is surprisingly intelligent. Merrick is treated much better in the hospital, but Treves brings him a lot of publicity as his patient, causing the surgeon to wonder if he is any better than those who exploited Merrick in the circus! I have read about some inaccuracies in this film, which doesn't surprise me at all. Even though some criticise ""The Elephant Man"" for that, I've learned to expect it from movies based on true stories. I know that his name was actually Joseph Merrick, not John, though he is widely known as John, apparently due to Treves' memoirs for some reason. I know there are more significant inaccuracies, and probably significant things about Merrick's life left out as well. However, Merrick apparently was a very nice, intelligent individual who lived a sad life, facing discrimination just because of his deformities, which is all shown in this movie. This is what makes the movie so heart-wrenching at times (as I'm sure the true story was), seeing such a kind-hearted individual mistreated and living such a sad life. I know my eyes watered a bit a couple times! I'll admit I certainly wasn't moved by the entire film. Like I said, I couldn't always stay into it. This was mainly at certain times early on. I could have stopped the film, but I eventually found that forcing myself to keep watching was the right thing to do, as the story got so interesting that I couldn't stop watching! ""The Elephant Man"" is not the fastest-paced film ever made, and has somewhat limited musical score, which I'm sure could make it hard for some to watch, but overall, it is still a very well made, touching, and memorable biopic that shows what an unfortunate world we live in, where such kind-hearted people can be treated so cruelly for something they can't do anything about, and how you should not judge one by their appearance. Thumbs up for that!",The Elephant Man
81,one9eighty,Painfully ugly and beautiful at the same time,9,25 January 2021,"""The Elephant Man"" is a much forgotten, by highly influential and touching film from 1980 brought to audiences by David Lynch. It is based on ""The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences"" by Frederick Treves, and ""The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity"" by Ashley Montagu. Semi-fictional with some facts scattered around it too this is a film that has the ability to really tug on the heartstrings.Frederick Treves, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins, finds a deformed man by the name of Joseph Merrick (Sir John Hurt), at a Victorian freakshow in London's East End. He is being kept by the cruel Mr Bytes (Freddy Jones) who keeps him chained up and with a hood over his head owing to his monstrous disfigurement, and because Mr Bytes wants to keep the shock for his paying audience. Treves pays to take Merrick to the hospital for an examination where he discovers that Merrick, amongst other things has a deformed skull which is one of the reasons why Merrick cannot sleep laying down for fear of asphyxiation. At the hospital, most of the nurses fear him, barring Mrs Mothershead (Wendy Hiller) who is a formidable matron. Determined to prove Merrick is not beyond help Treves attempts to train him, a rouse that Mr Carr Gomm (John Gielgud), the hospital governor, sees through. Before he leaves though much to everyone's surprise, Merrick begins to recite the 23rd Psalm from memory. Despite the appearance on the outside, Merrick is an intelligent and gentle soul. Gomm permits Merrick to stay and Treves spends time with him building up a relationship. So impressed is Treves that he takes Merrick to meet his wife. Merrick also begins to entertain guests at his room at the hospital too. Treves begins to question the morality of his own decision to take Merrick away from the freakshow, after all, he is still being displayed, albeit to higher society now. Unbeknown to Treves, a night porter (Jim - played by Michael Elphick) is selling tickets to ""gawk"" at the ""Elephant Man"" most evenings. Merrick is given indefinite leave to remain at the hospital by Queen Victoria, but that does not stop Mr Bytes kidnapping him back due to loss of earnings. Mr Bytes leaves England to take his show on the road. The truth of this comes out when Treves and Mothershead confront Jim and establish that the kidnapping happened during one of the porter's showings. While in Belgium, Merrick is too ill to be rolled out to the baying masses and is locked in his cage to die by Mr Bytes. He manages to escape with the help of fellow attractions. On returning to England, he is harassed at every turn, and when he is cornered in the street, he defends himself before collapsing. The Police find him and take him to the hospital and to Treves. While he recovers a little, he is ultimately in bad health, dying from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He enjoys a few days of happiness with Treves and some of the people he met while Treves was caring for him but knowing his time has come, he bids farewell and goes to sleep on his back, despite the knowledge that he will not make it through the night. He is consoled in his dying visions by his mother.This is a sad film which is likely to invoke lots of emotions to people with a heart. It is beautifully written and performed by cast and crew. It forced its audience to look at the human condition and how it is treated, not just for the deformed John Merrick, but the people who around him, whether they are villainous people poking fun or making money, or the people that are less scrupulous but still strangely caught up in the orbit of events.The acting cast in this film were brilliant, none more so than Sir John Hurt and Sir Anthony Hopkins in the leading roles. They beautifully portrayed their characters and really gave them life and feeling. The make-up that John Hurt had to apply each day took around 5 - 8 hours to don, something that Hurt later said was almost enough to drive him to hate the acting profession he had chosen to pursue. Despite this, the production team wanted Hurt's look to be as authentic as possible. After the real Merrick died, parts of his body were preserved in the London hospital where he lived out his life. These real samples, or what was left of them after the hospital was bombed during the world war, were used as the basis to make sure Hurt looked as close to the real person as possible. The character that Hopkins played was apparently what helped get him cast as the villainous Dr Hannibal Lectre in future ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) films owing to his demeanour and delivery.While there are some accuracies in the film with it being based on real life, there are some which were invented purely for the film too. A lot of the situations that occur in the film did not actually happen to Merrick. He is reported to have lived a largely uneventful life in hospital - he was not ill-treated constantly, and never escaped from a freakshow either. In fact, the real muse for Mr Bytes was not a mean showman either according to reports; Tom Norman and Merrick were friends and business partners. The film did slightly tarnish the Norman name, but campaigns were arranged to try and clear up falsehoods like this.The executive producer of this film was Mel Brookes. He was responsible for hiring the writer and director David Lynch for this, and responsible for requesting the film be filmed in black-and-white. He kept his own name off the credits of this film though as he knew that it would give people the wrong idea. Brookes had previously been making comedy films and that was far from the genre with this film, and he did not want audiences getting the wrong idea.Filmed in black-and-white, and with the Victorian era in full swing, you would be forgiven if you thought this film was a lot older than it actually is. These techniques really help to age the film and give it a sense of authenticity. Another authentic element was the fact that the filming took place in England, meaning that a lot of the crew had to leave a sunnier climate behind to get this project up and running.I remember watching this haunting film as a child and being scared by it. Not necessarily by the monstrous depiction of John Merrick, but by the treatment of what was meant to be polite society. It wasn't until I was older that I was able to appreciate the full extent of the story being shown here. ""The Elephant Man"" is a touching and moving piece of cinema which is a stand-out when it comes to films produced in 1980. It is a film that I am glad to have watched, and will happily watch again and again, but making sure I have a tissue at hand too. If ever there was film which championed the notion that you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, this film is it.",The Elephant Man
82,KnightsofNi11,One of Lynch's best,9,20 February 2011,"David Lynch never ceases to amaze. The Elephant Man is his second feature film and it is indeed one of his best. It is more accessible than most of his films, but it is undoubtedly Lynchian with all of his style and substance rolled into one hypnotic experience. This movie is a biopic of John Merrick, otherwise known as the Elephant Man. He was a man who suffered from severely grotesque deformities. The movie opens with a doctor named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) stumbling upon Merrick at a sideshow circus where Merrick was one of the attractions. Hopkins manages to get Merrick out of the circus and to a hospital where he is cared for. From there he makes his way into London society, proving to be intelligent with a great personality. This movie is such an excellent portrayal of what it means to be human and how we perceive being human. It is a heartfelt tale told in the most unique form possible a la David Lynch.The Elephant Man has a sort of dream like quality to it. This movie is doesn't lack the surreal quality which Lynch laces his films with. The movie is hypnotic in its development of its characters and storyline. It helps that the entire film is shot in black and white, giving it a much more dramatic overtone. It is a very serious film, but not one that takes itself too seriously. It's not pretentious. Instead it's beautiful and enticing. Instead of being melodramatic, its heartfelt and sincere. It's a masterpiece in surreal filmmaking as well as dramatic realism.What really drives this film are Hopkins and Hurt. Their performances are tremendous and Hurt earned a nomination for his heartwarming performance as the most grotesque physical perversity of mankind. Hopkins' performance was somehow overlooked at the Oscars, yet he delivers the most driving and powerful performance of the film. And it is particularly interesting to watch the relationship between him and Merrick evolve as he realizes how human Merrick really is, and that he is a real human being, not some sort of grotesque science experiment. It is truly beautiful to watch these two characters grow and become more human than you would have ever expected.The Elephant Man is a masterpiece. It is just simply a remarkable film that will change the way you look at yourself and those around you. It's a movie that teaches us things about the human race. Things we don't want to know but have to face. These are the things that John Merrick knows very well and they are the atrocities that he must face every day. This is a movie that will leave you thinking long after you see it. It is an emotional triumph and one of Lynch's greatest films.",The Elephant Man
83,jluis1984,Terrific masterpiece!,10,3 July 2006,"Joseph Merrick, the man once known as ""The Elephant Man"" due to his terrible deformities, is definitely one of the icons of the Victorian age, as his sad story is an example of how terrible can we be with people with physical differences. Right after his surrealist debut with the ""Eraserhead"", David Lynch was asked by producer Mel Brooks to direct a film based on the life of Joseph Merrick as written by Merrick's doctor, Sir Frederick Treves. Brooks was so amazed by Lynch's debut that he wanted that bizarre and unique sensibility to tell the story of the bizarre and unique life of Joseph Merrick, ""The Elephant Man"".The movie follows Merrick's (played by John Hurt) life in a relatively faithful way, from the time that Sir Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) finds him working in a Victorian freak show. After he takes him to the hospital, Treves will discover that behind ""The Elephant Man"", there is a human being that deserves to live with the same dignity as any other man. Merrick's efforts for having a normal life, his struggle to adapt to society and Treves' doubts on his intentions are the core story of Lynch's film.Director David Lynch is probably more known for his surrealist works, so ""The Elephant Man""'s harsh realism may come as something unexpected to people more familiar with his later work. Still, the movie contains small but noticeable elements of what would become the director's trademarks, such as the nightmarish surrealism and the dreamlike atmosphere. The film's beautiful black and white cinematography gives the movie a look reminiscent of the early silent films that perfectly sets the stage for the events presented on film.The story unfolds with good rhythm and pacing, it is surprisingly accurate to the real story (albeit it does have some alterations) and while many have labeled it as emotionally manipulative, it is hard to think of a different way to present this story. The script focuses on Merrick's life under the care of Sir Treves, and the friendship that grew between them. It is a very moving and powerful story and the way it is adapted to the big screen is remarkable.While Lynch and his team deserve credit for the success of this film, the cast is what definitely makes the film a masterpiece. John Hurt makes an inspired performance as Merrick and portrays the emotion and passion of this man who ironically, was unable to express emotions in his face. It is definitely one of the best performances of that decade. Anthony Hopkins as Sir Frederick Treves is, as usual, very effective in his role and gives proper balance to Merrick's part. John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft complete the cast and are equally superb in their small roles.The film is completely flawless and even people usually turned off by Lynch's bizarre film-making style will probably enjoy this atypical work from the American director. What in other hands may had ended up as a blatant exercise in emotional manipulation, here is a subtle yet very powerful and moving portrait of a man who had a tragic life, and that despite of this, he still could find something to hang on.Merrick was a prisoner in his own flesh, and the people that could saw past his appearance discovered a brilliant young man with ideas, dreams and ambitions like any other normal man.

These are the heartbreaking words that John Merrick says when he gets fed up with people gawking at him and comparing him to an animal. David Lynch's The Elephant Man is a hard-hitting story about a real-life person who is an outcast due to his deformities. However, Lynch who also wrote the script, portrays this subject matter in a more positive light. Themes of courage, and the fact that everyone is human no matter the circumstances are brought to light here. Prepare to bring the tissues, because this story is an emotional story and I can guarantee no one will have a dry eye when the end credits appear on screen.I will go right into the thick of the story. John Merrick (John Hurt), nicknamed ""The Elephant Man"" is a man with a wonderful personality, but is hated by the English society because of his deformed body. He was discovered at a freak show by a kind doctor named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), and Treves gives Merrick the life and the treatment that he has never received before.The true story is a tragic and a heartwarming story. It makes you lose your faith in humanity, but then you believe not all hope is lost. There are caring people out in the world and the film gives you prime examples of these people. In addition to Treves, we have Carr Gomm (John Gielgud) who is Treve's understanding superior, Mrs. Kendal (Anne Bancroft) who became a wonderful lady friend to Merrick, and Mothershead (Wendy Hiller) who took good care of Merrick in the hospital.David Lynch is a great director who is known for directing very strange films. When the film opened, and the disturbing montage of elephants and Merrick's mom giving birth appeared, I became worried that the movie would end up being some odd take on this story. Fortunately, this turned out to be one of Lynch's more straightforward stories he told on the big screen. He took a difficult and odd subject matter, and turned it into one of the most emotional stories I have seen.The performances are fantastic up and down the board. The one standout is John Hurt's mesmerizing performance as John Merrick that garnered him an Academy Award nomination. He was always a committed actor, and that really shows in this film. In addition to his wonderfully horrifying makeup work, you believe that you are watching ""The Elephant Man."" You feel his pain and his emotions as he tries to live with his deformities in an era where people like him are not accepted. Anthony Hopkins also delivers a strong performance as Frederick Treves. He came across as aloof, but kind-hearted enough to help Merrick. The film does a good job highlighting the relationship between these two characters.If there are any criticisms I had to make, it would be with pacing. The film portrays Merrick as a man who can hardly speak then in the next instant, he would be quoting Shakespeare with exact precision. I had difficulty keeping up with the timeline, and it caused some confusion at times.The Elephant Man also made some history. People in the industry were angered because the film didn't get the proper recognition for its makeup. That caused the Academy, in the following year, to create a category for makeup. The makeup artist, Christopher Tucker did an amazing job creating the real, authentic look of John Merrick. The work put into the makeup was grueling, and John Hurt has been quoted saying this is the film that made him ""hate"" acting. That hard effort paid off! This movie is a wonderful, emotional true story about the man named John Merrick who went from a freak show performer to a man being recognized for the person he is with the help of some very good individuals. John Hurt's performance is one for the ages, and he has a bunch of wonderful supporting performances to work with. I liked Lynch's idea to film the movie in black-and-white. Freddie Francis's camera work is put to fine use in the movie. In a world with increasing darkness, The Elephant Man gave me a little hope.My Grade: A-",The Elephant Man
85,SmileysWorld,A story of inner beauty and society's failure to recognize it.,9,1 October 2001,"I first saw this film at the age of 15,and many things about it have remained with me over the years.Firstly,I admire any film maker who is bold enough to use black and white film in the day and age of color.Somehow black and white film seems to get the point across better when used in the right situations,and this is definitely a film that calls for it.This is an excellent film about inner beauty and about how we as a society all too often fail to see it.There are a lot of ignorant people in this world who think that outer beauty is the only thing that matters.This movie exposes that ignorance and does it very well.John Hurt gave an Oscar caliber performance,and he not only deserved a nomination,he deserved a win as well.See this film and see if it doesn't make you take a long look at what kind of person you are.",The Elephant Man
86,rainking_es,Essential.,10,30 December 2005,"There is no feeling, no virtue, no human baseness ""The Elephant Man"" doesn't scrutinize: hypocrisy, cruelty, mercy, sadism, love...). David Lynch reached the status of genius with his second movie, he created an instant classic for the history of cinema, a masterpiece. He probed his huge talent beyond the oniric or surrealistic fits of ""Eraserhead"" (and of most of his filmography). He probed he's capable of doing anything he wanted to with a camera on his hands. For those who think Lynch is just a pretentious guy which only films nonsenses, please take a look at this movie.As for John Hurt, he didn't need to become the elephant man to demonstrate he's one of the best actors of his generation; nevertheless, he accepted the challenge... and he won. He made an outrageous display of physical and mental effort, and of body talk. I can't imagine how hard it was for him to carry that disguise all along the whole filming. Please let's take our hats off to Mr. John Hurt.The Elephant Man, just an essential film.*My rate: 10/10",The Elephant Man

88,Ben_Cheshire,Superb haunting story about human nature.,10,1 April 2004,"With a crowd bearing down on him, the tortured cry of The Elephant Man (John Hurt) rings out: ""I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being!""Set in Victorian England, it looks into the Freak Show trade that was popular then, through one particular gentleman, grossly and uniquely deformed, by the name of John Merrick (The Elephant Man), and is based on the memoirs of the doctor played by Anthony Hopkins, Dr Frederick Treves. It shows the humanity of poor Mr Merrick and condemns the society that exploited him for its own monetary gain and sick pleasure.The story itself is a difficult one, and i'm surprised that any producer, even someone as offbeat as Mel Brooks, would have agreed to pour money into this idea. It has none of the classic elements of the commercial formula for making a movie that will make money: it has no love story, it has no sex, and, without spoiling too much, it is quite a tragic, unhappy story.The pervasive tragedy of the story is that John Merrick is an intelligent man, trapped inside this hideously misshapen body. Hanging over the head of the story is also the fact that nothing can be done for Mr Merrick. And the metaphor running throughout is that Merrick is no elephant man at all, he's just as human as the rest of us, but this exhibitionist, heartless society whipped him and made him dance around for them like an elephant in a circus tent.""Luck, my friend,"" A circus dwarf says to the elephant man at one point in the story, ""and who needs it but we.""It is a story of immense sensitivity and humanity, and one the likes of which you won't see anywhere else. Its definitely not for the weak-hearted or depressed. Its often devastatingly difficult to watch (mainly in one or two scenes), most of this story is wildly compelling and human drama due to the immense talents of Lynch and Hopkins in particular. There are certainly moments of reprieve - all is not black.Its certainly a beautiful movie - every frame is perfection. Gorgeous black and white cinematography give this subject the class it deserves. A wonderful score by John Morris helps give it a haunting beauty. It is directed with superb classical storytelling, illustrated by Lynchian brushstrokes: expressionistic dream sequences and trademark Lynchian soundtrack. David Lynch should be very proud of this early effort. It is a marvellous film. The sensitivity of the construction, and its classic perfection, are the work of a master.But it is hard to say what this movie would be without Anthony Hopkins. It is a topic that easily could have fallen into the trap of the society it depicts, of exploiting freaks for the petty thrill of exhibitionism. But whatever credit for this that does not go to Lynch, must go to Hopkins. His sincere delivery, in one of the most genuine performances i've ever seen, are a major factor in our believing this story really happened (which it did), and taking it seriously (which we do).5 stars.",The Elephant Man

The black and white adds to the ambience of the Victorian London the film is set in.Anthony Hopkins (with hair) plays a surgeon at a London hospital who befriends and at the same time discovers John Merrick (John Hurt) nicknamed ""Elephant Man"" because of his grotesque physical appearance due to tumours.Make-up effects transform Hurt into Merrick. It must have taken many hours for his make-up to be applied to achieve the desired effect.Hurt is unrecognizable and follows his famous role in Alien only one year previously.Director duties fall to David Lynch who earned an Oscar nomination and in the process increased his film making profile.Look out for a small role from the late Michael Elphick, who U.K. watchers may recognize from television roles such as Boon.Hurt and Hopkins are excellent in their roles and elevate the film to greatness.",The Elephant Man
90,grahamsj3,Magnificent film,9,12 January 2005,"This is a more or less true story, from what I understand. It is the sad story of a man named John Merrick who was horribly deformed by a disease. He spent a large part of his life as a circus or sideshow freak attraction. Shunned by nearly everybody, he was beaten and mistreated in nearly every imaginable way. Merrick is masterfully played by John Hurt. He is eventually discovered and rescued from that awful existence by a physician named Dr. Frederick Treves, played beautifully by Anthony Hopkins. The film deals partly with deformity but also partly with Merrick struggling to regain some sort of identity as a man instead of just a freak. Dr. Treves is a great ally. However, even as a man who can now move among an abbreviated clique of people, Merrick discovers that his disease is still a terrible affliction. That it was produced in black and white adds to the sad ambiance of the film and helps draw powerful emotions out. IMDb users have voted this film a spot in the top 250 films of all time and it certainly belongs to be in that company. This is Director David Lynch's finest work to date. The Elephant Man is a film that has and will continue to stand the test of time.",The Elephant Man
91,barryrd,John Merrick's struggle for dignity,8,12 April 2007,"How do we accept people for who they are and overlook appearances. These usually get in the way of how we judge other human beings. In the case of John Merrick, the visual reality was, to be honest, hard to overlook. A severely-disfigured face and body resulted in sneers, taunts and cruelty from ""normal"" people. It speaks volumes for director David Lynch that he took on the task of making this film, which he handles with great sensitivity.John Merrick was a man of keen intelligence and sensitivity, as Dr. Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) was to learn. Anthony Hopkins is excellent in the character of Treves, the polar opposite of Hannibal Lecter. Treves initially dismisses him as an idiot but soon finds out that nothing could be further from the truth. Merrick shows his intelligence when he spontaneously recites the 23rd psalm. If this is true to life, it is incredible that Merrick, portrayed by John Hurt, did not carry a burden of bitterness and sadness. He was forced to go out into the public with a hood covering his head, which had grown to grotesque proportions over his short lifetime. It speaks volumes for the men and women who took him in, gave him shelter and tried to restore dignity to his battered psyche. Beneath the exterior was an extraordinary man, who drew strength from the memory of his mother. This inspirational figure from his past allowed him to survive the cruelties he had to endure, including a stint in a carnival sideshow where he was exhibited to paying customers. The staff of the London hospital where Dr. Treves practiced thought highly of John Merrick and they did everything they could to protect him. The characters from the hospital include Wendy Hiller and John Gielgud, stalwarts of the British stage. There is an interesting cameo by Princess Alex, the Princess of Wales, who intervenes on behalf of Queen Victoria to keep Merrick at the hospital. The princess is played by Helen Ryan in a role she has played in other British dramas. The most heart-warming of all is the role of Mrs. Kendall, played by Anne Bancroft (late wife of producer Mel Brooks), who becomes Merrick's patron and most ardent admirer. Her introduction to John Merrick is a moment of total graciousness towards John Merrick, which we feel that he so deserves. There isn't a hint of the awkwardness from Mrs. Kendal that others display.The harsh industrial background of Victorian London and the plight of the working class who exploit John Merrick are realistically woven into the movie. Interestingly, it is the other sideshow ""freaks"" who understand his plight and come to his rescue at a very moving point in the movie. Social realism, for which British cinema and literature are well known, is a hallmark of this movie. But there is also a counterbalancing of hope and kindness that gives this movie its real strength.",The Elephant Man
92,jdkraus,One of the greatest movies I have ever seen!,10,24 April 2008,"Based on a true story, ""The Elephant Man"" is about John Merrick, a man who suffers from a congenital disease. He is so horribly disfigured that the only place he can find a niche is the circus. Despite his condition, a Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) finds and brings him to the hospital of where he's doing research on such unusual diseases. Here, John develops a friendship with Dr. Treves and regains his dignity for being a human. John Hurt as John Merrick a.k.a ""The Elephant Man"" gave one of the most memorable performances I have ever seen. I can understand why Robert De Niro won for Raging Bull since he's a more well-known actor than Hurt. But underneath the hours of make up, John Hurt is not a screen robber like De Niro, but plays a troubled and unloved individual who wants to be accepted. His performance in several scenes almost moved me to tears. Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, and John Gielgud are equally as wonderful as Hurt. Even though this is the only movie I have seen by David Lynch, I was immediately pulled into the film. His direction is simply wonderful, particularly with the limited shots of the Elephant Man. His body was never fully shown, until John Hurt developed the character. Because of this, rather than being frightened by The Elephant Man, I felt sympathy for him. The work of the cinematography by Freddie Francis is marvelous. The black and white not only made the Elephant's Man appearance less disturbing but it also set the tone of the time period during the late nineteenth century. The movie would not even been as good if it wasn't for the black-and-white. In addition, the score by John Morris adds to the gloomy atmosphere of the film. The Elephant Man is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It is sad and depressing, yet it is brilliant and very moving. It makes you cry for John Merrick, not just for pity but for sympathy. It makes you realize that we are all human, despite our disadvantages. It also makes you realize that one man knows that despite his condition, he knows he's all right. It is a shame that this did not get any Academy Awards. 10/10",The Elephant Man
93,rajdoctor,The Elephant Man,3,25 August 2007,"On many web-sites this movie was a common factor in top classic movies. I was quite interested to see it. I also saw the IMDb review and the poster and that appealed me more. I was too eager to settle down on my chair to view this classic.This is a second half of 19th century (1860-87) true story of a Joseph Merrick (John Hurt) man with physical abnormalities thus the name Elephant Man. A surgeon Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) gives refuge to Joseph in his hospital and makes him part of the high circle society of England. But still Joseph faces humiliation from people due to his looks. In the end of the movie Joseph is given standing ovation by the then Queen Victoria and all eminent people.The movie though based on a true story is a distorted version. Joseph was affected at an age of five by elephantiasis  but the movie starts with a dramatic misrepresentation of a dream sequence (or I do not know real) of an elephant raping a young woman  through whom assumingly this boy is born. The movie's script is a big let down. It showcases typical irritating British-ness; exaggerate the miseries of the man and the goodness of rich British people. Most of the poor people are shown as villainous clowns who are insensitive, ignorant, uneducated, rascals; whereas the rich class is shown as overly sensitive and humane to ugly Joseph. Again I think a total mis-representation! This movie reminded me of a documentary I have seen recently Darwin's Nightmare. African poverty is shown and exploited by the Director to fetch a name in the ignorant and insensitive western audiences. Similarly here ugly looks of a person is exploited by the Director to fetch a name for himself in the ignorant and insensitive western; mostly British rich class.There are so many things that are badly scripted in the movie that I would not even venture to mention them here. Most IMDb reviews rate this movie very high. I am saddened by the fact that they because they have failed to relate with such characters in real life  they feel so moved in reel life.What about people who considers being humiliated throughout the life with people's insensitiveness  find this representation over the board.Acting wise I found everyone more dramatic, and overacted  including reliable Sir Anthony Hopkins. For no obvious reason at all (may be to hide the make-up of John Hurt) the movie is shown in Black and White. John Hurt due to a huge make-up and limping character, even though had some work to do; but with this character  any actor could have done an equally satisfying job.I think, Director David Lynch is not a competent director, but has achieved some mastery in showcasing miseries of people and earning a living. His list of movies proves that. He may have felt that he is sensitively portraying miseries, but actually he is exploiting miseries to make a name for himself in an insensitive British/ western society.Because of the fact that this is a true story I give 3 out of 10 for this otherwise  poor movie.(Stars 3 out of 10)",The Elephant Man
94,MrDHWong,"A compassionate, tragic look into the life of one unfortunate yet fascinating intellectual",9,13 March 2018,"The Elephant Man is a drama film based on the life of Joseph Merrick and starring John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Directed by David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet), it is a compassionate, tragic look into the life of one unfortunate yet fascinating intellectual.In 1880s London, surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) visits a carnival in his local area and stumbles upon a freak show as its most popular attraction. While there he discovers that the show's main exhibit is ""The Elephant Man"" (John Hurt), a man with hideous birth deformities giving him an almost elephant-like appearance. Intrigued by this poor man's plight, Frederick rescues the so-called Elephant Man to learn more about his condition, only to discover that he is far more intelligent than his monstrous appearance suggests.Easily one of David Lynch's best films, The Elephant Man effectively paints a human portrait of the titular character and showcases him in the positive light he most certainly deserves. Despite being more linear than most of Lynch's work, the film still contains many of his directorial trademarks, including close-ups on eyes and flashes of surreal imagery. John Hurt gives a terrific performance in the title role and the makeup effects applied to his face were fantastic. Interestingly enough, this film helped serve as a catalyst for Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to introduce the ""Best Makeup"" category at the Academy Awards.I rate it a solid 9/10",The Elephant Man

All the pieces come together here for one of the most bittersweet true stories ever put to film.  Anybody who thinks Lynch can't make a coherent and meaningful film need only look at this.

96,LebowskiT1000,Worth Watching!,9,21 February 2002,"This was definitely a very interesting movie, and to think it's based on a true story makes it very touching.  There are many notable things about this film that make it so good.  I have to be honest though, I'm less than thrilled about the director.  I've now only seen two David Lynch movies and I hated the other one that I saw (""Wild At Heart"").  There were a number of things that I thought could have definitely been directed better or just seemed out of place in the film, but I'm not going to let that ruin the movie for me.  I'm very curious as to why David Lynch decided to make this film in black and white.  I know a lot of people love black and white, but to me it just seems to take away from the realism of it.  Also, to me it's basically having the technology to make it better and not using it.  But in any case, it didn't really bother me, I still enjoyed the film immensely.  The story is actually very moving and it really makes you think about how much you take for granted in life.  The acting is just great, you can't really go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, and John Hurt pulls off a great performance.  I was very happy to see Kenny Baker in the film, he's probably best known as R2-D2 in the Star Wars series.  In case you don't know, he's the guy inside R2-D2 controlling him.  The pacing is very good and does a great job of getting you interested in the story.  There isn't really much else I can say other than it's definitely a good film, and you should see it if you haven't already.  Oh, and I should also say something about the make-up.  I thought John Hurt (John Merrick aka The Elephant Man) had some incredible make-up on for the part, and it just really impressed me.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",The Elephant Man
97,oOoBarracuda,Humanizing the Elephant Man,8,6 January 2018,"David Lynch and Mel Brooks sound like a cinematic partnership that teeters on the edge between the surrealism of a Lynch film and a gag from a Brooks film. Nevertheless, these two would work together in 1980 on Lynch's second feature, The Elephant Man. Simultaneously, yet separately, both Brooks and Lynch had interest in seeing The Elephant Man, a script written by Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore based on the novel by Sir Frederick Treves. Treves book highlights the heartbreaking existence of John Merrick, whose severe disfigurement relegated him to a near imprisonment as a circus freak show exhibit. After making a film as polarizing as Eraserhead, Lynch wasn't exactly having to sift through many offers for work. Thanks to Stuart Cornfeld, a film producer who enjoyed Eraserhead, he picked a project that he thought Lynch might be interested in. After Lynch confirmed interest, Cornfeld, who was also an associate of Mel Brooks, took the idea to him thinking it would be a good venture for his newly founded Brooksfilm production company. Needing to be sold on the relatively unknown David Lynch, Brooks was advised to watch his debut feature, Eraserhead. Perhaps surprisingly, Mel Brooks took enough from his screening of Eraserhead to hire Lynch on the spot and put his full confidence in him to direct The Elephant Man. The chance Brooks took with David Lynch was monumental and put Lynch on the map. The Elephant Man was a huge success, nominated for eight Academy Awards, paving the way for Lynch to be able to continue his career in filmmaking. The partnership with Mel Brooks also allowed Lynch access to such a phenomenal cast including John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, and Anne Bancroft, Lynch had come a long way from selling newspapers to pay his cast. Despite many Hollywood producers being ill-prepared to properly respond to a film like Eraserhead, the artistic integrity was not lost on all, and the opportunity for David Lynch to flourish had just begun.One of the many positive qualities of David Lynch as a filmmaker is his ability to humanize even the oddest of his protagonists, thereby fostering an emotional connection between the audience and the characters in his film. Even the more minor characters in each of his films are given a human touch by David Lynch. Whether it's a distraught movie director who's casting decisions are being forced upon him, or a lounge singer embroiled in a kidnapping plot, each inhabitant in David Lynch's world is compassionately treated and given such human qualities, it is difficult to not become invested in the worlds he creates. Even in characters with such sparse dialogue as that of his feature film, their emotional essence is beautifully captured by Lynch. The audience is taken through a 14-minute trip before a word of dialogue is heard in Eraserhead, and after that, it's sparse until about the 30-minute mark. We are shown two socially inept individuals that seem to have little contact with the outside world. Despite their handicaps, however, Lynch shines a light on the aspects that make them similar to ourselves. We root for Henry and Mary, or at least want to see their suffering end, and that is credited to Lynch's ability to emotionally commit us to his characters. Lynch's gift of making such introspective cinema that allows the viewer to see at least aspects of themselves, in seemingly unrelatable characters, is invaluable. In The Elephant Man, Lynch's human touch was needed in multitudes to polish the animal-like John Merrick, who was routinely disregarded by those around him.I often think of The Elephant Man as Lynch's most human film. Perhaps that distinction should be shared with The Straight Story, the other linear oddity of David Lynch's oeuvre. Maybe it had to do with the plot-driven ""normal"" timeline following of these two films that kept Lynch from going too far out into the weeds. Whether it was due to the structure or perhaps the source material, Lynch didn't seem to hide the fact that he was putting a passionate, deeply moving bend to the story of John Merrick. In the first meaningful experience the audience shares with Merrick, played expertly by John Hurt, we see him isolated and alone, kept from having any interaction with people, only to be gawked at as the imprisoned sideshow oddity. Merrick is treated as property, solely because he looks different. He is completely commodified for someone else's gain because it has been decided for him that he couldn't possibly have anything meaningful to contribute to society. By expressly showing us the disregard of Merrick, Lynch sets the tone for Merrick's retribution that is to come. By the time Anthony Hopkins' Frederick Treves happens upon John Merrick, Merrick has been conditioned not to trust anyone, as every person in his life has abandoned him, beaten him, or gawked at him. Treves, however, is committed to helping Merrick, so committed that he brings him into his family's home to the shock of his wife. Treves creates the most comfortable environment he can for Merrick at his new residence in the Royal London Hospital. Lynch utilizes several long takes, focusing on Treves' face, to show the audience the depth of his humanity, and his desire for Merrick to be treated as a person rather than some sort of freak. This focus on Treves humanizes him, making his character another humanly in-touch addition to the compassionate world Lynch creates. There are a number of key scenes throughout the film where Merrick is seen constructing a model of the cathedral that he can see the top of through his window. As more people that come into contact with him ask about his model, Lynch creates a beautiful moment wherein he highlights the importance of each person's individual perspective. Merrick can only see a portion of the cathedral, just like those who interacted with him could only see a part of John Merrick. No one would have expected that Merrick had the soul of a poet or a depth of feeling that he shared for those important to his life. Each person only saw Merrick's disfigurement and assumed from his appearance that he could not possibly possess a great capacity for thought. Of course, this was wrong, but Lynch exposes the reality that no one knows all parts of anyone else. Just as the window blocked the view of the lower half of the cathedral, there is in each of us aspects of our being that are unable to be seen by others. Creating an opportunity for self-reflection, Lynch again successfully adds a richly human element to his film. In many ways, I was reminded of the ways people would interact with Dougie in Twin Peaks: The Return. Like Dougie, John Merrick was shown heart and affection by those close to him while being blown off or gawked at by strangers. This similarity goes to show that, despite there being 40 years difference between the two works in Lynch's filmography, he has maintained a commitment to highlighting and respecting the emotional elements of humanity.I have encountered many people who look down on The Elephant Man as ""lesser Lynch"", due to its coherent storyline and structure. It's not that these people don't care for the film, they just don't see as much of David Lynch's influence as in his other films. I've always been puzzled by this claim, as I see plenty of Lynch's touches throughout the film. The film is full of extreme close-ups of eyes, just like we see in Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive. The opening of The Elephant Man is incredibly similar to that of Eraserhead, both in sound design and sequences of overlaid images. The camera lingers, often longer than the audience thinks it should, which is something Lynch has done in just about everything he's done. What stands out the most as uniquely Lynch, however, is the nightmarish sequences of Merrick's abuse. Lynch is a master of the nightmare, creating terrifying, unnerving sequences that stand from all of cinema. Lynch also cultivates an environment of isolation, of characters that are always, even if slightly, trepidatious of the world around them. Like only he can do, Lynch creates a world that is ugly on the outside, but beautiful within, echoing the mindset David Lynch seems to apply to all of his films, that ""people are frightened by what they don't understand.""",The Elephant Man
98,elicopperman,A Disabled Being with Humble Value,8,25 January 2020,"When it comes to biopics on the disabled, they can more often than not be used to display sympathetic narratives to make one feel guilty for their subject at hand. Sometimes they can be overly sentimental, but in the case of The Elephant Man, it's more than just that. This film is not only sincere in how it tackles its subject's life of prejudice and deformity, but also in terms of how any act of good will can overcome the harshest obstacles in life.The film follows the tale of John Merrick, a 19th century English man who was struck with a severe body deformity at birth, thus living as a circus freak and being bombarded with cruelty from people. Soon, a medic named Frederick Treves rescues John from his inhumane conditions to make him more accustomed to a better life, in spite of other people's prejudice. What makes John Merrick such a charming character is that underneath his rotten outer shell is a benevolent intellect who only wishes to share the same amount of respect as any other being on Earth. In addition, Anthony Hopkins effecting presents Treves as cautious in regards to whether or not he is really helping out Merrick or not and John Hurt does a phenomenal job emoting through the deformed face in order to believably present his character as tortured yet delighted by his fascinations in life, no matter how small they may be.As this film was directed by the abstract horror legend David Lynch, the film looks appropriately gloomy and dry given the classic Victorian environment. The choice to shoot the movie in black & white not only makes Christopher Tucker's frightening makeup look remarkably appealing, but it also recreates an almost German expressionist approach with subtle grays and cast shadows, though with less bluntness in the more calm moments. Some sequences are also told strictly through the visuals and sound design, and they manage to communicate the purpose and effectiveness in the narrative without coming off as distorted. Also, despite being more well known for his collaborations with Mel Brooks, composer John Morris lets his broken lullaby score practically paints the insecurities of the unfortunately morbid victim who has no real desire in life other than living as a human being, not as an animal.To some, The Elephant Man is a depressing cautionary tale about how hard it is for humans to accept others. To others though, it is a harmonious and inspiring story of a remarkable individual whose one wish is to live among the people normally. It's the heartfelt tenderness from those who care that can really make a difference to those of unfortunate circumstances, making this film a timeless venture through tragedy and emotional resonance.",The Elephant Man

You get the unsettling nightmarish Lynchian moments too, but so briefly that it infuses the whole endeavour with this strange transient beauty.

101,Nightman85,One of the most beautifully moving dramas of modern cinema.,10,7 February 2006,"A modern masterpiece of style, grace, and thoughtful film-making; The Elephant Man is one of David Lynch's finest works.In Victorian England, a doctor discovers a terribly deformed gentleman being used as a side-show freak and takes in him hoping to give him a decent life in society.The Elephant Man is one of those rare films that actually reaches an emotional level with its viewer. Lynch makes this film with a truly dark and even bleak atmosphere, but this atmosphere gives birth to a kind of hope only the human heart could produce. Its sounds weird to describe a Lynch film in this way, but The Elephant Man differs from the stories of some of Lynch's more terrifying thrillers. Director Lynch does give this film some of his trademark surrealism, as well as some nicely hypnotic sequences. The style of this film is lavish, even as it's filmed in black and white. John Hurt's makeup work is astonishingly convincing. The music score of John Morris is beautiful and haunting at the same time. The conclusion of this film is one of the most elegant and solemn of cinematic history.The great Anthony Hopkins is terrific as always as the doctor that wishes to save the title character. John Hurt, even under a ton of makeup, is excellent as the films sympathetic and tender-hearted subject. The late Anne Bancroft appears as a theater actress who becomes friend to John Hurt's character.A magnificent film, quite unlike any other, The Elephant Man is a must see for all cinema lovers - the tender hearted of which will likely need tissues before the movie ends. For once, that's a good thing!**** out of ****",The Elephant Man

107,romanorum1,A Tortured Soul Comforted by Compassion,9,24 August 2018,"In 1884 Victorian England, renowned London Doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) attends a carnival side show to view a ""freak"" managed by slimy Bytes (Freddie Jones). The anomaly in question - the ""Elephant Man"" - 21 year-old Joseph ""John"" Merrick has a large and deformed head, a twisted spine, enlarged and nearly useless right arm, a twisted foot, and numerous scale growths on his back. Bytes continually mistreats his meal ticket, and sadistically beats him without mercy. Treves first ""borrows"" Merrick to use as a model for his lecture before his academic colleagues. Then he decides to rescue him from Bytes but still believes that Merrick is a mental idiot who (thankfully) does not realize his plight. Treves eventually convinces Mr. Carr Gomm (Sir John Gielgud), House Governor, to allow Merrick to have residence at the local hospital. Treves wants Merrick to be used as a source of study. Over time Merrick and Treves become friends and the latter soon realizes that Merrick is no idiot. Not only can he speak, but also is a sensitive, gentle, and intelligent individual. Even the staff begins to respect Merrick. Ultimately though, his life would not be a long one.In the surreal opening scene, a dreamlike sight, elephants are in motion and one attacks a woman. In reality, when Merrick's mother was pregnant with him in 1862, she was knocked down by a fairground elephant. Apparently - and not explained in the movie - both she and her son thought that the confrontation was the source of John's disease. This concept of ""maternal impression,"" that emotional experiences of a pregnant woman could have lasting effect on unborn children, was seemingly a common belief in the 19th century. A touching moment occurs when Merrick weeps when he is in the presence of Mrs. Treves (Hannah Gordon). He explains that he never had been in the company of such an attractive woman. Also note his most sincere appreciation when he receives a grooming kit as a present. Another impassioned scene occurs near the end when John proclaims to the crowd at the train station, ""I am not an animal.""""The Elephant Man"" is based upon Dr. Treves' account and not upon the play of the same name. Liberties have been taken, especially with Bytes' character. The Elephant Man's real name was Joseph Merrick, not John. Dr. Treves somehow had a mental block about Merrick's given name. Shot in crisp and appropriate black and white with smooth editing, the movie by David Lynch is well-filmed. Note the dark undertones of human misery in 19th century London. The music score Adagio for Strings is lovingly played and is so apropos. The acting is great all-around, including that of the supporting cast. Anthony Hopkins as the good doctor very well plays the part of a compassionate man who had to question himself of his ulterior motivation. Freddie Jones is appropriate as the sleazy Bytes. John Hurt is totally unrecognizable and outstanding; it took seven-eight hours daily to apply his makeup, and two hours to remove. I don't know how he accomplished his role so well. ""The Elephant Man"" is the second best movie of the year (1980) after ""Raging Bull."" See both.",The Elephant Man

I think I feared a shallow, 'we're all human at the end of the day' type of thing that would skip across the depths - a habit which has infected many an awards-laden film over the year.My fears were unfounded. I loved the remarkable cast; I loved the use of horror and science-fiction conventions to convey a story with so much humanity at its heart; I loved the film's willingness to allow strange, surreal sequences; I loved the allusions to pipes and steam and engines and the like, suggesting to me an idea that the more technologically advanced we become, the less human we are; I loved the reminder that Anthony Hopkins can act with restraint - a skill which he has seemed so reluctant to embrace since Silence of The Lambs (no criticism of that film, incidentally - more of a reflection on how he allowed himself to slip into roles written with less room for silence and subtlety); I loved the patience of the film-making.I found myself reflecting on my sense of being an outsider - a sharp issue for me; and also on my own tradition's (I'm a Christian pastor) habit at times of making a show out of 'healing', of treating a condition or a problem and not a person - an issue at the heart of this film in terms of how John Merrick is treated both by many in science and in wider society.A beautiful, haunting, compassionate and thoughtful triumph.",The Elephant Man
109,rowmorg,A Victorian morality yarn with a thin story and thick make-up,5,24 August 2009,"Choosing monochrome for his foray into the smog age and Jack-The-Ripper back-street London, director David Lynch does everything to place his freak-show action far in the past. However, he is exploiting the Elephant Man (Hurt as John Merrick) no less than his ""owner"" was in the fairground. He offers no explanation for the man's condition, not even from the eminent surgeon Treves (Hopkins) who got the unfortunately deformed man admitted to the London Hospital. Apparently, plastic surgery was far in the future when Treves practised medicine. Not even a dental surgeon was able to sort out Merrick's mouth for him, it seems. Once this is established, the medical dimension is removed from the story and it shrinks into a little morality tale that can barely support a 90-minute feature. There's no sub-plot, for example, to change the tempo, and the civility of Merrick's entry into society is laboured while we wait for the janitor to bring in his paying crowd, along with the wretched, drunken 'owner', and wreck Merrick's life once again. Anne Bancroft's walk-on appearance as an improbable West End actress speaking American and doing a reading of the love scene from Romeo & Juliet is poorly handled as the story clunks along in ""and then"", ""and then"" mode. The Elephant Man is a rather tiresome and poorly constructed bio-pic that fails to transcend the age in which it is set, and succeeds only in making a banal point about the gulf between appearance and inner nature, something that Charles Dickens would have handled in one paragraph.",The Elephant Man

113,Didier-Becu,the elephant man,10,4 June 2005,"David Lynch always used to be one of my favorite directors even if most of his movies leaves me puzzled. Perhaps ""The elephant man"" is his most easy one as after all Lynch only tells you a heartbreaking story. The elephant man is in fact John Merrick (John Hurt), a man who has been trampled by elephants and due to this, he is totally deformed. In the Victorian London he's a freak who's been used at carnivals for people to have a look at. One day Doctor Frederick Treves sees the man and decides to take care of him. John Merrick got a room in the local hospital but soon we'll see that the doctor invites all types of persons from the high society who want to see the freak, even if they all can cover it up like some tea-parties. Anyway, it looks like John Merrick got a sort of life in where he seeks the little pleasures of life. The real tragic is that there is a sort of battle going on who owns the freak, is it the freak show-owner or the doctor? What Lynch is showing us is to see who actually the freak is : the poor creature or the crowd who are so curious that they forgot there is actually a human being behind the tragic body? One of the more accessible films by Lunch for sure that got the full support from the public who were falling for this tragic story.",The Elephant Man
114,steiner-sam,"Plays with the truth, but still engaging",7,17 June 2021,"This black-and-white film is set in 1880s London, England, and is ""based on"" the last decade of Joseph Merrick's life, a man with severe deformities known as the Elephant Man. In the film, Joseph Merrick is called John Merrick.John Merrick (John Hurt) is a man with extreme facial and other bodily deformities, probably with genetic causes. He is displayed as part of a freak show by Mr. Bytes (Freddie Jones). The movie portrays Mr. Bytes as an extremely cruel man who assumes that Merrick is severely retarded and describes Merrick as ""it."" Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) is a young surgeon based at the Royal London Hospital who encounters Merrick in the freak show. He ""borrows"" Merrick to examine him and later shows him to a Pathological Society meeting. He also initially describes Merrick as ""it.""Treves learns that Merrick is literate and is able to get him to speak (he had been silent from fear). Treves arranges for Merrick to have rooms at the hospital and builds Merrick's self-confidence by introducing him to his wife and other people interested in getting to know him. Initially resistant to having Merrick at the hospital is the hospital's board chair, Francis Carr Gomm (John Gielgud), but he also soon becomes an advocate.A dishonest night watchman shows off ""The Elephant Man"" to his friends and allows Mr. Bytes to capture him again. Bytes takes him to Europe for display as a freak again but abandons him when Merrick's health fails. Merrick gets back to England and finds his way back to the hospital, where he has some good years before he dies at the age of 28 when he tried to sleep like a regular person. (His head had become so large, he usually slept with his on his knees; he was always in danger of asphyxiating himself if he lay flat.)It was a moving film, and the recreation of Joseph Merrick's appearance on John Hurt was stunning. I was somewhat skeptical of the saintliness portrayed in Anthony Hopkins' Frederick Treves. Treves' memoir was a major source for the film, and I think it resulted in a too positive interpretation of Merrick and Treves's relationship.The somewhat odd opening sequence in the film is explained by Merrick's belief that his deformity was caused by an elephant scaring his mother during her pregnancy.",The Elephant Man

116,Scars_Remain,Emotionally Exhausting but the Most Beautiful Film I've Ever Seen,10,5 June 2008,"This may be the greatest movie of all time. I know for a fact that I have never been more moved by a film in my entire life and i doubt I ever will be again. I have never cried during a movie because I never find something on screen to be that touching. I learn to care about the characters and the story but never become attached enough to really feel it emotionally. However, I must admit that tears were sliding down my face at several points during The Elephant Man. I really fell in love with everything about this film.It is definitely a David Lynch film, there is no refuting that. It has his lighting, his eerie sound effects and his feeling of tension throughout most of the film. This difference between this film and his others is that it is a very straight forward story. Don't get me wrong, I love his weird and confusing movies 100 percent, but it is awesome to see movies that he branched out on.The story is breathtaking. I have to admit that I don't know the real story of John Merrick very well but I have read a little about it and it seems that at least portions of the film are, in fact, reenactments of things that really happened. I saw some pictures online of the real John Merrick and I have to say that they did a great job of turning John Hurt into the character. His wonderful acting only added to the dimension of The Elephant Man. Everyone else does amazing work in their roles, especially a young Anthony Hopkins who, I believe, was perfect for the role of Dr. Treves. I wish I could put this film into words but it is impossible. You just have to see it.I don't think anyone will have a problem with this movie and I think that everyone should see it. It is more of an experience than it is a movie so be prepared to be attached to the story and the characters.

117,Med-Jasta,Got under my skin,10,20 January 2021,"I saw this as a long-time Lynch fan. I didn't know what I was going to get. I literally had no idea. I knew very little about it. I saw part as a kid and was utterly disgusted by the Elephant Man. I assumed it was a dark drama that Lynch happened to direct.It's not very Lynch but it's also very Lynch at the same time. The story doesn't follow his typical mystery/violence/scary style. But instead highlights the other side of his movies that is seldom talked about. His heart. His movies are always full of heart and the good things that people do but that's not usually what you walk away with. Unless it's The Straight Story. Which is fantastic by the way and had the same effect on me.Where Lynch is scary he replaces with touching. Somehow he can scare you on a level that no one else can. They aren't scares or monsters but it's something that hits you deeply on an instinctual level. Well he does the same with heart. I watched this by myself and half way through thought, ""This is really good but I'll probably never watch it again."" Well after a day of not being able to get it out of my head and so effected by its heart and so moved by the human story I watched it again with my wife the next day. Telling her, ""You have to see this.""The opening scene proved much more Lynch than I thought. Then what follows was such a great story about not only the struggles of someone that's different but what most people will do to help them and make them feel wanted. So many people go out of their way to make Merrick feel included because he has such a hard life. The good thing with this story is that this is such an extreme case of that idea. His appearance is disgusting and frightening. And his insides are not only intelligent but also very nice. So many times in the movie are people trying not to look away from him and he says one thing that makes people realize just how normal he is and they relax.That's of course good directing and good acting. The acting... Everyone is great in this. Not only for the actors themselves but from the writing. The characters are three dimensional and they feel very real. So many things happen in this movie where you think one thing is going to happen and it doesn't.Of course I read up on the real events after the first watch. I was surprised at how many things weren't factual. But of course it's a movie when it comes down to it. But after reading even more I was fascinated at how good of an adaption this was. The real events didn't go down like this but they also did. It was a real good way to condense and make a two hour concentrate of the real events. What you walk away with actually happened.I found myself really invested in the story. Real laughs, real cheers and real tears. Even when I think about it now those damn tears start to pool up. I can even explain why. In an honest way this movie says so much about humans and the things that we will do to help those less fortunate than us. The good in humans is what gets me. We already know so much about the bad and stories rarely reflect an honest image of the good in humans.As a Lynch fan this is cut from the same cloth as The Straight Story. Well it's really the other way around in chronological order. But if you love this check out The Straight Story. You'll be just as effected and touched and love Lynch even more, if that's possible.",The Elephant Man

Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker (Freddie Jones) until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins in a powerfully understated performance) rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and co-writer of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film, Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a Gothic vein.

He is just perfect in one more character, in this case, the doctor of a hospital in London, England whose routine changes when he finds (in a circus) a man with a terrible deformity in his body. The tumours in his skin and the scaring problems in his bones make him look like an elephant. The doctor takes the elephant man to the hospital and takes care of him. He also treats the poor lad with love and care, and it makes him feels good. John Hurt is superb as the elephant man, and his performance must have taken some awards.The film was totally done in black and white, and it certainly contributes to give it a dark and old look, what perfectly matches with the atmosphere of the story.

It's basically a movie about human suffering and how an individual can be completely excluded from society merely because of his/her physical appearance.It tells the factual story of Joseph Merrick, a man born Victorian Britain that began developing physical deformities when he was about five years old. By his late teens, his physical deformities prevented him from working as a factory laborer and instead he had to make out a living by selling himself as a curiosity. By the later years of his life he moved to a hospital and died there, at the age of 27. The movie begins by showing how terrible was Merrick's job as a living curiosity and proceeds to show how he moved to a hospital, which became his last place of residence.One can be deeply moved by Merrick's terrible life experiences in late 19th century Britain and France.

The transformation of doctors, the introspection of doctors, shows that there is hope in this society, and the film is not completely revealing and criticizing.What impressed me most is a sentence said by John: people are nervous and afraid of things they don't know. This explains the attitudes and causes of most people in society. When John finally signed his name in the church he built and made a voice saying that he was not an animal but a human being, John realized his dignity and existence as a human being and began to work hard to defend his rights. John realized that he was not alone because of the help and love that the doctor and the dwarfs had given him.

I like this one because it shows that despite being so hideous and so un####able a freak can still be just as normal in both character and looks. And the elephant coerced coitus scene was funny. Dumbo got his freak on. Yo yo yo.",The Elephant Man
128,Stompgal_87,"A dark, scary and poignant biographical drama",8,28 December 2013,"I vaguely remember seeing parts of this film as a child and how dark it seemed. This evening I saw it in full and it had a mixture of moments that scared me and made me smile and an ending that nearly made me cry. Either a scene of John Merrick lying on the floor at the freak show (or something along those lines) or the ending of him lying on his bed made my sister sob her heart out when she was nine because she was worried he would die.Due to its black and white cinematography as well as its old movie style, I initially thought this film was made way before 1980 but that's not the thing that bothered me the most. The film felt slow in places and had some forgettable moments but the beginning (a screaming person rolling back and forth being superimposed over a stampede of elephants, which mistakenly made me think an elephant disfigured Merrick's face by trampling on it) and ending scenes (Merrick dying and a vision of his mother against a starry sky) are two of the most memorable parts of the film as well as the train station scene where Merrick tells a mob that he is a human being and not an animal. Other standout assets were Merrick's distinctive style of speech, a tear falling down Frederick Treves's face, Merrick becoming attracted to a woman who is afraid of him, a female character reciting dialogue from 'Romeo and Juliet (the ""good pilgrim..."" part), the play scene, some earlier visions of what looked like a fair complete with a Punch and Judy puppet show and the camera sweeps of Merrick's cathedral model while the London Symphony Orchestra's beautiful rendition of 'Adagio For Strings' plays. John Hurt's make-up accurately resembled the real Elephant Man's disfigurement and all music was old-fashioned with some eerie pieces but the music at the play and 'Adagio For Strings' were more pleasant to the ears.Overall this was a gripping biographical drama with disturbing yet memorable scenes and a couple of well-known cast members (Hurt and Anthony Hopkins). 8/10.",The Elephant Man
129,frankwiener,I am a human being!,8,30 October 2017,"Even before I realized that David Lynch directed this film and was specifically in charge of its sound design, I immediately recognized his trademark background effects, which reminded me of the constant drone of old industrial machinery, from ""Eraserhead"", which he had directed three years earlier. Although my unfavorable review of the earlier film has received a mostly ""useless"" response from IMDb readers, I am not here to win any popularity contests, and that review stands exactly as is. To this day, thanks to ""Eraserhead"", a film I admittedly couldn't understand or appreciate, I can't look at a roasted chicken in a supermarket without wanting to throw up. Perhaps this was Mr. Lynch's deliberate intention. At any rate, what a difference three years makes as my reaction to this film was totally the opposite. That producer Mel Brooks had the vision to select Lynch as the director here was a stroke of genius. Brooks could see what I could not. That explains his success and my sitting here at a keyboard as a washed-up old geezer passing judgment on the actual, creative achievements of others. Although the subject matter and atmosphere of this film is as bleak as that of ""Eraserhead"", the visual depiction of Victorian England and the impact of the industrial revolution on the nation as a backdrop was fascinating, as was the unique and compelling story. While the true story of the real Joseph Merrick was fictionalized for the film, I had no problem viewing it as a work of fiction that was based on factual circumstances. It wasn't the first, won't be the last, and no one pretended otherwise.At one point, Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins), Merrick's physician, asks his wife, ""Am I good man or a bad man?"" This is one of the key questions of the film. Once he ""discovered"" Merrick and began medically treating him, was Treves more interested in the well-being of his extraordinary patient or in his own professional or social standing. If his priority was on himself, how were his motivations different from those of evil Bytes, Merrick's original captor, even if Treves did treat Merrick far more kindly and introduced him to British royalty and high society along the way? While Treves found comfortable shelter for his patient at the hospital, what good was that accommodation when he could not guarantee Merrick's safety from the torment of the night watchman and eventually of the very real threat by Bytes himself. It was almost as if Treves set Merrick up for disaster by failing to protect him from the terrible sequence of events that followed Merrick's admission to the hospital. In answer to Treves' question, I would say that the jury is still out, Doc. I'm just not sure about you or your motivations, dude.The cast was high caliber, but I felt that Hopkins and Bancroft, one of the most talented and versatile actresses of her time, were wasted in their muted roles, preventing them from demonstrating their true potential. John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller, two very experienced veterans, were excellent. Although the Oscars don't sway me one way or another, I will have to view ""Raging Bull"" again to understand how John Hurt lost out to DeNiro in the category of Best Actor. My memory is shot.This is a film that very effectively illustrates just how cruel humans can be to each other and how even the best intentions can result in disastrous consequences. While humans did not create John Merrick's horrible condition and while some acts of kindness at least partially compensated for overwhelming meanness and selfishness, he deserved much more compassion from us. Now let us go outside and practice in real life what we have learned today. Be kind.",The Elephant Man
130,JoshtheGiant,Brilliant,10,27 May 2006,"The Elephant Man is one great movie. It has several brilliant performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, great art direction/editing/costume design and such, but there are three things that stand even farther out. The direction is just perfect. David Lynch manages to disturb us without making us stop caring for his characters. The screenplay is one of the greatest ever. It helps a lot in the area mentioned before disturbing us while making us care deeply about the characters. The original musical score is however the strongest point of the film. It is just absolutely brilliant. Maybe the best ever. All around a fantastic movie that everybody who can handle the general disturbing nature should watch.",The Elephant Man
131,krational66,He's not the elephant man.,7,11 May 2020,"David lynch's expression is still experimental, had seen years before Japan stage version of the elephant man, more attention to the psychological description of characters, then don't understand why emphasize looks like people dies slowly lie down, see the understood because of his spine deformity, like normal person lie down and sleep become his dream, he is more a way of taking.
In the film, John self-imposed isolation from the start to have the friendship, and the doctors put him as their friends, and the doctor, but because of heart guilty can't respond to his friendship, dare not look into the eyes of his. Until in the end, also did not respond to his friendship, just say, see you happy I am also very happy. He knew he didn't do friends. When the doctor's position is out of curiosity, later see John at the moment of being touched, but everyone just sympathize with him, to feel sorry for him, that's right, the circus owner locked John and monkeys together, beat him, regard him as a beast, and he finally because doctors, has been treated as a person. All he wanted was to be human, to be able to walk, to be able to go to the theater, to be able to go to church, to be able to work, to support himself, not to depend on the handouts of others.
Why does the person who contradicts the doctor begin with, ""you and your elephant man?"" Is not John himself, he was ""like a man"" label on the champions league, and this label is posted on his face. The hands, body, is obvious. He need to cling to, a person is not his own is does not have its own role in the society, so he is the boss of the circus, he is a doctor, he is just an attachment, a property, a clown.
John was admitted to the hospital through the mercy of the doctor, the stage moved from the circus to the hospital, and the audience moved from the third class to the first class. In stage plays, like a person can't see myself, so you can't see the mirror, he can't face myself, ""he is like a mirror"", however, he is always ready to appreciate other people, ""you are beautiful"", ""crutch is very good-looking,"" people find affirmation of the self through to his mercy, ""look at this poor man, so alive, I can be a lot better"",
Ironically, however, is so ugly appearance of John, in faith, in 21 years to recite the bible, is at the top of the house just looked down at the cathedral to sincerely to build up to the church, his spirit was not tainted by the reality, he have no hatred, he is just with gratitude, he always say thank you, for all the damage, no hate.
Finally found it, he said he felt himself, he finally don't have to hide in a dark place, finally is not like a person, but to a man called John. He built a church, ""said the"" end "", as if all his desire, not caring. His wish, is no longer a symbol, is no longer like a person, he is just an ordinary man, he knows that he is not the ordinary people, also is unable to be ordinary people, he can't through the normal sleep and to prove himself, but he finally completed the wish, too. So, as human being's heart, he need not to think he is like a person, he finally like personal living, like a So the story of man is over, and he is not finished as a man, just like so many other people, the day is eternal.",The Elephant Man
132,brianberta,A well-made and powerful film which could use some polishing,9,13 July 2016,"David Lynch is a genius when it comes to the weird and absurd. He puts a lot of imagination into his films, and its interesting to see what he can do in each of them. Eraserhead was the 1st film that I saw from him. Over time, it grew on me to an extent to be my 4th favorite film of all time (currently). The Elephant Man was the 2nd film I watched from him. Even though its story is more grounded, it still manages to keep Lynch's absurdity feeling present found in most of his filmography.A Victorian surgeon named Frederick Treves rescues a horribly disfigured man named Joseph Merrick who's mistreated, and works as a side-show freak for a living. Behind his disturbing appearance is an intelligent person who Frederick begins to appreciate as they continue to spend more time together.Often, when movies contain bleak plots like this film or attempt to make the viewer feel sadness throughout them, it's very easy for them to be crippled by feeling overly emotionally manipulative. This can also easily hinder the viewer's immersion with the film their watching. For that reason, it seemed unlikely that this film would be able to succeed concerning the hopelessness of its plot. Despite that, however, Lynch was able to make one of the saddest films I've ever seen without making it feel overly sentimental or cheesy whatsoever. By firmly sticking to the facts of the true story this was based on, he did all that was required for him to do in order to make this film into a powerful experience. Also, we got to know more about John Merrick throughout the film as Lynch did a good job at developing his sensitivity and intelligence. This proved to be a highly powerful characteristic which made the film stand out so well. It makes many other feel-good films crumble into dust when compared to this one.The acting is another high point to the film. John Hurt as Joseph Merrick gave an amazing performance. Underneath all of the disturbing makeup, he is able to project humanity. Also, his voice was very muffled, like one would expect. Despite that, however, his voice was still understandable, and I was able to make out his voice without having to try too hard to listen or replay a line of dialogue. He stole the show. Also, Anthony Hopkins as Frederick Treves gave a great performance as well. He was able to convincingly play a doctor trying to help Merrick without ever sounding bland. Both of them did pretty good as the 2 main roles. I had no glaring issues with the rest of the cast.The visuals were pretty good. Since the movie was set in the last 1800's, the black and white seemed fitting, and it made sense for a movie set over 100 years ago to have black and white. Also, the make-up on John Hurt looked gross and realistic. To make it, Lynch looked at different photographs of the real Joseph Merrick. Also, after this film wasn't recognized at the Academy awards for its make-up effects, tons of people wrote angry letters to them, demanding them to give the film an award for Lynch's recreation of Joseph Merrick. They didn't do it, but they did create a new award called ""Best Makeup"" with ""An American Werewolf in London"" being the first to receive it. Since the effects inspired all of that to happen, I'd say that it did something right. Also, because of the black and white, the disturbing and realistic make-up effects on John Hurt managed to look gross without distracting me from the movie.When it comes to historical accuracy, this film isn't the most accurate film out there. It had several inaccuracies. Firstly, the events from the films famous railway station scene happened before Merrick stayed at the hospital. Secondly, the whole kidnapping sub-plot never happened. Merrick went to Europe on his own accords. Mr. Bytes, the original cruel owner of Joseph Merrick, never existed. Bytes was based off of Tom Norman. Thirdly, it's likely that Tom Norman was never as cruel as the movie made him out to be. Fourthly, Frederick Treves never had to rescue Joseph Merrick from Tom Norman. A few weeks after Joseph Merrick started working with Tom Norman, their exhibit was seen as 'distasteful', and it was shut down by the police. After that happened, Joseph and Tom went their separate ways. In addition, several operations were required to enable Joseph Merrick to talk. Finally, his first name was not ""John"". It was ""Joseph"".In conclusion, I enjoyed this film. It succeeds where many feel-good films fail at. It has great acting and gross and realistic effects made even better by the black and white cinematography. This may not be the most historically accurate film out there, and it may be a bit dull in a few places near the middle, but it's still pretty good. I'm going to check out more of Lynch's films in the future. People who aren't a fan of Lynch's work tend to agree that this one and The Straight Story are his best films as they prefer his more straightforward work. I think that this was pretty good as well. It just needed some polishing in a few areas.",The Elephant Man
133,coop-16,Ones of the most heart rending films of all time.,10,14 April 1999,"It is truly baffling to me that there are people who have seen this film  who still think that David Lynch is a cold and cruel film-maker. David Lynch is ,in fact, a man of extraordinary gentleness and sensitivity, who cares deeply about the sort of people whom mainstream society stigmatizes as 'freaks'.Please, watch this film--watch it carefully-- and you will see that Lynch's deepest concern is with how a over-industrialized, rigid, and profoundly hypocritical society crushes its outsiders. It may sound odd, but I really believe that the non-Christian Lynch has, in the person of John Merrick portrayed one of the most profoundly moving ""Christ figures' in all of film.  Let me also note how well Lynch( In only his second effort at directing!) handled such legends as Hiller, Gielgud and Hopkins.",The Elephant Man
134,ozjeppe,Mesmerizingly beautiful!,8,24 November 2006,"Can't believe I waited 26 years to watch this, and realize how director Lynch's career took off at such a peak. What a mesmerizingly beautiful and hard-to-fathom tragic account of deformed man John Merrick's fate in 1800s London. It wrenches out as much emotional sadness as a viewer can bear, but is very simple (sometimes too simple) in its storytelling structure. Its surreal dream elements are a good, welcome break in that matter. John Hurt gives an immortal portrait, and the images burn in effective, almost pencil-sketchy black & white. The similarities to Fellini's ""La Strada"" just adds to its likability. Man, that scene when John Merrick comes back to the London train station and is chased by a mob... as classic, haunting and heartbreaking as it gets!! 8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",The Elephant Man
135,Afracious,A moving and touching look at compassion and acceptance,10,4 January 2000,"The film begins with a hazy scene of a woman being trampled by an elephant and a baby crying, then quickly switches to the dark and dreary location of Victorian London, and a freak-show where there is a commotion. We see all the faces of spectators, aghast and appalled by their viewing of a particular freak. A doctor passing by notices this and investigates further, and eventually sees the freakish man. That scene is one of the best not only in this film, but in all of film. The tear rolling down the cheek of the doctor, played brilliantly by Sir Anthony Hopkins, is very touching. The doctor decides to take the man to his hospital to look after him and teach him. The rest of the cast are all exemplary, with Freddy Jones as the freak-show owner and Sir John Gielgud as the head of the hospital, and John Hurt Oscar-nominated as the Elephant Man, with also the make-up effects being excellent. The Oscar-nominated direction by Lynch is perfect, too. Some of the early scenes have a feel of Eraserhead, with the film being black and white and the drab location with all the industrial steam, and the sound also being perfect. The ending is like a salvation with a look into the stars and the heavens. It is an exquisitely crafted, touching tale of human compassion. A masterpiece.",The Elephant Man
136,Artimidor,About monsters and someone with a human soul,9,7 July 2012,"""The Elephant Man"" is not your typical eccentric brainy David Lynch flick, but it was the one that really launched his career as one of the most important filmmakers of today. It is also one of Lynch's most accessible films - realism and story go first. This highly commendable effort results in a very unusual biopic, following the true story of John (originally Joseph) Merrick, who lived in Victorian England of the 19th century, severely deformed from birth on. The picture steers a highly emotional course. For one it shows Merrick's life as a human curiosity, exhibited and exploited for his abhorrent looks, with his abnormality being celebrated, his helplessness greeted with violence to make the caged animal obey. Degraded to a mere creature, the abuse is physical and mental. But we also get to learn about a person named John, his other side, as one among others, who earns our respect as every human being does, regardless of race, belief, deformity, or any other prejudices. As with similar films where the horror is not merely a fantasy of its creators (take for instance Tod Browning's ""Freaks""), ""The Elephant Man"" is serious material one cannot recommend enough to watch, as it will undoubtedly leave an impression. The way the soul of John Merrick is carefully unwrapped is just heartbreakingly executed, helped tremendously of course by the endearing performance of John Hurt. Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who harbors the unfortunate Merrick, fully delivers, as do Hannah Gordon, Sir John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft, who complete the supporting cast. There are very few movies out there which can offer you life altering experiences. ""The Elephant Man"" might be one of them.",The Elephant Man

The Elephant Man represents one of his better films. Theres no doubt The Elephant Man is a good movie, but I found the pacing to be quite slow. There were scenes that were quite interesting and sad but I couldnt help how slow the movie moved.However, I could look over the slow pace and see the strength of the acting. Anthony Hopkins is very good here, as a conflicted doctor. John Hurt is excellent as The Elephant, he was able to show emotion with all that make-up on too. Anne Bancroft gives a credible performance. The rest of the acting is good. The Elephant is well-written and technically stunning. The Sets, Cinematography, and Costumes are all great.

I like many others in 1980 were just curious to see what this monstrosity of nature looked like. After I saw it with several friends, they all left in tears and talked about it for days. David Lynch does not borrow from the stage play in any way, but brings to life the clinical biography of John Merrick by Ashley Montag. 19th Century Victorian England is vividly brought to life in every detail from its smelly wharfs to dingy brick buildings.

143,quinimdb,The Elephant Man,10,14 May 2016,"David Lynch is known for his surreal, complex films, but this simple, heart wrenching story about the resilience of the human spirit is his most beautiful and yet grueling film simultaneously. And I know that to most people, greuling would seem like the better word to describe this movie than beautiful, judging by its harsh black and white aesthetic and it's utterly depressing main story, but like it's subject, there is so much more underneath it's exterior. It actually has fantastic, truly uplifting moments on par with the Shawshank Redemption and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest that literally had me in tears occasionally, and for me that really isn't common. This is due in no small part to the incredible performance by both John Hurt as John Merrick, who portrays surprisingly more happiness than pain underneath the layers of Merrick's physical suffering, and Anthony Hopkins subtly caring performance as Fred Treves, Merrick's friend.It is about Joseph Merrick, or as many know him, ""the elephant man"". He has been looked on as a creature or a beast his entire life, being paraded a around in a freakshow owned by a man that abuses him. But when Fred Treves, a doctor, finds him in a freakshow he takes him into the London hospital. He doesn't talk for a long time, leading Treves to believe he is just stupid, and hope to God that he is stupid, because if he isn't then that would mean his he has had bottle up his intelligence and true self for his entire life. But this only makes it all the more depressing when later Treves discovers his true personality just before they were about to kick him out. He ends up staying, and we learn that his whole life, all he has really wanted was to be normal, be loved, and know his mother. This is where ""The Elephant Man"" challenges us as viewer's to see beyond the exterior of the people we stare at on the street, because there is so much more beyond that, and all they really want is to be normal, even though they seem cursed from birth not to. It encourages us to try and understand the unfamiliar instead of dismiss it, because to be loved and to be normal isn't just what Joseph Merrick wants, it's what we all want.",The Elephant Man

145,hoernkeem,"The Elephant Man (1980, David Lynch) Lynch's beautiful black & white homage to the beauty and grotesqueness of humanity",9,16 February 2021,"The Elephant Man (1980, David Lynch) SPOILER REVIEW
After his breakout cult film 'Eraserhead' David Lynch's second feature tackled the real life story of Joseph Merrick colloquially known as The Elephant Man due to his intense disfigurement. Lynch's weird sensibility does creep in a bit, but for the most part it is a pretty straight forward directing job. He does shoot it in gorgeous black and white really capturing Victorian London. Interestingly I think 1980 was the last time more than one film in black and white was nominated for best picture with the other being 'Raging Bull'. 'The Elephant Man' was nominated for 8 Academy Awards but wound up winning none. This film actually prompted the Academy to add a category for makeup and hairstyling.
Frederick Treves, played excellently by a young looking Anthony Hopkins, is a doctor in London and stumbles upon Merrick at a freak show. Merrick is played by John Hurt who is unrecognizable under all of the makeup and prosthetics. He did receive an Academy Award nomination for the performance. He is basically being held captive by a sadistic carnival barker named Bytes. At the time he is found it is unknown if Merrick can speak or if he has any level of intelligence. Most assume he is just some form of mute, idiot dullard. In reality he is more like an abused pet so indoctrinated by the whip that he doesn't speak. The doctor steals him away and secrets him in the hospital where he works and when Merrick is discovered it causes a fervor. Some are scared and others are shocked, but as time passes Merrick reveals a tender, gentle soul beneath the grotesque form he inhabits, and he has a spirit that hasn't been destroyed even though it easily could have. He becomes somewhat of a star in Victorian society winning the friendship of the actress Madge Kendal, played by Anne Bancroft, and even Queen Victoria herself who, in her stead sends Alexandra to treat with him. Treves fears this is just another version of the side show he wrested Merrick from. Merrick, thanks to a drunken orderly, is stolen away by Bytes and is displayed again, however, the side show freaks all help Merrick escape who makes his way back to London and leads to Hurt's iconic scream as he is harassed by a mob, ""I am a not an animal. I am a human being!"" Eventually he is taken back to the hospital. One day he decides he wants to lay down and sleep like a normal person knowing it will kill him, but in a way he will also be free and never at the mercy of those who would do him harm again.
It is a brilliantly insidious film that contains an obvious theme of humanity. In Merrick we have the physical form we deem to be monster, but time and again it is the run of the mill ""normal"" people who display the true monstrous and cruel behavior. There is light and humanity for society as well though embodied by Treves, most of the hospital staff and Kendal. It is quite a resonating story based on Merrick's real life story. The script and actors are amazing and in it is shot beautifully by David Lynch. The cinematography, script, acting, makeup and set design are all exemplary. It is easy to see why this film was deemed to be one of the best of 1980.
Eric's Grade: A-",The Elephant Man
146,thedarkhorizon,Very emotional and cuts deep - for me an unorthodox Lynch film (because it is so straight up narrative and emotional!),7,26 April 2020,"I must say, I was rather surprised by the tone and narrative approach of this film... mainly because I have seen many more WICKED films by Lynch before (Twin peaks, the LA trilogy, ...). This one is super emotional on a few levels. We stay always close to the 'Elephant man' and are taken trough his journey among men and we experience his hardship from first hand.Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world, a victorian tough (and hell, I liked the circus bit at the beginning - this is how one imagines those old circuses, don't we?)The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The actors did a very intense job.Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. There's a transforming quality about it.To me, this proves once again and once more that Lynch is a chameleon, slipping in different film maker roles. He strangely stays close to the deeper levels of the soul - sometimes through wicked, mad riddle-tales (LA trilogy), sometimes through mixing soap-and-horror-genres (twin peaks), sometimes through heartfelt and emotional close-to-main-character-plays (this film). He is a very changeable filmmaker that thrives on many levels. He never stops to surprise me and this is maybe one of his greatest qualities: to go deep and surprise us all over again. Wonder and transformation are in his hands.",The Elephant Man
147,Davalon-Davalon,Sad and gripping,8,15 April 2007,"I had never seen ""The Elephant Man"" and considering it was made 27 years ago, it was almost as if I were watching an old black and white movie.Despite excellent performances all around, I felt there were several moments when the camera moved in a bit too quickly on certain shots, making us keenly aware this was a movie. Also, the dialog written for John Merrick (the Elephant Man) seems designed to make everyone burst into tears. It did move me, indeed, but it just seemed perhaps a little too planned.Because this film was made in 1980, the make-up, as brilliant as it was, seems like make-up. Poor John Hurt was forced to walk around with this huge bubble head which makes him look distinctly like The Alien's spawn. If the lighting hit it a certain way, it had a sort of almost Halloween-mask feeling about it, sort of plastic and fake. I hate to say that, because obviously the make-up artist did a superb job, and they based the shape on the bone structure of the poor individual who suffered these ghastly diseases.Anthony Hopkins, as always, is brilliant. He really can do no wrong. John Hurt, I thought, was superb. He should have won an Oscar for having to live inside that head, plus walk as if his spine was deformed. He must have been in agony for the entire film.David Lynch was unquestionably the best choice for this film and I think he's utterly brilliant. But I did think some of the lighting was a bit too bright in some scenes; I felt the sick and tragic mad crowd party crashing scene went on a hair too long and the music seemed just a tad too calculated, and the ending, when we are suddenly thrust into the starry galaxy was so reminiscent of ""The Twilight Zone"" that that is exactly what I blurted out to my friend as we watched it.And yet... the story pulls you in and keeps you with it, and you cannot help but feel absolute pity for this poor soul, and when he says, ""I'm not an animal! I'm a human being!"" -- you cannot help thinking, ""What is wrong with the human race that they are so quick to condemn and destroy all that is not like them?"" The Elephant Man was, at that time, what they used to call a ""freak."" It is absolutely monstrous and horrid to think or to even imagine that these poor people were thrust into circus shows and treated like slave animals.This film forces you to reconsider your own boundaries. As I looked at John Merrick, this poor creature who had the misfortune to suffer such disfigurement, I decided I would love him, and learn to love anybody like that, because no one in this world deserves to be without love.I'm glad I saw it and I hope I can keep these feeling in mind the next time I feel sorry for myself and/or the next time I criticize someone for looking something other than what I think is ""right.""",The Elephant Man
148,schroederagustavo,"A great, touching film",10,6 August 2020,"The Elephant Man is my favorite David Lynch movie. John Hurt, who plays John Merrick, is outstanding and more so for having to show so much emotion under such heavy makeup. And the makeup is amazing as well, having seen a picture of the real John Merrick, it is extremely similar. Anthony Hopkins is also really good in the movie. Although The Elephant Man does have some weird abstract dream-like sequences that are really characteristic of Lynch's films, this is probably the most straight film I've seen him direct, although I haven't seen all of his work. This is a very emotional movie, with some great messages. John could have been utterly resentful about life and because of the way he was treated he had every reason to do so. But he decided not to. He shows us that regardless of the circumstances of our birth and regardless of what happens to us in life, we still have the ability to choose our own attitude in the face of adversity. It also speaks volumes on kindness and helping others. I think it's a great film!",The Elephant Man

150,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,What a sweetheart.,9,17 January 2019,"Honestly, some of the most amazing acting you'll ever come across. Filmed totally in black & white for the purposes of Victorian, industrial age atmosphere.The strongest emotion I take away from this film is a sense of sincere endearment for John Merrick. On the outside he's nothing but a monster, but on the inside he's the sweetest, dearest and humblest person you could ever hope to meet. He's foolhardy, joyous, imaginative and grateful, and none of the things you'd expect him to have become after a life of such abuse and humiliation. No bitterness, anger, or the need to exact revenge, but a pure heart who's thankful for what his life has become, and to have found true companionship and friendship.The way the film juxtaposes a scene in which John Merrick re-enacts a high society event, pompously cradling a luxurious walking cane and cigarette in his hands, with the contents of a 'beauty' and perfume set strewn across the bed, followed by the intrusion of the contents of the entire after-hours pub scene just for the sake of a nightmarish look and a laugh at Merrick's extreme expense, emphasises the brilliance of this film in presenting the horrific rags to riches life experience of such an innocent man living in the shell of hell itself.",The Elephant Man
151,kylehodgdon,A Beautiful Movie With An Interesting Subject,8,13 January 2010,"""The Elephant Man"" is truly a beautiful movie. I have been interested in the elephant man for a while now (ever since an acquaintance of mine started painting several art pieces on him) but never really knew much about him other than the physical deformity. This movie is very nicely done and really makes you feel for John. It is very sad that he is treated the way that he is and you really root for him to make it in normal society. It is great to see him finally make it to the theater in his nice suit. The movie transitions from the positive theater experience to the horror of the public humiliation quite quickly, but it is a necessary one. It really helped to solidify our feelings for John.The way that he died was really great as well. He had been longing to be normal and had been looking at the photo of a person sleeping on their back for so long, that it was very beautiful that he finally felt normal enough in his last living moments.I have always hated David Lynch and when I found out that he directed this movie I became very worried, but I must say that he did a very good job. My only minor complaint was how many useless transitional shots he used. I get that they help to set the mood, but every one was a bit too long and he seemed to throw one in every few minutes. Things like pictures of elephants, or people working in a factory. Again, it is just a minor complaint and did not take anything away from the film for me, but I think they should have been minimized a bit.I must say that I was a bit disappointed to find out that a large part of this film is not historically accurate. Everything right down to his name (it was Joseph, not John). I have always said that I don't mind with movies if they are not the most historically accurate pieces of footage ever produced, but sometimes I feel like they should be pretty close. This is one of those examples.But nevertheless this is still a beautiful movie and should be seen.",The Elephant Man

I try to not take for granted all the fortune in my life. This film really made me realize how happy I should be. I should be incredibly blissful, every single damn day of my life. I should wake up and realize how fortunate I am compared to the rest of the world.And I don't say this to show off. I say this because its completely necessary for us more fortunate than others to never, NEVER take for granted every single, wonderful thing we have.Some people can work towards being fortunate, others can not.The Elephant Man can't. John Merrick is a very deformed human being. Let's say that in this case human beings are defined by how well they live their lives given their limitations, how they treat others, how they behave...etc. In that case, John Merrick is a human being in every sense of the word.But he is treated like a freak, a clown, a toy used for the benefit and entertainment of others. And that is sick. The thing that is so heartbreaking about this film is the fact that is based off a book, a true story. Even though the story has probably been a bit tweaked, the fact that there was once a man named John Merrick who was deformed and was probably treated unkindly and even sickly is disturbing.We make fun of mentally retarded people today. We make fun of people who look or act strange. Is this human nature? I suppose so...but can we really call it human? The human race doesn't consist of all bad people...not at all. We have people working in charities, donating money, trying to find cures for terrible diseases. We aren't all bad.

A deeply compassionate film, but never overly sentimental; never begging for you to pity the man, but rather to understand and respect him, and the people who came to know and love him.

I dont normally make such generalizations, but I have seen this film more than I have seen Star Wars and it moves me to emotion every time.  The most important thing that I have found about this film is its portrayal of the women in the life of John Merrick.  Lynch is often portrayed as a misogynist in the media and I really believe that one can gain a different perspective on his view toward women by interpreting his female characters through this film.  Only the women in the film empathize with Merrick, they are the only ones that can truly understand him and love him.  The scene where Mrs. Treves breaks down after Merrick tells her about his own mother is simply beautiful.  You can read it all in her eyes, as she thinks about her own children and feels genuine empathy and love for Merrick.  Bancroft's reaction is also without judgment and is purely love, as is the nurse (even though she may have disdained him at first).  I beleive that this film gives one a deep insight into the female characters in Lynch's other productions and is necessary viewing before any attempt to understand his art can begin.",The Elephant Man
160,jonathandoe_se7en,"I am not an Animal, I'am a human being...",10,19 May 2001,"David Lynch's the Elephant Man is one of the most beautiful films anyone could imagine to see. It tells the story of John Merrick (Hurt), a sideshow performer cursed with Neurofibromatosis, an illness that causes the victim's bones and muscles to swell and distort. After he is affected by bronchitis, his ""owner"" places him in the care of Doctor Frederick Treves (Hopkins).This is where the main part of the story takes off. Treves thinks that his findings with Merrick will make him a celebrity in the medical world, but little does he realise that he is forcing Merrick to exchange one freak-show for another.Lynch's vision for the story is very dreamlike, drawing on the black and white abstract nature of his debut ERASERHEAD (1976), he paints a portrait of Victorian England in such a modern way that it feels so real you can almost taste the smoke that hangs in the air.Boosted by the great performances (notably Hurt) the film can drive the most jaded audience to tears without ever resorting to sentimentality, taking us on a fantastic journey of hatred, friendship and the human spirit...

161,muons,A touching and depressive story,7,15 July 2018,"The movie tells the tragic story of Joseph (John) Merrick who lived in Victorian England. As a biopic, it is focused on the relation between Merrick and Dr. Frederic Treves who saves him from freak shows and arranges a permanent room in London hospital where Merrick spends rest of his life. Except some deviations which probably don't affect the main theme, the movie in general sticks to the historical facts. Anthony Hopkins displays a superb performance as Dr. Treves who finds himself in a moral dilemma: his humane approach to help Merrick from the cruelties of outside world is counterbalanced by his scientific curiosity which drives him to study Merrick's abnormal physical condition and exhibit him in conferences reminiscent of despicable freak shows. In comparison to the pictures of actual J. Merrick of his time, the makeup artist does a phenomenal job on John Hurt to recreate Merrick's disfigured appearance. The fact that all this happens in a pre-CGI era further adds to the value of the work. Finally, John Hurt delivers a top notch performance in a difficult acting job where he successfully plays Merrick's physical impediments along with his mental and psychological state. On the negative side, the pace of the movie is a bit slow and the narrative is quite depressing which is deliberately aided by the black and white shooting of the movie. Merrick's physical condition and the resulting mental burden on himself get us all moving but can't carry the movie for 2 hrs alone. The surrounding stories involving his abuse by his ""manager"" and others, the curiosity he evokes in London high society lack in human drama and tension. The subplots of these stories are bland and too weak to pick up the crawling tempo. Finally, the movie is very categorical in displaying the attitude of people towards Merrick. Overall, we are exposed to three types of people of the time: those living underground and suffer silently due to their freakish appearance sympathize with him; the general public react very cruelly on streets and pubs towards Merrick; the concert going, educated, higher class elites on the other hand are benevolent and behave more accommodating.",The Elephant Man

163,eddiez61,A Wondrously Gorgeous Monster Movie,9,23 October 2017,"This is a very early film in Lynch's professional career, his 1st major studio production following his much more personal, intimate and outrageously bizarre masterpiece, Eraserhead. That freshman effort is perhaps Lynch's most pure expression of cinematic artistry—a fiercely idiosyncratic, absurdly inscrutable gesture of audio/visual mischievous of the most masterful kind. Contained within Lynch's debut feature length movie can be found the bulk of the sublime ideas and ingenious cinematic techniques which infused all his later films with such shockingly vivid & visceral emotionalism. Eraserhead is such a powerfully effective bit of cinematic wizardry that upon witnessing it—no, upon being assaulted by it!—Mel Brooks was convinced that its mad genius creator had to be the director of the unusually odd film which he was producing, and thus David Lynch was hurled into the gaping, yawning, voracious orifice that is Hollywood film-making. Luckily, David Lynch had a magnificently talented cast (Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, Freddie Jones, and of course a brilliant John Hurt) as well as a superb script (Christopher De Vore, Eric Bergren & David Lynch) with which to fashion his quaint Victorian period piece/archly Gothic nightmare monster movie. The narrative is strikingly concise and terse, almost bleak in its unadorned simplicity, yet more than ample to support the gargantuan mass of barely tolerable pathos which burdens nearly every scene. That's not to say it's a tortuous slog—no, not hardly. The Elephant Man is only as emotionally crushing as David Lynch has astutely calculated we can endure, and it regularly assumes a surprisingly delicate & buoyant demeanor. In other words, it's an intensely disturbing, wonderfully rich & rewarding emotional roller coaster. Lynch's monster is a ghastly creature dwelling in the darkest, dankest recesses of the human psyche, and it's by dragging us kicking & screaming down to those formidably threatening depths that he's able to then kindly usher us to the shimmering splendor of an equally remote but welcoming inner realm where resides compassion, empathy & genuine humanity. It seems it's only by directly facing life's most daunting, most ugly, most horrific truths can we hope for any real joy, or at least any relief. That's heavy, isn't it?",The Elephant Man

165,SnorrSm1989,"Any biographical inaccuracies far, far less significant than its symbolic impact",10,1 December 2012,"I had known about THE ELEPHANT MAN since childhood and been told how touching the film was, but with so many supposedly good and ""touching"" movies to check out, it was only after I found it mentioned in Marlon Brando's autobiography (of all places) that I decided to see for myself, at 16 years of age. To say that I was touched is accurate, but really too mild; a film has never, ever forced me to cry so hard as David Lynch's interpretation of the life of this unfortunate human being. When I watched it for the first time as a teenager, there were instances when I literally could not see what was going on, as my eyes were too filled with tearsand if I ever believed, in retrospect, this reaction to have been the result of being at a more ""tender"" age while watching, a more recent re-viewing of the film must now put that possibility to rest. It remains completely haunting, both so ugly and so beautiful that repeated visits should be regarded as obligatory, yet it is very hard on the soul and the stomach to sit through it more than once in several years.More than just a biographical film that covers the essential story of Merrick ""The Elephant Man,"" Lynch's film is so vehemently sensitive in its depiction of Merrick that his life serves to function here also on a more allegorical level. This is worth pointing out particularly due to some viewers' objection that the film is not factually reliable. It may be so that Merrick's first name was not John, as in the film, but Joseph; also, actual reports suggest that Merrick was far more severely abused by his family than during his engagements as a ""curiosity performer."" However, in order to provide THE ELEPHANT MAN with more than some provincial interest, and make the issues it covers relevant (and, of course, narratively interesting) to a wider audience, to focus on undisputed facts throughout would have been a mistake, in my opinion. The pain which Merrick must have felt, his sweet and gentle personality made forever invisible to others due to the body that happened to contain it, cannot be diminished in any case; even though he was not truly haunted by a ""master"" who whipped him regularly. The film adopts a rather stylistic approach, which in my opinion justifies most inaccuracies and exaggerations; had the film pretended to be a more realistic piece, I might have felt a bit differently, but such is not the case.One could make the case that a story such as that of ""The Elephant Man"" is hard not to make touching somehow, but even so, the fact that I still cry at the film so my lungs hurt is in no small part due to the efforts of several talents involved. Lynch's portrayal of the grimmest aspects of Victorian-era London is exceptional, the dirtiness of its streets emphasized further by the black-and-white cinematography. I've yet to discover any film adaptation of Dickens feel so Dickensian as the sets and environment seen here. Upon watching the film again more recently, it also struck me how the ethics of demotic entertainment business in 19th-century England is indirectly being addressed through Merrick, and thus contradicts with how joyful 'n merry the era of music hall is often remembered in other retrospective depictions. First and foremost, however, John Hurt deserves all possible praise as Merrick. It's easy to suspect his role to have been a painless task, given that he's hidden beneath tons of make-up which is apt to have done much of the performance for him. However, while one undoubtedly would have felt sympathy to Merrick's story regardless of how the role was performed in the film, to make him come alive as a character, and make the viewer intrigued by him also for who he is underneath the skin, something special is required for. Hurt's sensitivity shines through in every gesture, and I found myself wanting so often to give Mr. Merrick one big, big hug. Also at hand is a strong supporting cast, including Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Frederick Treves. If there is a ""message"" to be found in David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN it may indeed be a simple one, but rarely if ever has it been expressed with such vigor.",The Elephant Man

167,Alex_Hodgkinson,Unforgettable Masterpiece,10,14 March 2014,"The Elephant Man touched me emotionally. I can't say I have watched many films that have done that. At first, I was reluctant to watch the film because I find most black and white films to be slow paced and quite boring. I know, unpopular opinion, but I am a mere sixteen year old boy and have grew up with all the newer stuff. But I digress, I watched the film because I came across the train station scene by accident on YouTube, which may have spoilt it a bit but it left me shattered and I knew that I had to watch the entire film. Knowing it was in fact a 1980 film, I assured myself that it wouldn't be like the black and white films I have watched. I was beyond correct.I thought I'd feel sorry for John Merrick (John Hurt) and have a respect for him, but it was more than that. I found myself connected to John Merrick and to Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). The characters were not only wonderfully wrote, but were also wonderfully acted. I was literally clenching my fist when the mob attacked Merrick wrecked his room. And that single tear running down Treves' cheek at the beginning of the film when he first saw Merrick was just so heartbreakingly perfect; you can see his feelings towards this new discovery without him saying anything at all.Before watching the film, I found out that most of the film is in fact fictional, and that the name of the character was changed from Joseph Merrick to John Merrick (possibly due to it being in Treves' diary). This originally put me off slightly as I expected The Elephant Man to get everything wrong and send the wrong message. But I came to learn that that didn't matter at all. If this film were entirely fictional, it'd still be absolutely brilliant.Every scene of The Elephant Man was essential, I believe. We slowly began to love and feel happy for Merrick, before he's chucked back into chaos and we're thrown into a state of both sadness and anger for the character we had grown to love and care about. The entire thing came together perfectly, thanks to the writers, Christopher De Vore, Eric Bergren and the great David Lynch, who also directed this brilliance of a film. Another powerful thing to note is John Morris' amazing, perfectly suitable circus music. Each time it is used is in the perfect scenes where Merrick is being used like a circus freak. For example, the scene where Merrick is being thrown around and played with by the mob has this great music in the background. The harsher the mob gets, the more intense the music gets, which just adds to your anger at the people using Merrick for fun.I like to imagine that the scene where Merrick dies isn't merely sad because he's trying to be like everyone else. It left me happy. Merrick didn't know whether he'd survive sleeping like that. He died believing that he was loved by so many. He was so happy. The only person I feel sad about in the end was Treves, because he'd have to continue living knowing that his friend was dead. Merrick died a happy, hopeful death.This masterpiece of a film left me filled with so many different emotions. I swear I came out of this wiser and more fulfilled. It made such an impact on me, an indescribable impact. Not once did I find myself turning away, I was enthralled by it. I knew what I was going to see before watching it and knew of what basically happens in the film, but somehow it still left me amazed and touched. I never expected it to be this great. I would say more, but I think other reviewers have said everything else I have to say already. What a truly remarkable masterpiece.",The Elephant Man

170,Magenta_Bob,One of the saddest films ever,9,26 March 2010,"Very few films leave me weeping like a baby, but The Elephant Man is one of them. It is about John Merrick (played by an excellent John Hurt), a man whose deformities are so great that he is even banned from the freak show at the circus. He is extremely badly treated by his ""owner"", but eventually ends up in better hands, with the doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). However, the film also raises the moral aspect as to whether Merrick is actually better treated in high society than he was at the circus. Indeed, some of the scenes where he is introduced to noble people are just as heart-breaking, and you can really question Treves' motives, but in the end there is no doubt that he is better off. Nevertheless, John Merrick remains somewhat of an exhibition item, which is part of why the film is so sad. Most people treat him kindly, but you can see that they are disgusted by his presence. In fact, every scene that Merrick is in hits the viewer like a punch in the stomach. There is something inherently symbolic about the character John Merrick. He doesn't just have an ugly face, but it also represents the ugly way people treat him. The hood over his head is not just a shelter from his face, but also the way he is sheltered from the rest of the world. And when he builds a small cathedral in his room, it is a fine representation of the way people built a fake world around him. At one point, the model is destroyed, and so is Merrick's sense of security. David Lynch has made many fantastic films, and I would be lying if I said that this was his best one, but what I admire about The Elephant Man more than any other Lynch film is the sense of judgment he displays. The film is of a quite sentimental nature, but not once does it feel overwrought or manipulative, and I give Lynch's direction most of the credit for this. Moreover, there are many gruesome scenes in the film, but he never indulges in them; they always seem to add something to the depth of the film. If I have to say something negative about the film, it is that the second half drags a bit at points. The terrific ending more than makes up for that though.Finally, one thing I have to mention is the cinematography. It is shot in stark black and white, and every frame is truly a wonder to behold. This, along with the superbly powerful portrayal of John Merrick, makes The Elephant one of the best films of the eighties.",The Elephant Man
171,gentendo,Taking Merrick in Complete Context,8,12 October 2007,"One of the predominant themes the director portrays in this film is in teaching the viewer not to be an ""offender for a word."" Given the loglinea permanently disfigured man is freed from the debasing life of freak-show entertaining and is given an opportunity to feel and be treated as a human beingthe viewer is taught not to cast unrighteous judgment onto another by not taking offensive of their outward appearance (Merrick's disfigurement). Instead, they are generously taught to embrace the inward appearance of people, in this case the spirit of John Merrick, and to treat him with just as much respect as a ""normal"" person would be treated. In short, it is a film that hones in on the importance of observing internal rather than external beauty.Director David Lynch sets a specific standard by asking the viewer to consider an important idea: Learn to analyze a human life in complete context of who they are before casting judgment. How could this be done? The subtext of the film asks the viewer to seek to understand what they do not understand by asking questions. This means that the viewer should not make poor assumptions of a person based upon their physical appearance, how they might talk, or even how they might dress. A person who superficially judges another based upon these factors conforms to a readerly contextone who judges without analyzing. Contrariwise, Lynch is asking the viewer to be writerlyin other words, choose to see the good in John Merrick, and humanity for that matter, by analyzing and asking questions to the things (i.e. people, films, ideologies) you don't understand.A general standard I've adopted while watching and critiquing films conforms to Lynch's overall message in this particular film. Just as Lynch suggests that the unexamined life is not worth living, I conclude that the unexamined film is not worth watching. The Elephant Man is a film about choosing not to be offended. My reasons are as follows.The characters in the film who are offended by Merrick's appearance (i.e. crowds at freak-show, Merrick's owner, nurses, doctor's in training, watch-guard) are the one's who take him out of context of who he really isand who is he really? From the viewer's perspective, Merrick is kind, thoughtful, romantic, intelligent, emotional and sensitive. He is a human beingnot an animal. However, these aspects of his character are ignored by the offended because they refuse to take him in contextin other words, they refuse to see beyond his physical appearance. They do not allow him to express himself. As a result of this rejection, Merrick is confined to a life of fear, misery, disparagement and loneliness.The viewer, on the other hand, is given the opportunity to see Merrick for everything he is in context. There are several ways the director accomplishes this: First, the viewer is divorced from the animalistic qualities that are unfortunately attributed to Merrick and as a result learn to care deeply for him. How is this done? The director shows the viewer truthful and poignant moments of Merrick's humanity: his love for theater and poetry shows his interests in the arts; his graciousness in accepting gifts from both the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) and the theater actress (Anne Bancroft) shows his cordiality; his ability to recite scripture illustrates his intelligence; and his ability to converse with other human beings demonstrates his cognitive understanding. He is just as real as anybody else.The only character in the film who chooses to see beyond Merrick's surface is Anthony Hopkins. The most powerful moment in the film that best defines the theme I've suggested is when Hopkins first sees Merrick in his prison cell. Rather than repelling with horror like everyone else, Hopkins completely embraces the sight of Merrick. While doing so, the camera slowly dolly's towards his face, capturing a single tear falling from his eye and down his cheek. It is beautiful! In that one moment alone, the entire theme is summarized: Don't be offended by the outward appearance of what you think is evil; rather, learn to embrace what you don't understand by welcoming fear with loving hands.",The Elephant Man
172,bedazzle,the cathedral. interpretation,9,24 May 2001,"Spoilers: Most likely, John had been raised an orphan until the time when he had been taken into the freak show. More so, he had been beaten often and treated like an animal. In a life of punishment and obeying to avoid more punishment, John had been living in order to achieve the interests of his master, never himself. Upon emancipation from this nefarious situation, John's life becomes devoted to self discovery, realization, and confidence.
Yet John cannot even begin to engage with his self if he cannot even engage with others. With the help of the good doctor, this language barrier is overcome. First words are anxious and reserved, but through continued conversation he becomes more self-confident. Moving John from the isolation ward to the normal area is symbolic of his traversing the language barrier.
With his newfound ability to communicate with others, he can finally communicate with himself and magnify his search for self. Beginning the construction of his cathedral is symbolic of John's beginning search.
At first, he builds only the part of the cathedral viewable from his window. This represents the first stages of his search for self. He begins by coming to grips with his only-viewable aspect, his deformed body. By ending his veiled days, he shows his overcoming of his previous self-dislike.
Later, he further tests his identity by engaging in talks with females. Extraordinary courage is needed to put himself in a position of possible rejection and even hysterics. (This tension between desire for females and fear of repulsion is first alluded to when the doctor states that although John has abnormalities over 90% of his body, his genitals were completely unharmed) Throughout these journeys into self-discovery, his cathedral is symbolically becoming taller and taller. Yes, these are abstract journeys, but even the abstractness is symbolized in the cathedral. After he gets past the appearances of cathedral/body he must, as he states, use his imagination for the remainder. He must go deeper and discover the hidden self - not only his deformity, but his emotional relationship and understanding with it. Just as his self-concept is coming to light, an eclipse occurs. A group of sight-seers shows up in his room and thoroughly dehumanizes John while at the same time destroying his new self-image of someone more than a freak show attraction. Likewise, the cathedral is also destroyed during this misadventure. However, when John goes into public and stands up for himself (""I am not an animal!"") and when he attends his first opera, he has finally overcome his greatest fears. The cathedral is completed and from the few visible towers, a magnificent foundation is discovered. John has finally come to complete self-realization and acceptance. Yet, he is not happy with the completed picture. He sees that if it took such hardships and struggle for he himself to accept himself, there is no chance of the outside world reaching this perspective. Sadly, self-realization coincides with self-destruction and John leaves this wickedly cruel planet. But both John's built cathedral and remembered image will stand for a long time to come, he will never truly die. Great movie, great ending!",The Elephant Man

A well-known surgeon who is Frederick Treves discovers him and wants to take him under his protection. Just for protection, because there is no possibility to cure and improve shape of his face.Lynch teaches the subject that people could be mentally ill in comparison with people who are really have an excuse or defective. The behaviours which people show to ""The Elephant Man"" is proof of this reality.Hopkins' appearance does remember Edward Norton. As if Norton acted in that role. Hopkins' role in this film touched my feelings and I prevented to cry with great difficulty.As an interesting point, I watched a Lynch film with contentment.Finally, the final scene in the theatre is wonderful.

176,LagerLagerLagerShouting,Morally Important and Deeply Moving.,9,30 April 2008,"David Lynch's poignant and touching drama is a emotionally-draining true story of acceptance and suffering set in Victorian Britain. Personal to Lynch and exploring his key themes of dreams and the effects of society on the individual, The Elephant Man is a beautiful, haunting piece of film-making. Although a simple story on the surface, as expected of Lynch films, it is also psychologically complex. Here he explores the effect of industry and class in society and draws on dark themes deriving from Bakhtin's notion of Carnival in his exploration of the marginalisation of difference and the quality of life in the developing post-Industrial Revolution world. The script is both heartfelt and precise and Lynch's direction remains taught and accomplished, enhanced by some beautiful black and white wide-angle cinematography and effective linear editing. The acting, particularly from John Hurt, is completely faultless, with every emotion hitting home. A important, masterful work of significant moral importance, that is both historically aware and ambiguously complex.9/10",The Elephant Man
177,lucianomarzo92,Excellent Film,9,10 January 2011,"The Elephant man is a very good movie. I would definitely recommend it. It is an artistic film, which may turn off some viewers unfortunately. It is a surreal film. Sections of it are dream-like, but they are also imaginative and captivating. David Lynch, the director, is well-known for this style. He is an imaginative director, who incorporates the surreal into his films. He is my favorite director, and this is one of his best works.The Elephant Man is an engaging movie. It is sad, but it is also moving. The Elephant Man is a little slow-paced, but it really integrates the viewer into the story. It is about a man named John Merrick, referred to as the Elephant Man. John Merrick is disfigured. His has a misshapen head, and face. He is unable to talk, and has trouble sleeping because of his condition. He is also frequently sick.John Merrick is in a circus. The circus profits of his disease, while John Merrick suffers because of it. John Merrick is constantly put through the humiliation of being gawked at by crowds at the circus. People marvel at him, and are horrified by his physical appearance. You really understand what he is being put through, and you really feel sorry for him.John Merrick has to wrap cloth around his face when he is in public. People are shocked when they seem him. He is not accepted by society, or sympathized with. He is instead ostracized and ridiculed as a freak. This film has a lot to say about humanity. It really exemplifies the fact that humans can be savage and cruel.John Merrick has been used and mistreated by nearly everyone he has ever known. There is no known cure or treatment for his condition. Doctors are really not much help. Nobody ever seems to have given him much love, or showed him any hope. He has just been exploited by humanity his whole life. But one day everything changes. He meets a man, a doctor, who decides to take on the challenge of helping him. This man is a very good doctor who has a lot of character.He feels sympathy for John Merrick, and is dedicated to helping him. He spends a lot of time with him, and slowly gets him to feel better. John Merrick never really talked his whole life. His disease prevented him from talking. But his doctor, through great patience and determination, teaches him how to speak. This doctor is the only man who ever believed in John Merrick. He gradually gets him to learn English. He also is able to improve his immunity and reduces symptoms of the disease.This doctor changed John Merrick's life. He not only healed him physically, but he mended John's broken spirit. Before, John lived a life devoid of happiness, but instead filled with pain. The doctor gave him something to live for. He is also responsible for discovering that John is a sensitive and intelligent man, and an exceptionally kind person.This film is a testament to the fact that humans can be harsh and unmerciful. Humans are generally not that accepting of people like the Elephant Man. People can be scornful of others who are different, whether that difference be physical, or personal. But among that majority there is a minority of people that are capable of great kindness and compassion towards others. I think we should all try to aspire to the dedication and the kindness of the doctor in this movie. The doctor in the Elephant Man is one of those special people who have the ability to aid those who are needed, even when no one else can.The Elephant Man is a strange movie. It is not your typical pop corn flick you get now. There are still good contemporary films, but many of them lack originality. Today a lot of films were clearly made to try and please crowds, so they won't be flops at the box office. Filmaking is too much of a business today, and not enough of an art. However, movies like The Elephant Man, show the craft, the intelligence, and the artistry of film.",The Elephant Man
178,lreynaert,People are frightened by what they don't understand,10,18 August 2013,"'The Elephant Man' is David Lynch's most humane movie. But, its humanity depends only on the initiative and the unselfishness of ONE man, played sublimely by Anthony Hopkins. This doctor faced stubbornly the denigration, the jealousy or the pure misunderstanding by his colleagues, thereby risking his reputation and even his job. The 'Elephant Man' is physically a horrendously 'painted bird', whose deformed features are cynically exploited by 'businessmen'. Being 'abnormal', he is hounded by racists and fiercely attacked by the mob. Psychologically, however, he himself is the most generous of men. Of course, this movie doesn't brush a very 'bright' picture of mankind. Its harsh and violent scenes are nearly unbearable and go straight to the heart of a 'conscious' spectator. 'The Elephant Man' is a horror movie, but not in the normal sense. The horror doesn't come from a seriously misshapen man, but from his treatment by his 'fellow-creatures' and their barbaric slogan: individuals who are not normal have to be slaughtered. A must see.",The Elephant Man
179,johnmschofield,This film should be viewed by everybody,10,27 December 2009,"In my opinion it doesn't matter whether this film is based on a true story or not. It shows perfectly what all humans could look like if everybody suffered from the same condition(s) as Joseph Merrick and there will always be somebody who earns a living out of someone as unfortunate as Joseph and in 2009 it is no different. I have seen a number of documentaries shown recently on British TV where unfortunate people who happen to have an abnormality are paraded and poked and photographed purely because of the way they look. Granted most of these programmes and reasonably well made but all of them showed that if there is money to be made somebody will exploit the unfortunates, it is still the way of the world. What this film attempts to do is to show to the viewer that inside each unfortunate is a human being who has feelings and emotions like everybody else. I do not know if this condition is treatable now but one would hope that medical science could do something to alleviate the distress. It appears these tumours which Joseph had on his body were not malignant but they continued to grow and affect everything he did in his daily life. The film is a sobering look at an intelligent person who is ridiculed and taken advantage of merely because he doesn't physically conform to the norm. It is a testament to everybody who was involved in the films creation that the end result is not a travesty or a white wash but a study mainly of everybody else who came into contact with him and how they reacted to him. He was just a man who happened to look different to everybody else. The numerous people who laughed and stared at him maybe had something inside which was abnormal and that was and is sad. Having said all of this it is only my opinion and thankfully everybody will have different views. I would recommend anyone watch this film and would hope that everybody should watch it at least once.",The Elephant Man
180,Supachewy,Lynch Transforms a Great Book Into a Great Film,9,20 November 2010,"The biographic drama The Elephant Man is directed by David Lynch and stars Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt, and Anne Bancroft. The film takes place in nineteenth century London.When Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins) goes to a circus, or to better say it a freak show, he stumbles upon an act that is titled the Elephant Man. He discovers the most hideously fascinating human being he had ever come upon in his entire life and wanted to study the deformed human to discover why he is the way he is. The owner of the man, Mr. Bytes, claims that his mother was raped by an elephant and that is why the Elephant Man is so monstrously deformed. Treves makes an agreement with Bytes to take the Elephant Man back to the hospital to do research on him so he can make a presentation to build his medical career for the Pathological Society. But as time goes on Treves realize that the Elephant Man is not an animal, he is a human, a human named John Merrick (Hurt). Merrick can speak, and read, and do anything mentally that a normal person can do yet his deformities make him unable to function in society. Can John Merrick live a happy life where he isn't abused, or will society not let him? The screenplay by David Lynch, Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren was superbly crafted and very loyal to the book by the same name. The film is just a fascinating biography about someone who suffered so much in their life and how I as an audience member just want John Merrick to experience just a shred of joy in his life. The characterization of both John Merrick and Frederick Treves were brilliant, by the time I was half way through the film I knew each character and that allowed me to feel for them. There is really nothing wrong with the screenplay at all, no complaints here.David Lynch ploys his crazy directing style from the second the film starts with a flashing screen of a woman being raped and elephant sounds being heard. Personally I believe that Lynch is one of the greatest directors of all time and he definitely proves it yet again with this film. I love the way he takes simple shots of a street, it looks like a photograph that would be on a cover of a magazine. What is also great about Lynch's style is that if someone put a film in front of you within moments you could tell that he directed it because he is one of the few directors that have such a noticeable style. Alright, I sound like a little school girl. Besides the brilliance of all the shots in the film Lynch got great performances from his whole cast. Yet again, Lynch proves he is a directing force to be reckoned with.The editing for this film by Anne V. Coates I have some likes and some dislikes. Let's start with the likes. I really like the sounds put over the film to add an effect of creepiness to it, they appear in many of Lynch's films and I always love them. I think the way all the shots are organized is great but there are too many fade to blacks in this film. It sort of segments it and makes it tiring to watch. After every scene about there is one and it just doesn't feel necessary, a simple dissolve or another technique could be used that does not push the viewer out of the film.The acting in this film is very good, with a great performance from John Hurt. Hurt received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor which he very much deserved. If this movie came out in a different year he probably would have won it but he unfortunately was up against Robert De Niro in Raging Bull who delivered a masterful performance. Hurt played John Merrick brilliantly moving and sounding like he was deformed and while doing that he made it so he was a lovable character besides his hideous deformities. I love the scene where he meets Mrs. Treves, it is just so heartwarming and perfect. David Lynch does not make scenes like that anymore. Anthony Hopkins gave a strong performance as Dr. Frederick Treves who wants to be successful while not wanting to take advantage of Merrick. Treves struggle is not as major of an issue as it is in the book but still plays a significant part in the film and Hopkins could not really have done anything to improve it. Anne Bancroft played Mrs. Kendal, an actress of the theatre who visits Merrick in his hospital room. Bancroft plays the part fine but it is nothing too memorable, when thinking about the performances of this film the only person that will be remembered is John Hurt.Overall I give this film a 9/10, it is definitely a great film and one of the best of the 1980's. I would recommend it to anyone who likes David Lynch, moving stories, biographies, the 1800s, never mind I recommend this to everyone. It is always fun watching Anthony Hopkins not be evil. I guarantee that if you enjoy films that are not pure entertainment you will enjoy this masterful piece of art.",The Elephant Man

Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There's a transforming quality about it.

Although similar movies have been done before, the realism, acting, and subtleties were done fantastically in this film. Elephant Man was shot in contrasty black and white, which gives it a feel of the early times in which the movie takes place. Elephant Man is based upon the actually life of John Merrick (actually Joseph Merrick) - a man who had a frightening appearance but was actually an ordinary human being. Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt do an exceptional job at playing their characters. There are some historical inaccuracies in this film. Such as the fact that Merrick was not abused while performing at the freak shows and that Merrick went out of his way to find a doctor and not the other way around.

Director David Lynch has peered into the souls of both the ""outcasts"" and those considered ""normal"" in our society. Lynch has never been better, and the same may also be said about actors John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.Bytes is a would-be circus man who puts The Elephant Man/John Merrick (Hurt) on display in the freak show, attempting to profit from another man's misery. Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins) ""saves"" Merrick from the evil Bytes, but what does he do with Merrick? Puts him on display in another freak show of sorts for a panel of doctors. Treves has again stripped Merrick of his dignity and tried to to profit from his misery. So who is worse? Bytes or Treves?And this is only the first 15 minutes of the film...What eventually saves Treves is that he actually gets to know Merrick. Behind the deformity he discovers a human being.There are so many beautiful and touching moments in this movie: Merrick's awe at watching the play, Merrick removing the pillows from his bed so he can sleep like a normal person and, of course, Merrick trapped at the train station and shouting out ""I am not an animal!""But my favorite moment comes when Merrick's fellow ""freaks"" in the circus help him escape. As they put him on a ship so he can hopefully find his way back home, the dwarf (Kenny Baker) says to him ""Good luck, my friend. And who needs it more than us?""Filmed in gorgeous black and white.

184,AdFin,"""The stream flows, the wind blows, the cloud fleets, the heart beats... Nothing will die""",10,20 April 2002,"Never could one hope to find a film as ugly and beautiful as David Lynch's film biography of John Merrick (The Elephant Man).  Merrick's story is perhaps one of the most heartbreaking and appalling cases of human injustice to those different, with a strong message, which still holds importance to this day.  In the hands of a lesser talented director this film may have been just another pointless Hollywood story, but in the hands of Lynch the film becomes a haunting, beautiful, but at the same time, highly disturbing work of art.  Always surrealistic in its storytelling approach, the film sets up Merrick's complicated birth with an abstract dream/flash back sequence, dimly lit and photographed in gloriously grainy black and white the audience can't help but be immediately drawn in to the story.The film then jumps forwards, and introduces us to the character of Fredrick Treves (Hopkins) at a London carnival, where Merrick is being shown as part of the sideshow.  Treves is unable to see Merrick due to the police, who close the show before he gets there, but hungry for a glimpse he arranges to for a private showing with Merrick's owner Bytes.  Lynch is reluctant to show us Merrick in full daylight for the first quarter of the film, which in my opinion was a clever move, because it allows we the audience to share Treve's intrigue as to weather or not the tag Elephant Man is suited, or whether we are being duped into seeing something not too much out of the ordinary.  It is only later that, after we see Merrick, we realise that he is truly deformed beyond human recognition.The next part of the film is where the real argument of The Elephant Man rests, the age-old argument of beauty only being skin deep and how those who have beauty on the outside often have none on the inside.  As Merrick goes to show the staff of the hospital of which he's taken residency that he is an articulate, erudite human being, he is slowly integrated into polite society, not from respect though, the crowds are only gathering because viewing Merrick has become something of a status symbol, and this is where Treve's must decide whether or not he has forced John to exchange one freak-show for another.  For me The Elephant Man is one of the most staggering and moving films of recent cinema, the herald of a maverick talent in the then young David Lynch, and brimming with evocative production design, beautiful photography and a wealth of fine performances from Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud and Michael Elphick, not to mention Hurt's remarkable performance hidden under layers of prosthetic make-up.  It is true what others have said, that The Elephant Man is a very bleak, very downbeat film, a film not afraid to hold a mirror to society's injustices, but the ending is uplifting in a different way than most conventional happy endings.  In the respect that John has just has the happiest day of his life, and no day will ever be that good, so the perfect way to end that perfect day, is to sleep like he has always wanted to, even if it will result in his own death.  With the final line (used as my summary), we are told that nothing dies, that the spirit will always live on.  What a touching sentiment to the endurance of the human spirit.

The Elephant Man (real name John Merrick) is played by John Hurt (1984), who uses his voice only: it's really unfair he didn't get the Oscar for this performance. The story of this man hideously deformed is touching and makes you think: who's the real monster, him or us? Can he be considered like a monster, he so delicate and appreciative? Or we are the real monster, we that use his hideous malformation to get money, or we that can't understand he's an human being? It's all more shocking because it's cinematographed (by Freddie Francis) in a violent black and white, full of shadows and twilights. Maybe, it remembers the shadow part of everybody. The cast is completed with Anthony Hopkins (who plays the doctor who saves and studies the Elephant Man), John Gielgud (the hospital manager), Anne Bancroft (the actress who grows attached of the Elephant Man) and Freddie Jones (the circus manager who beats and takes advantage of the Elephant Man).

Anthony Hopkins, who would rise to fame a decade later in the chilling 'The Silence of the Lambs,' is brilliant as Frederick Treves, a doctor who initially exploits Merrick's condition to advance his career, but inevitably falls in love with the man. Likewise, John Hurt is so perfect as John ""The Elephant Man"" Merrick that I feel I don't even need to express how good he was! The famous scene in which Merrick, unfairly cornered at a train station by a mob of angry men, desperately cries ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!"" is one of the great moments in cinema. I would consider this film to be absolutely perfect, but for the very end. As Merrick lays himself down on the bed, determined to sleep and die as a normal man, I would have been blissfully content with a brief pan to his mother's photograph, a pause of several seconds and a soft fade into black. However, we instead have the stars in the sky flying past the camera and, as I interpreted it, the spirit of Merrick's beautiful mother offering him comfort in his final moments. Perhaps I am missing the significance of this final scene, but I simply felt it was unnecessary.We shouldn't let this minor nitpick detract too much from the brilliance of the film.

However, this takes little, if anything, away from the impact of the film.The black and white photography is excellent, as is the cinematography; a very real sense of Victorian England is evoked.  As in other Lynch pictures, such as _Eraserhead_, sound is used skillfully in the creation of mood and a sense of place.  Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt and a host of others offer a sense of their characters that is almost palpable.I found _The Elephant Man_ to be, at times, very uplifting and positive; at other times, it was almost unbearably sad.  Scenes of great joy and happiness are contrasted almost immediately with scenes of mindless brutality and infuriating ignorance.  For anyone that has never quite fit in, or felt an outsider, Hurt's portrayal of Joseph Merrick will be something that will strike a very, very deep chord, and leave a lasting impression, as it did with me",The Elephant Man

Another director would have suited this film.9/10",The Elephant Man

Me, I prefer this kind of David Lynch, a man who shows us the hypocrite  and cruel society: if John Merrick (a wonderful John Hurt) is an external ugly, the Victorian society is much more ugly in his cruelty against him. His shout: ""I'm not an animal! I'm a human being!"" it's still deeply and sadly actual. Great performances by Anthony Hopkins (it is fantastic, but this performance is not valued), Anne Bancroft and the 2 old glories John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller.

193,auberus,A baroque masterpiece,8,29 July 2003,"""Elephant Man"" is the 6th movie from David Lynch and probably is most ""baroque"" work. Staged in Victorian England, directed in 1980 and shot in black and white. Elephant Man might very well be one of the most powerful movies in history so far... The film is based on the true story of John Merick, the Elephant Man. David Lynch adapted this story following a very basic/simple narrative construction, emerging the audience in part of the life of John Merick from the time when he gets noticed in a freak show by a British surgeon to the time...(well you'll find out by yourself). The interpretation of both Anthony Hopkins as the British surgeon, Dr. Frederick Treves and John Hurt as the Elephant Man, John Merick is ""mistakeless"". The ton is right from beginning to end. Not one dialog is overplayed or downplayed. Overall the actors deliver an amazing performance. Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Kendal) is acting so true, John Gielgud (Carr Gomm) is the archetype of the humanist gentleman and Freddie Jones (Bytes) is impersonating this pathetic drunk vile character to perfection. The picture itself is flawless and very well balanced: few close up, few traveling. Every camera technique serves only one purpose: telling the story. The black and white picture is the perfect fit and reinforces the 'baroque' like atmosphere as well as helps the audience focus on the feelings demonstrated by all actors. Feelings are really what make this 'quest for humanity' an exceptional cinematic experience. It is an 'initiatic journey'. We start with a descent in Horror, dehumanization and monstrosity; we climb back to decency and tolerance to eventually arrive at the door of 'humanism'. We need to remember that how we act is who we are. If we act like animals we are animals and if we act like human beings we in fact become human beings. In other words we are not human by essence but we become human through our actions. In this regards John Merick appears to be the human one among us...Once again and after 'Eraserhead' (1977), David Lynch is demonstrating his skills in terms of 'mise-en-scene'. He is comfortable handling weirdness and monstrosity and he does so with maestro, triggering our deepest fear, our darkest side and eventually the more human part of our body: our heart",The Elephant Man
194,roig27,Nothing will die.,9,14 June 2008,"This is an excellent film. Set in the style of _Murder on the Orient Express_ this Tudor movie is a classic of XX Century cinematography. Director David Lynch known for _Eraserhead_, his first cult film, is at his best in this affective tale of a deformed man of aristocratic origins. He goes to the Opera, the Ballet, the Teatre, the Modern Dance production and meet many people on his way to the Patis M'etro. This film in B & W is affective: Effectively, it is smash, a hit in tenderness, a success in cash. You will love it. The other productions of Director Lynch, _Dune_, _Paris, Texas_, _Blue Velvet_ are masterpieces: Anne Bancroft, of the Bancroft family of New York City, is in her best role as the Opera singer: Not to be confused with the Hitlerian singer-machine from the State of Vaticano: You will fly away in it.",The Elephant Man
195,jzathajenious,"Exquisitely crafted, but emotionally simplistic.",7,18 October 2011,"I loved the cinematography of this film, the lighting and the stark, crisp black and white image seemed apt for the environment; the dark cold streets of the 1880's East End, streets filled with the unfortunate, the dirty, the poor. In fact, Jack the Ripper was plying his trade at the same time John Merrick was being subjected to horrified stares from folk as the Elephant Man. the cinematography by Freddie Francis was truly the hero of the film for me.The acting as well, was of a very high caliber. of course with acting royalty on screen, your always going to get great performances. Gielgud, Hopkins, Hurt, and Bancroft all give wonderful performances. Gielgud, so measured and precise in his delivery of every syllable, Hopkins too, reflect the upper class doctor of the time. Bancroft, is just luminescent in her genuine desire to accept john as her friend. Hurt is very good as well, many may argue but i feel this is not his greatest acting role by any means though. he stammers platitudes ""ohhh, that is wonderful, beautiful, lovely"" etc etc. it is a very one dimensional performance. the grotesque makeup masks this lack of diversity in his acting to a great extent i feel.The emotional simplicity of the film is its major downfall in my opinion. it feels as emotionally manipulative as a Disney film at times, with its very black and white depiction of Merricks existence. he is treated as animal, then he is treated as an honored guest, everybody treating him as a child almost in their fawning over him. every new experience is met with Merrick's stammered breathless replies ""oh how wonderful, how lovely, how beautiful"". there are about 10 scenes with this scenario. Merrick getting a standing ovation by the crowd of upper crust theatre-goers, whilst he sheds a tear (for what reason, for the simple fact he is deformed?) is about as emotionally manipulative as it gets. i can say i was moved, but i felt manipulated afterwards by this feel-good moment.this does put a damper on what is otherwise an exquisitely crafted film. visuals and performances are wonderful, but the actual story and its simplistic portrayal of Merrick's emotional state mean its not a film i will be re-watching many times in the future. a very good film, but with its faults not a great one in my opinion. 7/10.",The Elephant Man
196,panchodh_12,We the Victorians,7,3 February 2016,"This movie touches upon many issues discussed in Academia by Michel Foucault, and I highly doubt it was coincidental. The Elephant Man is a character that could only come from the Victorian era and the rich duality that comes with it. The double personality of John Merrich, who goes from a gentle and refined man in the day to a poor beast that can only scream in the night, reflects the tension and evolutions of the power relations of that time. The oppressed goes from being a silent subject suffering from a brutal circus to being part of a much more subtle, scientific and bourgeois circus. Power structures are sharpened, but this comes together with an improvement of the objective welfare of the subject, who is now eternally grateful for this new form of control.David Lynch is a very clever guy, and he manages to really convey the feeling of the time, with the use of sounds, black and white, and dialogs. You feel the sadness of the Elephant Man, you share it. What does it say of us that we are so interested in these Victorian characters, that we can relate so much to somebody like the Elephant Man?",The Elephant Man
197,myrkeyjones,Heartbreaking,10,3 February 2007,"This film really shows off David lynch's versatility as a director, it is both heartfelt and disturbing in it's brutal cruelty. John Hurt is amazing as John Merrick, he injects so much innocence into the character, His first words on screen will absolutely melt your heart. It is a dense film, with some areas hard to sit through, but it is well worth it. It also cleverly layers themes of vanity and the concept of true beauty into the people outside Merrick's world. Hopkins is also brilliant, displaying a great deal of subtlety. The Black and White photography is beautiful and perfectly compliments the story. This is a very moving story, from a very brilliant film-maker. Recommendation: ""Bring a hankie, Masterpiece""",The Elephant Man
198,MatBrewster,Sentimental Lynch,8,3 May 2005,"Read all of my reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com David Lynch's second full length film contains the odd assortment of freakish characters we've become accustomed to in his film. Yet, despite one of the more outlandish characters he has ever put on celluloid, it remains his most sentimental.The Elephant Man is based upon the true story of John Merrick, a 19th century Englishman with massive deformities throughout his body. He performed in freak shows for many years until he was found by Dr. Treves who cared for him and placed him in Whitechapel hospital. It is his time in this hospital that the film concerns itself with. For here, Merrick is able to life, more or less, as a gentleman. He is well fed, well kept, and educated. He can read, write, speak eloquently and even begins to entertain well-to-dos of society.It is filmed beautifully in black and white. It is a very well made piece of cinema. Lynch, for the most part, stays away from his trade mark imagery and symbolism, and sticks to more traditional story telling, although the elephant involving opening sequence is straight Lynch nightmare. That the characters come from real life and not Lynch's twisted imagination only serve to add to the surrealism of the film.It has been said that Lynch is too sentimental in this movie. That he manipulates the audience too much. Ebert even goes as far as saying Lynch tricks the audience into believing that Merrick is a noble and courageous man. He suggests, that rather than being noble, Merrick is merely doing the best that he can, under poor circumstances. It is true that the film is sentimental. There is hardly a scene that does not prick the audiences emotions. Yet how can an audience not feel emotion when they see a kind, intelligent man live with such deformities. How many of us would dare to get out of bed each day with similar atrocities. And here, this man, though physically plagued, manages to keep up his spirits and even write and build card sculptures. It would be a poor director at that who could not produce a tear at such a sight. If we pretend it is not a noble feat for such a creature to retain his humanity and good cheer, while being constantly bombarded with inhumane indecencies are we any better than those who stand outside the carnival and jeer? Yet there is something in these critiques of sentimentalism. Lynch continues to use his tricks as a director to keep our eyes wet. There is a scene in which Merrick meets Dr. Treve's wife and breaks down with tears at her simple kind acts. His tears state that no one has been so kind to him as to treat him like a gentleman. Though effective, this is using the craft of film-making to do nothing but manipulate emotions. In other films I would lambaste this type of sentimentalism and chastise the audience for falling for it. Yet the overall sadness throughout the story makes me fall for it here. I cannot commend such use of it in film anywhere, and yet it works for me in this particular instance.Overall, the Elephant Man is a fine achievement for a young director. Lynch would go on to make more articulate, less sentimental films. But here we find him assured in his imagery and storytelling. He effectively sweeps the viewer into the emotional turmoil of such a sad, hopeless story.More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com",The Elephant Man
199,teodorodontosaurus,... who is the real monster?,10,25 April 2018,"The dramatic content is obvious in this movie; a major departure from Lynch's original style (remember that this is right after ""Eraserhead""). While ""Eraserhead"" is nightmarish, cold, highly disturbing and surrealist, ""The elephant man"" is dramatic and more stylized; and very dark; a somehow rare combination: dramatic and dark; it aimed towards a totally different direction - drama and biography. In ""Eraserhead"", Lynch shocked the audience with unreal nightmarish images and events, cold and emotionless characters and dystopian-ish images; here, his purpose was to leave the audience drowning in tears - there are characters full of emotions, emotional scenes, extreme sadness, sadness and again sadness and everything is marked with stunning and exquisite imagery related to the industrial revolution (+ symbolic imagery).

The excellent acting(esp. by John Hurt in the title role), inventive cinematography and an emotionally involving story would be the good things.

201,Rocketeer_Raccoon,"Aww, poor man.",9,18 September 2015,"Considering this film is based on the real life story of Joseph Merrick, the severely deformed man otherwise known as the Elephant Man, some things were changed from real life to give it fictional flare as well as Joseph Merrick's name being changed to John Merrick which I heard is an incorrect mistake. But what matters is this film is based off a real man who suffered with his tumour deformity who was mistreated and displayed at a freak show until one kind man, Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) took an interest in him and bought him into his own care at the hospital. Some parts were very disturbing and a lot of times you'll feel really sorry for the poor man being bullied by the wrong people but it's nice that there are people like Frederick who will give great kindness.Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt did a tremendous job playing their parts so well done to them. Now one would wonder why the film is in black and white, well I believe it was done this way for an artistic effect and it really does pay off, I suppose the film wouldn't be the same if it were in colour.And then all a sudden, the ending, I won't spoil what it is but it's one of the beautiful endings I've ever seen in my life and it made me cry.

This is a very sad movie. John Merrick is bullied and harassed by many characters. This will probably make you cry if you get sad easily. I didn't cry, but I just don't cry from movies. It did get sad though.
This movie is in black and white, so people might think it is boring because it is in black and white. But if you have any common decency, you won't care about the graphics. In fact, they made this movie in 1980 when color movies were possible, but they made it black and white on purpose to make it feel old, because this events on which this movie is based was a long time ago.

204,preposterous,9 out of 10,9,4 February 2005,"I wish I had as much time to comment on this movie as some of they put into this movie. I will try to make a sensible comment in a short space of time.It's not my favorite film, there are some problems with it. I'm not sure of the life of John Merrick (sp?) other than what is related by this film, but I would imagine the film would have been more challenging (to us, the viewers) if the deformed man wasn't so sweet, contrite, and appreciative. Perhaps the meanness of his treatment should have been reflected in his behavior. This would have presented us with a more difficult dilemma, of having to penetrate not only the visual aura of this sick man, but also a barbed personality.However, they took the easy way out of making John Merrick a wholly sympathetic character. The film delivers something of the black and white industrial age austerity of David Lynch's preceding film Eraserhead (which is sadly becoming hard to find). I thought Eraserhead was a more tightly focused on advancing those kinds of atmospheres.The acting in this film as one would expect, considering the quality of the actors involved, a stellar British cast. Just look at all the names. These are great actors and actresses.This film could have been better, but measuring it against the other films I know (including most of the films in the IMDb top 250), this definitely deserves a place even higher than it's been rated.

What astonishes me about that fact is that it's also a central theme for the movie: Don't judge a book by it's cover.I have seen more movies than I can count and this is by far the most emotionally human out of them all. There are several scenes which are so devastating, that you forget you're actually watching a movie. The way certain characters treat John Merrick are simply cruel. Especially after we find out what Merrick is REALLY like. On the outside, he's a disgusting mess, but on the inside...he's one of the kindest, most gentle characters that you can think of.The academy completely robbed John Hurt of a much-deserved Oscar for best actor that year. I'll be the first to say that Deniro's performance in Raging Bull was also amazing, but Hurt played his role in a way that no other actor in the world could have. I saw none of John Hurt in The Elephant Man...just 100% John Merrick.This film is almost perfect. I saw almost because I am still looking for flaws. So far, I haven't found any. The story is extremely uplifting and also very sad at the same time. The acting is out of this world, and David Lynch's directing really contributes to the greatness of the whole project. The last half-hour or so is especially noteworthy.

One should watch it simply for those two aspects alone. Hopkins puts in an average performance as his character feels far two dimensional even with the depth they try to give him. Lynch does Lynch things when it is unneeded, though at the time they would have looked avant-garde today they are Lynch things meaning someone who tries to be different but ultimately keeps doing the same thing. Thankfully he did not do too many of them and the movie keeps a steady grasp on reality.

215,Sewaat,"A Tragic True Story, Masterfully Told",8,20 July 2016,"Those who are already familiar with the real life case of Joseph (John) Merrick, AKA The Elephant Man would know that his is a very sad story. But in the right hands, such a complicated and sombre tale would make a very powerful motion picture. Thankfully, David Lynch's ""The Elephant Man"" is exactly that.This is one of the best films I've ever seen in years, without a doubt. As a simple Biopic, it lends itself well thanks to the historical accuracy which accompanies it. There's nothing worse than watching a film that's supposedly based on true account only for it to be over- flowing with inaccuracies that don't do the story justice. And while some fictitious changes were made to the story for dramatic effect, they are few and far between. The Elephant Man as a whole is very true to the real accounts in which it is based on.Victorian England was such an interesting time period. Some historians tend to glamorize it as a period of progress, which it certainly was. But this film looks at it through the eyes of someone who is incredibly unfortunate. And as a result, the scenery is gritty, dirty and full of mechanical set pieces. There isn't much humanity to be found here. It was a stroke of genius to shoot the film in stark, black and white. It gives off the sensation of looking at the film through old snapshots and photographs, as though we are looking directly into the past. Perhaps the most striking thing about the film is it's ability to throw a spotlight humanity's worst and most intolerant behaviours. One might even feel shame to know that John Merrick was treated so poorly by fellow members of the human race. But it is important that we acknowledge his suffering so we can remember that it is the content of someone's heart, not the features of their face, which we must judge someone by. This brings me to my next point. The cast of this film is superb. Anthony Hopkins shows his range as an actor who in this case, has not been cast in the role of someone sinister. His portrayal of Dr. Treves is admirable and saintly. Taking the role of the audience and responding to Merrick in a way I believe most of us would: with unconditional kindness and respect. His character is a statement which brings out the best and most noble of mankind. John Hurt completely disappears into the make up and character of The Elephant Man, giving what I believe is the best performance of his career. It must have been challenging to emote underneath such heavy prosthetics, and yet he manages to make us sympathize and support Merrick at every rise and fall of his character arc. Having been snubbed for the Oscar of Best Actor is an unforgivable sin of the Academy.This is an incredibly moving picture. I was hard pressed to hold back tears during it's final act. When seeing the story unfold through the lens of a camera, we feel more intimately close to the story and to the man himself. And if the memoirs of the real Dr. Treves are to be believed, after such a trying journey to be accepted as he is, Merrick's soulful line to him towards the end of the film is a relief to hear:""My life is full because I am loved.""",The Elephant Man
216,Cherubin,good but not great,7,11 December 2002,"""The Elephant Man"", rather than being all around great, is actually a mixture of good and bad. The good is that  , well, first of all, the cinematography is nothing less than amazing, feeling like a series of cutting edge paintings. For example, all the dark passage ways utilized really do seem scary and mysterious, the extended shot of the pipework is art at its finest, and the dream sequences are some of the most disturbing ever committed to film. Otherwise, the film has all around excellent acting (Hopkins as Dr. Treves is especially memorable, presenting the character as a gentle but realistic hero with self conscious doubts about his own virtues) and no punches are pulled in presenting the deformed main character being abused or making others feel uneasy. Indeed, in most of the scenes where Merrick tries to interact with people in a normal way, you can just sense how awkward the ""normal"" characters feel in spite of trying to act like his deformity does not matter. And when he gets bullied, he REALLY gets bullied (you´ll probably cheer when Dr.  Treves gives the abusive hospital worker a serious a-kicking in return). Otherwise, though, the problem with the movie is that Merrick is not really a well fleshed out character (no pun intended). The basic recipe for him is ""take a deformed person and make him stereotypically innocent and slightly socially retarded to show how isolated he was"". John Hurt conveys this quality well under a heavy makeup job but that´s pretty much the beginning and end of the character. Also, David Lynch, being David Lynch, usually focuses on getting the most violent shock value, absurdity, surrealist weirdness, or odd awkwardness out of most scenes. Plus, 1940s style melodrama and ""Eraserhead"" style surrealism, as good as they are on their own terms, are uncomfortably combined here. Hence, it sometimes even feels as if Lynch is making fun of the screenplay. All in all, though, it´s worth a look if you want to see something different.",The Elephant Man

It's were everyone tags along, kicking the outcast while he's down and no one will be pointed out or blamed since they are hiding behind each other, metaphorically speaking. It's a great cast you can't deny that, what I loved about it was that I actually felt that I was watching a movie from the past, it didn't feel like it was from the 80s, just make the picture and sound quality inferior and you could fool anyone. The great idea behind the black and white picture gives us a dull, yet magnificent indication of what kind of mood they are trying to distinguish. Of course I can't leave out the acting, Anthony Hopkins performance is excellent, the way he displays his characters compassion shined bright right through him, and understood completely what he was assigned to do. John hurt, playing John Merrick aka ""The elephant man"" portrays in a convincing approach the beauty and sincere sides of the elephant man who also is a very deep and intelligent man, still so very shy and anxious.",The Elephant Man
218,Lamprey,The most touching film I have ever seen,10,18 April 1999,"I see lots of films, and have a ""Top Ten"" list that only the most incredible of movies can enter.  However, upon seeing Elephant Man for the first time, it immediately broke onto that list which is dominated by Sci-Fi ""guy"" movies.The reason is that this movie is so heartbreaking, so sad, and yet so full of hope, there is little you can do to hold back your emotions while watching it.  I recommend watching it alone, for two reasons: 1) it is very painful and sad to watch and 2) the value is lost if you are trying ""not to cry"" or have something else on your mind (like talking to your friend).The performances are very well done, by Hurt, Hopkins, and everyone else in the cast.  The only gripe I have isn't really a gripe - the film isn't 100% true.  But it will make you forget all your problems for a while. Witnessing the life of ""John Mellick"" makes your own life seem like paradise.Even after repeated viewings this movie loses NONE of it's impact.

One of the best dramas I have ever seen, if not the best. I can't remember one in which I cried more than to this one, except the anime Little Princess Sara (Shôkôjo Sêra) and La Rose de Versailles (Berusaiyu no bara). And I think I would know because drama is my favorite genre! But those 2 anime weren't stories captured in 2 hours, but in more than a dozen!It's made in the crude ways of the 70's but even so, it's eviscerating at times. The most eviscerating fact is that it's made after a real story!! What!? Yes. A real story. Google wikipedia: Joseph Merrick - and you'll find it! Not that wiki can be considered fact but I don't think it lies in this particular matter. This is a man who's life needs to be investigated, and not for money. A little quote from wiki *Merrick left school aged 13, which was usual for the time. His home-life was now ""a perfect misery"", and neither his father nor his stepmother demonstrated affection towards him. The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick: ""I was taunted and sneered at so that I would not go home to my meals, and used to stay in the streets with a hungry belly rather than return for anything to eat, what few half-meals I did have, I was taunted with the remark-'That's more than you have earned."" *The 1st time I cried in this movie was right at the beginning when he 1st sat on a bed for years and I realized he doesn't speak because he is afraid. I wonder how many people realized that before it was obvious. What's obvious is that this is a masterpiece people have forgotten, the most terrible sin of cinematography who's supposed to keep it alive forever.A beautiful poem written by this wonderful person, Joseph Merrick - The Elephant Man:'Tis true my form is something odd, /
But blaming me is blaming God; /
Could I create myself anew /
I would not fail in pleasing you.If I could reach from pole to pole /
Or grasp the ocean with a span, /
I would be measured by the soul; /
The mind's the standard of the man.",The Elephant Man
225,DeathFish,Heartbreaking movie,9,1 March 2007,"The elephant man: This movie is based upon the actual statements of Dr. Frederick Treves from his time when he took care of Joseph (John) Merrick also known as ""The Elephant Man"". The fact that this is based upon real events just adds to the strength and sadness of this movie. The sheer story can shock and/or touch you when you here about it, but seeing this on screen, with such splendid acting performances, makeup and technical merits, simply just makes your heart ache with contempt and sympathy. The black and white footage mixed with the sad and sinister dark lighting gives this movie a gentle horrifying and yet at the same time calm mood. The music score simply enhances this emotional experience. I also like the way David Lynch has chosen to end/change some scenes, with this black fade-away, as if the viewer slowly closed his/her eyes to give the scene extra impact. We experience this alongside Dr. Treves and follow his emotional and mental states throughout the revelation of this dramatis personae; the elephant man. We feel sorry for John and pity him, but at the same time we sit curiously on the edges of our seats eager to get a glimpse of his face. We want to see him just as much as the customers we hate so much from the freak show. We look upon him as an attraction at a curtain point, whether we like it or not. We ask ourselves, just as Treves, ""Am I a good man, or a bad man?"" This is exactly what Lynch wants us feel at some point, he wants us to blame ourselves, blame humanity for the cruelty it possesses, and simply just respect John as the gentle person he is. Not to feel sorry or be ashamed, but to respect the humane content of a character. This movie is simply remarkable. 9/10",The Elephant Man

A better match in many ways than Dune, which worked stylistically but made no sense as a script in either long or short form.What Lynch does here, which eluded his previous work is bring a deft touch to the narrative whilst taking us on a nightmare ride into the darkest and saddest corners of humanity.Now that is much more than entertainment...that's art..unashamed and brilliant.

228,Elder_Yautija,Impressive and touching,10,8 August 2006,"One of my favorite movies to date is the real life-based story of Joseph (John in the movie) Merrik, aka the Elephant Man, a 21 years old Englishman living across the 18th and 19th century (am I right?) and whose whole body is severely deformed from a rare and incurable disease. It may sound strange, for a director, wanting to make a movie about a so profound disgrace happened to a man, and maybe inappropriate, but the portrait furnished by David Lynch of this unusual gentleman is one of the most touching, deepest, yet most impressive figures the history of cinema has ever displayed. It's presented in a wonderful b/w photography which helps you get into the dramatic reality, into the sadness of its story. Anthony Hopkins is simply amazing in the role of doctor Frederick Treves, a man whose intents of study and knowledge of the strange disease he's witnessed will soon bring him so close to the very soul of the Elephant Man, and yet he's not really sure if he's acting in John's or in science' interest. The carachter impersonated by John Hurt has nothing to envy to the most tormented heroes of Tim Burton's flicks, but the actor's performance, his suffocated voice, and deep artistic sensitivity define his beautiful soul much more than his appearance. In the beginning, this movie is very hard to watch, due to the fact that the disfigured facade of the Elephant Man is shown in all its dramaticity and some more sensitive ones could find it...heavy. That's what happened to me. All I can say is that after 30 minutes of movie I was in love with both the movie and its lead carachter and now this film stands in my personal top list of all time. It really strikes some chords..... Beautiful.",The Elephant Man
229,Jamalio,An unlikeley yet compelling follow up to 'Eraserhead.,9,17 January 2002,"This tells the devastating yet highly rewarding tale of John Merrick, a child born with a deformed physical disease on account of his mother being attacked whilst impregnating him, and consequently earned the nick name the Elephant Man.' David Lynch's directorial follow up to Eraserhead couldn't be less predictable- this is every bit a mainstream film, with the occasional flash of stylistic Joi de Vivre' that occupied the entire narrative of Eraserhead (industrial noise, abstract/nightmarish imagery of deformed faces).  The film loses a hint of perfection on account of its' slightly choppy editing (and too many fade outs) which makes it feel incomplete, but otherwise, this portrayal of a human being doomed to a constant freak show' attraction by exhibitionists (those who care for him are just as guilty as those who don't) is likely to reduce the most hardened viewer to tears 9/10.",The Elephant Man
230,Chihir0,Shocked by the story,10,4 June 2015,"The Elephant Man is a 21 year old boy with a lot of physical deformation and with a bad health condition. The boy is owned by Brutish Bytes, a person who uses it for financial benefits by presenting it in the circus as a freak, but in fact he is a freak itself. After a lot of suffering he has also some mental issues. But luckily Dr. Frederick Treves, manages to take him in care at the hospital where he works.This movie started for me with a lot of disappointment to humanity. The way John Merrick was treated was a shock to me, how animal people can be sometimes! Not only Brutish Bytes made me feel bad, but I couldn't believe that nobody at the circus didn't react.After Dr. Frederick took him under care, and after the way they treat him, a way that every human being deserve, bring us a different picture of John. In fact, the most touching part starts after the best treatment toward him. The way he reacts after the happiest moments of his life, made many wounds in my heart.The most touching movie I have ever seen. I have never been more disappointed with humanity. But when I reminded myself that this is based on a true story, I was shocked for 124 minutes.John Hunt had a great performance, too bad that Robert DeNiro had lifetime performance on Raging Bull that year. Not to forget Anthony Hopkins.Thank god David Lynch was the director of this movie. A great story like this, should have a great director like Lynch.

231,gunslinger861,true beauty truly comes from within,10,24 February 2010,"The title for my review although cliché' and absurdly simple. It is the truest statement that sums up this film. This film had a lot going for it from the beginning. Fist of all it was produced by Mel brooks,directed by David lynch,and features the acting talents of sir Anthony Hopkins,john Gielgud,john hert,and Anne Bancroft.The film starts out with a fairly self explanatory intro and then we are introduced to Dr. Fredrick treaves making his way through a Victorian London carnival. Whats great about this is that David lynch uses the same claustrophobic,industrial atmosphere that made eraserhead so disturbing and surreal. yet it completely works for London in the midst of the industrial revolution. Its shot in a sleek black and white that makes it look like it was filmed thirty to forty years prior,however its not grainy or scratched. Dr. treaves wonders into the freak show tent seeing the usual oddities. the fat lady,the bearded lady,Siamese twins,etc. He is drawn to display that is being given a great deal of attention. people are walking away,a woman leaves the exhibit sobbing.We hear a man arguing harshly with police man. saying things like ""i know my rights"" ""he is a freak,how else will he make a living"" only to be responded with This is an abomination. The man leans against the wall and says ""we have to move again my prize"". Automatically you don't like this man. He is a pathetic man who cares only for his own self. The kind of man who is soley responsible for the mistakes he has made yet will never admit to it. Instead he uses a man of much worse circumstances and exploits him for his own profit.intrigued the doctor follows the man back to a squalled basement slum,inquiring a view but is rebuked. However at the offer of money he is let in. Here we are shown one of the more iconic scenes of the film. As treves sees john for the first time,all we see is a single tear run down his face. He offers more money to examine the man at his hospital to witch he shows his colleagues and sends him back convinced he is completely retarded.As he arrives he is scorned and beaten by Mr. bytes, his owner. What compelled me about this scene is not the fact that Merrick is beaten,but rather his owner is so dependent on him as a freak and the obviously little money that comes in,that one has to ask who is the more pathetic creature? John is brought in and put in isolation where his face is finally revealed. It is also revealed that under a shell of disfigurement and deformity lies the soul of a man with great intelligence and a great capacity for kindness. As we progress john is introduced to an assortment of different people. some good and some bad. Even an actress of the London stage who befriends john and later towards the end dedicates the play she is in to him. Although at one point Dr treves is convinced that he may be no better then the monster he took him from.Later john is stolen with the help of an unscrupulous worker, and moved to a cheap freak show in France. In one of the harsher scenes we see john forced into a baboon cage.naturally this frightens the baboons. A group of freaks approach the cage and inform john that they have decided that he does not belong there. This however is not an act of ostracism,rather a true act of compassion.The last scenes of the film consist of the famous scene in the train station where john exclaims the immortal saying "" I am not an animal!,I am a human being!"". and finally the scene at the opera where john is excepted by London society and finally the end.Warning the last scene is a real tear jerker. john sits at his table putting the finishing touches on his paper model and hoarsely whispers""its finished"" although he is referring to his model. I also believe he is talking about something much deeper. As he stumbles to his bed we are set to a hauntingly beautiful choir score. As he stumbles we can truly see his pain. You know now that he is gonna die and you don't want him to because over the course of the film we see the man under the deformities and we don't want him to go. then he proceeds to take the pillows from his be and go to sleep like a normal man,something he never could do. The camera pans out to the night sky and deeper into the stars and we see a face appear and say "" nothing shall die"".I loved this film because it challenges the viewer on more then one level. The obvious is to watch a deformed man. It also challenges the viewer to look at his own self. To understand that man is capable of both great kindness and great cruelty. Also to take a look into the fear all men carry with them. the fear of the what he does not understand.i also loved the fact that although john Merrick was a victim of cruel circumstances,he did not allow himself to be a victim. He understood that although he was an outcast do to nothing more then simple genetics. He was still a man and must make it as all men do.I believe this film is more important now then it was thirty years ago. Especially in a culture that seems sometimes to be losing it's humanity. It shows that kindness is still real and true beauty lies within.",The Elephant Man
232,BeckyKmovieluver,"""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!""... Amazingly Moving",10,27 November 2005,"Wow... I have just seen this movie and I have to say 'The Elephant Man' moved me more than anything else I have seen in a very long time. This is a real classic and in my opinion Anthony Hopkins best ever performance. Joseph Merrick (or as he is known as in the film John Merrick) was born severely disfigured due to an horrendous congenital disease that left 90% of his body covered in tumours. As he grew up his condition worsened and by the age of 21 he was making a living in freak shows where he was presented to the audience as 'The Elephant Man'! John Hurt's portrayal of 'The Elephant Man' is simply amazing, moving, compassionate and deeply romantic! Whilst Hopkins approaches Dr. Fredrick Treves with genuine insight into the potential for great kindness and strengh that human nature embraces, providing a startling and moving contrast to the majority of other characters in the film who approach John with contempt and malicious intent. The movie really highlights the plight of Merrick when Victorian society knew and understood very little about what they dubbed 'freaks of nature' and often approached such unfortunate individuals with a mixture fear and perverted joy. Even those supposedly more educated individuals have trouble accepting Merrick for who he is: an incredibly intelligent, sensitive, loving yet horribly oppressed human being. Claiming that ""a hospital is no place for circus animals"" yet as John himself summed it up so brilliantly ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!"" It's amazing how much one man can endure, physical beatings, mental torture, and terminal illness yet still survive to prove to the world that their soul remains intact. As the film progresses the audience get to see beyond Merricks physical deformity and recognise him for the beautiful human being that he really is! The ending is brilliant, subtle and yet highly emotional with the death of John Merrick peacefully in his sleep. Yet now he is no longer alone and as the last line of the film sums up so perfectly ""Nothing will die"". Joseph Merrick will never truly die. His memory remains intact for anyone who has ever seen this film or heard his story. Whenever anyone accepts someone who is different to themselves they are remembering his name in the best way they know how. We can all say we know the story of 'The Elephant Man' but the question we have to ask ourselves is can we simply say that facts and figures are the best way to remember this man by? Suerly remembering through the love he shared with those closest to him is the only way to go forward.Definitely a film I would be proud to have as part of my collection! This movie is definitely of 5* quality and that is why I have given it a 10/10.",The Elephant Man

The scene where John Merrick meets Treeves' wife is one of the most affecting I've ever seen.  It used to bother me that the true life of Merrick differed so from his character in the movie (in reality, he capitalized on his deformity).

235,jephiachantharath,An enjoyable sob fest,8,25 October 2013,"This movie came to me as one of those films that was highly praised at the time but hasn't aged well, and of course I was wrong and ended up loving this film. Where to start, well perhaps in the style of it. I was surprised in the fact that this film was made in 1980, and is still in black and white. I'm pretty sure that this was an artistic decision by the director, and I applaud this idea. Sometimes throughout the film there are theses pans that I ever so enjoy, I'am in filmmaker right now and I do find the use of the camera quite refreshing. In case you don't what a pan is; it's not a cooking utensil, but it's a shot where the camera strolls along viewing a person, object, or scenery.Now I'll say that this has some fine good performances I must say, From John Hurt as the Elephant man, even to the despicable carnie owner. John Hurt doe such an amazing job at delivering his lines, for instance when he saw that Anthony Hopkins had children, he said it with such joy and I felt it, i felt his interest in what others find meaningless. I have to say this may be one of my most favorite performances ever, just in general, It's that good. Anthony Hopkins does well, but admittedly here does at times feel like a nonentity, at times you may forget that he was in the film.The security guard; at least that's what I thought he was, was so disgusting. I hated him so much, there's no human traits that I can find in him, he does some of the most horrible things to John Merrick (the Elephant man), teases him, shows him off to other people who tease and abuse him. Since this is based off a real person, I wonder if this really happened, and if it did I feel really bad right now. Finally the Carnie owner, at thought he wasn't going to be that big of a character, but the writing is so good that he's brought back in just the right time. When I see this person later in the film, I pity him. Using Merrick as a means to make a living; not a great one in fact, beating him and treating him like an animal. There's no redeeming qualities about this person, I don't care what state your in, you might as well be dead if your going to treat anyone like that.Final thoughts, This is really great for being so sad, and I don't think it's really in your face about it either. It does have very happy moments, and they do those very well. The sad and heart wrenching moments hit there mark, and the performances are good; great in fact.

Perhaps one of the most gut-wrenching moments in all of cinema. A person, a human being, loathed by society by his outward appearance. He understands why, but never himself sees the reason until later in life.There are some strange things in the film; the beginning of the film depicts an elephant and a woman producing a child.

This film is a beautiful melding of director david lynch's first feature, eraserhead, and a perfect sense of commercial mystery history swamped in surrealism. Not only does the elephant man stand out for his looks, but it seems all others in the film are so affected by him that their movements, pace and strange sense of fear are affected by the elephant man. Its a bizarre but digestible story about a once circus freak, and its loaded with custonm lynchian industiral eerie spooky factory ambiance...perhaps a reminder of hearing the outside filtered by being in the womb. I feel throughout the film that the audience become a type of elephant man themselves. The story surrounds a surgeon from london hospital who takes on the elephant man to study him and tryo to integrate him within society as best he can. The core to this story is humanity...being human despite oddities. This 4k uhd presentation is the best black and while 4k restoration i have ever seen. Virtually no grain...it was shot by master freddie francis with low asa film stock and its been preserved fantastically. The blu ray version is not too far off in terms of compariable quality. The 2.0 sound is dynamic and you can get enveloped by ambiances(the spooky ones) while finding the dialog flloating in front of you in 3d (kinda like how that sea dream 3d movie of the 70s had that jellyfish virtually floating in front of you), the extras are merely complimentary extras, but some of the interviews give some depth.

What was so sad was that the ""Elephant Man"" who was not even known by his name, was expected to live as an outcast because of his disease. All who he was as a person or all that he had to offer was discredited. It broke my heart when he said that he was a human being, not an animal.

241,buonanotte,Excellent,10,25 January 2008,"I think it's a pity David Lynch abandoned the path of a traditional screenplay in his following movies. ""The elephant man"" is like ""Eraserhead"" with the benefit of a realistic pattern. Basically what happens around John Merrick is a process of cleansing. At the beginning he's dirty, oppressed and isolated. Then he gets through a recovery period, while he receives assistance and increases his knowledge. At some point of the story (more or less 30 minutes before the end) he's left alone in order to double-check his new abilities. Then, obviously, we end up in a triumphant happy ending. I wish to see a film like that, instead of another ""Inland empire"". I've heard that it was considered a sort of sequel for ""Mulholland drive"", but I slightly disagree with this view. If you don't have a character, you don't have a story. If you don't have a story, you have an artworks gallery. That's what David Lynch is when he writes his own films.

242,coolmule,The most moving film I have ever seen,10,4 March 2003,"****Warning, Spoilers******The Elephant Man is one of my all time favourite films - a true story of human dignity and friendship, set against a background of the bigotry, brutality and hypocrisy of Victorian society. This is the only film which has ever made me cry - I defy anyone to watch the scene where John Merrick recites the 23rd Psalm and not shed a tear.David Lynch shot the film in black and white, which gives the whole thing a very gothic, nightmarish feel. It's not going too far to say there's a palpable sense of evil in some of the scenes. Set against this is a truly wonderful cast (including a very young Dexter Fletcher and R2-D2's Kenny Baker!). John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft are as good as you would expect them to be, but the film undoubtedly turns on absolutely magnificent performances from Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Frederick Treves and John Hurt (unrecognisable in his Elephant Man make up) as John Merrick.Both actors give performances that will leave you never doubting the inherent decency and goodness of the human spirit ever again. John Hurt plays a man who has every reason to hate the world he was born into, but instead displays amazing reserves of dignity, courage and kindness. Anthony Hopkin's Frerderik Treves gives hope to us all as his relationship with Merrick changes from one of pity and medical analysis to a genuine friendship. The dilemma at the centre of Hopkin's character serves to highlight the hypocrisy of the society he lives in - he may have rescued John Merrik from being a circus freak, but has that only succeeded in turning him into another exhibit, albeit one to be viewed by Treves' medical colleagues and upper class voyeurs?I cannot praise this film enough - as Barber's Adagio for Strings plays at the end you will never have felt so moved or uplifted. Do yourself a favour and see it at once.Rating - 10/10",The Elephant Man
243,ccharlie183,"didn't know what to expect, very moving",10,16 July 2010,"I never really expected what this movie would be like it was a strange film. at first i was a little put off by the style the opening sequence was a little confusing and cheesy but after 20 minutes or so i got into it, the really retro style of filming like its the 30's. the story its self is what kept me into it just to see how much suffering the guy goes through. this is first movie that actually made me cry since i was a child and it was really unexpected they just make u really feel sympathetic towards john hurts character. The most convincing part of the movie is the acting itself. Hopkins was superb throughout but a bow has to go to John Hurt for what should have been an Oscar winning performance. If u can handle an a retro-stylized and emotionally intense film then this is definitely worth a watch.",The Elephant Man
244,katrowellpa,My Fair Elephant Man?,9,8 September 2006,"This film is very different from most of Lynch's work and is beautifully filmed. As I watched it, I could not help seeing parallels to the infamous story of ""My Fair Lady"". Dr. Treves as Henry Higgins, takes the circus freak, teaches him how to speak politely, dresses him in nice suits, and makes him presentable to society. The Elephant Man is even allowed to attend the theater. The only problem is, as the film reveals, his life in society is not that much different than when he was in the circus--either way, because of his deformities, people want to come see him because of their curiosity. He is still viewed as a freak of society. Very few characters in the film really seemed to care about John Merrick, even though he seemed to believe that they were all his ""friends."" Everyone seemed to be using the Elephant Man to advance their own careers, or to make money. The only character, besides Dr. Treves, that seems to really be interested in the Elephant Man as a person is the actress, Mrs. Kendal. There is a fabulous scene when she comes to visit John Merrick in his room at the hospital.There are many heartbreaking scenes in the film and it really makes you think about the true nature of unconditional love and how we, as a society view people, especially those who appear different on the outside. How we are so quick to judge and how even the most grotesque looking person can be so beautiful on the inside. Very highly recommended.",The Elephant Man
245,Rosebud815,Five bags of popcorn,10,7 August 2016,"After seeing ""Eraserhead"", it seemed impossible to me that David Lynch could make a better or more unique film. Yet he did. The Elephant Man is a dark tale of the human spirit through prejudice and hatred. Perfectly cast, it features jaw-dropping performances from John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft. It is the most emotional film for me.Every time Lynch uses white noise, it is more effective than most soundtracks for me. That, and the seemingly random scenes of machine-men, sent me on a journey straight into my very existence, into my own emotional reality. The dark, dehumanizing parts of The Elephant Man and the eerie white noise are used as a contrast to the pure, humanistic moments. This dehumanization made the emotional moments of the film so effective for me because it forced me to feel the lack of humanity that John Merrick, The Elephant Man, had experienced his whole life. It took John Merrick 27 years. 27 painful, humiliating years where the only people he knew bought and sold him for entertainment because of his disfiguration. This is why The Elephant Man is so powerful to me - it is an exaggerated version of my own being, one that lets me feel all of the self waiting to be shared and the torture within. When I saw John Merrick finally be treated kindly by a beautiful woman for the first time, he bursts into tears, and I had a tear running down my eye. The Elephant Man lets me feel everything I would ever want to feel in my life, while showing me the stark contrast of what surrounds me.",The Elephant Man
246,An_Hedonic,a film everyone should see,9,8 December 2003,"The Elephant Man is one of those rare movies which gives one insight into the human condition, at its ugliest and most beautiful.  In a way it reminds me of The Miracle Worker in that these true stories (albeit fictionally embellished, both are accurate) demonstrate the incredible tenacity of the human spirit: both John (Joseph) Merrick and Helen Keller overcame insurmountable obstacles to be recognized as ""normal"" humans despite profound disabilities.From Wendy Hiller and Anne Bancroft in smaller roles to Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt in the major ones, everyone is perfect in this incredible movie. Although I'm not not a big fan of David Lynch this is one of his best, if not his best, movies.  John Hurt is amazing; one cannot help being repelled by his appearance, but before long you see beyond the physical into the beautiful, refined human inside.Anyone who can watch this film and not be moved to tears at least once may be in need of emotional counseling.  It touches on so many levels it's hard not to be affected at some point.  Unless you're a Pod Person...",The Elephant Man
247,redzon19,Keep in faith and try hard to be a better man,8,6 January 2011,"Although this movie was made in 1980, the color and atmosphere seemed to be way before the 80s. At that time, some argued about the preservation of the color film, so there came up with a few black and white films such as The Elephant Man. Fortunately, the black and white film fitted the story very well since it was based on a true case in the early 20s, thus the way it showed was just like the director wanted to present.This is not a horror film, yet it is filled with scary moments which are those when people showed their evil spirits over the innocent elephant man. Curiosity is one thing, but to tease someone despite their dignity and misery is not what a human being should do. However, things like these happened all the time in real life, and sadly there is nothing we can do about it. Thus, to maintain our merciful and compassionate heart is so important that we might accidentally become the accomplices once we are not careful enough.John Hurt and Antony Hopkins are the best parts in the movie, the way they acted made it so convincingly that they built firm friendship after knowing each other and learned from each other indeed. Due to my personal preference, I have to say Antony Hopkins is like the most elegant actor besides Daniel Day-Lewis in the generation. On the opposite, I don't like the way other characters performed, because dramatic acting is just not fit in the movie. Last but not least, best scene was the escape from his owner in circus, helped by other deformities made the most ironic impact in humanity.One thing I learned from the movie is that there are all kinds of people in the world, and you can't decide what others should do, the best way is just to keep in faith and try hard to be a better man.",The Elephant Man
248,mariabowman-66756,A tough film to sit through.,6,1 August 2018,David Lynch is a tough act to get into and The Elephant Man is perhaps his most mainstream work. But even a mainstream Lynch film is abstract and The Elephant Man- based on the true story of John Merrick is filled with imagery and allegories that might bore the watcher. Make no mistake- this is a good movie and the performance of John Hurt as the titular character is so good I think it's a joke he did not win an academy award for it. Hauntingly photographed and well acted by everyone from Anthony Hopkins to Anne Bankcroft this is an artistic film and needs a certain mindset to be viewed.,The Elephant Man
249,OldTree,A hundred per cent film,10,19 November 1998,"This film tells the true story of John Merrick, who suffered from a rare disease (multiple neurofibromatosis). His case was very severe. In addition to the enormous skin growth he had a misshapen head of almost unimaginable dimensions.Because of the heavy make-up, John Hurt was forced to portray the man mainly with his voice and he has done the difficult task seemingly effortless. For example the very moving scenes at Dr. Treves' home or when he asks the doctor hesitantly Can you cure me?"" and a calm reaction follows the negative reply.It doesn't take long to hate the two evil characters of the film (a compliment for the actors). Bytes, the owner"" of Merrick (he's the greatest freak in the world"") and the night porter of the hospital, who forces Merrick to look into a mirror.The presentation of 19th-century England is perfect, thanks to a wonderful black and white photography.It's evident that everyone involved in this picture has given 100 percent. A touching film like no other, one of the finest moments in cinema history.",The Elephant Man
250,Evan Anderson,One of the greatest,10,24 September 2002,"This was a truly great and touching movie.  It's hard to give a review because it really has to be seen to be believed.  Hopkins and Hurt are terrific.  This has to be one of the best by David Lynch and that's saying a lot considering the obsessed Lynch fan I am.  One of my friends have begged me to see it at a party but he and I were outvoted by Shining fans.  Anyway this movie will make you cry.  John Merrick may look like a monster but he is a caring, kind, intelligent, respectful, and above all great man.  It's the people that discriminate against him, ridicule him, and use him that are the monsters.  Several scenes in the movie can be rather disturbing (one is hard not to turn away from) but that's what makes this movie so powerful.  I don't see how anyone can put down this film and say it is not great.  Even if you hate David Lynch's other movies you'll probably still like this one. If it didn't win any of the eight academy awards it was nominated for it would have been an injustice.  You have to see it to believe it.  10/10",The Elephant Man

This film is truly remarkable, to put it simply. I believe this is David Lynch's best film, and as I stated in the title, in my opinion it is the best film of all time.The Elephant Man is a throwback film that shows us the life of a man that has been judged his whole life on his abnormal outward appearance. I could break down the plot and messages of this film, but that has been done numerous times in the reviews on IMDb. What I will say is this; The Elephant Man is timeless, and even if you don't like older movies or even any of David Lynch's other films, give it a chance. I had this movie on my ""watch list"" for a very long time, and for whatever reason decided to put off the viewing until recently. Whatever is holding you back from watching this beautiful film, forget it. I can almost certainly promise you will not be sorry.In summary, this film should be considered as one of the best of all-time, and left me speechless when it ended.

254,RabidED990,Beautiful,9,15 October 2007,"The Elephant Man is a simply beautiful movie. Everything about it is done with such a subtle, frank beauty and honesty that it is a truly difficult quality to put into words. It is an exceptional film.These qualities are truly remarkable given what the movie could have been. With such a topic, The Elephant Man could have been anywhere from pretentious drivel to an exploitation film, or could have simply missed the mark. True, the writings on which the movie was based are quite venerable, but the possibility that this could have been an absolutely awful film was certainly still there.One of the major reasons The Elephant Man works the way it does is that everything about it feels, well, right. Natural. Take the movie's most obvious characteristic: it's filmed in black and white. Now, there are a million little reasons why this works so well, each is too small to get into properly. The fact, however, is that it works. It works marvelously, actually. Another 'right' thing about The Elephat Man is David Lynch's direction. Every scene is important, every one with a purpose. The film never once becomes boring or starts to drag. Not a second is erroneous. However, the audience also gets 'the full story,' so to speak. When the movie ends with Merrick's death, the audience is sadly and strangely satisfied with this conclusion, and all the prior events that build up to it.John (in reality, Joseph) Merrick himself is a lovely character. Lynch's presentation of him to the audience is brilliant. John is grotesquely disfigured, but we aren't repulsed by him. By that same merit, we don't automatically feel sorry for him because of his condition. Instead, the audience simply accepts John Merrick. We come to know him not as an elephant man, but simply as a man. The compassion the audience feels for John is for him as a man. When he is harassed and beaten, we feel his indignation. When he is accepted and respected, we feel his joy.John Hurt's performance as the title character is great, and is probably one of the greatest and most underrated portrayals of all time. Everything from the voice to the body language is completely convincing and sincere. The subtleties of his performance are something that is often overlooked. From the nervous confidence in all of his actions to the frankness in some of his reactions (when he is forced to view himself in a mirror, the startled scream he emits conveys about a dozen different things, each one of them feeling genuine), everything about the title performance is done so perfectly and fits so well that we don't even notice most of the time.All in all, The Elephant Man is a great movie, and is certainly deserving of its place on the Top 250.",The Elephant Man

Anthony Hopkins is marvellous as Sir Frederick Treves. He clearly shows his concern and friendship for the misshapen John (Joseph) Merrick. The scene were he defends John against the evil porter is magnificent.Freddie Jones (who plays the evil circus owner) is marvellous! Clearly brilliant acting.But the praise mostly should go to the man himself, John Hurt. He's brilliant and shows us the real John Merrick as he would have been. And his acting brought me to tears the whole time.This movie is magnificent and I am shocked it didn't win any Oscars, cause it should have!Bravo!

256,jpriest75,A Parable of the Human Soul,10,4 June 2009,"The Elephant Man is the single most underrated film in the history of American cinema. The performances were nothing less than flawless, and the atmosphere of the story, brought to life by a combination of hauntingly beautiful music and being shot in black-and-white, is other-worldy. I will break down every aspect of The Elephant Man so that I can explain exactly how this movie made me feel.1.) Jon Hurt plays the eponymous lead, Joseph Merrick, a sufferer of Proteus Syndrome who is flaunted as a sideshow freak. Rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins,) Merrick is shown humanity and that there are those in the world who will see him for his inner beauty, rather than his outer deformations. Hurt's performance in the film, which was nominated for an Oscar but did not win (unbelievable,) was moving on so many levels. The most prominent of course is his sheer inability to comprehend the cruelty he is faced with; this is expressed in the infamous line, ""I am not an animal! I am a human being!"" I swear to God, I cried my eyes out.2.) Anthony Hopkins plays Frederick Treeves, an English doctor who treats and befriends Merrick after rescuing him from the circus. Treves is the symbol of the essential goodness in people. Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors of all time, partly because of this role and partly because of his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter (Yes, that's right, the infamous Hannibal the Cannibal.) Treves is one of the few, and possibly the only person to show genuine affection for Merrick in the film.3.)The opening theme of the film gave me an unusual feeling. I wasn't sure how i was going to feel about the rest of the movie; it gave me a sort of hollow, foreboding sense. The eerie circus music also sent an additional shiver up my spine.4.) The most emotional scenes in the film, all of which obviously center themselves around Merrick, are as follows: 1. The scene in Joseph's bedroom when a group of drunken criminals break in and assault him, throwing him around and lifting off the ground, all the while circus music plays in the background.2. The chase through the train station, when an exasperated Merrick is run down by a crowd of angry onlookers. He is backed into a corner with, his malformed face exposed, and exclaims: ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I... am a... man!"" 3. The final scene of the film when Merrick commits an act of self-euthanasia by lying on his back to sleep, which he is aware will kill him. After examining a painting of a small girl lying flat, he imitates her in a final attempt to be ""normal,"" resulting in his implied death. He drifts off to sleep as the words of his deceased mother ring out in his head. ""Nothing will die.""I have heard some critics say that after seeing the film they did not know what is said about the human condition. This angered me. The message was clear and simple, and that is: ""No matter the condition of the soul, the is still human."" This theme is wrapped up so efficiently in the film's most iconic line. For anyone looking to watch a great drama film, I highly suggest The Elephant Man.",The Elephant Man

258,Alex_Priest,There is Justice in this World...,9,5 December 2006,"What a Beautiful Movie this is.A truly Unique experience. This (reality based)story is about a man that was heavily disfigured and ugly on the outside but beautiful and extraordinary on the inside.A true example of how people should,but never will,be.You may be pure,kind,gentle,the kind of person and friend everyone would like to meet,but if you differ from the others(because that was John's problem,he wasn't ugly,he was just different from the others.If he was born on a society formed of ""Elephant-Mans"" he would have been absolutely normal)your virtues count nothing at all and there are really few people who can appreciate you,usually open-minded ones(as Hopkins here). What really touched me though,except from the great story,is a message that I personally found: ""THERE IS JUSTICE IS THIS WORLD"".Kindness too if I might add. When John was ""tortured"" by that hospital-guy(and his ""owner"" too)I kept saying inside of me these words:Justice exists,in this world or in the other.John will be awarded for his kindness and all those who transformed him into a way of entertainment will be punished. I must admit that if John had died that night the whole bunch of persons entered the hospital and he was kissed by those women and spilled with wine,while the responsible of this situation managed to get away clean,I would have supposed that in the afterlife everything would have come to its right place.But ,since this wouldn't be shown,the movie wouldn't have the same impact on me.What if in there is no afterlife or if there is no justice in the afterlife?I don't fully believe those last lines I wrote,but I don't negate them either. Luckily enough,there is justice in this world... John,even in an ugly body and in a terminal condition at his 21st year of age only,found what he wanted:Love and Acceptance by people,at least by some of them. And the responsibles for his bad times got caught too. I would like to see what would Mr.Bytes(John's former owner)do in a foreign country without his ""treasure""to feed him...same goes for that hospital guy,he would have to find another job,plus get another judgement when his time would come to pass on the other side...To conclude,this movie faithfully depicts how people from a ""darker"" age(but not too different from ours-see Jews,Negro's etc.) act against something that is considered ugly and different.I advise it to anyone who truly believes that : ""Despite our differences,all humans are Equal""",The Elephant Man

I was afraid of start crying or to have pity or to feel sorry or having all type of sad emotions all together.Movies of this nature, with people with such denigrating conditions are usually sorrow and at the end you feel that you were in hospital of hopeless people, this movie brings you from sadness to happiness, to reality, but most of everything to understand what the human race is capable and that is: a melting pot of feelings from the most good to the most evil.Even though the elephant man knew that his ill was incurable, that he might have had an inconsolable childhood, that he was treated like a freak even worse than an animal, he was a normal person, smart and really sociable. Similar to real live, most people just see the exterior and don't see inside, most of the times the opposite happens when you see beautiful people with an ugly heart, this movie was great in showing all the contrary. In the bright side, there are and always will be people that help others and don't worry about their external characteristics and their actions resonate louder and louder, in a way that fights the barriers of social classes, fame and time.In summary, it was a really a great experience to watch this movie, please watch it without prejudice.",The Elephant Man

264,omelette007,The best and worst of humanity,10,12 March 2012,"...are to be found in The Elephant Man, David Lynch's masterful follow-up to his debut, Eraserhead. In many ways, this is an enormous departure from the utterly bizarre Eraserhead - it is a polished drama with well-developed characters and a clear-cut storyline. However, there are certainly artistic similarities, and maybe even thematic ones. There are a few strange Lynchian flourishes to be found in The Elephant Man, and the black-and-white images and industrial sounds are reminiscent of Eraserhead. Both films also are sympathetic portraits of outcasts. However, The Elephant Man is ultimately a very different beast than Eraserhead, and distinctly different from most of Lynch's other works. This is a deeply compassionate, achingly sad film. John Merrick's story is heartbreaking enough on its own, but when told with Lynch's intimate, graceful approach and John Hurt's entirely believable and dignified performance, it's just about too sad to bear at points. But The Elephant Man also shows the moments of beauty and joy in Merrick's life. It may be a movie about the tragedy and injustice of human cruelty and ignorance, but is equally about human compassion, love and faith. This is one of those rare movies that everyone needs to see.",The Elephant Man
265,mrlespaul,"The good ones, the bad ones and the very ugly one",9,23 March 2005,"David Lynch surprise a lot of us with the story of John Merrick (a great John Hurt), a Circus freak of the XIX century which has his face and body totally deformed, to the point that people frightens when they see him. He lives with his ""owner"", Bytes (Freddie Jones), a really mean man, who gets paid for showing him in a cage, in a vulgar and horrid spectacle. But one successful Doctor (Anthony Hopkins, sober and good as always) in London finds John in a Carnival and he wants to help him.At the beginning, the only thing he wants is to show the man (just like the other man used to do) in an anatomy class for doctors, but once he get to know John a little bit, he gets a room for him at the Hospital and he protect him from Bytes, from whom he had been stolen.At first, John seemed to be dumb and stupid, but after a while, we noticed that he wasn't any of those things: he can talk (he has some difficulties but he can) and he can also read (not a common skill at the time). But what really shocks Doctor Treeves and us is the fact that John is the most pure and gentle man we could ever imagine. He is incredibly kind and sensitive, and he feels that he had found a friend in the Doc.The fact is that John became very famous in the city just for being deformed and living at the Hospital, and with him became Doctor Treeves very popular.And here is one of the keys of the whole film: Dr. Treeves ask himself whether he's good or bad, because he understands that he made the same that Bytes, he won something by showing the monster.But what I think is the most important element is the fact that John could be the purest person in the world, gentle, kind and polite, but he is so extremely ugly, that people can't really love him. I know this could sound crazy in some way, but I beg you to be honest and ask yourself if you could. Remember this scene in which an old couple visit him in his isolated room: remember the expression in their faces... he can be the best man ever, but he's still a monster and we suffer every time we see him.So, we get to see that there are good people (like Merrick or Treeves or the other freaks from Circus), there are bad people (Bytes and some that I rather not mention) and there is also ugly people. But maybe we are some kind of a mix of all this...The plot is very good. The acting is good as well (it is really funny how a lot of us, including me, say that John Hurt performance is great, in spite he is wearing a mask and a lot of make up from the beginning to the end, and he has almost no expression in it!) and this is until now, the best movie i've seen made by David's Lynch peculiar brain.",The Elephant Man
266,johannesjt09,Beautiful and sad,7,13 April 2020,"The Elephant Man is a beautiful film about several things: the two very distinct human characteristcs; compassion and cruelty, aswell as the curiousity that is John Merrick.It is a tale based on the life of the actual person Joseph Merrick with some dramatic changes to his life story. It may be a David Lynch film but the storytelling is very classic, similar to other stories of the genre like Beauty and the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame.We follow the heavily deformed man John Merrick who everybody seems to treat as a monster or rather an animal until he is helped by the doctor Frederick Treves. Frederick sees the humanity in John and also discovers that behind all those tumors (and makeup) is an actually very sensitive and intelligent man.So what did I think? Despite it's lack of Lynchian mind trips it is still very well made with excellent photography and great acting from both leads. It is almost impossible to not like the compassionate doctor or the sensitive John Merrick.I'm sure the film contains many secrets but the ones that were easy enough for me to spot was the symbolic significance of the cathedral model that John builds which may be a reference to The Hunchback of Notre Dame or that John is simply Jesus as hinted at in the ending phrase ""nothing will die"" and there are quite a few similarities between those two stories as well.
A lesser obvoius symbol is that elephants are usually said to be wise and intelligent which John Merrick also is.You can still tell that David Lynch directed this movie without the help from imdb or the credits, there are a few weird mind fog trip things going on just to a fitting degree and in appropriate places. The film also keeps you at the edge of your seat to the very end because you are always waiting for terrible things to happen to John and you really don't want it to.in other words I recommend you watch it.//Johannes T",The Elephant Man
267,myownme777,A Film For Those With A Heart,10,1 November 2013,"If you want to know if you or someone else has a heart, watch this film. If you do not feel something, sadness or anger, while watching this film then i'm sorry to say, you are heartless. David Lynch directs the story of John Merrick (Joseph Merrick was his real name), unfortunately known as The Elephant Man because of his deformities. Unfortunately, this film is all I know about the man, but it has inspired me to find out all I can about his life. I had heard an unfortunate rumor that he was considered a suspect for Jack The Ripper. But if this film holds any truth, then it could not even be a possibility. I hope at least that this film captured the true John Merrick, which is a man with a heart. Not many films make me cry but this one most certainly did. It shows how cruel people are, especially towards those who are different from themselves. But it also shows people with heart who treat him with the utmost respect and who truly do feel for him, unlike those who abuse and use him for a buck. I can see this movie in life itself with all it's beauty and cruelty. David Lynch directs seemingly using inspiration from classics such as Freaks, Frankenstein and his own, Eraserhead, all in black and white such as this. If I have any problem with this film it would have to be, and i'm sorry to say, Anthony Hopkins. His acting in this I find rather odd, and this coming from a fan of David Lynch, who i've seen just about everything by, so having the knowledge of Lynch's odd characters. But something seems off by Hopkins performance that I can't quite put my finger on. He seems tired, confused and upset even, as if he and the director did not get along well. It's not that his performance is necessarily bad, otherwise I would have given this 9 stars instead of 10. But it's John Hurt that does an amazing job with the character that he portrays. The make-up is incredible that I was surprised to see that it wasn't done by either Rick Baker or Stan Winston but rather by a man named Christopher Tucker. In my opinion this film should be mandatory viewing for all and used as a ""life skills"" course on how to be and how not to be as a human being. This world would be a much better place if we all treated one another equally, differences and all.",The Elephant Man

The Elephant Man is one of the more mainstream, straightforward narrative films by the auteur but even a mainstream Lynch film is abstract and The Elephant Man- based on the true story of John Merrick is filled with imagery and allegories that might bore the watcher. Make no mistake- this is a good movie and the performance of John Hurt as the titular character is so good it is a shame that he did not win an academy award for it. Hauntingly photographed and well-acted by everyone from Anthony Hopkins to Anne Bankcroft this is an artistic film and needs a certain mindset to be viewed.",The Elephant Man
269,Emre-kyncu68,Elephant Man,7,30 August 2020,"David Lynch, one of the few directors in the world, appears in 1980 with the movie Elephant Man. He chooses a successful actor like Anthony Hopkins, who will be awarded an Oscar for the lead role. The film focuses on the doctor's relationship with a man who resembles an elephant, played by Anthony Hopkins. The acting is very successful in the movie. It's a movie that makes us empathize with Elephant Man. But the movie is a bit weak in terms of plot. The doctor finds Elephant Man. He's taking him to the hospital. Elephant Man is experiencing an unfortunate abduction, but he returns in a short time, is admitted to the hospital and begins to live happily ever after. They fill in between scenes that will have a smile on the faces between the doctor and Elephant Man. You never get bored while watching, but you don't feel like watching a big plot. The acting is successful. I could not hear very memorable music in it. The plot is weak. Production is appreciated. The elephant man's makeup opens a new era in the era. Despite being black and white, the film does not stand out at all. In short, everyone should watch. But do not have high expectations. My rating for the movie is 100/76.",The Elephant Man

I know this may sound stupid, but it was extremely hard, hurting, devastating to see all the abuse and discrimination a person can get just because of his appearance. Sadly, it made me think of how many feel dehumanized not only by their physical capacity, but emocionally.
By a lot of very sweet moments, the protagonist speaks and moves so tenderly I wouldn't think it's John Hurt behind a mask. There's just some deliciousness in the quality of the image in black and white that makes the film even more touching. This adorableness, in my opinion as a teacher, makes it a perfect movie for students to enjoy and learn the most valuable lesson I couldn't ever provide like the film can: everyone deserves respect, understanding and empathy, no matter how they look or where they come from.

""The Elephant Man"" is a film where emotions and the human spirit really show. A film about the development of humans. Just because people are deformed, does not mean they are useless, or a waste. In this story, its about an Englishman who was born differently than everyone else. Now what I admired about this film is how its acting is done by John Hurt as John Merrick (Elephant Man). Such a disgrace a man like him must have lived through.If anyone has a heart for films and loves teary-eyed films, this is probably for you. Its much different than most of David Lynch's films, but it shall be remembered for its beauty and sadness that John Merrick must have felt.

277,The_Centurion,Despite all the ugliness this is a film of absolute beauty.,10,5 April 2008,"""The Elephant Man"" is overwhelming. Never before, not ever, have I been so emotionally moved by a figment of cinema, or piece of music, or any other work of man. To admit that is hard for me, but to neglect doing so would be to rob this film of what it is due. This is the most arousing cinematic accomplishment, perhaps, in the history of motion pictures.This is also the true story of a man, a freak, who was absolutely vulgar and disgusting to the eyes. Maybe he was the ugliest man in history, and was certainly treated as if that were true. He was unceasingly beaten, caged, mocked, and exploited. Women screamed at the sight of him and men were repulsed. However, despite living like an animal, despite being treated as one for most of his life, John Merrick possessed an unwavering kindness and civility that made his condition utterly heart-breaking.Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt are two of the finest modern actors. To watch them both at their best in ""The Elephant Man"" was the only way to do this film justice. Dr. Treves (Hopkins) was the character through which we felt our own moral questions arise. Did we look on John Merrick (Hurt) with a purpose of compassion, or was it to satiate some inherent desire to point and stare? Certainly at the outset I was merely curious to gawk at Merrick, and at first, looking upon him made me curl my nose at the sight. But as the story progressed I began to see his inner beauty. And it moved me almost inexplicably.There are many instances of cruelty towards Merrick throughout the film, but this is not what defines it. Despite all of the ugliness in ""The Elephant Man"" it is a thing of absolute beauty. There is a simple sweeping elegance, displayed in wondrous black and white, that unwraps itself in moments of terror, sadness, and joy. And when Merrick, even after an eternity of horror and injustice waged upon him, shows that his heart is bigger than all of it, it will set yours to flight.I see God in this picture, and I cannot comprehend any grander praise to give.",The Elephant Man
278,lukedela,For anyone with a heart,9,8 July 2006,"Easily David Lynch's most accessible film and undoubtedly a classic that is still heartbreaking for me to watch. 'The Elephant Man's' accessibility is undoubtedly owing to Lynch's decision to sparingly use his surrealist style. Lynch's typical traits as a filmmaker are only really evident when relating to Merrick's mother. Also unusually for Lynch, the film has such a positive message and contains such universal sentiments about being an outsider and the desire to be normal that it is difficult not to connect with the film on some level.The ending is one of my favourite scenes ever and is unspeakably beautiful with John Merrick dying and his mother appearing in the sky telling him that 'nothing will die'. His mother, meeting him in the afterlife, becomes the angel that he envisioned. It is really difficult not to react to such a powerful scene and is indicative of the films overwhelming effect on an audience.John Hurt gives a great performance in the role of John Merrick. His acting really arouses sympathy for John Merrick, giving his character a polite and simple friendliness that only contributes to the tragedy of the film.The soundtrack is also perfectly used in 'The Elephant Man' not dominating the film but rather adding to the haunting and melancholy atmosphere of the movie. Silence is also suitably used to add tension to scenes.Although 'The Elephant Man' has a PG rating it is certainly not a film I would recommend to children as it is a disturbing film which is at times extremely discomforting to watch. The human exploitation which Merrick faces from the night porter in the hospital is a good example. I found it such a draining experience to watch as it is an entirely believable account of the treatment Merrick would in reality have received because of his appearance.Although not my favourite film by David Lynch, this will always remain a personal favourite. A film that I probably will not revisit to often but when I do will always have a profound effect on me.",The Elephant Man
279,theriddler,"This ""story of the human soul"" can't decide what it wants!",4,13 June 2002,"I saw this supposed masterpiece this week and was pretty surprised people didnt see its flaws. i see three major flaws in the movie.Note: There are what could be called spoilers in this review, but then again there arent really secrets in the movie...
First, the beginning and ending sequneces try to be mystical and deep-but theyre not. They look and feel stupid.Second, the costume for the Elephant Man was, at the start of the movie, gruesome and disturbing-because they showed him so little. But as the movie wore on and we were continually exposed to it, the cosatume slowly begins to lose its shock value, and it becomes almost amusing at how unrealistically deformed this man is. I think that the movie, although I know this denies not only the title but some of the basis of the story, would have benefited better by a deformed man, but not THAT deformed, past the point of any man ever to come to the public's attnetion.Third, and most important, was how David Lynch/ the screenwrite wavered between values. One moment (i.e. when The Elephant Man is being abused by the drunk man and his friends at the hospital) the movie seems to be expressing a particularly dark, pessimistic view of human nature. Yet, at the end of the nature, The Elephant Man ahs become a popular commodity, able to attend high society plays and receive standing ovations. This is so stupid its overwhelming. How can one crowd beat him and treat him like a freak and yet another give him a standing ovation at a play. In reality, as sad as it is (and that sadness should have been conveyed instead of this wavering between the two), a man that deformed would have to be a recluse, and never come into the public for fear of harassment and ridicule.",The Elephant Man

One scene shows a French man spitting at his ""owner"" for taking advantage of a such a majestic creature... Not an elephant, not an animal... but a human being, a man. It seems hopeless for him, until one person, a doctor, played brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins, takes his hand, and leads him to a place of beauty... A theater... He gives him hope again...

282,MatthewTHuff,Under The Ugly Within The Beautiful,9,25 November 2013,"To start off with the movie the elephant trampling on the mother was a bit confusing to say the least, but later on in the film Bytes (the owner and freak show host), tells Dr. Frederick Treves about how this disfigured man came to be. Dr. Frederick Treves in the first part of the film (based in England), was visiting a circus when he fell upon a freak show . Feeling a bit curious to what was in this entrance (especially when it was certainly a private entrance). The English police shut down the Byte's Elephant Man sideshow presentation because, quote the chief of police, "" It degrades anybody who sees it, even the poor creature himself"". This action could of had something to do from the startled, crying, and frightened lady walking away from the side show.Dr. Frederick Treves,(in the next scenes), is working on a man that got into a machine accident, mentioning to Mr. Hodger how their had been quite a number of machine accidents lately. A boy enters with a message, Dr, Frederick wants to see Elephant man for himself. This part of the film made me deeply sorrowful for the poor man; when Dr. Frederick Treves blankly starred at the disfigured human with tears creeping down his face. I myself felt that Bytes was an abusive animal in the beginning of the film when he pushed, yelled and mistreated Elephant Man like he wasn't human.This was the brief glimpse of how this relationship with Elephant Man(John Curt), and Dr. Frederick Treves( Anthony Hopkins) came to be to blossom this magnificent movie. I loved the Rome and Juliet scene, it was inspirational, and Mrs.Kendall(Anne Bancroft) played a giant role in bringing the Elephant Man's hopes high to becoming a regular human being. When Mrs.Kendall played that poem skit out of the book changed my perspective on life, and showed me a great life lesson, even know you might not be perfect there is someone that loves you. The night porter ( Micheal Elphick), along with Bytes, tried destroying the Elephant Man's dreams of becoming normal, in which very menacingly, decry him to the public. Both Bytes and The Night Porter were the perfect resemblance of bullies and stereotyped society today.Uses of dramatic experiences in this film are well written and love,despair,frightful occurrences, yet a hint of humor, and overall inspirational was displayed in perfect fashion in this film. To think even today some people look down and mistreat others, this film resembles todays society and the corrupt cruel world we live in. A surrealistic film indeed.

It made me feel sick. Made me feel hollow and depressive. There isn't one little spark of the delightful in this movie. There is only the bottomless indulgence in the bizarre and noir. This is not a portrayal of the human misery. This is a wretched exploitation of it. The fine line, after which this stops being sincere and pure, in a way it should have been, and starts wallowing in the ordure, only for it's own amusement and pleasure, is crossed. The elephant raping a woman at the very beginning is a clear indication that Lynch, in this case at least, was more distorted than it was suitable and necessary.I am not so convinced in Merrick's inner beauty either. I simply do not know what this man was like. This movie didn't appoint me to that. It was not about his personality at all, he couldn't have been a living machine that endures that much terror with absolutely no consequences to his innocence? If it was to show the contrast between the ugliness of the world that fit so well with his external ugliness, and the splendor of his persona on the other side, it failed. One extreme doesn't necessarily bring the other to life. He was presented as a puppet with no real human trait, a disposable fiction. Him shouting ""I am a man!"", as sad as it is, is simply not enough... So in a way this movie isn't black & white. It is black & gray.But real Merrick was probably more prudential and clever.

It begins with Dr. Treves, the film's other main protagonist, discovering and then going on to save Mr. Merrick. The film chronicles the rest of Merrick's life, up until his death in 1890. In typical Hollywood fashion, the facts of the real man's life are largely ignored in order to create a more dramatic viewing experience. For example, it appears he was not mistreated by his freak show promoters, and even expressed gratitude towards them according to Treves. His exhibitions in Europe also occurred before he was ever admitted to the London hospital, with the obsessed former promoter who kidnaps him story line completely fabricated to create peril. Merrick was in fact swindled when in Europe and able to return to London without assistance from anyone. That would seem to indicate he was a far more independent man than the film presents him as.The Treves character is given an over-inflated role, as although he did care for Merrick and some of the film's scenes are based on real events, many are embellished heavily.Lynch does not so much pull at the heart strings, but attaches them to a pneumatic winch. His lack of music was played to perfection, with the emphasis almost entirely on the other characters' reactions to him.

It's fair to say that the film delivered in this respect! I can honestly say that this is the most harrowing film I have ever seen, and at points I found it almost unbearable (the BBFC's PG certificate for this film is frankly mind-boggling). The fact that this film is more unsettling than some of the most violent horror films is testament to the power of the story and directing, but in a way this is where I would criticise the film; I can't help but think that Lynch pushes his audience a little too far.Whilst many will describe this film as 'sad yet uplifting', I simply found it sad yet.....well, sad. The film conveyed to me mainly that a man such as Merrick could never live a normal life because society will never really change in its attitude towards such people, and, perhaps worse than this, conveyed the idea that even compassion can be a strange new brand of exploitation in its own right.This is an interesting film, and one which will get a debate going - something I always love in a film, but if you already know that every human deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and already know not to judge a person on appearance, you may not find that you learn all that much from this film.And if you don't know this then you won't even bother watching.

As he begins to learn to live a relatively normal life, encounters people from the high society and form friendship with Ms. Kendal, a theater star, Bytes profits from a night security breach to take him back. But soon, physically exhausted, he cannot perform in circus anymore and is freed by his animal circus peers soon to end up in the hospital he had earlier left. As he is dying, Merrick attends Kendal's performance in the lodge and is the beneficiary of a standing ovation. Back home, he is ready to die.Comment: In this black & white two-hours-long movie, David Lynch's true story based movie explores the human condition, and the value the 19th century society grants to human dignity. Moved by this orphan in search of acceptance and love, we cannot refrain from pitying this unlucky soul. This movie places us in front of the mirror, and asks us whether we do more good than the people we despise; whether nobler feelings and motive leads to better results, i.e. whether bringing Merrick to the hospital then become attraction for the high society is better than leaving him entertaining the low society in circus. Few can boast it.",The Elephant Man

304,suegrayson,Touching,7,5 March 2006,"Great performances by Hopkins, Gielgud and Hurt. Also look out for small roles from some famous British faces, including a young Pauline Quirke!Beautifully shot and a heart rendering tale that thankfully doesn't get too soppy or sentimental. A lot can be taken from the film about the way we treat people in general, not just the Elephant Man.I wonder if anyone else saw a clear link between Merrick making a model of a cathedral and the story of Quasimodo in Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame? Was this intentional by Lynch or just a happy coincidence. Worth thinking about!",The Elephant Man
305,Xenix94,Perception beyond face value...,10,16 August 2019,"The skin at face value most certainly isn't everything, and Lynch's The Elephant Man wants one to be very aware of this. There are many different facets/attributes that make up something that is beautiful. It encourages one to think outside of the box when encountering something within reality. The soul is more than the shell. Digging deep under the skin could bring great rewards. Perhaps after watching this film you will see people, and creatures in general, in a different sort of way. Perhaps reality will unfold into a new light.This film is one of the most emotionally exhausting films I think I have ever seen. It is presented in stark black and white which fits quit nicely with the industrial landscape and subject matter. Without spoiling anything, the end had me entranced and in complete awe. It's probably the most riveting ending I have ever seen in a movie. After the movie had ended I sat in complete silence thinking about it all. It was extremely powerful. I felt emotionally drained but also enlightened.The Elephant Man is far more straightforward in comparison to other Lynch films. However, there is still Lynch's surrealism thrown into the mix. For instance, the industrial landscape of the town. I thought the cinematography and layout very pleasing.In closing, it's raw and it's powerful. It has superb acting (Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt are both absolutely phenomenal). It will make you think. It's something a lot of films fail to do. The Elephant Man is a keeper.",The Elephant Man

This movie will appeal to anyone who does not have a heart made of stone.",The Elephant Man
307,avijit_n,Very nice movie,10,28 January 2008,This is one of the nice movie I have ever seen. Nice acting. The story is great. It tells the agonies of the disable person. Many times we laugh at the physically challenged person but seldom we feel their pain.This movie shows us the true story. The acting is mind catching. I think the actors and actress put the story alive. The actor of 'The elephant man' makes him alive to the audience.The man was in pain for his whole life and the doctor helps him to come out from it. The doctor also helps him to get recognized in the society. But I could not get one things: how he person learns to read and write. Does he get little education? But in one word it is a great movie.,The Elephant Man
308,viabilityfer,"Beautiful examination of the ""appearence"" social stigma",10,5 June 2018,"Lynch's second film succeeds on every level it intends to. It is a bleak and uncompromising look at how society judges others based on appearance, or really based on any social stigmas. Being a Lynch film, there is the classic Lynchian dream sequence, as well as flawless cinematography and great performances. John Hurt plays the ""Elephant Man"" perfectly, and the makeup effects are truly haunting, while at the same time evoke pity and strong sympathy for how this man is treated by society. There are plenty of insane, morally revolting characters, as is common in many of Lynch's works. At the end of the day, this may be the most sad and powerful Lynch film. As while his other works may examine the human condition very successfully, none come close to the uncompromising cruelty and mean spirited-ness as seen in ""The Elephant Man."" At the same time though, there are genuinely good people that want to help improve his life. All in all, the film is a phenomenal expression of the human condition, and should be taken as a warning to avoid applying social stigmas and barriers to individuals.",The Elephant Man
309,CynthBage,"Despite historical inaccuracies, this is one fine film",10,25 October 2007,"If you check out the Wikipedia entry on this film, you will find out that there are some stunning historical accuracies in 'The Elephant Man'. For one, his real first name is Joseph, not John. Secondly, Merrick went to Dr. Treves on his own accord. Thirdly, the character of Bytes is completely fictional and mostly based on a similar character from 'Oliver Twist'.Despite all this, this film is a wonderful work of all the contributors of cinematic arts. As art, it is beautiful and it stands on its own as a cultural force to be reckoned with. I really wish it would have won at the Oscars instead of 'Raging Bull'. John Hurt was a much better actor than De Niro, IMHO.",The Elephant Man
310,dcearley,A Moody Masterpiece,10,4 December 2007,"Am I wrong or is this David Lynch's masterpiece (which was only the second movie he directed!)? Many have commented on the great qualities of this film but I want to add one comment about one of the actors: Freddie Jones who played the evil freak show ""owner"" of John Merrick. Among movie bad guys, he stands out as the personification of evil for the sake of greed. An actor of lesser skills playing this role would have done an injustice to the entire film. Bravo Freddie! With this flawless production, one can feel the moodiness and dreariness of Victorian England literally dripping off the screen. Add to that the acting of John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins plus the supporting parts of John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller and the aforementioned Freddie Jones and The Elephant Man is one for the ages.",The Elephant Man

312,jonesberney,Half elephant half man? It could only be David Lynch!,10,19 December 2009,"Aside from what is generally considered Lynch's masterpiece 'DUNE' (the scene where Baron Harkonnen pulls out that ginger lad's buttplug and he bleeds to death had me wrapped in bad dreams for months!) this is my second favourite of his films just behind Mullholland Drive and neck and neck with Scanners. I always wonder when i'm watching a David Lynch film, ""Where does he get all his incredible ideas from?"" and my friend Carlton Jackson said that he only eats cheese all the time. Apparently he actually has a sculptor living with him who sculpts various cheeses into the shapes of other foods, and then another artist meticulously paints the cheese sculptures with edible paint, so they look like other foods but taste like cheese. My friend Carlton Jackson also said that David Lynch is a real prankster and has lots of things made of cheese that look like other things that he gives as gifts to his friends. Apparently he bought a new house for a friend of his years ago and his friend didn't realise but thought the house smelled a bit whiffy, and then when it came to summertime the house started sweating really badly and he woke up in the night and his house had literally melted around him and he had to be pulled out of a four foot thick layer of cheese by the local firemen, and Lynch was there laughing like the devil and took a polaroid photograph of his friend and slapped his knee, and said, ""I got you real good Charlie boy!"" But apparently the gag kind of backfired because his friend had been cocooned in the cheese all night and so much of it seeped into his system that it went straight to his brain and his friend has since been trapped in a perpetual nightmare state and cries all the time. My friend Carlton Jackson said that Lynch made a movie about it called The Straight Story but i haven't seen that so i can't comment on it. So to get back to the point i think the cheese helps Lynch's imagination a lorra lorra lot. I first saw this film at an arty cinema in Nottingham and i thought i wasn't going to enjoy it when i realised it was in black and white, but as soon as Elephantman came onto the screen i knew it was going to be a blast. There is a lot of intentional humour in the film, like the way Elephantman talks, and Pauline Quirke and Dexter Fletcher are in it so it definitely is a comedy movie, but i don't think the audience picked up on the comic elements of the film because no one in the cinema was laughing like i was, (i was actually rudely told to shut up or get out at one point) but i enjoyed it a great deal. I didn't think Elephantman should have died at the end, i thought that put a bit of a downer on the film, but it is a David Lynch movie so i guess you're supposed to expectly unexpected. My friend Carlton Jackson said there is a deleted scene from the film where you see Elephantman's mum having sex with the elephant but it was cut from the final edit because a lot of people were being sick on their popcorn when they saw it. Overall i give this film 6 out of ten because the special effects weren't very good, you could tell Elephantman was made on a computer sometimes and at one point you can definitely see it was John Hurt under the mask, so i would give this film about 5 out of 10. If you like this movie i recommend you see the film Mask with Eric Stoltz (Which is pretty much the same but in colour) or The Mask which is a Jim Carrey film.",The Elephant Man
313,bostonmania2002,a priceless gem...,10,16 May 2007,"Definitely an exquisite piece of cinema, one of the most harrowing, engrossing and poignant movies in motion picture history. No gargantuan budgets, no Hollywood hotshots, no special effects, no violence, no sex, no long-legged chicks, even no colors!. This is PURE CINEMA where both elegance and substance are blended into a perfect mixture of intensity and integrity.It is beautifully shot black & white on purpose. Although filming B&W was very expensive process at that time, it was a right choice by director David Lynch and producer Mell Brooks because it fitted perfectly with the eerie mood and sinister ambiance of the story.Visually it drags the viewer into dark, gray, filthy, haunting and suffocating PHANTASMAGORIA of INDUSTRIAL WORLD where cruelty and self-interest overwhelm kindness and compassion. Soggy streets, foggy alleys, smoky steel mills, and crummy crowds are all the elements of Lynch's SYMBOLISM used to portray very sharply the psychological turmoil of John Merrick - a physically plagued & horribly abused soul with massive deformities throughout his body  while being constantly bombarded with inhumane indecencies. So, this is the story of that hapless and hopeless man's arduous journey to return in humanity and dignity in a world full of real freaks and two-footed beasts.

I was about to go to sleep as it was about 00-40 in the morning and I flicked over to the movie and even though I was falling asleep as I flicked over to it, within  five minutes I was wide awake and totally captivated.Everyone knows the tale of John Merrick, it is so sad and painful to watch and see a man with above average intelligence trapped by his physical deformity and to be physically and mentally abused and tortured for a few meagre pence.I thought Sir John Gieulgud(?) and Sir Anthony Hopkins were both excellent in their respective roles. John Hurt did Merrick proud.I had a bit more than water in my eye on 4 occasions during this movie and not ashamed to admit it either. This is the 1st movie to make me cry.

316,conrado,A masterpiece about the triumph of a man against society,10,30 January 2001,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It is the story of John Merrick who was severely deformed.  His deformity is a deformity of appearance and stature but not of the heart and soul.  This movie should remind everyone who watches it about the prejudice and ignorance of society.  Personally, I thought John Merrick (John Hurt) was more beautiful than any of the people who laughed at him and made fun of him.I knew this movie was going to be great from the beginning when Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins) first sees him in the shadows.  It shows a close-up of Anthony Hopkins' face and shows a tear form.  This may also have been a foreshadowing to how much I would be crying throughout the entire movie. Superbly made in every possible way, The Elephant Man will stay in my memory for many years to come.  I will remember this every time I remember injustice and cowardice of men to face what they don't understand and what is truly beautiful.",The Elephant Man
317,Count Orlok,The Greatest Example Of Courage,10,20 June 2000,"I have always had unusual fascinations, and Joseph Merrick is no exception. At the time the film was released in 1980, I was but a mere second grader. I was enthralled by the mystery and spook factor of such a dark and dreary film. Today, I am a film student/director. My films are mostly in the style of David Lynch, David Fincher and Ridley Scott - dark and eerie. The mood which low lighting creates is unsurpassed in its ability to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Furthermore, the majority of the stories I write and the films that I intend to make one day, all revolve around persons whom have had to overcome seemingly insurmountable struggles. While as a boy it was the esoteric 'creepiness' which interested me, I look back upon such experiences as being instrumental in shaping me artistically. I feel there is no better story to tell than that of people who live in a world of intolerance and have the ability to create for themselves a life despite their outcast status. My compliments to you as well for dedicating yourself to such an endlessly interesting subject as Joseph Merrick. His is a lesson to be relished not only from the perspective of disabilities, but from one of self-respect, steadfastness and determination; Very unique characteristics in a situation which might daunt the average man.",The Elephant Man

You see this strength in many of the characters, specifically John (Joseph) Merrick, but also the doctor, Merrick's high society friends, his caring nurses, and his sideshow mates. The sadness in this film is overpowered by the strength of the people in it, and the love and friendship introduced into Merrick's life. A wonderful film.

There are few loopholes in the story and few character are not clearly defined e.g. Mr. Treves motive to save elephant man is not clearly defined.Anthony Hopkins is good in surgeon role.

327,For_the_love_of_cinema,Captures the heart,10,22 May 2012,"""The Elephant Man"" is not a regular film. It achieves something that not all movies are able to achieve. It gets under your skin, makes you feel powerless as the audience and leaves you wishing you could go back in time to the 19th century and be a source of comfort, a friend, a companion to John Merrick, cruelly termed 'The Elephant Man'. The film, based on a true story, shows us the life and ordeal of John Merrick (John Hurt), a 21 year old man whose face is severely disfigured as a result of a progressive disease, so much so, that he has to wear a hood and a cap when he's in public. He earns his living for himself and his ""owner"" by being displayed at various freak shows. It's clear that everybody wants to see the deformed man, but, nobody wants to understand him, rescue him and treat him like a normal person. But that's where Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) comes in. He discovers him in one of the freak shows and takes him to his hospital to look after him, thus giving him a second chance at life. From then on, John Merrick is introduced to a new world. Watching John's life changing is truly moving and touching and makes you realize that people like him should not be shunned upon but instead, deserve to be loved and cared for because that's all they really want and need. The film works on all levels with excellent acting and direction and a fine screenplay.I will say that the movie is disturbing and difficult to watch at times but I won't say that it isn't for everyone, because everyone's eyes should be opened to the inexplicable realities of life, which is portrayed so well in this film. It captures so wonderfully the life of John Merrick and reminds you how grateful we should be for a normal life.Bottomline: The Elephant Man is one of those rare films that cannot and should not be missed.",The Elephant Man

I didn't know what I was expecting but I got a lot more of this film than I originally thought I would. It's a sad portrayal of the cynical nature of man and John Hurt's portrayal as the deformed man is at times heartbreaking yet brilliant. Lynch takes a step back and delivers a film that is a lot more narratively coherent to the average viewer and he also offers some of his best work. From the beginning when you the viewer is straining to see the 'freak' in its captivity to when you are sympathizing for his unfortunate treatment, there is never a moment that felt forced or unbelievable.

The story is sad with the way John Merrick was treated and no one could have played him better than John Hurt. I believe Robert De Niro's performance in Raging Bull was superior and I am glad he won best actor. However, I believe the Elephant Man should have won best picture. The direction is great, I believe it was a great choice to film in black and white. I love the cast starring Anthony Hopkins, John hurt, and Anne Bancroft.

I saw this film, and It struck me as much as 'An Inconvenient Truth' did. This film, to me, portrays the human side of us, the side that we consider dark and hollow; the side that is 'evil'. Several scenes in this movie are shocking to realize, although there may be something horrific of it. Not horrific as in gore, but that of a story that you find true and you want to avoid it. In plain words, it is how mean, cruel, and cowardly we can be when there is something unknown. This story reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, in that something unnatural is introduced into a stable environment, and chaos breaks out. But wait!! This film also introduces a grandness played by Anthony Hopkins, whose character shows us a better, kind side of humans.

336,TownsleySteven,A Movie A Work Of Art?,10,13 March 2002,"To answer my own question, YES! A rare event, a movie which stimulates the intellect, asks questions, moves the soul and heart, and ENTERTAINS. This movie DID change my view of the world and other people. Yes, it did break my heart, but ultimately it uplifted my spirit. Shot in gorgeous black and white, with moments of realism - the cruel belching of fumes from Victorian factories - and surrealism on a level with Jean Cocteau. The performances are magnificent. Hopkins (in my view the greatest SCREEN actor of all time) is superb, understated yet portraying every emotion of a dedicated man who cares about the world. And John Hurt is truly magnificent. Buried in make up he portrays the man. Finally, we see Merrik as a MAN. And there is the pleasure of Wendy Hiller in a rare movie role, and Anne Bancroft proving she is one of the great American actresses. Lynch gives us the oppressive and cruel Victorian value system (not the glorified Thatcher vision), and demonstrates the power of love and friendship I personally have never seen in a movie before. And it moves at a sufficiently fast pace to ensure viewers of clash bang wallop genres won't be bored. The black and white imagery is a feast for the eyes. And the score one of the most haunting, beautiful and most underrated ever - in my opinion! So, if you don't like phoney art house pieces, don't be put off, and ignore the period setting and black and white cinematography - it is sumptuous. And should be shown to everyone, including children, to try and prevent the dreadful racism and Nazism and intolerance that appears to be increasing in our times.

337,dnights,Nothing Will Die.,10,30 July 2003,"This movie changed my life forever. To see someone so beautiful, dignified, and unique, hidden behind a body and face that society considers ugly, made me realize how the body is a decaying pile of dust, but the soul is a breath-taking and uniquely formed indestructible diamond.I believe that everyone should get a chance to see this film, for those of an open mind, and a caring soul, there is nothing else like it.It also shows the detestable ways some people treat others. I felt at first pity for John Merrick, but then my feelings changed to admiration, as the film went on. John, in the film starts as a severely deformed mute figure being badly mistreated, as the story progresses, he becomes the hero. A bold and courageous man, standing against the  evils of modern society.Joseph (John) Merrick, was a man so one-of-a-kind, that someone else like him physically or emotionally will never appear again. His life should be taken as an example to everyone.As in the film, John's mother says ""Nothing will Die"", Joseph Merrick will live on in the hearts and souls of everyone who has witnessed the story of his life.My love goes to Joseph Merrick, where ever he may be.",The Elephant Man

It is simply remarkable that this film was made in 1980. It holds the charm of a film released in the 50's. I have to say it is a true masterpiece of cinema. It is a gem that will be cherished for all generations to come. A true tale of the cruelty and beauty of the human race. It will force you to rethink which crowd you would be part of and which you would want to be part of. Would you react and judge the way most did, or with the greater, higher moral ground that is taken at the end of the film. The hope that most would react with the latter is proof of the indomitable human spirit to provide good will to all men. The greatness on every level achieved in this film is to include: cinematography, make up, Direction, camera work, human story and acting. It will remain as a testament against the belief that mankind is a failed race. Every human being throughout time can relate in part to the emotions of ridicule and disconnection from his fellow man suffered by The Elephant Man. However, very few can truthfully claim to have the heart to not hate after enduring such. That is truly the greatest woe of man. Thank you.",The Elephant Man

343,subhajit89,David Lynch's perspective on human nature,10,29 June 2017,"This is my first David Lynch movie and after watching it I was so moved, that I felt like writing about it The movie follows the story of an extremely disfigured man named John Merrick, who, managed by his proprietor Bytes, goes from carnival to carnival as a special attraction whom people would pay good money to see. After years of torment by Bytes, finally he gets the attention of medical surgeon and professor Frederick Treves(Anthony Hopkins), who takes an interest in him as an interesting medical case that he could examine to gather knowledge. Treves ends up moving John into a hospital freeing him from the clutches of the abusive Bytes. From here the story follows how John's life begins transforming as he comes in contact with more and more people and the people come to know that there is more to this ugly freak of nature than meets the eye.The setting of the movie is hauntingly beautiful. Most of the scenes are very dark and grainy adding to the atmosphere of the film with an apt soundtrack. The shots of the carnival, where John is with other disfigured people are very dark and have a negative vibe to them. The makeup on John is surprisingly well-done, so that you wouldn't have a hard time believing the reactions of the people seeing him for the first time. The story is at all times believable and never goes over the top. I personally found the story incredibly painful and was brought to tears at many points. The direction seemed flawless. In fact, after watching this I am going to look for other works by the director.At the core, Elephant Man is in many ways symbolic to actual life. It points out how being ugly is almost considered a crime in today's society and how everything and everyone is taken at face value. You can't be the strong and silent type if you are not good looking, then you are just a loner. It shows how people need to pity and laugh at other people in order to feel happy and to feel secure themselves. This movie shows the true and unchanging nature of the human mind. It shows how all individuals who are part of the society are the same in one way or another. Treves rescues John from the carnival just to put him on display in a bigger one. In that essence, he is no different than Bytes. In fact, every person shown in the film had something to gain from the freak and in that way they are all the same. The only exceptions are the poor disfigured people of the carnival. What they did for John was out of pure compassion and not for any personal gain. The movie makes it abundantly clear again and again that no matter how they tried, those freaks can never REALLY be a part of our society. This is the question the movie presents. Are they the ones who are the freaks, or are we?",The Elephant Man

Its great acting stands out extremely, David Lynch's direction is a marvel, too bad he didn't create more fascinating pieces. John Hurt's wonderful performance in the title role is indescribable. Anthony Hopkins' classy acting fits perfectly with the character, along with talents of Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller and Hannah Gordon.I was touched by the film because of its storyline of drama, brilliant script, acting and music. The sorrowful and suffering life of John Merrick and the grand end of his life brings out the sadness in us all. At the end of the film, the music, Barber's 'Adagio for Strings', is a masterpiece, it fitted perfectly into the upsetting grand finale. I mostly enjoy 'true' films, when the plot actually happened. Overall, I suggest the film to be one of the best in movie history. It brought out the best in John Hurt, and the joy within us.

345,Oliver_Cooke,Work of Genius,10,15 March 2014,"I think it is a testament to all people involved in the making of this film, that through the presentation of the life of one individual, such powerful messages about humanity; it's prejudices and fears; it's hopes and dreams; the decisions we make in regard to the way we communicate with and treat others, are conveyed with utter brilliance, whether that be through Christopher DeVore, Eric Bergren and David Lynch's screenplay; Lynch's trademark directorial style; John Morris' haunting fairground-esque soundtrack; Freddie Francis' grainy black-and-white cinematography; the exemplary performances of the likes of Anthony Hopkins (Dr. Frederick Treves), Anne Bancroft (Madge Kendal) and, the man himself, John Hurt (John Merrick); or perhaps, what I believe, a wonderful mix of all of these aspects, creating a motion picture masterpiece that visually and thematically gorgeous.Being first introduced to this film through an interest in Victorian society as well as, in my opinion, the depth of atmosphere that can be produced in film through black-and-white, I feel privileged to have been allowed to immerse myself in such an unforgettable world that ties these two things together flawlessly.I am not a person usually effected by emotion within film, (In most films, I tend to find it to be usually forced and contrived), but this film provides that perfect balance, recognising that, rather than portraying Merrick as an all-around extraordinary person, a portrayal of a real human individual, who has been born with such horrendous deformities, yet attempts to be seen as equal in a time of extreme prejudice, is more suitable for developing that emotional connection with an audience, as Merrick's humanity is heavily emphasised, being more identifiable.",The Elephant Man

The doctor and his contemporaries care for the deformed man throughout the movie but not once is he treated like a normal human being. The kindness that everybody, but a small few, show him is surface level nonsense.The movie is supposed to show how kindness and ""love"" turned this deformed mans life around. This would be true if the kindness and love were genuine. Unfortunately they were not.I strongly do not recommend this movie. It is about a miserable man who is mistreated and abused his entire life.

347,hdagelic,Brilliant,10,26 February 2006,"I don't remember seeing a movie before that left such a impression on me.The film is deep and even religious clearly showing the people character clearly distinguishing attitudes that are valuable and good like the ones of Dr. Treves, his wife and Mrs. Kendle and the ones that are for every condemnation. But the characterization is not naive like in a fairy-tale but very realistic and people like the ones shown in the movie really exist. For example Mr. Bytes - The Elephant man's ""owner"" is not some soulless animal but the weak character who suppressed his feelings because of his material condition and is unable to put anything noble and good in front of his need to ""earn"" money.The movie is based on a novel written by the real Dr. Treves and it is not completely true. But most of it is. John Merrick really lived in London and was born in 1862, and the symptoms of his illness began to show when he was about two years old. He was an intelligent and imaginative child and lived with his parents until his mother died when he was 11. His father remarried and his wife gave him and ultimatum and he was cast out of the home. He really did work in a circus in a freak-show but he was not mistreated at the beginning but afterwards when he had to go abroad to Belgium because side-shows were banned in England. When he returned to London he was found by Dr. F. Treves and the hospital became his home until his death in 1890. In his room he wrote poetry and prose and built models from card stock, his most famous being of the St. Philip's cathedral. In the movie his death is shown correctly, like Dr. Treves tried to explain it: He often said to me that he wished he could lie down to sleep ""like other people."" I think on this last night he must, with some determination, have made the experiment. The pillow was soft, and the head, when placed on it, must have fallen back-wards and caused a dislocation of the neck. Thus it came about that his death was due to the desire that had dominated his life -- the pathetic but hopeless desire to be ""like other people. (Howard & Ford, 210) http://www.phreeque.com/joseph_merrick.htmlThe only thing I don't like about the movie are some unneeded horrific scenes (so I have to warn when I give the movie to a girl :) Like two ladies fighting viciously, screaming and moaning in the hospital hall and the scene with the monkeys which is shown too explicitly. But this is nothing compared to what I saw in some other Lynch's movies some of which, like ""The Eraserhead"" I couldn't even watch to the end because it was bizarre and left an evil and satanic impression.This film is with one word - perfect and I would recommend it to everybody.

Sir Anthony Hopskins, and John Hurt, and other terrific actors did a tremendous job on this film. The 1st thing I noticed was that, this movie was in black&white. At 1st I was very skeptical if that would work..To tell u the truth it did. Having the movie black&white gave this movie some deep feeling and powerful emotions..since this movie was based in the 1890's, it was the perfect fit for B&W film..Casting John Hurt as John Merrick, was the perfect choice because, he is a tremendous actor, not well known to the audience, so that gives it a more punch for the money.Because after the film ends. You wanna know who was that actor that played John Merrick so well..Anothny Hopskins.WOW what can I say, what compassion this fellow had.This movie really brought a tear in my eyes. The transformation of John Hurt..UNBELIEVABLE..To bad back then the academy awards didn't have a category for best make-up design.and the only reason that john hurt didn't win the Oscars is because I think that the audience never saw his face..BUT WHAT A JOB WELL DONE!!!I would give this movie 100 Stars, but the Max is 10....",The Elephant Man
356,Demondreamin,A true gem in cinema history,10,21 May 2007,"The elephant man is an almost immediately engaging movie based almost entirely on true events and people (and is fairly accurate as far as my knowledge of the actual story goes). The story is indeed quite a sad one which the fact that it was shot in black in white, and just the overall feel of the movie doesn't help. If you upset easy have tissues handy. I thought the acting was right where it should have been and was overall really good, especially for the elephant man. The only thing I could be somewhat skeptical on is that for some it may seem to move a little to slow and not really pick you up as the movie does draw a lot on having empathy and sympathy for John Merrick (the elephant man). Its a very emotional movie and to me you kind have to be in the mood to watch it. So if your not up for an emotional drawing movie it may not be for you, or at least not at the time. The meaning and undertones of the movie is a statement about society and how we react to things, the true meaning of beauty, how we think of things, and to me how terrible people can be to others who are different. It simply is a great movie, a classic that really should be sat down and watched at least one good time.",The Elephant Man

This one is a tear-jerker. The layers of extreme contrasts in this movie make quite a strong impression on the psyche. For example the contrast between the gentleness and beauty of Merrick's soul and his horrendous appearance. The contrast between the kindness of Hopkins' character and the cruelty of some others. By the end you are wrung out. I believe Merrick is in heaven, in bliss and free from deformity. In the movie he quotes scripture flawlessly and I believe we are being led to think about that.Once I saw a computer generated face of how Merrick would have looked had he not had his disease.

In this movie a young spry Anthony Hopkins plays a doctor seeking to better the living conditions of John Merrick but also discover the reasons behind his baffling medical condition. Though he is most likely the most redeemable character in the movie, one must question if he shows hospitality to Mr.Merrick merely out of kindness or wish to further his career in the medical field.

364,erinmerle,"Great Film-making, Problematic Treatment of John Merrick",7,27 June 2010,"Moralising narratives are at the heart of many ""outsider"" biopics as a means of exposing the flawed logic of a ""civilized"" yet inherently inhumane society. This approach is exemplified to the extreme in David Lynch's The Elephant Man. The famous biography of John Merrick is presented as a horror film in which the viewer is repeatedly subjected to scenes of violence against a helpless and cripplingly deformed man. Historical documentation reveals that Merrick indeed suffered a great many injustices but testament to his survival is his industriousness and independence, qualities not explored in the film. The intelligent and gentle nature of Merrick is emphasized not to explicate his strength of character but rather to expose the stupidity and brutality of his tormentors. Fictionalized abuses such as a kidnapping, a violent manager, and a psychopathic night-guard supplement an already grotesque vision of 19th century England as an era of absolute inhumanity. The industrial nightmare which is the basis of Lynch's earlier experimental film Eraserhead is recycled and juxtaposed with the world of etiquette and bourgeois finery of the self-righteous Victorian upper classes. The system of capitalism is exposed for its inability to acknowledge the worth of human life outside of productive capacity. Those without labour power are dehumanized and stripped of all dignity in order to survive, fuelling the prevalence of prostitution, child exploitation, and freak shows. The treatment of John Merrick in The Elephant Man is yet another exploitation of sorts as it reduces an extraordinary life to a moral tale. When Dr. Treves says, ""Mr.Bytes, I'm sorry but all you do is profit from another man's misery"", one has to wonder at the hypocrisy of a film which replicates the spectacle of the freak show and exaggerates victimization in order to drive home an unsubtle misanthropic narrative.",The Elephant Man
365,ipsilont,A searing look into the depths of the human soul...,9,24 November 2005,"I picked this movie up at my local video store without any previous knowledge about it. I was simply intrigued by the curious title, and the strange hooded figure on the cover it seemed to refer to. Not surprisingly, all the characters in this movie, are driven to find the answer to the same question. What is intriguing about this movie is its exploration of each individual's response (us included) once they are confronted with the truth.I will not be spoiling anything by telling you that he is hideous; the most deformed, deranged man you will probably ever see. So a warning to those of the faint of heart. The movie does a fine job of covering the entire spectrum of human responses, from obvious shock and revulsion, to sympathy and kindness, to exploitation and greed.I believe though that at the heart of this movie is clear humanistic message: that while superficially he may be different, he is still a man, and certainly deserving of anything that any other ""normal"" man is entitled to.Once you've can overcome the shock of seeing the ""ogre"" full face, and you look him straight in the face without fear, without disgust, are his eyes in fact any different? He is simply another human being, born from a mother's womb, capable of happiness and sadness, destined to die, no different in anyway except that he had the most unfortunate fate of being born into a most hideous vessel.While this is not a horror movie, it is certainly disturbing. But not in way due to the behavior or appearance of the elephant man (far from it ironically). Rather the disturbing content comes from the way he is treated by other ""normal"" humans.If your thinking well all this has been done before, your right it has. But I never get tired of it, and only rarely has it been told with such fine performances all around, and such searing truth. I highly recommend this movie to all, and sincerely wish more movies like this would come out in the near future.",The Elephant Man

367,kingrobertwilliam,Very good and almost universally misunderstood.,7,23 March 2012,"I come to write this review because on having read one or two others that have been put up, both by the lay-people as you and I and by the 'professionals' such as Ebert (a man whose reviews are consistently poor!); I believe that a serious disservice has been done. Both by those who have praised the film and by those who have condemned it.The film appears to have been assessed almost unanimously on its portrayal of Merrick and its message regarding his strength of character. I however feel that the more nuanced and more praiseworthy element of the feature is how it addresses the ethics of exploitation. A theme which is opened within the first ten minutes of the film with Treves mention of how terrible are these new machines. These machines being the steam powered machines of the workhouses and factories. That means of capitalist exploitation from which England was birthed and that exploitation which was practised by every strata of society.What I took the film to be is a very subtle exploration of who might be in a position to call the other morally reprehensible, who it is that might condemn the actions of others. In just the same way as Treves asks who might be more of a monster; Merrick or his 'owner' (or rather in the film Trevers actually charges Merrick's owner of being a monster, but his character this moral question of the audience). As for the opening scene of the movie at which Ebert takes such offence; besides David Lynch simply being David Lynch (and we might all be thankful that he is), the opening scene might readily be interpreted as Lynch having us imagine all by ourselves that the woman was raped by an Elephant. It is never made explicit that this is what happens and in fact, when Merrick is first being introduced as The Elephant Man his back-story is given as being the result of an elephant trampling his mother whilst in her fourth month of pregnancy.Who is perverse here, Lynch or us? Who is the exploiter here, Treves, the 'owner', society - us?As for the sermon which Lynch is giving on Merrick I don't believe that it is quite so patronising as Ebert suggests. In the final scene it is quite clear that Merrick is choosing to sleep in a way that will end his life (as explained earlier in the film). And again there is a subtlety about this. Is suicide an escape from something unbearable (is it weakness?), or is it the fruition of Merrick's realisation that he is a man - for he is choosing to sleep as 'normal people' do.With that said the film can certainly be taken on a(n extremely) sentimental level. But this is surely only something that we should Praise Lynch for. He has succeeded in making a film on many levels. One that your mother can watch and merely gloss the surface of, or, that you can analyse and discover something deeper. Moreover he has also facilitated some brilliant performances and crafted a brilliant aesthetic.He's also thrown in a few wonderfully 'Lynch' elements such as the scene with Elephant and Merrick's rescue by the 'freaks' of the circus from a baboon cage.So go and watch the film. It will not be the greatest film you ever see, but it will certainly be one of the better ones and it will test your subtlety of appreciation.",The Elephant Man

The directing of David Lynch is an aerobatics in world cinema! The movie is an unbelievable emotional experience! I still cannot believe that ""The Elephant man"" has eight Academy nominations and not a single award! The plot is arranged so smart, that the characters don't need to say a lot of lines so that the story can move forward. The film is very bold and tight; there aren't any boring episodes and the viewer is concentrated all the time. Hopkins and Hurt are brilliant. The other British actors are keeping the rhythm of the movie very intelligent. The cinematography is astonishing; the B/W decision is great; the lightning is impressive! The soundtrack is used very precisely; it appears only a few times. The whole movie has a unique ""movie atmosphere"". A must see for cinema lovers!",The Elephant Man
369,mhs_njrotc2004,"A Masterpiece, Truly Remarkable",10,10 May 2004,"David Lynch is a remarkable director and The Elephant Man is a remarkable film. Inspired by a true story in the streets of London during the Victorian Age, the film is based entirely around the life of John Merrick (John Hurt), an individual dubbed by his `owner' Bytes (Freddie Jones) and others as 'The Elephant Man' because of his hideous deformities. With this film, Lynch grasps his audience and stretches them to a new parallel of an emotionally capturing film. And what makes this so daunting and so intriguing is the fact that 'The Elephant Man' is a true story, no part of it is fictional. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves, the man who somewhat saves John from those who persecute him for being a freak, being a `monster.' A story of human triumph could never be so remarkable as that of The Elephant Man. Lynch takes The Elephant Man to a new level of technical aspiration with a dark, dank setting shot completely in black and white. This film is amazing and would undoubtedly be just okay any other way. The black and white adds to the story in a way that touches the audience much deeper and much more personal. Not to mention stunning performances and dialogue by all cast, `David Lynch's portrait of John 'The Elephant Man' Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.' Literary critic Leslie Fiedler maintains that freaks stir `both supernatural terror and natural sympathies' because they `challenge conventional boundaries between male and female, sexed and sexless, animal and human, large and small, self and other.' In this very interesting and moving film, we are challenged to clarify our values in regard to `very special people.' However, in one powerful scene of tension and curiosity, John Merrick screams out, `I am not an animal! I am a human being! I.am.a man!' This particular sequence, I believe, is incredible and it ties in with the whole focus of the film itself, human dignity and emotion. David Lynch is known for some pretty twisted films, and yet, The Elephant Man is not that twisted at all. Even though his audience views John Merrick as not the average person because of his medical condition, the story is cherished because of how it is put onto the big screen. Compared to his other films such as Blue Velvet and Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is more surreal in terms of what Lynch was going for. Lynch does a magnificent job in portraying his version of The Elephant Man, and many people along with critics alike agree. I can easily rate The Elephant Man with four stars because David Lynch deserves no less. The Elephant Man is a classic, a striking and devastating film depicting the account of John Merrick's search for a dignified and normal life. I would definitely recommend this film to those in search of a wonderful story about one man's conquest to a regular life. Dr. Treves' account with John not only presents him with respect and normalcy, but also takes him as far as an uplifting scene where upon John states `my life is full because I know I am loved.' With such an inspirational and true story, David Lynch puts on a film that should be loved by many, if not all.",The Elephant Man

In my opinion it was realist but some parts was absurd.In example his kind of die wad absurd.I did not like that part.I was reading to story. I didn't like this part.In contrast, The Queen's visited him.I think it was nice and kindly.Everyone understood.he was good and friendly.The Elephant Man died at the end of the story.

374,OrElHai,this movie engaged me deeply,10,25 July 2015,"First I'd like to say that this is one of the best and most engaging movies I've ever seen. There were many scenes in which I was close to crying and my eyes were wet during about half of the film. This movie was for me very sad. It made me feel sad and I felt much pity for the character of John Merrick , the elephant man. The main reason I think this movie is a great movie is because we have much to learn from it. It teaches us a lot about people in general, about the values of society, and if we think hard enough about it, it teaches us about how we can improve as people and as a society. I think that this movie is a sad movie primarily because it depicts our society as valuing people based almost entirely on their appearance. Very little of the value we bestow upon people is based on their character and personality. To me, these days it's even more accurate than it was back when this film was released. We have much to learn from the movie the elephant man.",The Elephant Man
375,corruption101,Nothing More Than Life Changing,10,22 December 2013,"I'll be honest. I looked at other reviews stating how emotional and heartbreaking this true story. I disregarded such descriptions and came to start watching ""The Elephant Man"" for pure enjoyment. Though what I quickly realised throughout and by the end of the film was this was a piece of art, a masterpiece, that was not supposed to be made for one's own entertainment. It personally made me question the ideals of society, even though the film was during Victorian times, it made me question the curiosity and harshness of current society's in their upfront disgust to those who are different, and not considered 'normal'. This is the one film that has REALLY made me question. I urge everyone to watch this movie at some point in their life as I promise that this is an experience that will be eternal and ultimately life-changing.",The Elephant Man
376,lbudmelman,"Reminds me of ""Eraserhead""",8,20 May 2014,"This film reminds me of an almost a cookie cutter reproduction of the 1977 Lynch film ""Eraserhead"". Both were filmed in black & white, there are constant fades to black which jump to new scenes, very little use of music soundtrack & many shock scenes. That doesn't make it a bad film and I don't mean to pan his work. I understand that directors follow a general structure. However if you've seen both these movies you may see just how similar they seem to be, especially since they are only 3 years apart. In conclusion it's a powerful & well performed movie. Having watched it again tonight I couldn't help but make the observation. Just my dos centavos.",The Elephant Man

Well done to Mel Brooks for producing such a beautiful film and having faith in the then relatively unheard of David Lynch.

My heart goes out for Joseph Merrick and everyone should watch this movie because it really makes you think about how you treat other people and it is a really touching movie for everyone.

David Lynch achieved a perfect balance in allowing us the viewer, the opportunity to experience the pain, prejudice & strength of spirit possessed by a human being faced with an ultimate level of physical disability. Despite this, the 'elephant man' surprises & triumphs in his attitude towards his predicament by demonstrating the only human quality that really counts, inner beauty. There are so many moments in this film that had me noting comparisons with the prejudice and attitudes towards physically challenged people present in the UK today, that I wonder if this film is more relevant today that it was when it was made. Flawless performances in particular from Hurt,Hopkins, & Sir John Guilgud make this a delight to watch. I hope you enjoy & experience this film more than just once.",The Elephant Man

I know a lot of kids these days don't know about the Elephant man and need to know. He needs to regain his popularity back! I'm just saying it would be so so awesome! Perhaps they could do with a little vengeance, action, and sincerity in the new film. I'm just wondering who would play him and who could maybe produce this in the future. I know anyone who loves the Elephant Man would insist on this. It just needs to be brought back, some good old time movie but with a new presence of today's society and what other people go through now. There have been lots of body shaming and bullying, you name it. Just something to think about. I think this movie would just make a great impression on those.",The Elephant Man

Never have I seen a more moving film and I've seen lots. Hopkins and Hurt gave the performances of a lifetime and played them with such passion and feeling.The movie broke my heart and broke it even more when I learned it was a true story! I was horrified when we first see John but then as we went deeper and realized what a kind, loving, and intelligent man he really was...wow. My favorite part had to be when he and Bancroft were doing Romeo and Juliet, although it was disappointing that Bancroft got so much credit for such a small part. Seeing John being treated so inhumanely infuriated me on so many levels and it's hard to watch those scenes without yelling at the screen. It also made me realize that there are still Elephant Men and Women in the world today and I hope they're not treated like John Merrick was. I sincerely hope we can all learn some- thing from John Merrick and Dr. Treves. Was he attractive to look at? No. Was he a wonderful human being? Absolutely. Watching him remove the pillows and quietly slip away made the tears start all over again. In all, this is a beautifully haunting movie that stays with you and makes you think! A definite must see!",The Elephant Man
383,djdstylzs,You're the monster! You're the freak!,8,18 July 2010,"So much content and so many themes are thrown around in this film that it is easy to loose sight of its main purpose. Throughout smoke billows forming mangled spheres while machines pound rhythmically, implying both an image of our hero as well as a dystopian view of an English society that finds itself more civilized and refined than any before or after. There is an ongoing question as to whether John is being pimped out by Treves as a sort of cutting edge fashion statement to the upper classes just as much as he was a circus act to the lower ones. The unavoidable apparent point of the movie is to show Johns kindness and acceptance of a cruel design of nature and a society that mocks what is doesn't understand. On top of all this Lynch can't help himself and throws in some of his acid soaked dream sequences. All of these are rouses though that misdirect us from the movies main function. It is a film that is a scathing and scorching indictment of human society as a whole. The apparent freak of the film is easily the most normal and attractive person. When the night porter breaks into Johns room and we see a man forcing a woman to kiss John, we feel disgust not for the woman's sake, but for Johns. During the long focuses on Johns mothers supposedly angelic face, we are forced to question why what we are seeing is the supposed definition of beauty. Every supposed normal person in the film is meant to be disgusting. Only John is truly beautiful. Even Johns supposed friends, including Treves, seem distressingly neutral towards Johns ultimate value as an actual human. Some are barbaric in their distastefulness, refusing to muffle their disgust towards John. Most are purely barbaric in their gleeful cruelness towards him. Ultimately the finger is pointed at us, the viewer. How do we judge beauty? Why do we hold people to such random standards? Why do we base one's intrinsic value on their physical appearance? Treves indictment of the night porter is really an indictment of all of us. Perhaps WE truly are the monsters. Perhaps WE truly are the freaks. The film puts us all on trial. It is a furious statement that should make us all reevaluate ourselves. A film of utmost importance.",The Elephant Man

385,missmarty,very interesting movie,10,11 January 2006,"I appreciated this movie. It was a very moving story. The thing is that they don't show you John Merrick's face until about half-way through the movie. By this time, if you're like me, you've got all sorts of pictures and horrible images running through your head. But when he finally is shown, he's not that bad. He is deformed, and rather repulsive, but as the story goes on, you begin to warm up to him, and feel for him. I still cannot believe how cruel some of the people were in the story. It made me nearly cry. This movie is not for kids, as it shows the darker side of life. It has some startling images, and (if I'm remembering right) the part where the guys force Mr. Merrick to drink something, then pretty much murder him (I won't say how) was, for me, very hard to watch. THIS IS NOT A COMEDY OR LIGHT-HEARTED FILM! It's simply a very sad, and unfortunately true story of the struggles of a man with a deformed face and head who has to move through most of his life without hardly hearing a kind voice, and instead being beaten, laughed at, and eventually dying. I don't remember anything offensive in the way of language. This movie will remind you that even if someone is deformed, that doesn't make them less of a human being. They still have feelings, and need to be loved and cared for like everyone else.",The Elephant Man

387,ooerplop,"It is NOT the ""true"" story of the elephant man",8,1 February 2006,"I agree that the film is remarkable, involving and emotional, but it is part fiction. If you study all the material you will observe that about 30% of the film is exaggerated to make better drama. It is wrong to say that it is the ""true"" story of the elephant man.Early biographies of Merrick inaccurately give his first name as ""John""; an error repeated in many later versions, including the 1980 film The Elephant Man.Born in Leicester to mother Mary Jane Merrick, he had a younger brother and sister. He began showing signs of deformity at age two (or, according to [1], at age five). His mother died when he was 11. According to family accounts, she too was ""crippled"". He then was forced to live with his father, Joseph Rockley Merrick, and stepmother. She did not want him and gave Joseph's father an ultimatum, ""Joseph, or me.""Joseph was forced to earn a living by selling shoe polish on the street, where he would be harassed constantly by local children. For the better part of his life he was unemployable, so as a last resort he took a job as a sideshow attraction. He was treated decently, and made a small amount of money. When sideshows were outlawed in the United Kingdom in 1886 he travelled to Belgium to find work and was mistreated and abandoned by a showman.After making his way back to London, Merrick was befriended by Dr. Frederick Treves, who discovered Merrick at the train station suffering from a severe bronchial infection. Treves was a physician at London Hospital, and Joseph was given a permanent home there. He was something of a celebrity in High Victorian society, eventually becoming a favourite of Queen Victoria. Although numerous people, including a few women came to visit him, he never received the thing he sought most: love. Treves later commented that Joseph always wanted, even after living at the hospital, to go to a hospital for the blind - so that he could find a woman there who would not be frightened of his appearance. He found some solace in writing, composing both prose and poetry in his later years. He was cared for at the hospital until his death on 11 April 1890 from suffocation while sleeping, which was apparently accidental. Merrick was unable to sleep horizontally due to the weight of his head, but may have intentionally tried to do so in this instance in an attempt to imitate normal behaviour.His life story became the basis of a 1979 Tony Award-winning play, and in the following year an Academy Award-nominated film, which were unrelated but both called The Elephant Man.In 1971 Ashley Montagu suggested that Merrick suffered from neurofibromatosis type I, a genetic disorder also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, and this disease is still connected with Merrick in the mind of the public. However, in 1979, Michael Cohen first identified a condition which came to be named Proteus syndrome by Rudolf Wiedemann in 1983. In 1986 it was argued that Proteus syndrome was the condition from which Merrick actually suffered. Unlike neurofibromatosis, Proteus syndrome (named for the shape-shifting god Proteus) affects tissue other than nerves, and is a sporadic rather than familially transmitted disorder. In July 2003, Dr. Charis Eng announced that as a result of DNA tests on samples of Merrick's hair and bone, she had determined that Merrick certainly suffered Proteus syndrome, and may have had neurofibromatosis type I as well. His PTEN gene (often mutated in the Proteus syndrome) appears to have been healthy (i.e., not mutated). As it stands, many people still refer to his condition as elephantiasis (sometimes misspoken as ""elephantitis."")Merrick's preserved skeleton is on permanent display at the Royal London Hospital. Singer Michael Jackson reportedly attempted to purchase the remains in 1986, but his offer of $1,000,000 US was rebuffed, and he has since denied that this ever took place.",The Elephant Man
388,shpsqzr,The film is factually incorrect,7,1 February 2006,"In the film, it appears that Treves has to walk a long way to see Joseph for the first time. In the film, Treves leaves the Hospital and appears to walk for ever. This is incorrect. The dark, damp and filthy abandoned premises where Joseph was displayed, was on the opposite side of the road from the hospital. The building is still there. The Whitechapel area hasn't changed much at all during these hundred years or so.Gas lamps have been replaced with electric ones, horse-drawn trams have been replaced by the London Red Bus, but it doesn't take much imagination to see the place as it used to be.... dark.......dangerous......and e-x-t-r-e-m-e-l-y mysterious. If you listen carefully you are able to make out the sound of hooves on the cobble stones. (Some Whitechapel back streets and allies still have them).The nurses who attended Joseph were very frightened at first. In the film, a nurse runs screaming from Joseph's room in the attic. This is absolutely true., the nurse wasn't prepared for what she saw. and she did scream very loudly. After not too long though, people came to love and respect Joseph.Joseph's cap has survived. The author of this site has seen it close up - it's very daunting. The circumferance of Joseph's head was 3ft and the curtain at the front of the cap was intended to hide his face. He was often tormented by children and adults alike, who attempted to lift up the curtain and peek inside.This is the part of the film where Joseph is on his way back home from Ostende (Belgium). Freak shows had become increasingly unpopular in the UK towards the latter part of the 19th century, and so Joseph was forced to make a living elsewhere. Hence, he went to the continent. His companion (and owner) the Showman, who incidentally didn't mal treat him as the film depicts, ended by robbing Joseph of his life savings. Stranded in Belgium and with no money, Joseph had to rely on the charity of the skipper of the cross-channel ferry.",The Elephant Man
