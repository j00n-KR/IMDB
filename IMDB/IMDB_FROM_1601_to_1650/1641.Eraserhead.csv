0,MartinHafer,Art or excrement--you decide.,1,7 January 2009,"This is an amazing film to read about in the reviews. Many give the film ratings of 9 or 10 and yet many give it 1--it seems that some consider it great art or genius and the others consider it pure excrement. There aren't a lot of opinions in the middle with this one! I'm not even going to bother trying to summarize what I saw--like practically everyone else, I really have no idea what it was all about though I suspect the film has no meaning at all and director Lynch had no idea as well. Yet, like much ""art"" that is confusing and controversial, many TRY to read meanings and symbolism into it. Sure, there is a lot of obvious sexual imagery, but what it all means seems pretty pointless and I truly think this is THE point of the film.In addition to having no point, the film also tries very hard to make an impression by pushing the audience's ""gross-out buttons""! In other words, keep playing various horrific images in an apparent attempt to make people flinch or be repelled. Frankly, I've seen worse but would probably have to go back to a medical museum to find it again! It also tries to push the limits by making the film very unpleasant--not just appalling but also by making the whole thing rather boring and drab.So, you are left with a confusing film with probably no meaning, bizarre sexual imagery, gross special effects and complete utter boredom all wrapped up in one package. Some enjoy this and I say more power to them, but as for me life is just too short. Watch it if you want--I just can't see why!",Eraserhead
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A very, very good debut from David Lych, though to me he did go on to even better things",9,11 September 2014,"Of a very divisive director, along with Mulholland Drive Eraserhead is one of his most polarising films, with people finding it wonderfully surreal, funny and unsettling and others will find it for their tastes confusing, too out there and weird. On first viewing the latter was the case with me(after being so amazed by the accessible emotional power that The Elephant Man and The Straight Story gave) but after further viewings(Lynch is one of those directors where each of his films should be seen more than once) now it's the former. While Eraserhead is not quite among Lynch's best films(Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story) it is still a very good, even great debut from him, albeit with some parts that are a bit too draggy and drawn out. Eraserhead looks splendid, it's beautifully shot and coupled with the film-noir-ish lighting it's a highly atmospheric-looking film. It's not a Lynch film without surreal imagery and Eraserhead is filled with that and in a way that even early in his career is very distinctive of Lynch. The score has an eerie tension and used in an understated way, not one of the best film scores out there but it suits the film well. The dialogue is spare, only about 21 minutes worth and while not exceptional it is a long way from poor, though maybe Eraserhead may have fared even better without it(big emphasis on maybe). Lynch's direction is for a debut very accomplished if not at his best, his direction in the likes of Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive was pretty much masterly. The story is distinctively surreal and oddball but also very expertly unnerving, Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man feel more accessible but Eraserhead is essentially a mood piece and works amazingly as one. The theme of a man fearing fatherhood will resonate with a lot of viewers too. The mutant baby is incredibly creepy but there is room for some funny moments in a very low-key way especially the dinner-table scene. The acting is great, especially from lead actor Jack Nance, what was most effective about his acting was how personal it felt, in fact the whole film felt very personal. Overall, will divide viewers, it did bewilder me at first, Eraserhead proves to be a very, very good debut as well as a very, very good film where no matter how you feel about the film you cannot deny that a lot of effort had been put into making it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Eraserhead
2,SnoopyStyle,overwhelming David Lynch visions,6,20 March 2015,Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is a quiet factory worker living in an industrial landscape. He and his girlfriend Mary X has a child but it is a malformed inhuman baby. Mary can't take the crying and walks out.I am very reluctant to put down any more plot details because I'm not sure about a lot of what I saw. There are some crazy surreal stuff here. It's part Kafka. The baby is like some weird Cronenberg creature. Nance is doing most of his acting thru his hair. This is a lot of weird ideas from the mind of David Lynch. It kind of overwhelms any story in the end. It reminds me of the second season of 'Twin Peaks' where his craziness becomes greater than any traditional story or even the characters.,Eraserhead
3,Hitchcoc,Every Nightmare I've Ever Had,8,25 August 2009,"My experiences with David Lynch always leave me saying ""What?"" This is no exception. I have seen posters and pictures advertising this film for the thirty odd years it has been around. I always wondered about it. I finally had a chance to view it and found it to be the perfect representative of those weird anxiety dreams that all of us have. Start with a very strange young man who isn't half as strange as the rest of the characters. Throw in a marriage and the offspring of that marriage, a lizard who is quite ill. These people are trapped caring for this thing, not knowing exactly how it appeared or why. There those Pinter like pauses and odd statements made at the oddest times. There is no future that anyone can recognize; where are they going. There are scenes of people dancing and stepping on the heads of more snake-like creatures, cruel exchanges, a man's head being severed and made into pencil erasers. Does this sound like your typical film? And, yet, I couldn't take my eyes off it. I had lapsed into my own nightmare state, I guess. It is about as claustrophobic as anything I've ever seen. I wanted fresh air after seeing this.",Eraserhead
4,Horst_In_Translation,Ultimately nothing is memorable apart from the head,4,11 November 2016,"""Eraserhead"" is an American black-and-white movie from 1977, so this one has its 40th anniversary next year. It is an English-language film and the writer and director here is the (in)famous David Lynch. He was around the age of 30 when this one came out and after a series of short films, this was his very first full feature film. It is relatively short still though at easily under 90 minutes. The lead actor here is the late Jack Nance and he worked with Lynch on other occasions too. This one here is maybe his career-defining performance. And I can see why. Honestly, he is the only somewhat memorable aspect about this film. It reminds me a lot of Lynch's early short film works, not just because of the lack of color, but also in terms of style and the whole absurdity in this film. It's tough to classify it as a genre. Is it mystery? Thriller? Fantasy? Horror? Sci-fi? Family drama? Maybe a bit of everything. As with some other Lynch works, the cast is not really famous and I must say I am not familiar with any of the names in here. Lynch also does not have a cameo this time in contrast to some of his later (and also earlier) works.Today, this film is considered a bit of a cult film, but I cannot see the appeal at all. I give almost every production value a thumbs-down, with the exception of Nance as his face expression and haircut is somewhat memorable here and makes it at least somewhat entertaining. The rest of the film is pretty much garbage though. You can not justify the lack of a convincing story by the director's absurd take on the material. There is no good performance in here really and the supporting characters feel utterly forgettable. The ""good"" thing about the film is that there is so little dialogue in here that you can understand the movie no matter where you are from and you don't even really have to be able to understand the English language. I wrote ""good"" because the real difficulty is to understand the film at all because it is so abstract and incoherent. Of course, it is an atmospheric watch and not a bad achievement for a rookie work I guess, but all the dozens of references Lynch included here about culture and film are probably mostly understood and recognized by Lynch himself. I just cannot give this film a thumbs-up and I also cannot say that this movie makes me curious about the many other films by Lynch I have not (yet?) seen so far. Thumbs-down from me and I do not recommend the watch.",Eraserhead
5,claudio_carvalho,Harrowing Nightmare,7,27 August 2006,"In a post-apocalyptic society, Henry Spencer (John Nance) works in a factory and has a girlfriend, Mary (Charlotte Stewart). When she gets pregnant, she moves to his apartment and delivers a mutant baby, who cries all the time. She can not bear the screams of the child, living Henry, who is on vacation, taking care of the newborn child and driving him insane.""Eraserhead"" gives the unique uncomfortable sensation of watching a harrowing nightmare. The bizarre characters, a trademark of David Lynch, together with an unbearable sound of machines working in a nasty environment of destruction give an amazing view of a possible pessimist future of mankind. The original cinematographic language of David Lynch in his first movie gives a magnificent sample of the future work of this great director, one of the best and more creative in the contemporary cinema industry. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Eraserhead
6,classicsoncall,"""Oh, you are sick!""",4,29 November 2019,"Well, I'm not going to say that I was never so relieved to have a movie end with regard to ""Eraserhead"", but it sure was an extreme exercise in physical and mental endurance. Nor am I going to say that it was a mind blowingly stupid film, because I'll leave that up to your own judgment. Fortunately it ran about a half hour shorter than your average feature film, so that was a plus. But my oh my, the images are disturbing and the story line is incoherent, other than the idea that the movie's protagonist Henry (Jack Nance) is caught in some version of a personal nightmare with a forced marriage resulting from a pregnancy gone wrong. There's not much sense you can make out of the story so any interpretation you might give it is as valid as the next person's I guess. And I usually go in for movie symbolism when you can connect the dots in a rational way but this was one step beyond. I will make the observation that David Lynch might have been inspired by Chaplin when he came up with the dinner scene with the dancing chicken. It provided the picture's most endearing line of dialog when Mr. X instructed Henry to ""...just cut 'em up like regular chickens.""",Eraserhead
7,gavin6942,The Feature Film Debut of the Great David Lynch,8,17 April 2011,"Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) tries to survive his industrial environment, his angry girlfriend, and the unbearable screams of his newly born mutant child.If you know David Lynch's work, this debut may not be a shock to you. And if you know that his background is actual in art (specifically painting) rather than film, the images he puts on screen may make a good deal more sense -- he is much more concerned with a visual presentation rather than any sort of coherent plot.While the film is certainly more bizarre than ""Mulholland Drive"" or ""Lost Highway"" or ""Twin Peaks"", those films (and more) give a hint that Lynch has a unique vision. (If you have seen his short films, including ""Alphabet"", then you know exactly what to expect.) How do you review this film? You will like it or hate it, probably. Howard Maxford seems unsure how to categorize this film. In his brief review, he calls the picture ""clever but ultimately depressing"", ""boring"" and ""an alienating and tasteless experience.""The film is bizarre, has no real plot (the brief version written above is really a stretch and ignores the pencil factory, man in the planet and woman in the radiator). And how does Sissy Spacek tie in? Mel Brooks loved this film, and because of it offered Lynch ""The Elephant Man"", quite possibly Lynch's biggest critical success. Stanley Kubrick also loved the film and screened it for the crew during production of ""The Shining"".Lynch fans who have not seen this one need to see it. Others may not need to see it, unless you like a dose of the surreal (if you liked Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" then you will love Lynch).",Eraserhead
8,jboothmillard,Eraserhead,8,14 August 2006,"Director David Lynch (The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet) in his later films made a few films that have hard to follow stories and plot lines, but this one has pretty much no plot at all. Basically in a seemingly post-apocalyptic world of an industrial town lives big-haired factory worker Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) who is attending dinner with his girlfriend Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) and her parents Bill (Allen Joseph) and Mrs. X (Jeanne Bates). Together they try to feast on chickens the size of a person's fist, but carving it proves tricky, especially when it spews blood and Mary has spastic fits. Henry then finds out that Mary has given birth to their baby, a mutant looking creature that squeaks and cries all the time, so they obviously have to move in together to care for it. Mary leaves after not too long living with her boyfriend and their baby because of the continuing screams of the child, leaving Henry to care for it himself, slowly driving him insane. To escape the sight and sounds of his baby he diverts to watching and listening to the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near) with her puffed up cheeks singing about heavenly things. There is a particular moment when madness truly hits Henry when he sees himself on the Lady's stage in a courtroom style set-up, his head comes off, and is replaced by his mutant baby. Henry's head then falls down into a street where it is cracked open, exposing his brains, and a Boy (Thomas Coulson) takes the head with brain to The Boss (T. Max Graham, or Neil Moran). A portion of the brain is put into a machine, becoming eraser ends fro pencils (hence the title), which is checked by the Pencil Machine Operator (Hal Landon Jr.), who approves the brain is perfect. When Henry returns from this dream or whatever, he can't take anymore from the mutant baby either, so he takes the very harsh decision to stab it to death, before ending the film in the arms of the Lady in the Radiator. Also starring Judith Roberts as Beautiful Girl Across the Hall and Jean Lange as Grandmother. Throughout the film you see all sorts of weird, creepy, disgusting and unsettling things, I quite like the plant in soil on a table with no pot, but the stand-out moments are of course the tiny chickens, any part with the baby, and the infamous brain scene. This utterly imagined nightmare really taps into all your senses, making you feel uncomfortable, and the non-linear narrative is up there with Un Chien Andalou, certainly a must see cult experimental horror. Very good!",Eraserhead
9,Woodyanders,Truly haunting and peculiar 70's cult item,9,6 September 2017,"Unlikable misfit factory worker Henry Spencer (a nicely deadpan portrayal by Jack Nance) lives in hellish squalor in a shabby apartment with his glum girlfriend Mary X (the pretty, but shrill Charlotte Stewart) and their grotesque constantly mewling mutant baby.With its jarring sound design, bleak industrial landscape, hypnotically gradual pace, funky old school practical special effects, and potently brooding gloom-doom mood fraught with dread, decay, and despair, David Lynch's debut full-length feature possesses a surreal nightmarish atmosphere that's uniquely its own singularly warped thing. Better still, the grim dream-like world presented herein proves to be so vivid, aberrant, and strangely convincing that once seen it's impossible to forget about. The interesting array of colorfully quirky secondary characters rates as another substantial asset: Allen Joseph as cranky plumber Mr. X, Laurel Near as a sweet and cheerful swollen-cheeked gal who lives in Harry's radiator, Jack Fisk as the badly scarred man in the planet, Judith Ann Robets as a seductive and predatory neighbor, Neil Moran as Henry's stern boss, and Darwin Joston as browbeaten desk clerk Paul. The striking black and white cinematography by Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell offers a wondrous wealth of startling and bizarre visuals. A fascinating one-of-a-kind oddity.",Eraserhead
10,rmax304823,Vision Quest.,6,14 May 2009,"I came in late and left early on this one but I don't think it makes much difference. This poor guy whose head sticks up like the pink eraser on the end of a pencil (Jack Nance) lives a shabby life in an industrial setting. He has to put up with a shabby girl friend who takes up all the bed and leaves him on the edge with only a blanket full of holes. She clacks her teeth while sleeping and when she rubs her eye the sound is that of a finger rubbing an inflated balloon. He has to put up with a mutant baby with the ugliest tiny head since the monster's in ""Alien"" -- and when the infant gets sick, the head bursts out in pustules.But there's no real narrative line to describe and none for a viewer to lose. I think maybe what David Lynch was doing was pretty ambitious: an attempt to create a Gesamtkunstwerk on a minuscule budget, a fusion of images and sounds and a trip through the time line that all need to be taken together, grasped and appreciated as a whole.I would judge that he succeeded on his own terms. That is, what Lynch has put on the screen is pretty much precisely what he wanted to. The least we can say about it is that it's consistent. Everything we see or hear is itchy or slimy. If Lynch wants to break off from what skeletal story there is and dissolve to a woman wearing an overblown blond wig, standing on a stark stage, and singing ""In Heaven, Everything's Alright,"" backed by shimmering dissonant organ chords, he does it. And if he wants to insert a shot of a drifting meteor, he does THAT. He doesn't ask anybody. He just goes ahead and DOES it.That's okay. A chaque a son gout. The problem is that Lynch's notion of what's interesting -- forget about ""beautiful"" -- may not correspond to that of anyone else. It certainly doesn't overlap with mine, although it seems to have struck a resonant chord in many others.I couldn't have more respect for a director than I do for David Lynch. I was an atmosphere person in ""Blue Velvet,"" which, to my surprise, turned out to be a great film in many ways, as was ""The Elephant Man."" He was behind the camera for eighteen straight hours for one scene and looked wrecked. I doubt that commercial considerations occupy much of his life space.The impression I get here, though, is that Lynch was testing reality, asking himself and his producers just how far he could drop down the rabbit hole and get away with it. He got pretty far down.His later work was, in my judgment, an improvement -- still weird, still a cinematic tribute to textures -- but linked to a structure that we can grasp. A better balance between the formless and the rigid. People whose intentions and character we can empathize with. When Jack Nance begins to pull out these repugnant things from his girl friend's body, one placenta after another, and flings them away in disgust, why doesn't he get up and run like hell for the police? It's Lynch's vision and he gets all kinds of bonus points for originality. Nobody had ever done anything quite like this. The closest thing I can think of is slitting a goat's eyeball open with a razor in ""Un Chien Andalou"" and that was back in 1929 and Luis Bunuel had to drag in Salvador Dali.Actually, a movie like this would prompt me to wonder what, exactly, was going on in the writer/director's head. There is a rich hint of psychosis. Yet David Lynch himself, when he appears in interviews, is always dressed in a sports coat with a shirt buttoned up to the neck. When he speaks, he sounds perfectly reasonable, like a guy behind a drug store counter.Well -- if it helped him find his footing....",Eraserhead
11,moonspinner55,Not your garden-variety freak out,5,11 December 2006,"To review David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" is to review the man himself, which is nearly impossible since he's as enigmatic as what he puts on screen (images oozing out gracefully, sometimes grotesquely). It isn't any wonder why Lynch's output has made him a cult figure and hero: he simply doesn't pander to any known movie regulations (he's his best audience), and his very dry humor reaches us cautiously, creeping up like fingers from beyond the grave. Lynch directs nightmares, but not just anybody's nightmares. His horrific hallucinations seem to stem from childhood--a lone boy's mounting terror at being sucked down into the unknown--and yet he revels in the experience. He's a consummate filmmaker, and often a quiet masochist, but if a viewer isn't attuned to Lynch's rhythms--or his fascination with the perverse--the twisted imagery just starts to look silly and self-indulgent. ""Eraserhead"" concerns two unwed freaks and their mutant offspring, and it is filmed in startling black-and-white utilizing a fine central actor (John ""Jack"" Nance, whose perplexity and child-like confusion is the most sympathetic part of the picture). David Lynch is green here, and probably unconcerned with audience reaction, but his style (a series of sickly scenes of human deterioration) is certainly gripping. The film is really not much more than a project, a talented student showing off, and it isn't absorbing as a whole. But in vignette form, and surely in retrospect, ""Eraserhead"" holds a peculiar power unmatched by any picture from a major Hollywood studio. Its eerie ambiance isn't accidental--Lynch is quite calculating as a scenarist and as a director--although the end results could be less personal than anyone realizes. It could be the ultimate in-joke on celluloid. ** from ****",Eraserhead
12,dbdumonteil,a nice nightmare,8,11 July 2011,"David Lynch's first film which took five years to make, essentially for financial reasons, Eraserhead is a film you'd rather watch than tell. In an interview led by French newspaper Liberation in 1987, the filmmaker was asked why he was making cinema and he answered: ""to create a world and to experiment it"". This is what he perfectly does throughout this oppressive nightmare.Eraserhead can be read at different levels. At the first degree, the filmmaker develops a simple story that is constantly distorted by the bizarre and the horror. An artistic choice reinforced by an audacious making with disturbing shots. Set in an industrial town, the main protagonist Henry (Jack Nance) has a girlfriend Mary (the actress was the teacher miss Beadle in Little House TV series). He's invited to dinner by the young girl's parents. This sequence flops. Then, Mary raises a monstrous fetus that's constantly crying and treats him like a normal baby. Shattered by its incessant cries, she's leaving Henry's room, leaving him alone with the monster. The latter doesn't seem to want to take care of it and wants to eliminate it.Throughout his work, Lynch shows Henry trying to escape from this oppressive world. Numerous shots depict enlarged details belonging to objects or parts of the room and they are shot in a weird manner. Furthermore, two ladies are in his mind: his female neighbor with whom he seems to be in love and the lady in the radiator who sings corny songs. But the monstrous fetus always reappears...I'm not a David Lynch aficionado but throughout the years I warmed to his first visual nightmare and it remains a testing experience. A must-see film.",Eraserhead
13,Quinoa1984,still likely the Strangest film I Have Ever Seen,10,13 September 2000,"David Lynch's Eraserhead makes Being John Malkovich, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Lost Highway (another Lynch flick) combined look like they are chicken feed. And years later, having immersed myself in all of Lynch's work (minus Twin Peaks), going through numerous other ""cult"" and nightmarish films, and even recognizing the slower bits in the film, it still holds up for me as one of the filmmaker's masterpieces. Believe me, you will rarely see a stranger and more terrifying film in your lifetime until you see this. The plot (which if you can find you win a prize in your mind I think) has a weird zombie-like man (with a Al Sharpton like hair-do) who accidentally gets his spastic girlfriend pregnant and what comes out is a creature that is probably the unwanted child of an alien and a gasoline can. For most of the film though are images and scenes of macabre and fright that are authentic in their own way; abstractions that sometimes are humorous (the best being the highly uncomfortable and classic scene at dinner with the chickens) and sometimes purely out-of-this world. Lynch, while artistically might be by this work as mentally balanced as The Monster in Frankenstein, can make a film so weird, evil-feeling, yet compelling as all hell, that it boggles the mind. Very low budget, this is definitely one of the top 10 best debut films ever.",Eraserhead
14,wes-connors,Surrealistic Pillow,10,7 June 2009,"David Lynch is like a hollow chocolate egg. This doesn't work in something like ""Twin Peaks"" (1990) because so much more is promised. But, ""Eraserhead"" has no such limitations. You can leave it hollow, or fill in the egg yourself. The planet (God) image bracketing this film reveals what is inside the egg, during the film's conclusion. Possibly because we are witnessing a loss of virginity, this surrealistic pillow is the purest, most intrinsic Lynch. If Mr. Lynch is successful, your imagination has allowed you to either taste ""Eraserhead"" on an artistic level, or become consumed by the picture; if neither prevail, get out your eraser and go back to the drawing board.

15,Coventry,The twisted world of David Lynch,9,4 September 2003,"I'm always a bit worried when I'm about to express my love towards this movie by the genius director David Lynch... I figure it's the perfect indicator for psychiatrists to claim that you're completely nuts :) But what the heck, they're a lot of nutballs on this website, so I can speak my mind freely. Indeed, I love this movie...although 'love' may be a wrong term to describe my feelings towards it. This movie 'fascinates' me is a much better saying. Usually, a movie is something in which you can live yourself in...in order to escape the stress of real life. Eraserhead is the exact opposite of that ! When watching this film, you can only hope that you'll never awake in the wold like Lynch shows it here. The horrible noises, the colorless and tasteless locations and the insensible characters...you all hate to love it. Eraserhead takes a walk with your emotions, you don't know whether to be disgusted or intrigued by it. So you'll feel uncomfortable when watching it and that's a wonderful experience for a cinema freak !Eraserhead is the ultimate cult film in my opinion and a must see for every fan of this delicious genre. In fact, I would go so far to say you can't call yourself a cult-freak if you haven't seen it yet.David Lynch begins his highly impressive career with this one and it still lives on. Eraserhead isn't his best film at all ( certainly not when it comes to storyline ) but it's his most deep and personal tale. 25 years old and still the ""weirdest"" film ever. That's an achievement, certainly with all this artistic filmmakers lately...or, at least, they try to be...)I want to encourage as much people as possible to see this one, but it's for the best that some groups of people avoid it. Surely not recommended if you're depressed or suicidal...The image of Jack Nance and the rest of the cast could even put you more down, I think. The tagline of this movie - ""In heaven, everything looks fine"" - could become a stimulus, I'm afraid. Pregnant women and young couples in love should beware as well !! This film is the ultimate nightmare for that what should be the greatest miracle of life...The hideous but yet harmless ""baby"" ( I really don't know how I should call it, actually )is the purest form of horror that ever occurred on the screen.You must have respect for director David Lynch. If you imagine how hard it must have been to create and finance this production. But it worked...hell, even comedy legend Mel Brooks was deeply impressed. Based on this film, he decided to let Lynch direct ""The Elephant Man"" a few years later. By that, David's career was launched and of course he made a masterpiece out of it. For me personally, his highlights were the 80's with terrific movies like ""Blue Velvet"", ""Dune"" ( very underrated, in my opinion) and ""Wild at Heart"" at the end of the decade. And let's not forget the best TV-series ever made: ""Twin Peaks"".Please, watch this movie !! Three times in a row if possible. I know a lot of people who just stopped watching it after half and hour ( or less ) and yelled ""What the f*** is this ???"". Real shame, if you ask me. It's an insight to a great mind and a unique event. If you really don't see the magic of it, at least try to admire the very stylish haircut of the main character. I'm thinking of doing the same thing with mine...",Eraserhead
16,Hey_Sweden,"In Heaven, everything is fine.",8,26 November 2014,"Jack Nance plays Henry Spencer, a timid, tall haired man living in an oppressive industrial environment. He must deal with not only a temperamental girlfriend, Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), but the supposed offspring of their union: a worm-like mutant child whose incessant wailing drives the mother mad. It looks like Henry desperately needs some sort of reprieve from his overwhelming existence.Filmed in beautifully stark black & white by cinematographers Herbert Cardwell and Frederick Elmes, ""Eraserhead"" marked the arrival of filmmaker David Lynch in a major way. This debut has a potent and nightmarish quality which drew this viewer in from the beginning. The sometimes disturbing and gross visuals are telling the story just as much as any narrative. In fact, there isn't much of a narrative here, but a series of images tying together that film buffs can have fun trying to analyze.The atmosphere is bleak but lovely right from the start. The acting is just right in all of the major roles. Lynch favourite Nance is a striking lead. Allen Joseph adds some offbeat (than again, what about this film *isn't* offbeat?) humour as Mary's father. Jeanne Bates, Judith Roberts, and Laurel Near co-star; Lynchs' daughter Jennifer has a small role, and that's Darwin Joston of ""Assault on Precinct 13"" fame as the front desk man at the pencil factory.The use of music is haunting, but what really got to this viewer is the sound design, by Lynch and Alan Splet. In fact, Lynch wore a lot of hats on this show: director, writer, producer, editor, production designer, and art director. Catherine E. Coulson, the future Log Lady of 'Twin Peaks', was Lynchs' assistant director and assistant camera person. Listed among the ""special thanks"" are Sissy Spacek and her husband, veteran art director Jack Fisk; Fisk has an acting role here.Both unforgettable and unpredictable, ""Eraserhead"" truly got under this viewers' skin.Eight out of 10.",Eraserhead
17,poolandrews,Almost impossible to do justice in a few words.,3,15 November 2010,"Eraserhead is set in some dark, noisy & dirty industrial city where Henry Spence (Jack Nance) lives in a small apartment on his own, the utter banality of his existence is frightening. Invited over to his girlfriends (Charlotte Stewart) house Henry is told by her mother (Jeanne Bates) that her daughter has given birth to his child, she expects the two married very soon & the baby to be picked up from the hospital. Henry discovers that his baby is a mutant that screams constantly, the constant noise & pressure gets to Henry's girlfriend she leaves him & the baby to go back home to live with her parents. Left alone with his wailing baby in his cramped little apartment life & fatherhood becomes almost unbearable for Henry...Written, produced & directed by David Lynch who also gets production designer, sound effects, special effects, editing & original music credits many consider Eraserhead as some sort of classic, some sort of modern surreal masterpiece oozing with metaphors & deep symbolism but I really can't see where those opinions come from. Eraserhead is the sort of film that really does defy description or categorisation as it's one of a kind, not meant as a typical straight forward film with a linear story that can be understood easily Eraserhead is hard to interpret & seems like one long surreal dream full of symbols & metaphors for everyday life & it's the way you subconsciously interpret these images & metaphors that will ultimately decide how much you get from Eraserhead. Unfortunately for me I just thought Eraserhead was a random collection of seemingly unconnected weirdness that never came together in any meaningful way & if I have to think about the meaning or message of a film or even something as basic as what's it's about then the artsy symbolism & surrealist nonsense has probably gone over my head & as a whole the film wasn't obviously for me. For a film like Eraserhead to work you need to associate the surrealism & metaphors with something tangible & I didn't, I just thought Eraserhead was a mess of scenes & images that overall meant nothing to me.Maybe the single biggest cult film of all time Eraserhead is definitely worthy of it's notoriety, filmed in black and white with barely any dialogue & nothing in the way of standard narrative for an audience to grip onto Eraserhead isn't an easy watch. From piles of dirt on Henry's dresser to a bizarre scene where an old woman starts singing & dancing while giant sperm rain down which she them tramples to when Henry's head falls off & is replaced by his mutant babies to a general weirdness & unease that the not quite right normality it has. Apparently shot over five years as & when first time director Lynch got some money Eraserhead is amazingly well made considering it's low budget with a really crisp & clean look about it, sure it's weird but it's also stylish & nice to look at. Two years into filming original cinematographer Herbert Cardwell died in his sleep & was replaced by Frederick Elmes for the rest of the shoot.Shot on a budget of about $20,000 Eraserhead is incredibly well made with great special effects & some mildly gross-out scenes of mutant babies, decapitated heads & giant sperm. The acting is pretty good & quite intense although there's barely any dialogue & the character's are never fleshed out.Eraserhead is hailed as some sort of cult classic that I admit just went over my head, I thought it was a boring mess of a film with scenes of surrealist weirdness that to me didn't mean anything. I didn't get it, so what? Life is too short to spend hours thinking & analyzing a film, isn't it?",Eraserhead

I know that amongst the millions of imdb contributors out there, such as myself, someone would be able to interpret the stream of images I just watched.As it stands, I haven't the foggiest clue what this movie was about. I saw that it was labeled a horror and has a rating above seven so I thought it was a safe play to pay $3 to watch. Fooled again. What I saw was some cockamamie artsy film relying heavily on strange imagery and very little on things such as dialogue, character development, or a cohesive script. Very little, if anything, made sense. I'm sure most of what I just witnessed was representative of something more, but damn if I know what the deeper meaning is.",Eraserhead
20,neil-476,Not really my sort of thing,6,18 March 2012,"When I critique a film, I usually begin with a synopsis. That is where my problems start with David Lynch's Eraserhead: what with not having a conventional narrative, it doesn't lend itself to being easily synopsised.So let me say that it appears to be about a strange man and matters and characters concerning his strange mutant offspring although any or all of it may be fantasy.I must say initially that I suspect that the movie is very close to showing on screen exactly what David Lynch intended: I can't imagine these images or events being accidental or unintentional.I must then go on to say that I don't like it very much. Not just because it doesn't tell a conventional narrative in a conventional way, although that's part of it. But more because what it shows doesn't please me. The images are unpleasant and unappealing. The main character doesn't invite me to identify with him. I don't understand what Lynch is trying to do, as a result of which I can't engage with the movie on any level except visual and, on that level, Lynch seems to have set out to ply me with a disturbing visual experience which I didn't enjoy.So I have to say that while I admire Lynch's ability to capture something which is, at best odd and, at worst, twisted, it wasn't really my thing.",Eraserhead
21,evanston_dad,David Lynch's Bizarre Nightmare of Fatherhood,8,5 December 2007,"This phantasmagorical David Lynch film is nearly suffocating in its ability to immerse its audience in a domestic nightmare. It's a fascinating film, but not one I can say I necessarily enjoyed watching.All of Lynch's fever dream movies are open to interpretation, so I can only say what I took from this film personally. To me it was entirely about the fear of responsibility and the potential stagnation that comes with domestic married life and fatherhood. The baby in this film is literally a creature from another planet; it's threatening not because it's evil or menacing itself but rather because it has needs and wants that it has no clear way of communicating and which its father doesn't entirely comprehend. The film manages to capture in images and sounds the kind of abstract thoughts and fears that lead men into mid-life crises.It's a difficult film to summarize or even describe, other than to say that it lingers in the brain and is amazingly unsettling to watch.Grade: A",Eraserhead
22,Aaron1375,"I always wanted to see it and now that I have, not sure what I watched",7,2 January 2015,"I had always heard about this movie...about how it was very strange and it is hard to figure out what exactly is going on. By golly, it is very strange and hard to figure out. I watched this film and when it ended I was pretty much like, ""What did I just watch?"" A surreal type film where it seems Lynch is taking us to a world that is similar to ours in many ways, but vastly different than ours in very disturbing ways. A place where life is just as normal and dull as a day in our own lives, but at times is an utter nightmare so horrid that those who live within it just wish for death to escape it. Still, one wonders what it all means as this film kept becoming more and more bizarre as it progressed. A very disturbing film that had odd bits of humor here and there and periods where one felt uncomfortable to watch.The story has a man named Henry. He is apparently on vacation and his girlfriend apparently wants him over for dinner. He goes to this dinner only to learn that not only is Mary's family very strange, but also that Mary has had a child...or perhaps something else as Mary herself said that they were not even sure it was a baby. Well, Henry becomes a father unexpectedly and soon his girlfriend leaves him with said child. He becomes frustrated and wants the neighbor across the hall, but is also drawn to the mysterious girl within the radiator who sings of heaven.At times, I have no idea what is going on, but at other I feel almost as if I do. When Henry goes to meet his girlfriend's parents it almost seems to me that Henry suffers from social anxiety disorder. That everything is being blown out of proportion by his condition. Suffering from this condition when I come upon things I am not used to and being around people I am unfamiliar everything seems to go wrong in my mind and the most awkward situations keep popping up. Like how he gets roped into carving the chicken which promptly bleeds and the mother runs out of the room screaming and then the father tries to have a conversation with Henry who is very uncomfortable at the moment. Then other parts of the film are just so strange that I am unable to figure out what is going on except Henry is becoming increasingly unhappy and frustrated. However, he seems to find relief at the end as the last shot of him embracing the girl in the radiator shows him having an expression of pure relief.So, this film was well done and is something that is up for interpretation. I do not find it pretentious as I feel a more pretentious film shows imagery that tries to make it look like it is showing something really deep, but in reality means absolutely nothing. Here, I do get a sense that there is something behind what is being presented. Lynch did an excellent job of presenting this strange world and I would almost like to see more of it as it is such a strange and horrific place. Henry's story ended, but perhaps another viewpoint could have been done at one point of this nightmarish realm that so mirrors our world, but at the same time has deep cracks in it.",Eraserhead

27,Red-Barracuda,I locked myself out of my apartment......and it's so late.,9,29 May 2013,"Made over a period of five years, Eraserhead was director David Lynch's debut feature film. Up until this point he had made several short art films that had a heavy surrealist influence. Eraserhead is also an art film too. Its imagery and audio are intense, while its plot-line is pretty seriously far removed from any conventional ideas of traditional cinematic story-telling. In order to appreciate it, you need to be able to connect more with the rhythm and feel of the film, rather than try to understand its logical meaning. It's because audiences are unconsciously trained to expect the latter when watching films that many feel alienated from this movie. It's understandable of course as this is not an easy film in any sense. Not only is it not easy to interpret but its pacing is very deliberate and slow with a tone that is quite disturbingly down-beat. It probably doesn't really need to be said but Eraserhead is certainly not a film for everyone.The protagonist is a man called Henry (played by Lynch regular Jack Nance) who lives in an unspecified, bleak dystopian world. He and his girlfriend have a baby who is hideously freakish. We observe the nightmarish world that surrounds the passive Henry.In the world of Eraserhead things continually aren't what they seem, even if on the surface they look quite normal. Ordinary items such as radiators have the power to disturb. Lynch seems to have a skill in presenting everyday items in such a way that they take on a sinister veneer. It's a feature of his films overall but it was here where it was first so evident. In the logic of Eraserhead worlds exist within worlds and behind the radiator in Henry's room lives a grotesque character called simply the Lady in the Radiator. She performs on a small stage and sings about how 'in heaven everything is fine'. It's sort of like the type of strange worlds that little children wilfully invent to amuse themselves – but it takes a confident artist to bring such an abstract idea to the screen is so committed a fashion.While Eraserhead's fantasy world was not one Lynch would immerse himself in so fully ever again, there were many aspects of this film that he would never abandon. The chief being the specific way in which he interlinks the visual with the aural. The sound design is just as important as the images on screen; the audio assaults the viewer just as intensely - the constant wailing of the baby, the repetitive industrial noise outside and the low hum of the soundtrack. The dialogue, too, works in a similar way. It's very sparse and deliberate, even sometimes funny. In such an intense film Lynch does have strangely comical moments such as the squabbling pencil makers or the somewhat uncomfortable family dinner scene. Bizarre humour is after all another less commented upon feature of the director.Whatever you think of Eraserhead – and many will hate it – it has to be admitted that it's a one off. The product of a very unique mind. Many have interpreted it in various ways and while some ideas do make some sense such as it being a reflection of Lynch's fears of impending fatherhood, I think it's only fair to surmise that this is essentially a pretty impenetrable movie; one that has to be felt more than it should be understood. If you can get into its specific rhythms you could really appreciate it.",Eraserhead
28,KineticSeoul,"Yeah, it's weird and surreal but this one just wasn't for me",5,10 August 2013,"Some call this film a masterpiece, but I don't know. Personally this film just wasn't for me. Sure it's surreal and weird with a bit of horror aspect to it. But personally, maybe I missed something but I just didn't appreciate this film. It's a David Lynch film so I was prepared for weirdness but that is all that seems to be going for this film. It's just so darn slow while mainly just focusing on the imagery most of the time. A lot of times, I just can't get into art-house types of movies and this is one I just couldn't get into. The plot is just flat and hardly anything to it, but it's still about a hour and a half long since it moves along so slowly. Despite the weird and surreal imagery and characters I was bored with this one. With the constant eerie space noises in the background. Which is in some art-house films, maybe to bring out the feeling of chaos. The protagonist Henry seems like a nice guy who is just out of it and confused most of the way through. And he actually adds to the surrounding and made me understand what might be going on a bit more. I don't know maybe I just missed out on a lot of the symbolism or something. Or maybe some people that praise this film are just self-indulgent and pretentious to the point of liking this film(or acting like they like it). Maybe it is a brilliant film, but personally I just didn't enjoy it much. It felt way too slow for my taste and I started to run out of patience. It does seem to pick up after the first hour though. For a surreal, weird with horror film I recommend ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"".5/10",Eraserhead
29,MOscarbradley,Some kind of masterpiece,9,26 August 2017,"The first time I saw ""Eraserhead"" was in the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton. My friend Gerry had already seen it in San Francisco and was still in paroxysms of praise for the picture so I went in with high expectations; even so, I still wasn't prepared for what I saw that night. I was meeting Gerry in the bar next door afterwards but when I left the cinema I was still in something of a daze, or perhaps a trance, and started walking in the wrong direction. I knew I had seen some kind of masterpiece but I also knew here was a film I wouldn't want to sit through again, at least not for a very long time. Well, here we are 40 years later and I've just seen ""Eraserhead"" again.For anyone still ignorant of the fact, ""Eraserhead"" was the film that introduced David Lynch to the world and a few minutes into the film was enough to tell us that here was a singular new talent worthy to sit on a pedestal next to the young Welles, not that Welles would ever make a film like ""Eraserhead""; indeed who, other than Lynch, would.There is a plot of sorts but essentially Lynch's film, luminously shot in black and white by Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell, unfolds like a living nightmare, but whose? Lynch's? Henry's, (the central character that established Jack Nance as a cult actor for a new generation), or our own? Certainly there are images here enough to give the strongest of us nightmares, images and sounds, (this film has some of the finest sound designs ever recorded).It has been described as experimental, as avant-garde and by some just as a plain old horror film. You could say it's also a kind of love story, though a very warped and forbidding one. Lynch, of course, would go on to the likes of ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks"" and would never fully abandon the sensibilities first seen in this extraordinary film. I was more prepared for it this time but it still blew me away.",Eraserhead
30,bowmanblue,Horror unlike nothing you've seen before,10,15 July 2017,"Horror movies have become pretty formulaic these days. They consist of either zombies, a masked killer, or a spooky entity terrorising a family. Even the better ones that subverted those sub-genres were still instantly recognisable as what they were and any that were hailed as 'original' were most likely remakes from Japanese films. However, back before CGI blood had become the norm and a group of five American teens could go on a road trip to the middle of nowhere without being picked off by pitchfork-wielding locals, came David Lynch's horror masterpiece, 'Eraserhead.' I guess it could be described as a bit of a 'passion project' as it took him years to make, due to him filming it while he studied/worked other jobs and generally did his best to get this movie financed. Now, you can probably tell that I'm a fan, however I will admit that no matter how much it appeals to me, it's definitely not for everyone. You could almost call it an 'art film' as it's filmed entirely in black and white and has little to no dialogue. The story – or at least what we can tell is a story – centres around a young, downtrodden man called Henry (played by long term friend and actor of David Lynch, Jack Nance) as he shuffles back and forth to and from his job to his flat in what looks like some sort of post apocalyptic industrial landscape. It's a bleak and meaningless existence for a man in a bleak and meaningless environment. I think the black and white adds to the overall mood of the tale. Whatever is really happening in Henry's world, he is merely a small cog in a much larger machine. However, just because his life is bleak doesn't seem to make it dull. He does seem to have a girlfriend. I use the word 'seem' as their relationship is never made truly clear. And, upon meeting her parents for the first time, discovers that there's a baby at the hospital and he's going to have to help look after it.Now, this may not sound like the most sinister and horrific story ever told. However, I may have slightly overlooked some of the other things that occur. For example the 'mini chickens' Henry eats at his potential inlaws' house appears to be alive. The baby is a deformed freakish-looking thing that may or may not even be human. It whines continuously and there's a lady living in his radiator with bizarre cheeks who crushes slithering worm-like creatures underfoot. Yes, it's weird. But then this comes from the mind of David Lynch – the man who eventually went on to give us Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, Mullholland Drive and almost every other twisted, surreal modern nightmare ever put down on film.Now, as I say, it's not for everyone. It's hardly a 'date movie' and most people will probably be either bored or confused (or both). It's very slow. It doesn't make as much sense as most films with their classic Hollywood narratives and overall many will find it just too damn weird to be watchable. However, if you're in the mood for something a little different (and when I say 'different' I mean horrifically different!) then 'Eraserhead' is certainly a film that has to be watched to be experienced. Whether you end up loving it or hating it, it will definitely stick in your mind for many years to come.",Eraserhead
31,gbill-74877,Kafkaesque,6,28 July 2017,"You have to admire director David Lynch's creativity and for the focus he had in putting his vision on film. In 'Eraserhead', he creates a dehumanizing and nightmarish world, hyperbolically amplifying the awkwardness and isolation many feel in real life. He uses black and white film, light and shadow, long, drawn out takes, and ghoulish, haunting sounds in addition to 'creepy', outrageous moments to play this up. The result is absurdity along the lines of Franz Kafka's 'The Metamorphosis', and if you like Kafka or highly unconventional movies with a dark take on life, you'll probably love this one. For my taste, though, while it held my interest and I appreciated what Lynch was going for, it's just a little too dark.",Eraserhead

34,atlasmb,How I Spent My Absurd Summer Vacation,3,22 May 2017,"""Eraserhead"" is not surrealism or abstraction, though some reviewers have tried to place it within those styles. It belongs to the cinema of the absurd. Viewers will find that it intends to shock, to confuse, to portray the unexpected.This is an easy style to work within, because your work can never be criticized for being incoherent, sloppy or wrong. Absurdism allows anything without rules or judgment. To say that a work of absurdism is good or bad is, in effect, nonsensical. Such works can be fascinating, however, or boring.The early scenes of this film declare the absurdist intention. The viewer is intrigued, hoping to find some thread of reason or purpose. But the action appears to be a collection of scenes from nightmares, tied together with a loose continuity.Influenced by Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"", the main character, Henry, lives in a desolate and dirty minimalistic world. He is on vacation, but nothing enjoyable happens. The film borders on the horror genre and probably should not be watched during dinner. Background sounds usually consist of various white noise sounds. Lighting is dramatic and stark. Director David Lynch created this film over five years. It's an opus of dedication by one man, much like ""Carnival of Souls"" or ""The World's Greatest Sinner"". Lynch definitely shows his skills as a director. Due to its style, it has a limited appeal. Personally, I have never seen a film from the cinema of the absurd that I valued or wanted to see again.",Eraserhead
35,The-Sarkologist,An existentialist masterpiece,10,20 January 2012,"Eraserhead is David Lynch's first full length feature film, made over three years with only $10 000. This is quite a effort as this film is much cheaper than Clerks and in a way is far superior. This film also launched David Lynch's career and he went on to make The Elephant Man, Dune, and Twin Peaks.The movie is very bleak and the synopsis is very strange. Des Managan did not bother to describe it, while a cult movie book wrote only a single line talking about its bleakness. It is not that the movie is not worth talking about though, rather the incredible intricacies of this movie leave it to the viewer to make his or her own interpretation. Des Mangan speaks of pointy headed intellectuals who try to push across a view point and says that he chooses not to go into a deep analysis as everybody is to make of this movie what they can. I will give a brief description of what I got from the movie, though I will touch upon aspects of another interpretation. I have included a link to a more detailed interpretation. I will simply look at what I see as the various themes in the movie One of the major themes in this movie seems to deal with relationship. Relationships form a major foundation of a lot of movies, and existentialist movies, such as this, show how fragile, or even impossible, they are. The main character, Henry, is alone in the movie. The impression you get from the first scene where he enters his flat is that he has no friends, and no true relationship. He is forced into a relationship through a pregnancy but this marriage is cold and emotionless, quite quickly it collapses with the wife walking out. It is not the attitude of Henry that destroys the marriage, but rather the baby that was spawned from the pregnancy. The baby plays a very major part of the movie; in fact it is the object upon which the whole movie revolves.To me, the spawn that is the baby symbolises the lose morality that destroys relationships. Though Henry at first does not admit it, we assume that he had sex with Mary and it is from this that the baby came. This seems to be a reaction against the loose morals from the sixties. The baby is thus a result of the destruction of the sanctity marriage. It is a baby born out of wedlock and thus is a freak, as such people are considered – the term bastard comes to mind. The baby itself is not evil, but it does drive Mary and Henry apart. Mary cannot take any more of it so she leaves, thus thrusting the responsibility upon Henry.This is another reaction against what the lose morals has created. Unwanted pregnancies burden people with unwanted babies, but generally only one person lands up with the baby, and that is usually the woman. Here the woman walks out leaving Henry with the baby, a corruption of what this world brings. Henry is the passive partner here where as Mary is the active. The roles of men and women are changing bringing a shift in the social order, and this is another idea that comes through. In this movie, the shift is complete, whereas in the 70's, when the movie was made, the shift was only beginning.Time has no meaning within this movie. Linear time does not exist and all the important events, such as the marriage, are squeezed out. In this movie, marriage no longer has any meaning, as such the wedding is ignored. The vowels mean nothing because Mary easily breaks them. The movie itself is not linear as we travel to a point where the marriage collapses, but after the marriage is still together. Further into the movie, Henry dies, only later to be alive. As such, linear time is not an important point in the movie and we are not to see it as such, rather the movie flows along a line of events. The importance of each of the events are put in order and thus the collapse of the marriage takes an earlier important, where a scene that occurs within the marriage takes its importance later. Thus the movie is like a retrospect, Henry looks back over his life and pulls the events into this order.The movie is also about the balance, one that can easily be over turned. A simple act of sex destroys the life of Henry. While Henry removes the baby's bandages at the end to discover that he has destroyed the delicate balance that held the baby together. Inside the baby is a living chicken, the same chicken seen during the dinner party at Mary's house. There the chicken was touched and it began spewing endless streams of blood; a similar thing happens with the baby at the end.Thus the idea of deceptions, and things not being what they seem, appears. The chicken appears dead, but is alive. The girl singer appears to be a girl, but really is a hideous man. She sings of heaven, a place you go at death, being a fine place, but the tone is dry and bleak, as if she does not really believe what she sings. Death does not bring happiness to Henry, instead he becomes an eraser. The meaning of life is nothing, but at least he makes a good eraser.",Eraserhead

37,sol-,Fatherhood can be scary,7,4 October 2016,"Left alone to care for his deformed baby, a depressed factory worker questions his sanity in this nightmarish debut feature from David Lynch. While not a film for all tastes, the movie works surprisingly well both literally and metaphorically. If taken literally, one might view the baby as an animalistic creature that his wife's parents have used to con him into marriage. On a metaphorical level, one wonders whether the baby really looks so alien-like or whether Jack Nance's protagonist simply perceives him like that. Nance provides a very human performance, full of sympathetic looks of despair, and the film could be seen as his reaction to finding out that he is a father and being unable fathom that a little bit of himself is in the baby. Then there's the fact that the baby would have to be several months premature to actually be he is, so the film could represent his uncertainty about whether he really is the father (maybe his girlfriend slept around) with good reason therefore as to why he does not recognise this little stranger in his house. Whatever the case, the film is a triumph of atmosphere with Lynch creating unease purely through accentuating everyday noises at key points. At times it feels like Lynch is just doing weird things for the sake of it here - but to no greater degree than in any of Lynch's other works. You have to know what you're in for with this film, but when watched in the right mood, it is a blast.",Eraserhead
38,poe426,Surrealist sensibilities...,10,17 January 2002,"David Lynch, whose roundabout route to filmmaking had its origins in surrealist painting, here crafts a contemporary classic. As with his two earlier efforts, the shorts THE ALPHABET and THE GRANDMOTHER, Lynch brings his surrealist sensibilities to bear- this time, on the Freudian tale of an average Joe named Henry. The imagery is often overstated (like the point-of-view trip through the birth canal seen very early in the film, in which we find ourselves emerging, as it were, into Henry's nightmare world), but Lynch can be forgiven these excesses. His is the imagery of the subconscious, his approach abstract. There's very little in the way of traditional storytelling going on here, which is why most people walk away from midnight showings looking as if they've been beaned with a hammer.

Personally i can't and with a bad copy, it's more painful than any soviet movie shot before WWII! As i watch with Forward pushed, i notice sometimes some real inspiration to do something different, like a dream experiment but at the end, it's a really difficult movie...

I enjoy black and white comedy films such as 1974's Young Frankenstein, and/or the 2011 The Artist.

44,paul-allaer,"Reapprecation of ""Eraserhead"", now decades later",9,16 August 2020,"""Eraserhead"" (1077 release; 89 min.) brings the story of Henry Spencer. As the movie opens, Herny leads a bleak existence in an industrial wasteland. Henry is invited over for dinner by Mary, his girlfriend. Her parents are there to.. Mary's mother corners Henry, asking why he is having sexual relations with Mary, and that they now must marry and carry for the premature baby Mary bore. We shift to later, as Mary now lives with Henry, and they care for the premature baby... At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut feature length film of writer-producer-director David Lynch. It's obviously a labor of love, albeit a complicated one. Production took a good 5 years as financing was very difficult (basically the early 70s version of GoFundMe or Kickstarter). As to the film itself, it is so wild and off center, there are basically no words for it. It is an industrial sci-fi film? horror film? both? more? Frankly all of the above. Please pay close attention to the sound collage, carefully drafted by Lynch and others, and present in virtually every second of the movie. It's probably what inspired Trent Resnor and Atticus Ross to do what they do nowadays. I had seen this movie back in the day (late 70s), possibly even more than once. But I hadn't seen this in forever, literally decades. I had lost all recollection of what the story was about, the only thin I remembered what the view of Henry as it appears in the movie poster. I was floored when seeing this again recently how well this movie has aged. Basically it's a timeless movie that could've been made today but instead was made 45 years ago. It blows the mind. This of course launched David Lunch's brilliant movie-making career. What a debut film!""Eraserhead"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The theater adheres strictly to all COVID-19 requirements, including social distancing, mask wearing and taking one's temperature before entering the theater. Not that it mattered, as the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening: I literally was the only person in the theater.

45,Captain_Couth,The World of David Lynch: Eraserhead.,9,15 August 2005,"Eraserhead (1977) was David Lynch's first feature length film. It was a piecemeal project that took nearly five years to complete. After directing several shorts, Mister Lynch took on the task of creating a film. This surrealistic vision of a nightmarish future confused and shock many people (even to this day). Using black and white film stock and a jarring soundtrack, David Lynch has made a film that stands on it's own even to this day. Sadly, this movie is not widely released on D.V.D. and for a time it was only available through the director's own web site. It's very pricey but if you're a true fan of the movie the price isn't too bad.A strange young man finds himself in a loveless marriage to an even more eccentric woman. He meets her weird family and is surrounded by industrial complexes and strange noise that seem to come from everywhere. Everyday, the dude escapes from his dreary reality and finds solace in a little lady that lives in a radiator. But the day when the stork makes a visit and leaves a present for the couple is when everything sours to a point of no return. What happens next is impossible too describe and not worth spoiling. If you're a true fan of David Lynch then you'll want to watch this movie!!This has to be one of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen. A true piece of work that's bizarre and eye candy for those who appreciate open interpretation films. Too bad David Lynch never made another film like this one ever again. Maybe it was never meant to be.Highly recommended.",Eraserhead
46,strong-122-478885,Yep. Henry Spencer Is Having Himself A Very Bad Hair Day,3,12 May 2014,"Is Eraserhead weird? Yes, it is.Is Eraserhead ""out there""? Most Definitely.Does Eraserhead's story even come close to promoting sharp thinking or inspiring bright ideas? Nope, it does not. It numbs and paralyzes any clear, lucid thought like the dull thud of a sledgehammer-blow applied directly to the skull.If you're seriously looking for a movie that actually induces brain-freeze (without the aid of drugs), then look no further than Eraserhead.Here's a movie that probably contains more ""WTF?"" moments than any other mainstream film in existence. But, of course, when it comes to these particular moments, the major problem here is that they just stack up way too high, leaving the viewer quite frustrated, annoyed and often gasping for a breath of honest-to-goodness fresh air after being suffocated (literally) by a non-stop barrage of irritating and nonsensical situations.The way I look at it, if it's considered hip and cool to be one of the chosen elite who love to gush and heap praise upon Eraserhead, then I can't begin to tell you how much it pleases me to know that I am looked upon as being an outcast and certified square.Due to a truly terrible sense of storytelling (which starts from out of nowhere and ends in the very same spot), I view Eraserhead as being something of an idiot's jigsaw puzzle where none of the ill-fitting pieces were ever intended to fit together into a coherent and satisfyingly entertaining whole, at all.I personally place full blame for Eraserhead's countless flaws and irksome short-comings directly on the shoulders of writer/director David Lynch. On top of being a total wiener-head, I think that Lynch is a frickin' pseudo-intellectual snob of the highest order.To me, Eraserhead was a film that wasn't made by someone who wanted to share any special or meaningful insights with his audience, at all. No. This was a film made by someone who was clearly looking down his long nose at his audience and saying, loud & clear - ""Ponder this, you stupid, low-life peasants!"" As far as I'm concerned, the only appealing and noteworthy aspect about Eraserhead was its (sometimes) startling b&w camera-work. But, since this film's story (more often than not) nearly put me off to sleep, it only earns for itself a 3-star rating.",Eraserhead

He has a good point: mild-mannered Philadelphia artist David Lynch's dark but impressive debut feature isn't really a conventional movie experience; it's the worst nightmare you've ever had, with the same compelling (and often nauseating) fascination of a bad dream. There's a facsimile of an actual plot, but it unfolds obliquely, in grainy, dreamlike black and white imagery, presenting a long, hallucinatory, and sometimes oddly comic descent into the restless, unprobed corners of the human condition, where newlyweds Henry and Mary live with their bastard child: a repulsive, limbless creature of unnamed origin. It's easy to see why this certified cult classic is such a perennial favorite on the midnight film circuit, but there's more here than just the usual wallow in film school self-indulgence, recalling at times the morbid, tongue-in-cheek surrealism of early Buñuel.",Eraserhead
48,GiraffeDoor,It's another case of style over substance.,5,18 February 2019,"A part of me really wanted to like this movie. It really did.It is one of the more polarizing movies of all time but I think a lot of its success is a combination of relative originality and the fact that it sort of cornered the market on dark surrealist movies.The start is promising. The abstract opening sequence and the 15 minutes without dialogue is exactly what I hoped this movie would be and creates an intense feeling of growing dread and isolation.But when the script kicks in that's where it became apparent this will be one of these pictures much better directed than it is acted or written.I feel annoyed that so much of the movie is apparently dreams. It's such a cheat when movies do that. There is negligible narrative, instead it's a bunch of interchangeable episodes that shoot high on the weird scale but without a context they would have worked better as short films or music videos.I'm not saying I don't want the movie to be mysterious but you got to give me something to work with.It has its moments to be sure. I like the gopher woman's song and that scene with the erasers. But a movie is more than the sum of good moments.It's frustrating how a movie that dumps most of its weirdness in the dream world still have weirdness spilling into real life (the bleeding roast chicken, that infant)There is little dialogue thank goodness. The dialogue we do here is stiltedly written and excruciatingly acted. It just undoes any atmosphere that gets built up.It's just the kind of thing that cinema was missing. It just unfortunately didn't do it very well.",Eraserhead
49,kluseba,A cult movie of the surreal art of cinema,8,7 February 2011,"David Lynch's first full length movie is one of the rare movies that has been extremely weird, progressive and simply different that have reached a certain cult status and given the occasion to a brilliant genius and director to do a professional career. There are many reasons why this movie has been so popular and it certainly merits its status even if it's surprising that so many people like this disturbing, slow paced and anti-mainstream flick.The movie has been shot in black and white and works a lot with surreal images, absurd scenes and strange sounds. The first ten minutes are without any dialogues and even when some characters begin to talk, there conversations are reduced to a straight minimum. The story is slow paced but yet very difficult to explain. The story is set in a very dark, grey and desperate industrial region which creates a truly haunting atmosphere. A weirdo, brilliantly played by the amazing and very authentic Jack Nance, gets the message that his ex-girlfriend is pregnant and they get together again to live with the baby that nobody wanted to get born. The couple soon feels imprisoned by the presence of an ugly and totally weird baby and is longing for freedom and afraid of taking responsibilities. That's the part of the story that is easy to explain but concerning the ending and the whole meaning of the movie, everyone should make up his own mind just as I have developed my proper theory.The movie is highly experimental and a weird piece of avant-garde. It is difficult to approach because of the lack of dialogues and the very slow paced development. The movie is sometimes gore and disgusting, sometimes transcending and surreal and deals a lot with the topic of sex in a very artistic and mature way.Personally, I would suggest to anyone that likes original and experimental movies to have a look on this flick as it influenced many famous directors, actors and even musicians and shows us the roots of a brilliant director that later created masterpieces such as ""Twin Peaks"" or ""Lost highway"". This is one of those movies that this kind of people should have seen at least once in their lives. It will surely be a very special and unforgettable experience but you will adore or hate it for sure as there is not much left in between. I really adore it but I didn't give the highest ratings because David Lynch has even done better movies and because there is even stuff out there that is weirder than this one, but ""Eraserhead"" is surely a brilliant introduction to the surreal art of cinema.",Eraserhead
50,EVOL666,"The ""Feel-Good"" Film Of The Century...",7,24 March 2006,"Before David Lynch brought you such laugh-fests as BLUE VELVET, WILD AT HEART, LOST HIGHWAY, MULHOLLAND DRIVE, and the TWIN PEAKS series - came his first full-length feature, the comically riotous ERASERHEAD.Henry is an average ""Joe"" who lives in a pleasant little industrial neighborhood. He lives in a cheery apartment where a happy little woman lives in his radiator. Henry gets his girlfriend pregnant and the result is a cute little gauze-wrapped mutated bundle-of-joy that looks like a cross between a plucked chicken, and a baby dinosaur. Momma gets fed up with baby crying all night and decides to move back home with her parents. Baby gets sicky and Poppa Henry tries to play the good Daddy - that is until baby's crying cock-blocks Poppa's chances with the hottie across the hall. In a particularly heart-warming scene, Poppa cuts open the gauze bandages exposing baby's innards and stabs baby in the guts with a pair of scissors until some sort of custard/oatmeal concoction pours from baby's wounds - HOW SWEET!!! ERASERHEAD will definitely be of interest to those who love the equally uproarious WWII concentration camp footage or perhaps those who get the under-rated privilege of watching friends or loved-ones detox off of hard drugs.

53,fertilecelluloid,A troubling nightmare derived directly from one man's subconscious,8,1 December 2005,"Lynch's consistency of vision elevates his material. There are no cracks in the worlds he creates, unless he puts them there. He makes no concessions to genre conventions because he has created his own genre. ""Eraserhead"", which shares genes with Lynch shorts like ""The Grandmother"", was his impressive feature film debut.Many horror films have been described as being akin to nightmares. ""Eraserhead"" is more logical than some nightmares, but it is as deeply troubling as the worst nightmares. It derives directly from one man's subconscious fear of being a father and losing control. It gives us a literal representation of that fear in the form of a deformed baby (ghoulishly realized) and serves up increasingly outlandish imagery that grows as a reply to the protagonist Henry's (the late Jack Nance) dilemma.The sound design by Alan Splet and Lynch is extraordinary and makes a clear case that sound is responsible for 50% of a film's power. The aural landscapes possess an engaging, transporting quality that add a deep dimension of grave unease to the spectacular black and white photography by ""Blue Velvet"" DOP Frederick Elmes.The film is impossible to categorize and not possible to adequately decipher. It is an ambiguous, interpretative work that broadens cinema's potential to prick the cerebral cortex.",Eraserhead
54,aidanratesmovies,A Bizarre and Messy Vision,4,9 March 2021,"Although on some level I understand its cultural appeal inside the world of horror, Eraserhead seems to favor visuals and its creepy nature and absolutely nothing deeper. I have a great respect for director David Lynch, and I praise his artistic creativity and boldness while making this film. That being said, I feel Eraserhead is largely quite a mess. I enjoy the look of the film, the black and white cinematography feeling like a nice touch, but the film is simply too forcibly odd and surreal to be any true fun to watch. It feels like you are watching a fever dream unfold, and on some level I understand how that can be an interesting point of view, but I feel its largely too dull and too random to be any fun, and too forced to feel believable. The acting is fine, all the actors commit to their bizarrely written roles and strange dialogue/situations. The script is a mess, never deciding if it wants to be a metaphor for something, or simply a strange gag which I never really got. In the end, Eraserhead is by far one of the most bizarre films i've ever seen, and although I didn't enjoy it, and may not remember it, I admire its willingness to try something new- even though it doesn't succeed.

55,Jonny_Numb,watch this at 12:30am and just TRY to get to sleep afterward,7,7 June 2003,"(there might be some SPOILERS within this gibberish, but I'm not completely sure)That's what I did, and I can say I regret it, but I don't; I can say that it was a mistake, but it wasn't.  I was trying to clear my mind of the overwhelming hype surrounding the film, but some of it lingered as I watched the fair-quality VHS bootleg.  I was prepared to call the movie ""slow"" and ""pretentious"", but now the right word is DELIBERATE.  The events which conspire are are less ""confusing"" and more NIGHTMARISH.  As the integrity of film as an art form deteriorated and gave way to formula and committee ""thinking"", it's hard to find films that not only have certifiable integrity, but also prompt you to think.  ""Eraserhead"" is an ideal example (""Videodrome"" and ""Fight Club"" are others), a movie whose bleak exterior is nothing compared to the emotional and psychological reactions it brings. Like Cronenberg, Lynch is a perpetual trickster, a court jester with an ace up his sleeve, wrapping a narrative around the viewer's mind like a hit of Ecstasy, to the point where nothing you see or feel seems real for a long time afterward.  I wondered how much of Henry Spencer is inside me?  What began as a hideous, deformed, wormlike creature has given way to the creature that is now typing this.  Is there a difference?  An elevator that hesitates before closing, a mailbox with nothing in it, two halves of a ripped picture, a hideous mutant baby.  A lot of what I saw seemed to be making a point--or implying at least--self-conscious behavior in everyday life--the intimidation of cutting a miniature chicken whose thighs thrust and whose rectum oozes blood; the nervousness of a man being interrogated about SEXUAL INTERCOURSE; the baby that cries only when its father leaves, and its sudden outbreak in odd boils.  A brick wall outside a window.  A man pulling a lever, the sound of a train outside the window.  Comments on fidelity as Henry sleeps with the seductress across the hall, the production number by the 'lady in the radiator' with sagging, 'genital' cheeks as she squishes sperm with an unflinching grin, the wiping away of eraser-dust.  As with ""Blue Velvet"" (Roy Orbison's 'In Dreams') and ""Mulholland Drive"" (Club Silencio), ""Eraserhead"" possesses a similarly simple musical number (a song about heaven) that seems to symbolize the characters and events--SUMMARIZE, I mean, but the connections remain vague unless you devote time to studying it closely.  I regret now calling Lynch's mindbending films ""pretentious"" (although honestly a few ARE)--""Eraserhead"" and the more recent ""Mulholland Drive"" symbolize a dying breed of cinematic artist, who assembles half of a jigsaw and allows the viewer to exercise the power of reason to figure the other half, but playing fair and keeping the challenge equal.  Even after watching ""Videodrome"" recently, I wasn't met with the same awake-with-nervous-jitters feeling that ""Eraserhead"" has given me--it's a distorted, perverse view of our own reality (even though it looks anything but) and reveals how self-consciously bizarre bland, everyday routines, sex, sharing a bed with a member of the opposite sex, and childbirth really are. As the clock approaches 4, ""Eraserhead"" has branded me with a red-hot cattle prod, a mosaic of images that endure and are complicated in the mind after the actual film ends.7/10",Eraserhead
56,truemythmedia,The Best Lynch,10,27 June 2019,"""Eraserhead,"" is easily my favorite of Lynch's works. I love the unique viewpoint he has, and the strange sense of peace, joy, chaos, and evil it employs. My problem with his other works is that he is restrained. He punctuates his stories with the inclusion of some indosyncracy which gets barely explained if at all, but then it flows back into pretty typical narrative and mystery.That is why ""Eraserhead"" is my favorite. In ""Eraserhead"" he doesn't shy back from the things that make his voice truly unique. Maybe, along the course of his career, he has worked with producers who have noted him into adding more accessible themes and story points, but this film is before any of that.Many times, young film makers need the input of more experienced producers or studios to help them find their voice but Lynch was already at a full throated shout in his first feature, so all there was for producers to do is ask him to keep it down a bit. Usually, this would have been a good thing but here, I feel it may have robbed us of more works like ""Eraserhead.""",Eraserhead
57,a_chinn,David Lynch's surreal masterpiece will likely both delight and annoy audiences,9,24 November 2019,"David Lynch's surreal masterpiece is brilliant and fascinating, yet it's also a purposeful endurance test for audiences, which does detract from the overall film experience. Watching the HD restored Criterion Collection print, the film is a gorgeous visual feast. Lynch fills the screen with delightfully surreal and disturbing images in a vivid black & white industrial nightmare world. Although off-putting and unpleasant, it's visually arresting throughout and never boring to look at. As for the story, Lynch presents a mostly wordless tale focused on the horrors of parenting. The story follows a hapless Henry Spencer, a laconic Jack Nance, who gets his girlfriend pregnant and finds himself parenting a mutant child who unendingly screams for what seems the duration of the film. Did I also mention there is a lady who lives in the radiator and sings to Henry? Thematically, you'd think the film is about dreams, reality, and fantasy from the surface level surreality of the picture, but at it's core, the film is about the stresses of parenting; dealing with endless crying? Worrying when they're sick? What to do when your partner is frustrated? What to do when your marriage is stressed? Parenting is tough for sure, though I would say it's nowhere as bleak as Lynch's vision here. What must his daughter, director Jennifer Lynch, think going through life knowing this is how her father viewed her as a baby? A mutant who brings no joy and drives a parent to consider filicide. I suppose this is the temperament of an artist to put those things out into the world, sharing these ugly truths, even if they are presented in a hyperbolic extreme. Overall, ""Eraserhead"" is not a film intended to be watched for entertainment value (except as a cult midnight movie level of high weirdness), but viewers wanting a challenging and disturbing piece of art to dissect, this is a fascinating and still to this day unique film experience. FUN FACT! George Lucas asked Lynch to direct ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" but Lynch turned it down. How fun would it have been to see Lynch's version of Ewoks!",Eraserhead
58,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Arthouse Film with a Deeper Message?,8,2 December 2019,"Now the first time I saw this film, I wasn't entirely sure what I saw. This was actually my first foray into seeing anything from David Lynch and I really got to know how weird his films are. I was definitely intrigued by what I saw and I did get to see this film at the theater, hoping to understand a bit more now that I've heard some podcasters talking about it and being an older film watcher now. The synopsis is Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) tries to survive his industrial environment, his angry girlfriend and the unbearable screams of his newly born mutant child.If you know anything about this movie, it is definitely odd. We start off seeing The Man in the Planet (Jack Fisk). He is looking out of his window and we see what appears to be space outside of it. He is also working levers. During this we see Henry's head appear translucent and he opens his mouth, which a spermatozoon creature emerges and flies away.We then see Henry walking through an industrial area. He steps into a puddle and goes into his apartment building. He goes up to his place when The Beautiful Girl Across the Hall (Judith Anna Roberts) comes out to tell him that his girlfriend called. She wants him to come to dinner with her family. He goes inside and we get a glimpse of his barren apartment. He takes off a wet sock and puts it on his radiator. We also see a tree growing from a pile of dirt on his nightstand.He goes to his girlfriend's house, Mary X (Charlotte Stewart). She scolds him, but finally lets him inside, stating that dinner is almost ready. He meets her mother Mrs. X (Jeanne Bates) and father Mr. X (Allen Joseph). We see a nightmarish scene as Henry goes to cut the small man-made chicken that Mr. X prepared, but it starts to wraith on the plate and bleed. Mrs. X has a fit before taking Henry aside to interrogate him about if he had sexual intercourse with her daughter. She tries to kiss him before being interrupted by Mary. It appears she had a baby that is Henry's, but she isn't sure if it is a baby. Mrs. X informs them they have to get married.Henry's life spirals out of control as their mutant child won't stop crying. It drives Mrs. X into hysterics and Henry is in over his head. He is visited by the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near) who sings songs for him and the Beautiful Woman Girl Across the Hall. What does the Man in the Planet have to do with all of this and can Henry get control before it is too late?I should lead this review off stating that this is definitely an arthouse film. If you don't like movies like that, avoid this one. The first time I saw this, I had no idea what I had seen and I came in this time around with what others thought this was trying to say to see if I could agree there. The major one I really can get behind is that this could be about fatherhood and how your life changes with it. This is coming from someone who doesn't have children though.The first thing that we get is Mary leaving Henry. I've heard of a new expecting mother leaving the guy who was with for a stretch out of fear with what to do. Her parents pressure the two of them to get married and they're forced to live together. They're in over their heads and can't take care of the needs of the child, which in this case is a mutant that nothing they do will get the child to stop crying. Mary can't handle it and she flees to her parents where we then see Henry lose control as the child becomes sick and is just kind of lost. His life completely changes extremely fast and there's nothing he can do to stop it.Going from this, we have an extremely bleak look at life. The world they're in is desolate and that is added by the apartment that Henry lives in. The baby that he and Mary has is also a mutant, which makes me wonder if this world being an industrialized as it is has poisoned her to create this. Compound the fact on to this of the tiny birds that Mr. X is trying to feed them. The Lady in the Radiator also is deformed and I'm not entirely sure she is real. I believe this is Henry's imagination to cope with his world falling down around him. The Man in the Planet I also can see as his inner conscious controlling him and failing later in this.Now I could be completely wrong about all of this, but just what I felt we were seeing along with what other people have tossed out there. This is also paced very weird and I know that is intentional. We get scenes that go on too long and have a lot of silence in them. This gives it a very awkward feeling that all of the actors definitely contribute to. I would even go as far to say that this is isn't necessarily horror, but we get images that are and bleak feel of the film really make me consider it that way, as well as to write this. The tension is built through these aspects, but not really in the traditional sense. I can't really say I like the ending, because it kind of just ends. The only thing that I will say is that Henry does seem to find some solace finally and I'm good with that, even though it isn't necessarily happy.I'll shift to the acting of the film, which I will say is amateur, but I dig it. Nance does fit the role of someone who is kind of being pulled in multiple directions and loses control of his life. I like it though, as I feel like it is kind of like how I feel at times when I'm not assertive. I can definitely commiserate when his life is falling apart as well. Stewart is fine in her role and what she does to contribute to Henry's downfall and the same can be said for Roberts, Joseph and Bates. Near does give him something to look forward to and I kind of dug her singing in a weird way. I would say the other actors we see here do round out for what was needed.The effects of the movie are actually really good for the budget here. The baby is extremely creepy and the things they do with it made me feel uneasy as it goes on. I have to give props there. They also do some classic things with it, like using two reels together to make one of them look translucent which I thought worked. This is filmed in black and white, so that definitely can mask things and gives this a vintage feel as well. David Lynch was the writer/director among other things, which he definitely shot this amazing. You can see the talent he would have as he goes on.Last thing to cover would the soundtrack, which is used masterfully here. It definitely made me feel uneasy quite a few times, which really helps make this feel like horror. The baby crying is annoying and really shows how Mary is driven crazy like she is. The songs that the Lady in the Radiator sings I kind of dug in a weird way. This is one of the strongest parts of the film if I'm completely honest.Now with that said, I've already laid out to who I would recommend this film for. I really dig arthouse and films that make me think. I would actually like to know what Lynch was thinking, but he really doesn't care to answer that or what he was intending. I do think there's some good social commentary here about being young parents and living in a bleak world, which can be fitting for how some people want to treat the environment. This doesn't do a lot of things in the traditional sense, like the pacing or the editing, but I can get behind that. The acting is good and I think the effects, even though some are dated actually really work here. I think the soundtrack is amazing though and really helps with the nightmare feel of this film. Overall I found this to be a good movie and would recommend it if you like Lynch or are into these type of arthouse films that aren't necessarily coherent.",Eraserhead
59,davidmvining,Sickness,10,10 May 2021,"This represents some of the absolute highs and absolute lows of independent production. Judging it purely by the end result, David Lynch's first film is a searing, personal portrait of a specific idea, completely unencumbered by committee decisions driven by nervous studio executives, worried about the film's salability. On the other hand, it took Lynch five years to complete the film because he couldn't find steady financing, delivering papers throughout the extended shoot in order to simply survive. The effort really did pay off, though, with a surrealist abstract film about the fears of early fatherhood and responsibility.Henry Spencer is a Chaplinesque loner in the hellish post-industrial landscape in which he lives. His apartment is tiny, sparsely decorated, and crummy. Across the way lives an attractive woman who tells him that a girl named Mary called, inviting him to dinner at her parents' house. The dinner is a strange affair (like most of the movie) with man-made chickens that move when cut and a pair of parents who are completely dominated by strange personality tics. There, Henry learns that Mary has given birth to a child (even though Mary insists no one is sure it's actually a child), and it must be Henry's. He must marry Mary and take his responsibility as a father.The rest of the movie is built off this idea that Henry has been forced into a situation that he doesn't want and may not even be responsible for. He never answers Mary's mother when she demands to know if Henry has had sex with Mary. Did they? Maybe.The baby is the visual standout of the picture. Not an actual human child, possibly made from a rabbit carcass or maybe a baby cow, it's a slimy alien-like head attacked to a tightly swaddled body by a thin, rubbery neck. It remains in one place, eating from a spoon when fed but mostly crying. I first saw this movie long before I had children. Now that I'm finally revisiting it after having a couple of kids, this makes more sense to me, in particular the screaming child through the night. Mary simply cannot take the constant wailing from the weird creature on the other side of the room, and she runs back to her parents' house, leaving Henry alone with the child that, honestly, may not even be his.Alone, Henry's perception of reality begins to fracture and the surrealist images of Lynch's imagination begin to take over. He makes love to the attractive woman across the hall in his bed that has developed a large, liquid filled hole at its center that swallows both of them up. He sees a lady in his radiator with bulging cheeks that dances back and forth singing ""In Heaven"" while stomping on sperm-like creatures that fall from the ceiling. His head falls off, falls to the ground, and gets taken by a small boy into a pencil factory where his brain gets used for erasers.All of this can end up feeling like random images untied to anything if you're not paying attention, but what Lynch is doing is keeping the story and focus grounded in human experience and emotion while expressing the ideas and emotions in strange, dreamlike ways. The movie is filled with images of sickness both industrial and biological (the baby suddenly developing sores, for instance) mixed with sexual images all pointing towards Henry's very real and obvious concerns about fatherhood. You don't need to read about Lynch's scary life with his wife and daughter (who was born with clubbed feet) to connect the dots here. Lynch has a negative opinion of industrialization as it effects the individual, and as a young man surrounded by the sickness of pollution, he wonders at the wisdom of bringing a new living person into the world. This is abject fear of subjecting another person to a world he sees as in ill health with no way out.The path that Henry takes ends in a sickening place. Perhaps out of curiosity or malevolence when it laughs at his sexual inadequacy with the woman across the hall, he cuts at the swaddling of the baby to reveal that the swaddling was effectively the baby's skin, exposing its innards before its head expands to gigantic size, consuming the free space in his room. The final twenty minutes of the film are essentially an extended nightmare sequence, and because it's so tied to Henry's fracturing emotional state it remains relevant to the overall story. It's not just a random series of images, but an extension of the small character driven story at hand.Jack Nance is kind of wonderful as the befuddled and chronically passive Henry. Having a passive main character is always a risk, but when that passivity becomes the point, all you really need is to keep the performance interesting, and Nance brings that. He does so much with his eyebrows, tongue, and voice when both speaking and silent, conveying incredible and comical frustration that helps balance out the more severe ideas and surrealist elements. The rest of the cast never really acts realistically, perhaps the most so would be the woman across the hall, but she's hardly a character. The most fully realized characters are Mary and her parents, and they are extreme examples of caricature in motion. The perpetual and odd smile on her father, the weird overbearing nature of her mother, and Mary's nearly constant fragility to the point of breaking help isolate Henry even further. The discomfort is the point, and the unnatural performances of those around Henry help that.This is an incredibly clear-eyed vision, free from commercial concerns and allowed to gestate for years during its troubled production, coming out as a complete whole with incredibly strange sights and sounds that never feel disconnected from the core story. Abstractions and surrealism aren't everyone's cup of tea, and they're really hard to pull off while keeping the narrative relatable, but David Lynch managed it with aplomb in his first feature.",Eraserhead
60,Amyth47,Another weirdo vision from Lynch.,8,17 December 2018,"My Rating : 8/10This belongs in the 'Director's Personal Film' genre - there should be a name for these types of films which come from the director's personal viewpoint of life experiences or a passion project.For example - 'Mirror', 'The Conversation', 'Enter the Void', 'Lord of the Rings', the recent 'Roma' and pretty much every Tarantino film. These movies are purely the director's dream come true (or nightmare in this case) captured in a film.Watch it if you're into surrealism.",Eraserhead

Hard to believe Lynch ever got money together to film another movie. i assume his financial backers hadn't actually seen Eraserhead. Since I was just a kid when this was released I assume this movie was shown in Times Square next to the pr0n theatres b/c it sure as heck wasn't shown at Paramount or Rialto or any other cinemas where normal people went to see movies. If I ever meet anyone in real life who tries to convince me this movie is great I am going to punch that person in the face.",Eraserhead
62,p-stepien,Erased it,2,2 November 2010,"The plot... well, yes... the plot. A rag-tag geek working at a printing house gets his girl pregnant. With a mutant dinobaby. Pressured by her parents (who like eating miniature dancing cooked chickens from Peter Gabriel's ""Sledgehammer"" for dinner) the two marry. However the freakoid baby is too much for her, hence she jumps ship, and lets our hero take care of the munchkin (yeah... like that's a likely scenario). Soon after he goes crazy and turns into an eraser, cuz being a father does that to you. Plus his kid turns out to be full of porridge. And their a lady living in the heater.The film is wacky. Some would call it surreal and is mostly reminiscent of Luis Bunuel's (and Salvador Dali's) infamous ""Un chien andalou"" (surprisingly at the same time it also has the feel of the classical Ozu movies). It's closest living relative would have to be the music videos of Tool. But is being wacky, out-there, surreal enough to make this a masterpiece? In my humble opinion no. I do admire some of the sequences and visionary filmmaking, which to an extent was revolutionary and it has unnoticingly changed a lot as far as the art of film is concerned. It's influence on music videos is not to be understated, as the movie offered such detachment from logic, but at the same time supplied captivating visuals and atmospherics. And that was exactly what music videos required - minimum to no logical script, but maximum visual gratification.Admitedly not a great David Lynch fan, but I do admire the fact, that no-one has ever come as close to filming dreams as he has been. Surrealism probably does best designate his movies and ""The Lost Highway"" or ""Twin Peaks"" will remain great cinematographic experiences. Nonetheless even though ""Eraserhead"" has all the trademarks of a Lynch movie it overdoes the absurd, pointless and illogical. There is no semblance of reason and although the outworldiness of the script does necessitate sense and logic I found at times that even in the minimalistic surreal script plot holes were abundant (a father not knowing anything about his son's medical condition?).Additionally I find it extremely hard to grasp, why so many people call this movie disturbing, horrific or ghastly. It was way to rubbery and the effects too comedic to really warrant such phrases. None of the images served in this movie troubled me, which surprised me given the notoriety of this film. Or maybe I've just become too desensitised after watching too many Japanese gore/artsy productions? Definitely a movie that will put off many from so-called auteur or art-house flicks and definitely not recommended as a movie to start off a Lynch fan-club. In the end too self-indulgent, absurd and pointless to really deserve anything more than a 2/10.",Eraserhead
63,Sandcooler,So you've decided to be a grad student,9,11 August 2008,"What message David Lynch was bringing with this, we'll never know, if there even was one. His work just always seems complicated for the sake of being complicated, I mean what the hell was the second season of ""Twin Peaks"" about? Luckily there are still plenty of people with plenty of time left from harassing people at the video store for renting recent non-foreign stuff that give this stuff a healthy over-analysis. Crazy theories have been circling, a long time ago I've decided not to care. I don't know why all of this happens, and I don't know why nothing happens, but I'll accept it anyhow. People always need to understand things or they get frustrated, perhaps I'm just that passive, I'll deal with it, later. I couldn't follow the story because there was none, I couldn't understand the characters because they were not human, but if the goal was to freak people out, and it probably was, the mission has been accomplished as far as I'm concerned. Some of the most bearable (pre)Lynch material, quite a lot of genius in it.",Eraserhead
64,Matt_Layden,Erase It From My Memory.,5,24 February 2009,"This is why I am doing this whole thing. To watch a film like this. I have only seen three other Lynch films in their entirety (I'm still having trouble watching all of Inland Empire). I have no idea if people on this board like this film, but I do know that many here like Lynch and his unusual style. Saying unusual is an understatement too.The sound design in this film is phenomenal, if not bizarre and is the film's key ingredient. If this sound design did not work then I do not think the film would have such a cult following. Everything is heightened to an extreme and surreal beyond what one can imagine. Thew squeaking of the puppies, the disturbance of the radiator, so on and so on.If I were to actually try and figure out what the film was about, my head would explode ala Scanners. I get some themes and meanings, but was lost in the so called narrative, if you can call it that. Lynch has always been one for the abnormal things and this is no different. I can say that this is one of his weirder ones and that is saying a lot.The dream sequence ties into the title and seem to have nothing to do with the film, upon first look that is. Eraserhead is definitely a 'watch more then once' experience. You can debate with everyone about what the film was trying to say or what the hell is was even about, but no one can be certain. I don't even think Lynch knows.Now whenever you watch a film that is experimental, you try to find some value and meaning within it. You want it to be more than just another weird film for the sake of being weird. Lynch has been accused of this many times, but I think he is better than that. His films do have substance, you can tell in how he tells the story and how things seem to re-appear. Unlike other films where they pop up and are never seen again. Even though there are numerous scenes that just simply don't make sense to me, like when the daughter is sitting on the couch and doing something weird, then the mother brushes her hair. Even worse is when the chicken starts bleeding and the mother reacts to it in a bizarre manner.This is my least favourite of Lynch's films, for the simple fact that I never was interested in what little story there was. It didn't seem to go anywhere and for me to be invested in a film it has to be telling a story, one that I can understand, comprehend, or at the very least, try to look more into. Eraserhead did none of this for me. After watching it, I do not really care to watch it again to find any hidden meanings or to try and understand whatever it is that I missed from the first viewing. I can go on in life saying that Eraserhead did nothing for me and of course be hated for it, but whatever.But never say never right? Who knows, maybe one day down the road I'll get a chance to watch this so called 'masterpiece' again, and think it's brilliant. Until then, I'll say not.",Eraserhead
65,frankde-jong,Not every cult movie is a good movie,5,10 June 2019,"During the making of his debut-film ""Eraserhead"" Lynch was confronted with huge problems with respect to production and raising finance. At one time he lived on the set to save money. One has to admire his perseverance. Mavbe because of this perseverance ""Erasherhead"" has acquired cult status. In my opinion this status can not be atributed to its quality because I do not find it a great film.One can divide the oevre of Lynch in films that are understandable (such as ""The elephant man"" (1980) and ""The Straight story"" (1999)) and films that are not understandable (such as ""Lost highway"" (1997) and ""Mulholland drive"" (2001)).
""Eraserhead"" belongs firmly to the last category.Probably due to his inexperience it is however not the most successful film in this category. In other inapprehensible films of Lynch he succeeds in suggesting that there is a logical explanation. Not that you as a viewer can grasp this explanation, but you are convinced that it must be there. In ""Eraserhead"" Lynch thus not succeed for a second in creating this impression.Despite the fact that it is in my opinion not a great movie, ""Eraserhead"" contains (disturbing) images that will later reappear in other movies. Below some examples.The worm shaped child does look very much like ET from the eponymous film by Steven Spielberg (1982)
The sad eyed Mary reminds us of Kati Outinen, the muse of Aki Kaurismaki.
The neighbor of number 27 makes us think of ""the female"" from ""Under the skin"" (2013, Jonathan Glazer), in particular because of the black puddle that arises in the love making scene.
Last but not least, one of the strongest points of ""Eraserhead"" is the way the industrial soundtrack and the desolate scenery fit together.",Eraserhead

67,Pumpkin_Man,A Crazy Weird Strange Descent Into Madness!!!,10,17 June 2019,"It's 2:30 in the morning, and I just finished watching this movie for the first time. I decided to watch it in the dark because it's a black and white film. I was always curious about it and wanted to give it a try. This is quite literally one of (if not) the strangest movie I've ever seen in my entire life! I was laughing, and confused and shocked and threw my hand into the air thinking ""Why?"" It was awkward and silly and artsy and creepy and atmospheric. I literally need a therapist now because this movie flat-out broke my brain. It's so hard to describe, but I'll try.Our 'hero' is a 'guy' named Henry Spencer, who lives in a small crummy apartment. One night, he's told by his beautiful next door neighbor that his girlfriend, Mary X has invited him to dinner with her family. The dinner scene is weird, quirky and awkward that you have to see to believe. During dinner, Mary's mom asks Henry if he's had intercourse with Mary yet, because she's pregnant with a strange inhuman, snakelike creature baby. During one night, they try to care for the baby, only to have Mary leave and make Henry tend to the 'baby' There are random strange scenes that might be dream sequences, or visions inside Henry's mind because he starts seeing a woman inside the radiator. She's a creepy ballerina-like girl who sings and steps on worm-like creatures.The cinematography and sets and the effects are beautiful. Again, I can't stress enough how incredibly weird and strange this movie is. Overall, I think I liked it.

70,Beta_Gallinger,"There was a good chance I would find this bizarre film very underwhelming, but I didn't!",8,18 May 2011,"After making several short films, filmmaker David Lynch made his feature-length debut with ""Eraserhead"", this very trippy movie which I guess you would call horror! I was not around when this film came out, and I never even heard of it until sometime within the past few weeks when I saw a clip from it, the part showing the character known as the Lady in the Radiator singing the haunting and repetitive song, ""In Heaven""! This made me curious enough to watch the movie, and it didn't take long at all before I did just that. I got plenty of warning about how incredibly weird and sometimes gruesome it was before watching it, and as popular as I knew it was, it wouldn't have been surprising if I got basically nothing out of it, but that's not what happened.In a decaying, post-apocalyptic society, Henry Spencer is a printer who lives in an industrial town full of noisy machines, and is currently ""on vacation."" His estranged girlfriend, Mary X, invites him over to her family's house for dinner one night, so he comes over. After a very strange session at the dinner table, Mary's mother takes Henry into another room and informs him that Mary has just given birth to a baby very prematurely, and he happens to be this baby's father! Because of this, he is now obliged to marry his estranged girlfriend, so Mary and the baby, a severely mutated child, move into Henry's apartment with him. When the couple attempt to sleep, the mutant baby just won't keep quiet, so Mary decides that she can't take it anymore and temporarily moves back in with her family, leaving the disfigured child with Henry, who is now headed for one bizarre and frightening mixture of instances!As I watched the beginning here, I could already tell that it certainly wasn't going to be one of the most understandable films I've ever seen, showing bizarre scenes in a slow-paced manner. It looked like I was going to find most of ""Eraserhead"" boring at first, and I wasn't finding the acting in the sporadic moments of dialogue to be all that impressive, but I wasn't going to give up yet. I kept watching to see what would happen, and I think I started finding the film more intriguing when Henry comes over to the X family's home, though I didn't find absolutely everything before that to be boring. From this point on, I found lots of tension in this very weird story which is a lot like a crazy dream with its incoherence, but that's not necessarily a bad thing! Some parts didn't grab me as much as others did, but the all the insanity was definitely enough to hold my attention basically all the way up until the very sudden ending! I think the gloomy atmosphere and constant sounds of machinery and howling wind really helped.Many consider this 1977 feature-length debut from David Lynch to be a masterpiece, while there are also lots of people who have been absolutely disgusted by it, and I can understand that perfectly. It's truly a mind-boggling motion picture, and it sure can get disturbing, especially during the scenes with the mutant baby! Also, what exactly the movie is about is probably largely up to the viewer to decide. You can be VERY sure that ""Eraserhead"" is not for kids, and many adults wouldn't be able sit through it, either, which I certainly can't fault them for. If you're used to mainstream cinema, you'd better prepare yourself for something very different if you're going to watch this polarizing cult film, and also be ready for the constant weirdness and unusual gruesomeness that you're bound to see. You've been warned! It's definitely not a film I would want to watch multiple times, but you just might find that you don't even want to watch it once, or maybe you'll be even more impressed than I was!",Eraserhead
71,tim-764-291856,The Art of Noise,5,11 April 2012,"Unlike most directors, who want to eliminate background noise, David Lynch racks it up here to make it a key character. It's also the driving essence of the film - from the mechanical thrumm of the industry nearby, to the singing radiator and to the ""baby"" crying continuously.Against this aural assault, in the grimy black and white of Lynch's darkest psyche, lie layer upon layer of absurdities and creepy oddities. Setting the scene is the tiny, claustrophobic room that the weirdly- haircutted Henry Spence (Jack Nance) inhabits, along with all its creepy idiosyncrasies, like the radiator that sings to him.Henry's girlfriend, Mary X lives with him and Henry gives her a child. This ""creature"", partly the alien coming out of John Hurt's stomach in 'Alien' and half 'Little Otik', the tree-based part baby, part log from the Czech semi-animated film of the same name, could compete as the ugliest single thing you've ever seen. And win, no question.It demands constant attention but Mary X is too emotionally drained to look after it and so leaves Henry with the little, VERY ugly mite. Then it gets some sort of disease which made it look ten times uglier and horrific. From then on, it just seemed to get more and more weird, with more and more disturbing images.From about a third way in, I was questioning not just whether I actually wanted to watch this film now, but at all. From two thirds on, one atrocious bit turned into another and like having an injection at the dentist, all I could do was to just hang on until it stopped. I certainly don't consider myself a wuss, or a prude and can watch almost anything but this endurance test was just a bit too much.I give three stars as it certainly is ground-breaking, very different and daring. And for a debut piece that had huge problems getting funding ($20,000 for only a 20 page script - that actually grossed $7,000,000 - not a bad return!) it has to be admired. I then deleted it from my TV service provider's box that I had recorded it from The Horror channel - as I never want to see it ever again!",Eraserhead
72,jluis1984,A wildly creative and original debut,9,3 July 2007,"Considered as one of the most creative filmmakers of the modern era, American director David Lynch has developed a very peculiar and highly recognizable style through most of his work. A style where surreal images are overtly present, and linear plot lines are thrown away in order to focus mostly on the emotions created. This style has its roots in the fact that Lynch started his career as a painter, making his films an extension of that previous work, and very different to what is the classic definition of cinema. This background is probably the reason why he tends to move away from ""normal"" films (although movies like ""The Elephant Man"" and ""The Straight Story"" prove that he can make that kind of films too), and prefers to let his imagination run wild when making a movie. His first movie, ""Eraserhead"", is also probably the best example of Lynch's style of film-making.""Eraserhead"" is the story of Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a timid factory worker in a nightmarish industrial work that one night, during an uncomfortable dinner with the family of his girlfriend Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), receives the news that Mary had his baby. Henry agrees to marry Mary, as he truly feels that he loves her, but when Henry discovers that the baby is a mutant that cries all the time, life doesn't seem that easy anymore. Mary can not stand the screams of the child, so decides to leave Henry and return to her parent's home. Alone in his decayed apartment, Henry will have to live with the constant screaming of the deformed baby, facing his nightmares and fears about parenthood, as well as the temptations that live outside his room. And the only thing that can help him to survive is the idea that probably, in heaven everything is fine.Written by David Lynch, ""Eraserhead"" is a movie built with the logic of a dream, that is, without a linear plot and moving between a series of hallucinations and dream sequences that while apparently random, allow us to enter the twisted mind of its solitary main character. While ambiguous and cryptic, ""Eraserhead"" is an incredibly original character study about a man's fears about concepts such as fatherhood, compromise and responsibility. As written above, it follows the logic of a dream, but given it's dark nature, it would be more appropriate to say it is the vivid representation of a nightmare. Despite the apparent lack of narrative (or maybe because of it), we follow Henry closely, almost intimately, through his twisted, yet oddly very human, descent into madness as he is tormented by his demons embodied in the shape of the screaming mutant baby.In ""Eraserhead"", David Lynch brings his nightmare come to life in a wonderfully horrific fashion thanks to his great imagination and his noticeable care for details. With an outstanding use of sound and the cinematography by Herbert Cardwell and Frederick Elmes, director David Lynch creates the perfectly haunting atmosphere of dread and decay that impregnates Henry's depressive industrial world, definitely symbolizing his bleak view of life. Many have said that ""Eraserhead"" is more a visual experience than a narrative, and I for once agree with that statement, as it is visually where we get the most clues about the film's obscure meanings, as Henry's vivid dreams and terrible hallucinations are opened windows to his troubled psyche. The pace is certainly slow, but it flows smoothly, allowing the film to express itself via the emotions of its images, like a beautiful yet frightening moving canvas.As the disturbed Henry Spencer, Jack Nance is simply amazing, as if he had been born with the sole purpose of playing this role. What I mean is not that Nance is an extremely talent performer (honestly, that is not the case), but that he managed to convey exactly what Lynch wanted to do with his character in the most natural and believable way possible, effectively making Henry Spencer a honest portrayal of a man facing his most terrible fear: becoming a parent. The rest of the cast ranges from average to very good, with Charlotte Stewart being one of the latter, delivering a subtle performance as Mary X, Henry's girlfriend. In supporting roles, Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates are good, but nothing spectacular, and the same could be said about Judith Anna Roberts, who plays the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall. Finally Laurel Near is great in the now iconic role of the Lady in the radiator.While a powerful and wild exercise of imagination, ""Eraserhead"" is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, as due to the atypical way its constructed and the dark nature of its themes, it probably won't be easily accepted by those expecting a more linear, classic narrative style. However, a way to face ""Eraserhead""'s cryptic plot is to let the images do the talking and simply experience the emotions Lynch's film attempts to convey. As written above, Lynch was a painter and performance artist before becoming a filmmaker, and ""Eraserhead"" carries a lot of this background in its conception; so the watching of the movie as a visceral experience, instead of intellectual, may be helpful in its enjoyment. A very personal movie for Lynch (a lot of the film's darkness comes from his own experiences in the different stages of his life), ""Eraserhead"" is like the pure expression of the director's troubles and fears on film.Due to a constant lack of money, it took David Lynch 5 years to finish ""Eraserhead"", but one can truly say that the wait was worthy. Thanks to ""Eraserhead"", David Lynch would be noticed by Mel Brooks, who would help him to establish his name with ""The Elephant Man"". But even if Lynch's career had remained in the underground, ""Eraserhead"" is without a doubt, one of the most interesting and thought provoking films ever made. 9/10",Eraserhead
73,The_Movie_Cat,"Cinematic genius, but definitely NOT a date movie.",9,30 January 2000,"I can think of very few films that have sound as their most commendable feature. The Exorcist is one, a film that, aside from infrequent strains of `Tubular Bells', adopts minimal incidental music. This is laudable in a horror genre where shocks are clearly signposted  and predicted  by overgenerous musical stings. The Exorcist may be flawed, but its avoidance of this field cliché is worthy of praise.Eraserhead is the other film that excels in sound. A frankly disturbing concoction of industrial score and white noise with undercurrents of musical hall and sonorous church organ, it is almost an extra character in the film, and easily it's most prominent factor. Yet Eraserhead is to be recommended for more than its incidentals. An impenetrable and gloomy work, what is it actually about? Who is the credited `man in the planet' who pulls levers that control giant spermatozoa? Many questions like this permeate a film which perhaps has to be seen several times to get over the initial shock of it's avant gardism. Lynch extracts the everyday and supplants it with the exceptionally bizarre. The experience of meeting a girlfriend's parents for the first time is never worse than here, where the parents in question gyrate spasmodically to the animated legs of a blood-spitting chicken. It's these scenes  along with the deformed mutant baby  that could lend the film the air of an abortion debate. Birth and repressed sexuality thrive throughout the film, from suckling puppies to the seductive appeal of the `beautiful girl across the hall' and a mother-in-law that gets too close for comfort. I guess the entire film could be a man's mental breakdown when faced with the premature responsibilities of marriage and fatherhood. Though to be honest I couldn't even begin to imagine what it's really all about.Encroaching blackness fills every scene, where lights are intermittent at best, and at worse fail completely. Often sets  particularly the bedroom when `Mary X' is feeding the child  are like prison cells. Two of the most eerie segments involve a title-explaining dream (?) where Henry's (Nance's) head is carved into pencil rubbers and an unsettling musical number from the `lady in the radiator'. This is the same lady with two candyfloss-like lumps on her cheeks that alternates her stage appearances between stamping on giant sperm to singing with religious convictions.Direction and cinematography are brilliant throughout, though the climax is the ultimate extension of a film that borders on darker, extremely unpleasant aspects of reality. I took a girl to see this film once, where the conclusion formed the final straw in what could be seen as a cycle of repellent imagery. I wonder why I never saw her again?",Eraserhead
74,Angry_Arguer,"Circular, Industrial Logic",10,1 May 2004,"The Concept:  'Caligari' meets 'Catch-22' meets '2001'Films are such an diverse medium.  For example: compare this to Ron Howard's 'Grinch'.  Both have interesting art direction, but Howard focuses on the story sanitation while Lynch thinks visually--and to heck with mainstream coherence.  Mild Spoiler, if you can call it such.Here is Lynch's major attempt at surrealism.  Like Scott, he is constantly misunderstood by studios and audiences.  Actually, we understand Lynch better than Scott because we always assume Lynch gives us something weird. With 'Dune': the studio wanted 'Star Wars', he wanted '2001',
We have some interesting points here and I'm not just talking about the baby.  Consider:--We have the photographer of 'Hulk'.  Considering Mr. Elmes has worked with Lynch up 'till 'Wild at Heart', I'd say he learned more than any of Spielberg's photographers have since 'Jaws'.  Elmes has now passed the torch to Ang Lee.--Notice how many roles Lynch takes on, this is his 'El Mariachi.'  His only other major collaborator here is Alan Splet.  Judging from his later work, I think the exhaustion from making the final sound mix is what drained Splet of ideas.--This, like 'Fast Times', uses the guilt-baby motif.  The finale is Snowden's secret spilled all over again.  Since Lynch isn't concerned with making sense, you're either in on the gag or not.Lynch would recycle his themes with 'Elephant', all of them in a ""Good Samaritan"" wrapper similar to 'Straight Story.'  So we accept it as ""feel-good"" material and accepting his weirdness as ""drama."" 
If film is meant to express a tone or mood, Lynch goes one further by sending ideas in sound.  Everything either displays experimentation or give the impression of it.  Skittish meditation.  Kubrick tried this method in 'Shining', but missed the effect.  Sonnenfeld would have us think this was funny.This deserves at least one viewing.",Eraserhead
75,itamarscomix,For fans of Lynch and German Expressionism,7,9 August 2005,"It's difficult to take Eraserhead seriously, really. It's more of a film student's exercise than a proper film, really; and if Mr. Lynch says in interviews that he refuses to reveal what Eraserhead is about because he wants each viewer to try and figure it out for himself, the only reason for saying it is that he has a mysterious reputation to maintain; or, in other words, he's full of horse manure. Eraserhead is about nothing. It's an exercise in visuals, in visual effects done at minimum budget; and homage to the German Expressionism of the 1920's that Lynch obviously loves so dearly, influences of which are obvious here but can be seen in all of his movies up to Mulholland Drive.It's painfully pointless to try to find a deeper meaning connecting all the pseudo-surreal dream-scenes in Eraserhead; it's better to just sit back and enjoy the grotesque humor, the creepy visuals and the eerie music and to appreciate Mr. Lynch's unique and strong sense for atmosphere, for his completely original freak-show vision of the grotesque and the bizarre, in the very early stages of its development. Eraserhead is the perfect preface to Lynch's celebrated career, and while most people will find it pretentious, dull and incomprehensible - which, invariably, it truly is - it's essential viewing for devoted fans of this unique director; for lovers of grotesque, dark visual humor; and for students and those interested in the history of cinema, and especially in German Expressionism like that of Murnau and his contemporaries. Remember that this is merely an exercise created by a young and enthusiastic filmmaker making his first steps as a pro; don't judge it too harshly, but also don't bother with the effort of seeking a depth to it. It's not worth it.",Eraserhead
76,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Mind over matter,8,23 January 2006,"Henry lives in a dark and gloomy world of what seems to be like a desolate, and possibly post-apocalyptic, future. There is a near constant droning of what can only be the sound of giant machines in the surrounding factories and life, it seems, has totally boiled down to keeping them going for whatever reason. Henry, who is on vacation throughout the film, seems to be pondering his existence and has a series of bizarre incidents and things are initially complicated when his girlfriend's parents find out that he got her pregnant. The baby ends up being a bizarre looking thing that can only be explained by mutation.Make what you will of this film, because it is probably what director David Lynch wants the viewer to do. Though most people would agree that the movie is a psychological journey through a dream or nightmare scape, but the meaning of it all is really up to the viewer. That makes it almost like a painting by Salvador Dali put on film - the title and content all suggest something, an even point you in a direction, but the film will not tell you where to go, you must decide for yourself - it can be viewed as a love story, a story about parenting, being lost in life, or basically anything else. Love it or hate it, but you have to admit that it is thought provoking. Even if you don't enjoy watching it, you'll enjoy trying to interpret it later.That also leads to the films main strike against it: this is a viewing for an audience appreciative of film art, casual film goers beware. 8/10Not rated, but contains gruesome and disturbing imagery.",Eraserhead

78,ofpsmith,A film that haunts and interests you at the same time.,8,25 October 2014,"I would like to start by saying that this film is not for everyone. It is filled with strange and surreal imagery that could very easily put you off. Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is a man living in a dystopia of a city in the future United States. His angry girlfriend Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) has recently given birth to a strange deformed mutant baby, that cries constantly to the point where Mary is driven insane. She leaves and Henry is left to take care of it. I won't say anything else because from then on is just strange imagery everywhere. There's a scene where Henry's head falls from the sky, a child finds it on the ground, takes it to a pencil factory, and it is made into erasers. This scene could have been left out of the movie and nothing about the plot would change. If David Lynch wanted to make a story he could have gone without 40 or more minutes of this. But making a story wasn't Lynch's only goal. You can see that he wanted to make a surreal and engrossing film. I'll have to watch this again many times before I learn what it's trying to say. But I'll have good time when that happens because this is a great movie. If you can take strange and deranged cinematography then you'll probably be able to take this.",Eraserhead
79,anselmdaniel,A simple story told in a complex way,7,22 September 2018,"This review contains spoilers.Eraserhead is directed, produced, and written by David Lynch. The movie stars Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Allen Joseph, and Jeanne Bates. The movie is in black and white and tells the tale of Henry Spencer, played by Jack Nances as he enters into a dreamlike state.The plot for Eraserhead is simple. Henry Spencer has gotten Mary X, played by Charlotte Stewart, pregnant. The entire story is a dream-like imagining that Henry undergoes when he must take care of the alien baby. much of the movie uses a lot of symbolism and foreshadowing. The actual plot of this movie only concerns Henry and the baby.The movie is shot and edited well. Like Lynch's future movies, Eraserhead uses a lot of close-ups and blurry shots to evoke dream-like state. This is one of the pluses of this movie as Henry's mind is explored in an abstract way. However it did feel as if the movie felt repetitive as it kept going through Henry's imagination. It felt that the movie began stretching its 90 minute runtime to its limits with its basic story.I would recommend Eraserhead. This movie is well-shot and well-edited. It is however repetitive.Grade: B",Eraserhead
80,mahmus,David Lynch at his most lynchian,10,19 March 2020,"Watching David Lynch's Eraserhead feels like slowly sinking into a warm puddle of electrified intangible darkness and I love every goddamn minute of it.There's something comforting about this movie that I just can't put into words. It's dark, disturbing and unsettling, but also oddly welcoming and seductive.I love the sound design. There's never a silent or quiet moment in this film. Always a buzzing or a humming noise in the backround; sometimes even in the foreground (I love that silent splash though).The production design is equally great, particularly Henry's room. A plant with no pot, a window to a brick wall, a photo of a mushroom cloud; all of it just adds a lot of character and mystery to the place.",Eraserhead
81,WriterDave,Funnier The Second Time Around,9,31 August 2003,"The first time you see this it's so dark (literally and metaphorically) and disturbing you can't help but be overwhelmed by confusion and a sense of what it means to be insane.  The second time around, it seemed to me to be a laugh riot (the scene where Mary is trying so hard to pull that suitcase out from under the bed especially stands out as it made me laugh so hard I almost cried).  Another great set of scenes is when Henry first gets treated to dinner at Mary's house.  Her smiling idiot father with the ""man-made"" chickens and bum arm is a comic gold-mind.  This is essentially a black comedy about a slightly disturbed young man's inability to deal with impending fatherhood and husbandhood and the effect that living in a decrepit urban hell (Lynch lived in squalor in the worst section of Philadelphia with his first wife and baby daughter while making this classic romp) has on his escapist fantasies (love that girl with the cotton candy cheeks singing in the radiator).  Takes on some qualities of a dream (in heaven everything is fine) and Lycnh fanatics should scream with delight at being able to spot the origins of all his usual tricks (curtains, electrical disturbances, stages, mystery women, hightened sound effects, ambient music, etc...) that have been used over and over again in his later classics.  The epitome of uncanny and a hoot if you read into it rightly (quite rightly).",Eraserhead
82,asda-man,Off your head!,10,23 February 2014,"Eraserhead finished at 12 'O clock last night for me. It was my first time experiencing the film and being a huge fan of David Lynch (my new favourite director) you can only imagine how excited I was. It's now half past eleven in the morning and Eraserhead is still whirling around in my very own head. The film is extraordinary. I've seen my fair share of weird films, from Jan Svankmajer's Conspirators of Pleasure to Lynch's very own Inland Empire, but somehow Eraserhead manages to surpass them both in the weirdness department. Indeed, Eraserhead is probably the weirdest film I have ever seen. It's pure Lynch and pure art. It's a film which you could not put into words; it's something you have to experience for yourself.When the film was over, my sister and I sat there in silence as the credits rolled up. My heart was thumping quickly and loudly. I felt utterly horrified by what I had just watched. I was drained and could hardly walk in a straight line afterwards. I don't get scared very often at all, but Eraserhead actually did frighten me. Its atmosphere is choking, unsettling and disturbing. The images are stuff you wouldn't even be able to find in nightmares.Your enjoyment of Eraserhead is partly down to how you view it. If you watch it in broad daylight with kids running around and not paying too much attention to it, then you're not going to like it. You're going to think it's the biggest pile of shitake you've ever seen and I wouldn't blame you for saying that! To fully experience Eraserhead (and with every other David Lynch film) you must immerse yourself in it. Watch it alone, in the dark, with the sound turned up and an open mind then you will experience something truly unique.The film is virtually plot-less. Or at least it seems that way when you first see it, but I'm convinced that if you dig underneath all the bizarre symbolism then you will find something quite rich and astonishing. It resembles a feature length version of one of David's shorts, especially The Grandmother and it's all the more better for it. I didn't feel like I was watching a film at all, rather I felt like I was having a nightmare. It didn't even feel like I was watching a nightmare. It felt like I was literally having a nightmare! Eraserhead is scene after scene of bizarre and incredibly frightening imagery. It's enough to make a person go insane.David Lynch's directing here is as amazing as it has ever been. He creates a chilling atmosphere with the use of a droning industrial soundtrack which is excruciating to listen to at times. He also makes incredible use of a slow pace and startling black and white photography which has an eerie beauty about it. It's a seriously depressing atmosphere and it's one which will stay with you for a long time after seeing it. The dream-like quality of the film is astonishing. When the lady in the radiator started singing I felt disturbed, bewildered and transfixed all at the same time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for the duration of the film.It also feels like it's on for an eternity when you're watching it and I don't mean that in a bad way. It enhances the nightmarish quality as when you have a dream it feels like you're there forever, but when you wake up you can only remember bits. Eraserhead is exactly like this. It's a nightmare captured on film and confirms David Lynch as a master of cinema. His films are unlike any other and they manage to affect me in such a deep manner. I was shaken when Eraserhead had finished and it brought back memories of when I saw Inland Empire for the first time.Having said all this, Eraserhead is not a film for a mainstream audience. Not everyone will 'get it' and I wouldn't blame you if you hated it. Strange doesn't even begin to describe Eraserhead. All I know is that it's a masterpiece. It's a piece of timeless art that was way ahead of its time and still very much is. You'll see the world in a different way when you've finished watching it and every other film will seem dull and conventional. Eraserhead will stay with me for an extremely long time and is an experience I will never ever forget. Roll on Blue Velvet!",Eraserhead
83,oOoBarracuda,Eraserhead,10,7 July 2017,"The time will come in every cinephile's life where they will want to critically watch and review their favorite film. If it fills one with as much anxiety as it did me, they'll put it off as long as I did. The 1977 feature-length debut of auteur David Lynch, Eraserhead, literally changed my life. After seeing Mulholland Drive, I began to learn about film in a way I never had before. Coming from a childhood where films did not play a large part, I had a limited exposure to cinema. Upon viewing Mulholland Drive, however, my eyes were opened to the fact that cinema exists beyond entertainment as a medium of artistic expression. I had a wonderful mentor to whom I am forever indebted who inspired me to seek out some of the films I hold closest to my heart today. This mentor repeatedly told me during our weekly meetings discussing film, ""you have to see Eraserhead"", and I will never forget the day I finally saw it. On an overcast afternoon in April, I had a few hours before work when I discovered that Eraserhead had arrived in the mail. Little did I know at the time I was adjusting my television per the instructions on the DVD that my life would never be the same. The sounds continued to reverberate in my head through my entire shift that night, none of which I remember because my mind was still in a post-apocalyptic world in which people lived in radiators. To say that I loved Eraserhead would be an understatement; I was completely mesmerized by the film, Eraserhead was executed in a way in which I didn't think possible and my heart was filled with an alluring world I had never before visited that I finally had an invitation to. Eraserhead had such a profound impact on my life that it's not a film to me, but rather a friend. As odd as it sounds, Eraserhead is home to me. Eraserhead would be an odd place to live for some but for me, it's such a comfortable place where my life was transformed in the most incredible way and I'm happy to stay there as long as I can. Because Eraserhead is my best friend, I've had trepidations thinking about writing a critical piece about it. Best friends have a place in your heart closer than most others in your life, so the idea of deeply analyzing them brings trepidation to your heart. You don't really want to find many flaws with your best friend, so you put off looking at them with a critical eye as long as possible. Such reasoning has brought me to the place of looking at Eraserhead differently than I do most films I write about. Eraserhead is so much more than a summary of the plot and what I thought of it. Having only seen one David Lynch film (Mulholland Drive) prior to watching Eraserhead, I wasn't well familiar with David Lynch's style, but I did enjoy the aspects I had experienced. I've always been a person much more in-tuned to the sound of a film than I am with the actors playing the roles. I could never have been prepared for the incredible sound Lynch infused in Eraserhead. The ambient sounds throughout the film completely envelope the audience leaving us no choice to the world of Eraserhead David Lynch creates. Because Lynch worked on Eraserhead over a five-year period during his time at the American Film Institute, Eraserhead was a world he created during production, as well. Because Eraserhead was a student film, the budget was small and the crew even smaller. Lynch himself, as well as the stars of the film and the crew financed portions of the film themselves through various odd jobs. That level of dedication, the depth of soul David Lynch put into Eraserhead shows in the final product tenfold. Eraserhead is one of the most introspective films I've ever seen. Henry's (Jack Nance) room is clearly David Lynch's mind, at some level. There is a bucket of water in a drawer, a tree on a nightstand, and a picture of an atomic bomb detonation suggesting that the many facets of the human mind are being explored. My favorite aspect of Eraserhead is how introspective it is. Throughout all of David Lynch's career, he evoked the surreal terrors hidden from the untrained eye lurking beneath the surface of the most benign picturesque places. Eraserhead, however, delves into the mind, evaluating the subconscious and exposing the most common fears. Henry is a man with many anxieties which culminate in several unique idiosyncrasies all why trying to survive in an alienating environment. This is why I always advise those new to Lynch to just ""take in the work"" because it is an over-evaluation of plot and meaning that take away from the most relatable aspects of the film.Afterall, as David Lynch himself said: ""Life is very, very complicated, and so films should be allowed to be, too.""",Eraserhead
84,PIST-OFF,A recounting of the worst acid trip in human history,8,15 January 2003,"One of the better arguments I've heard against all David Lynch movies is that all the artsy fartsy explanations are empty because despite over intellectualizing the movie at their core really are plottless and that no one understands them because David Lynch is f**kin crazy! It can be then stated that if people watch something they don't understand and like it anyway then that can mean they can be watching any images on the screen and it wouldn't matter. It's like putting a baby in front of the TV, the baby isn't so intrested in what's actually on the screen as much as it's intrested in the fact that anything is on the screen at all. It's all just fodder for dumb monkeys with Nikes. This theory seems pretty airtight to me because admittedly I don't have any idea what's going on most of the time in David Lynch movies. This one I think I have a pretty good idea. I often hear the word nightmare mentioned along side Eraserhead. Most of the time the word as used as a generic term without much thought. But if you think about nighmares or dreams in general you might think of times where you've had dreams that you just don't understand because nothing makes sense in them. For instance you might have a dream that seems allmost perfectly rational, but always there will be one or two elements that don't quite fit in. Like you're having a dream where your having sex with your best friend's kid sister in her room, but then she asks you about your eye color and suddenly her room is your third grade class and your covered in ants. Doesn't make two bits of sense and is so non-linear that it's beyond comprehension. So instead of the term nightmarish being generically used, it actually is acurately applied. All that aside you can start think about this movie on drugs. Anyone who as ever done acid can claim two things. One, is that under the world of drugs nothing makes two much sense in the immediate sense, only the overall reality is understood, if at all. Two, we've all heard the stories of somebody's bad trip. Usually something along the lines of, he thought the couch was trying to eat him so he attacked it with my uncle's set of ginsu's. Well put these two idea's together and a thought forms. How little sense does the world make to someone on a bad trip of acid, let alone the WORST TRIP EVER!!!!!!?  I think you hear me knocking. This movie began production around 1972, right around the end Woodstock generation and the heyday of LSD consumption. It's not all that unlikely that this is either Lynch recounting his own acid trip which would explain his subsequeent insanity, or a tale Lynch might have heard from a friend of a friend.

85,nickenchuggets,Everything is fine,9,25 October 2021,"Since the mid 60s, few hit movies have been released in black and white. The average television or movie executive must assume that showing things in color is not only more exciting to look at, but is also a direct rendition of how an object appears in front of human eyes. However, black and white film still continued to be used well into the 1970s and even to this day, mostly as an artistic decision on the director's part. Eraserhead is one such movie that would just not be the same if it was in made in color. As you start watching this, it becomes obvious why. It would rob the movie of the creepy and mysterious atmosphere the dark visuals establish. While David Lynch is well known today for putting some very odd and questionable things on the screen, this was really when he started to hit his stride with directing, as it was his first full length project. Like many other impressive movies, this one was not all that popular on its release. The types of people interested in Eraserhead are usually the weirder ones who want to try hard to be different. This makes sense because the movie as a whole is really weird. It follows Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a man who is on his way to see his girlfriend, who wants him to eat dinner with her relatives. Her name is Mary (Charlotte Stewart). The first truly weird part of the movie starts when Henry attempts to cut a chicken to feed himself. The chicken appears to still be alive and contorts on the plate while leaking blood. After eating, Mary's mother tells Henry she wants him to marry her because she is going to have a baby. Henry doesn't have much in the way of choice, so he and Mary's mother go back to his apartment, which only consists of a single room. The baby (if you can call it that) is a nightmarish creature with a reptile-esque face and beady eyes. Its lower body is not visible as it is covered in bandages. It also cries non-stop, which has fed up Mary's mother to the point where she abandons Henry, leaving him to take care of it. Henry experiences weird hallucinations, the most horrific of which involves him being decapitated and having his head fall out of the air and into the hands of a young kid. He takes Henry's head to a factory to be converted into erasers. Henry tries to figure out how to care for the child one last time, and finally decides to cut off its blanket. He then makes the sickening discovery that the child doesn't have any kind of flesh, so once the blanket is removed, all its guts spill out. Henry stabs the child with scissors, and the lights in the room go out. Henry is then suddenly teleported to a woman he saw dancing in his radiator earlier. I have no comment. This has to be arguably the weirdest and most unorthodox movie I've ever watched. The entire thing from start to finish is just a fever dream. I think Lynch was on drugs. Upon closer examination, it might make sense to compare this movie to the phobia of becoming a parent, which not everyone can do effectively (as you well know). The probable reason why the child in the film is shown to have such a grotesque appearance is because it represents Henry's fear of taking care of a child. He knows it would be a lot of work and take away most of his free time. Even the early death of the movie's main actor is odd. Jack Nance was involved in a fight outside of a donut store in 1996, which apparently killed him the next day because of brain injuries. Everything about this movie is twisted, and that's the reason why it will be remembered and loved for many years to come. Even Kubrick has stated it was his favorite.",Eraserhead

87,Al_The_Strange,Eraserhead Review,10,26 September 2014,"When it comes to cinema as an art form, very few films, if any, are as abstract and bizarre as David Lynch's first-ever feature-length film: Eraserhead. Like any piece of art, some people will embrace it, others will shun it. Most are content to give it a shot and never see it again.It truly is an experience unlike any other. The film takes place in its own little world: a dark, grungy, industrial nightmare laden with stark patterns, shadows, and odd details. Characters don't have much to say, leaving their odd actions and reactions to tell most of the story. There are numerous expressionist images that will truly challenge one's understanding of what's going on: I seriously can't say why this film has a scene with a man on another planet, or why there's an ugly lady dancing inside a radiator, or why there are worm-like things everywhere. The film has its share of grotesqueness, from the crying of a strange mutant baby to the bizarre nightmare where the guy loses his head and it literally becomes a pencil eraser...the film packs in so much weirdness, but it runs evenly and hypnotically, to the point where it's all effortless and natural for the strange world Lynch has created.The film's content doesn't really follow a standard narrative, so interpreting its plot will depend entirely on the viewer and what he or she makes of the images. The most obvious thing is that this is about some dude having to put up with the horrors and fears of parenthood. You could probably watch the film and extrapolate psychological and sexual subtexts as well. Characters don't have much to them, but it's easy to relate to the protagonist through all his surreal visions, no matter how harrowing they become.The film uses some very strong, vivid, and stark imagery, all shot with fantastic black-and-white photography. Editing is really precise and good. All of the actors fulfill their parts well. Dialogue tends to be pretty short, blunt, and weird. This was never really an expensive or elaborate production, so considering the film's limitations, it really made the most of what it had. Sound design is very punchy, while the music is extremely airy and surreal, giving the film the perfect atmosphere.Eraserhead is a strange, surreal, gaudy piece of work that may not make much sense to a casual viewer. As a work of art, it is phenomenal, and all mature audiences should give it a try at least once.5/5 (Experience: Extreme | Content: Extreme | Film: Perfect)",Eraserhead
88,bsinc,No sense at all,3,21 August 2004,"That's what this movie is. I skipped through it because it started to deeply annoy me in the first 20 minutes or so. As in ""Mulholland Drive"", perhaps his second most praised movie after this one, I wanted to hit David Lynch in the face or something after the movie ended. I have no problem at all with art expressed in any which way it be in a movie, but ""movies"" such as this, my friends, are THE REASON! why so many average viewers hate the so called artistic movies. Because self proclaimed movies like this one give them bad rep. I am a movie lover, and it annoys me if I don't get a certain movie's message or story, but intentionally making 88 minutes of confused and boring footage that has only stupid little monsters imploding around is beyond me. I am the first person to applause new approaches to movies but give me a break. Calling ""Eraserhead"" a good movie is calling any home movie just as good.

David Lynch.He's another of those film-makers, like Peter Greenaway, Steve McQueen (of 12 YEARS A SLAVE) and Derek Jarman, for whom the emotional impact of an image is more significant than the conventional building-blocks of American commercial cinema. Personally, I love the stuff.ERASERHEAD was Lynch's calling-card. I'd've been pretty scared if he'd come to call on me with it, but I was nevertheless hugely impressed with it when I first saw it not long after it first surfaced in London. Watching it again recently on DVD reminded me how dazzling it is. There they were, all those nightmare images that had stayed with me for over thirty years: the oozing chicken; the sickly baby; the lady in the radiator.

90,peefyn,Manages to make the surreal coherent,7,9 March 2017,"It's easy to make something surreal. You often see it in student films. Things are out of place, people behave weirdly, and there's lots of visual non-sequitors. But when using elements that's hard for the audience to understand, you have to be a master to make the audience follow along willingly. This is what Lynch somehow manages to do really well.This movie has a plot, and it's not all that hard to follow. The plot is weird, and is set in a stylistic, kafka-esque nightmare reality. It's at times visually interesting, but the plot itself is quite simple (yet tragic). But the weirdness doesn't end there, because several times the movie leaves the plot behind to show (even) more abstract sequences. Somehow Lynch manages to go quite far into surreal, abstract elements, without pushing the audience away. As I watch this movie, I don't feel like I'm supposed to be able to follow all of it, but rather take in feelings and moods. While, at the same time, you can feel that there's more to it, that's there's plenty of potential for analysis.I was also surprised by the sci-fi elements of this story. Watching it, it really makes sense that Lynch was offered ""Elephant man"" and ""Dune"" (and even ""Star Wars ep 6"").",Eraserhead
91,Bogey Man,"Surreal, more surreal, the most surreal, David Lynch, Eraserhead.",10,20 May 2002,"This legendary film by David Lynch is definitely one of the most disturbing and scary films of all time. It is amazing how David is able to make ordinary things and items from every day life look so scary and menacing. It is impossible to say there is just one way to see this film or other films by Lynch so what I'm going to write is just my opinion and interpretation. It would be more than interesting to discuss these things with the director himself..Eraserhead works for me mostly on the level of its imagery and effects to create such a nightmare as it is. The film is pure nightmare from which you can awake only to even more frightening ""real world"" whatever it in Lynch's world is! I would see Eraserhead as a paranoid study of something taken over humans and controlling them. The menace may be for example the development of technology, which has become the enemy for its creators. Humans can't control their creations anymore, because they are being used (the ""eraser"" scene at the factory) by their own work. Also, there is a theme of humanity being totally lost and people being destroyed as there are many ""mutants"" and abnormal characters as the baby itself and the attractive singer in the radiator.The sound effects, imagery, little details (which are dozens again) and totally irrational storytelling have created one of the most impressive cinematic nightmares (not dreams, nightmares!) I've ever witnessed and so this can be described as horror experience, even though this is not just a horror film. Eraserhead is very difficult film and will never unfold to mainstream audience, because the film is too much for even some film buffs who can't understand and appreciate it at all. David Lynch is one of the most important artist in this field, and his surreal and unique work must be experienced many times and every time they will unfold more and you'll understand new aspects in them. These films should definitely be seen in movie theater, but unfortunately it is not always possible, so the home viewing experience should be made as intense and peaceful as possible.Unmatchable cinema, 10 full stars for the great film maker's early achievement.",Eraserhead
92,charchuk,Merely bizarre,10,22 August 2007,"I should preface by saying this is my first taste of David Lynch - I figured I should start at the beginning. I knew it would be weird, but I was not expecting this. I like weird movies, but this makes Donnie Darko look like Titanic. Incredibly, incredibly over-the-top in its weirdness. Perhaps a few years ago, this would have bothered me, but I made a conscious effort to watch this film as a film student, not as a movie fan. Although I could easily criticize it for its nonsensical plot and exceptional artiness, I am choosing not to. Why? I really don't know.Right from the opening frame, the film grabbed me with its uniqueness. The single credit, in formal font, displaying ""David Lynch Presents"", made it seem more like a dinner invitation than the opening to a film. The opening sequence, right up until the first shot of the factory, is such a weird way to open the picture, and yet, it works. The first line isn't said until, what, fifteen minutes in? But the film never lost my interest or caused me to turn it off - I was mesmerized. Right from the get-go, the film's unique style is reinforced, with the odd white noise present in the background, the long lingering camera shots, and the lead character's incredibly wacky hair style.The film soon becomes an exercise in trying the audience's patience. Increasingly strange and disturbing scenes interrupt long, slow, awkward moments, but it all seems to fit together. The dinner scene, the mutant baby, the lady in the radiator, the man in the planet - everything is exceptionally weird, but it just seems to work. My personal favourite sequence is a nightmarish scene from where the title is derived - Henry's decapitated head is used as the source for pencil eraser. When it ends, there's no sense of dissatisfaction, but you really don't know what to think. For some, I suppose it could be viewed as overtly indulgent, but I quite liked it.Jack Nance gives a surprisingly good performance, given the fact that the film was shot over five years; his crazy hair aside, he manages to portray both sadness and anger in equal amounts. The shadowy lighting and stark direction suit the film perfectly, and the strange characters are all realized very well. The grey, smoke-filled, almost (some would say definite) post-apocalyptic environment is pulled off excellently and the disgusting mutant baby is just that: disgusting. It really is an experience to watch it; I wish I could do so at one of its infamous midnight showings. Still, I really have to sleep on it; it's not an easy film to grade.",Eraserhead
93,Seamus2829,Having Your Pre Frontal Lobes Massaged By Edward Scissorhands,10,10 February 2008,"Make no mistake about it,David Lynch is a genius/madman (take your choice). Eraserhead was his first full blown feature film. It is a profoundly weird & disturbing journey into another universe (of sorts). The no name cast includes John Nance as Henry, an every day doofus with a hairdo that suggests that he stuck his finger in the light socket one too many times. Henry arrives home,to find out he's been invited to dinner by his ex girlfriend,Mary, only to find out she's had a baby by him (or what passes for a baby). The rest of the film is a fever dream of images (real and/or imagined). The film gets it's dreamy,surreal look from it's low contrast black & white photography, and depends on sound to convey it's bleak,claustrophobic feel. I first got turned on to this film when I attended it at a midnight screening back in the early 1980's,when midnight movies were still a going concern. This NOT a film to take a first time date to, nor is it one to show at family reunions (unless your family is that dysfunctional). As this is an independently produced film that was never passed by the MPAA, there is no rating,but contains some images that some will find highly disturbing. Enter at your own peril.",Eraserhead
94,Scars_Remain,The Most Bizarre and Creepy Movie I've Ever Seen,10,24 March 2008,"I just watch Eraserhead and I am completely blown away and a little disturbed. I can't believe the amount of tension that David Lynch created with this film. The movie manages to maintain the same uneasy feeling the entire time and it felt like I couldn't breathe until it finally came to an end. It truly is brilliant.Much like David Lynch's other films, the story is very confusing and all over the place but brilliant. I like stories that let the viewer choose their own conclusions and this is definitely one of those. Jack Nance is awesome and the role is absolutely perfect for him. The effects are wonderful, I really wish special effects were still done the way they were in the 70's and 80's because that was when they were best. This movie is no exception.Eraserhead grabs you and pulls you into its bizarre world for an hour and a half. You will never feel the same after it's over. Be prepared to have this one stick with you long after it's over.",Eraserhead
95,Med-Jasta,As an honest Lynch fan...,6,22 January 2021,"While this movie previews the greatness to come, it in itself is not great. There are many many good things of course but this is hardly watchable. If I wasn't such a fan (I've even seen The Straight Story) I would have shut it off at one point. Much like 2001 this movie has many good things going for it but is not to be enjoyed and is to be appreciated.Much like other Lynch movies the story is very basic and then dressed up with impressionism and surrealism. Day dreamer/very unhappy man Frank has a kid with a girl by accident. After she leaves because she can't stand the constant attention required to have a baby the unprepared Hank steps in and after doing so bad that the baby becomes sick he saves the baby. He finally gets with the sexy girl across the hall except she leaves because of the baby. When he sees that she's moved on he is so upset that the baby is dominating his life that he kills the baby and then himself. Basically the message, if there is one, (I don't think every movie has a message and as a society we are obsessed on finding one) is that you have to sacrifice your life for your kids. All of you desires and everything are on hold so if you're not ready it can be rough.The special effects were all very cool. Especially for something so low budget. The dinner scene was very funny. And you thought meeting your in-laws was bad?The biggest problem is an editing one. Much of this needs to be trimmed. Lynch always walks this line but never more than here (well maybe Inland Empire). This is very impressive for a first entry. Just think of the confidence it took to not only make this movie but then to show people. I'm sure glad that Lynch was able to evolve from this but still keep one foot in this style and smartly incorporate it into narrative driven movies.It was nice to go back on and see that Lynch isn't stuck being himself like QT and it was nice to see his raw artistic vision.",Eraserhead
96,XxEthanHuntxX,Eraserhead,2,8 June 2020,"It has a nice and distinctive visual style and a very special atmosphere.

97,x_manicure_x,I'll never have a kid,9,14 August 2021,"""Eraserhead"" is one of those symbolic movies, more like a collection of unsettling moving paintings. It's Lynch's only feature film to be old-school surrealist, though the way reality is distorted could be considered as expressionist.There are sequences that could be interpreted in multiple ways, but the main plot is pretty straightforward. Not that the plot is the main focus here: most situations seem to be visually unsettling just for their own sake. The dark and eerie atmosphere that permeates the whole film is disturbing but at the same so fascinating that it gets addictive over time. You don't exactly know why, but you want to go back and rewatch it every now and then just to feel those weird sensations again, like a haunted house. Every shot has been meticulously constructed with the aim of deeply resonate with your subconscious and awaken feelings or sensations that are hard to express logically.Sound plays a crucial role as well: there is no music at all, extremely limited and uncanny dialogues, but a lot of humming and wheezing mechanical noise which melds perfectly with the cold, hostile wastelands and bare, wretched houses and apartments.That baby is probably one of the most disturbing I have seen in a movie. I still wonder how they managed to make something like that on their own.",Eraserhead
98,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Incredible symbolic horror film. Unrivalled in its class of psychological terror for decades,10,14 May 2020,"David Lynch's debut is a masterpiece that was possibly unrivalled in its weirdness or horror until 2019's ""The Lighthouse"". A landmark film in the horror genre, Lynch's nightmare is truly a psychological horror masterpiece that racks up indescribable terror on a scale not seen before its time. Jack Nance plays Henry Spencer, a simple man who is on 'vacation' from his job as a printer at a factory for a week. His vacation will consist of him sitting alone in his grim apartment, because let's be honest, where is he going to go? Henry appears to be one of the few denizens of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. His girlfriend, Mary, hasn't been in contact with him for awhile, so that appears to be over until he receives a message inviting him around to her parents house for dinner with them. Henry heads over, and it turns out that the reason Mary has been avoiding him is because she has given birth to a very premature 'baby'. Henry is the father, but you could hardly call the thing a baby. They even refer to it as 'it'. Mary moves in with Henry and they are driven demented by 'it' as it screams and gurgles all day and night. Mary can't stand it any longer, and Henry is also at breaking point. Not only does he have this mutant to contend with, but the woman who lives in his radiator won't leave him alone, either!That's ""Eraserhead"" in a nutshell. I won't even begin to describe the scene that gives the film its cool and unusual name; it really is just something you have to see for yourself. The symbolism is incredible in ""Eraserhead"". Post-natal horror is how I would describe it. There are so many symbolic scenes that you could write a paper on it, which I'm sure has been done. Lynch hints at everything from the pain of childbirth to psychological emasculation. Jack Nance and the rest of the cast are absolutely wonderful. Nance's performance as Henry is one of those legendary performances in horror. His permanent expression of confused terror is wonderful, and I would argue that he invariably became a horror icon, along with Frankenstein, Leatherface and Fred Krueger, for that look of bewildered and agonised horror. He is an extremely sympathetic character. As is Mary. You really feel for them. The writing is simple but Lynch adds layers to it with the aforementioned symbolism and his unique direction. The imagery is as grim as you'll ever see, and there are many fantastic surreal scenes; the woman in the radiator is my favourite, with her eerie singing and smile. The ending is a fitting conclusion to what is a rollercoaster of psychological turmoil; a nightmare that you feel you've woken up from as the end credits roll, and you don't dare go to sleep until the sun comes up again and (you hope) drives away the chills that this film will leave you with.A landmark film, not only in the horror genre, but in the history of film-making.",Eraserhead
99,werefox08,Very Different..........................Very Over..Rated,4,17 August 2013,"Eraserhead answers a very profound question. We now know where Michael Richards got the idea for ""high hair"" in the classy T.V. comedy ...Seinfeld. David Lynch (director) is playing around with our unconscious minds by using loosely connected sketches. His grotesque mutant baby...his ultra weird main actor ...and the other few characters that come and go throughout the strangeness. To entertain the audience ?? I have reservation about that. Lynch made a movie that is average, but Lynch himself feels this is a pretty excellent film. Everyone has their own ideas about what this movie is about. In the end, it does not really matter. This is an important film for Mr. Lynch (his first movie), but in the history of movies this is.....totally insignificant.",Eraserhead
100,Jacques98,Eraserhead = Napoleon Dynamite minus the entertainment value.,2,24 January 2009,"It always amuses me whenever I hear someone calls Napoleon Dynamite worthless trash, then they further to say films like Eraserheadand yes, there are A LOT of films just like itare cinematic masterpieces. I'm sorry, but both films are the same thing, just with different motives. I'll never begin to understand how anyone can find entertainment, or even something thought-provoking, in literally watching people stare at things for almost two hours. I'm sorry if everyone who gave this film a positive score had Down syndrome, but simply do not have that attention span. And, honestly, I feel sorry for those of you who do.There is very little about Eraserhead that is genuinely weird. It's a surreal take on our daily lives, nothing more. All the scenes involve shots of the lead character sitting and staring at things in an attempt from the director to make us, the viewer, feel as if we're seeing something weird. In actuality, there is not a single scene in this movie that is any more abnormal than what I see when I look around my room as I type this sentence. There are a few scenes, including the scene that reverences the title, where David Lynch apparently realizes the fact in what I just said and adds some generic surrealist moments. Black-and-white tiles, old ladies, trees, what looks like a waded-up crapall the predictable surrealist imagery you can think of makes its way into this movie.That leads to another point I've never seen a review mention: Eraserhead is NOT original. If anything, it's more unoriginal than the big-name Blockbuster made by some director who has about the creativity of a dead tree stump. It takes no imagination whatever to think of something like Eraserhead. Gothic art has been done for centuries. All Eraserhead does is take the most generic of it all and puts it to motion. It's a lot like a less diverse version of Vampyr. The only sole idea that David Lynch didn't wholesale copy/paste from other artwork is the baby, and even that left me thinking about a few other movies with similar ideas. Eraserhead had zero originality, and next to no creativity.The story isn't something a lot of people feel worth mentioning because it takes last priority in the film. Most people will say the story is left up to the viewer to decide, but that's completely ludicrous. Eraserhead has a very linear, predictable storyline that has been used time and time again in films and literature before. Because the story is so paper-thin, writing a single sentence about it would lead into massive spoilers, but I will say this. I fully expected the ""disturbing"" ending from the first 10 minutes. I would have been much more surprised/shocked if it DIDN'T happen. The events of entire storyline plays out exactly like a standard soap opera, and every single one of them is predictable. Again, Eraserhead is a sad lack of imagination.The only thing I can actually complement Eraserhead about is the portrayal of emotion. The father-son relationship as somewhat compelling. The husband-wife relationship was interestingly and accurately portrayed. All the other relationships in the film were complete clichés, but those two stood out. But, then again, who really cares? I can see just as compelling relationships in real life, so why should I waste my life watching them in a movie that has no other redeeming value whatsoever? The effects of paranoia and nervousness are well-done, but, again, it adds nothing to the bland story.Eraserhead is a waste of time. It takes an uninteresting premise and makes it even less interesting. As a work of Gothic art, it's simply generic at best. The repetitious surrealism gets annoying very quickly. Eraserhead does absolutely nothing but make you wonder: ""Why didn't I just walk to the local nursing home and watch old people stare at walls? Same thing as watching this movie. And at least that way I'm doing the community good."" 2/10",Eraserhead
101,dallasryan,Classic Lynch in his Eraserhead Form,7,28 March 2012,"Stephen King is to Novels as David Lynch is to Films. You're going to enter the minds of some very twisted individuals with King and Lynch. When you watch a film that a director wrote and produced, you're usually entering their mind, it's almost like a portal into their world. Well Welcome to Eraserhead!! The genius with Lynch is, he's so brilliant that once in awhile he accidentally makes a completely abstract, surrealistic mess into something amazing, with those movies being, in my opinion, Wild at Heart, and Mulholland Drive. WaH and MD barely come together as being some sort of story and that they come together with a beginning and an end(Not a conventional beginning and end though, this is Lynch we're talking about here)in a Lynch film is amazing within itself. WaH and MD are brilliant movies! Blue Velvet, a little overrated in my opinion, but still very good. Then Great movies that are of the 'norm' that Lynch Directed and wrote(one of them) is The Elephant Man and The Straight Story. Two movies that kind of get Lynch out of himself for a moment, and prove his true genius as a filmmaker-not just his usual abstract stuff, but his true genius in what he knows in general as a filmmaker. I really wish Lynch would have shown more of his talent as he did with The Elephant Man and The Straight Story because he really is a great director, and if he would have gotten out of himself a little more and was more diverse in his career, I think he would have easily been one of the Top Ten Best Director's of all time. But be that as it may you get his usual stuff, the abstract stuff, which is Eraserhead and his other films which consists of about 75 percent of his career. To understand Eraserhead is like trying to understand Life. Nowadays, a director with this kind of film as Eraserhead, would be called an Abstract Artist where his or her Abstract Film would be shown in the Gallery of a Small Art Museum. Because really, it comes down to this old question, is Porn exploitation or art? Everyone will have an opinion on that one, most probably won't agree with the latter on that one. So the same question applies with Eraserhead. Is Eraserhead a film or just art or both? Art is subjective, film is subjective, Film can be Art, Art can be film, but I believe one can be objective very minimally with the two(Film and Art) and splitting the two like splitting an atom. Technically Eraserhead is a film, but really it's not a film, it's a piece of David Lynch, it's pure abstract art. I honestly liked Eraserhead, and in my opinion, as all of you may be asking the number one question, 'What the (Blank) was this 'film' about?'...Nothing! That's my opinion, Lynch likes to express himself through his films, he likes to push his limits and he doesn't ever care if anything makes sense or not,(the ending is hilarious and Eraserhead is pretty funny here and there, I would almost believe that Lynch would get a kick out of watching people laugh when they watch his zany, abstract films because I could imagine Lynch would get off on the fact that you're laughing because it makes no sense and Lynch is laughing because he watches you react to his work in that manner), so like i said, when one of his abstract films comes together into making any kind of sense at all like Mulholland Drive and Wild at Heart did, it's a real miracle, and probably very accidental on Lynch's part. You cannot deny Lynch's brilliance though, he's truly an amazing artist, and i just wish he would have shown more of his amazing gift as a director. With Eraserhead though, don't put too much thought into trying to figure it out, you won't, it's subjective remember ;)",Eraserhead
102,D_Burke,"After 35 Years, ""Eraserhead"" Is Still Entrancing, Hypnotic, and Very Weird",9,23 February 2011,"Being as huge a fan of movies of all types as I am, I have a running list of films in my head that people say I ""must see"". ""Eraserhead"" has been one of those films. However, after reading about how disturbing the movie is, and how many movies magazines and critics have labeled it among the most bizarre and even ""dangerous"" films ever made, I have always been very reluctant to see it.I have seen other weird films that I have been intensely curious about, but after seeing them, I could not sleep afterwords. Having refused to see ""Eraserhead"" unless it was with other people, not by myself, I finally saw the movie the way it was meant to be seen: at a special midnight showing in the Coolidge Corner Theater, located in Brookline, Massachusetts.After seeing it, I fortunately don't have nightmares, but I still can't stop thinking about the film. It is almost always bizarre, sometimes grotesque, and a bit startling at times. What's amazing is how it doesn't feel dated, despite being 35 years old. It's shot in a cool black and white, which gives it a noir feel that has never run out of date. There are also very few (almost no) 20th century technological devices in it, making the film as relevant to 2011 as it was to 1976. It's also amazing that newer generations of moviegoers (like myself) are still drawn to it despite how weird it is.And yes, make no mistake about it, ""Eraserhead"" is very, very, very weird, and oftentimes incredibly intense. However, film lovers still see method in director David Lynch's madness, even though they may not completely understand it.Another part of this film's appeal is how the incoherent story structure is used towards this movie's advantage. Without one of the 14 standard Hollywood plots, the film takes hold of your desire to see what happens next. Every drawn out moment of silence clutches onto your attention span, and every eccentric character shocks you, but dares you to look away.It goes without saying that the question everyone has probably asked themselves at least once while seeing this film is, ""Why?"" Why does the lead character wear his hair straight up like he's been electrocuted? Why did he and his girlfriend try to raise a deformed baby in a cramped apartment? Why does this man see a singing woman in his radiator? Why does this woman have such huge, deformed cheeks? Why does she sing ""In Heaven, Everything Is Fine""?People who hate this film (and I imagine there are more than a few) have asked themselves variations of this basic question, but refuse to answer them. Fans of the film probably have different answers to this question every time they attempt to answer it. David Lynch's answer is probably, ""Why not?"", which definitely keeps film fans coming back.",Eraserhead

All of it was worth it though. Even directing legend (and friend of Lynch), Stanley Kubrick loved the film and made the cast of his masterpiece, The Shining, watch Eraserhead to get in the right frame of mind.No one knows what the film is actually about, and no one ever will. Although, Lynch has said that in all these years he still hasn't heard the correct interpretation. There's no point trying to explain the plot, because that's something you have to figure out for yourself. The film is an utter dreams-cape which combines unsettling industrial sounds with startling, surrealist black and white photography. A man with groovy hair walks around a possible Dystopian future and encounters a series of strange events. One involves a moving tiny roast chicken which spurts some sort of liquid out and another involves a seriously creepy chipmunk lady who sings in a radiator and also stamps on sperm.

104,brianberta,One of the weirdest films I've ever seen,10,31 August 2015,"This is definitely one of the most weirdest films I've ever seen. Despite its weirdness though, I actually found it to be thoroughly entertaining and I even got a few chuckles out of it due to its weirdness.Henry, our protagonist, faces a number of bizarre and horrifying obstacles before meeting someone of the opposite sex and her family.This film sure does have a lot of weird events which go on in it. However, I feel that every event which goes on in it has a purpose. Also, I felt that none of the events were there just to be there. None of them felt forced and many of them caused different reactions out of me. Some of them unnerved me while some actually got a few chuckles out of me due to how bizarre they were. It was an odd reaction I got out of it but it did make the movie more entertaining.This film may not make much sense to some but it's art. Art has multiple interpretations to it. Many people have their own interpretation to the film. I've seen many of them. My interpretation of the film is that it takes place on another planet and all the weird things which go on are alien-like. They seem weird to us but it feels normal to all the people who live there. There are a few other valid interpretations I've seen brought up but this one makes the most sense to me.Also, the visuals are amazing. Despite being almost 40 years old, they still look very disturbing and that's pretty impressive especially when you consider other films around the time period. Also, I really liked the sound design. It is well-done as well and it also adds much more to the disturbing graphics. It works well with the visuals.In conclusion, this movie is amazing. I think that this film is an outstanding masterpiece. This is a superb work of art. It leaves a lot of room for interpretation and it is never too complicated as well. If you want to see one of the most weirdest movies out there then make sure you watch this. It is not only weird but it is also well-written.",Eraserhead
105,manendra-lodhi,Out of scope,5,7 August 2012,"I had a lot of expectations from the film but I have been let down before also, so it was not new. I guess we also need to be mentally prepared before starting to watch any film.The film has a story which made no sense to me. I tried hard before writing this, to understand things on my own, but I still couldn't get its logic. It takes you to an unusual journey in which a man has a devil like son and how he came is unknown. What happens afterward is just a mystery. When you don't understand a film you are bound to give negative reviews. But the film is absolutely sophisticated for normal audience. You need a lot more than proper attention while viewing, to understand it. PROS:There was a fascination for the subject and the film all the time which made me sit. The scenes however are so haunting that you assume that something weird will happen. But all you get is increasing complexity in the story. The soundtrack however was good and apt considering the film. CONS:I understand that films should make audience think, but the story should not be this complex. At least if one views it with full attention for the first time, he /she should understand something. VERDICT: ""Can watch, looking at it like an experimental cinema.""",Eraserhead

107,kyrat,Disturbingly pointless + confusing= boring waste of time.,3,20 March 2007,"I like art films- I don't mind black & white. I don't need everything all laid out to me in a film... I've taken film classes & learned to enjoy German expressionist films for their lighting & symbolism, etc..... but for the life of me I can not comprehend how this film has such a high rating.I felt like I had wasted 1.5 hours of my life in trying to see this film. I think I would've enjoyed it better had I skipped the movie & just read the reviews and learned that it was supposed to be about an alienated man in a depressing industrial who suddenly has a monstrous baby. If only I could've gotten that from the film. Instead I stared at piles of hair, a deformed warty chipmunk woman, and a alienlike giant spermatozoa being stabbed to death while people hallucinate. I wasted the entire film searching for meaning.... trying to figure out what the piles of hair?/hay? were for? What alien looking spermatozoa had anything to do with what was going on?... etc.Just a few hints could've helped make it a good film... there were things that if explained would have been more enjoyable and seemed interesting... the ominous/abrasive music, the creepy mis-en-scene (the elevator that hesitates, the radiator, the dead tree in dirt, etc.)This film is in no way a work of genius. I've seen films that deal with alienation & isolation. There are tons of films out there about the fear of parenthood or the feeling that your child is an evil entity (Rosemary's Baby, Omen, Bad Seed, etc.) You CAN convey these emotions in a coherent/logical fashion and have a plot/make sense. This just added to my internal debate that David Lynch movies provoke: Is he literally schizophrenic and unable to process reality the way most other people do? Has he taken too many psychotropic drugs? I even tried watching the interview with him after the film on the DVD and was unable to bear it. He seems lost in another world and just rambles.People seem to like this film simply because it's shocking & experimental. Sorry, but that's not enough for me. I'd rather have something that's original, pushes the envelope but ALSO be interesting (or at least not like watching someone's disjointed nightmares). I took nothing away from this film - and that makes me feel like I wasted my time.I give it a few points for 1. No T&A, no sexism, no racism, no homophobia 2. No product placement 3.

108,karl_consiglio,Nightmarish,9,8 October 2006,"David Lynch has a frightening sense of humour. Henry Spencer is a likable sweet character in a very dark and sinister looking industrial type of world, a very bleak environment. This film is basically about the hidden fears of fatherhood. And he picks on every single fear one by one with the use of his imagination making this movie basically the bad dream of men who are expecting to be a Dad soon like myself. This is one crazy movie. Absolutely mad. Very psychological. David Lynch has an imagination which he allows to run wild, he feels free to take all kings of turns and really plays with you as he so desires and he does all this in a limitless fashion.

It is probably the closest you can get to being enveloped in a nightmare. I have recently purchased the video which is digitally remixed in Dolby surround sound and it deeply enhances the film. It is up there with Das Boot in the sound stakes and makes the film even better with the volume very loud. The soundtrack is superb, with the dark, dreary industrial sounds and the steaming radiator, and the eerie fairground style music when the lady behind the radiator dances. But it's the images what make the film what it is, from our first encounter with Henry wandering around the barren landscape, the mutant baby, the window with a brick wall for a view, the plant, the clock with one hand and the slow elevator. There is a lot of symbolism going on in this film, but it's all very nourishing for the mind, and I find it captivating and absorbing. It is a classic surreal masterpiece.",Eraserhead

Still,the acting by Lynch actor Jack Nance and the hallucinating soundtrack make it an unforgettable experience.The greatest surreal film since Bunuel's short masterpiece ""Un Chien Andalou"".I've seen quite a few Lynch films and this is my favorite.A definite must see for everyone loving film!",Eraserhead
112,Artimidor,"A world between Bunuel and Kafka - surreal, depressing and inescapable",9,4 January 2012,"""Eraserhead"" was David Lynch's first feature film. It was made in 1977 on a shoestring budget and it is a strange, weird, confusing, twisted, yes, a bizarre and surreal film, experimental some might say, nightmarish others, a paranoid experience perhaps, abhorrent, nasty, disgusting, shocking, horrific. Don't watch it! Worst movie, ever! And there are those who call it pure cinematic genius and a must see. But beware: Even if you know Lynch's later work, which is rarely straightforward either, ""Eraserhead"" poses its very own challenge by trying a balancing act between a surreal world à la Bunuel and a depressing, inescapable one like Kafka's at the same time. It is Lynch's most radical and raw work, an art movie for sure, so expect the unexpected.Yes, ""Eraserhead"" needs to be seen if you care for movies. And I'd say the main themes are not that difficult to grasp if you know a few biographical details on its creator, have a bit of an imagination and enjoy thinking about what got through to you by disturbing you. You might put a label on this or that to get to the bottom of the various symbols used in the film - this helps, but the sum of the picture is more than its parts. Most of all it shows the genesis of a filmmaker who would still be talked about decades after he made that incomprehensible thing called ""Eraserhead"".",Eraserhead

115,FKDZ,One of the hardest movies I've watched,6,10 November 2021,"Both on a understanding level, and physical/mental level to get through. Man this movie is something else that's for sure. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but people who are really into movies and like exploring it's vast selection of directors and styles.The sound design in this is haunting. It's the constant industrial coldness of the world that makes it so uninviting, every second of the movie hard to sit through. Watching this with headphones would be even worse/better.The directing, well this is my first Lynch movie and this was.. a experience to say the least. I needed a couple different sittings to finish the movie. I have to see more of his work to really compare/judge this and how it compares against his other movies he made later on. I expect those to be a bit more pleasing. Though the directing here is great, this movie is utterly unique.The practical/vfx is great for the disgusting/gore stuff, really not great for any of the other bigger effects. The scale was hard to grasp when it concerned bigger scenes.The acting, alright. There's really not much variety. But it's effective for what it needed to do. My favorite scene was definitely the dinner scene. And I yearned for more of that later on but sadly that was not the case.Now the story... up to interpretation I guess. It's incredibly abstract and vague. And did not satisfy me with it's end. Honestly, I don't really know what to hink about it. The movie just kinda happened and took me along for the ride. For this reason I also can't help but rate it any higher. It was a drag to get through, intentional, but still, it was not a entertaining movie nor did it do anything for me in regards to a deeper meaning.",Eraserhead
116,pontram,Outstanding Brain and Soul Fodder,9,4 July 2010,"Eraserhead is strange in many ways. One is, that as a very difficult movie (to bear), it has surprisingly many positive reviews here.When I watched Eraserhead I was very young, about 14 or 15, and for me it was the most remarkable movie for many many years. I didn't ever try (or was able) to interpret it besides the obvious fear of newborn children and standard family or social adapting. I remember me sitting there all the time wondering, what strange worlds movies can offer, and also wondering how familiar these strange worlds can be to me.At this time I had already seen Andalusian's Dog, The Golden Age, and some other movies like Themroc, Satyricon, Teorema and Solaris, but Eraserhead was an ultimate kick of strangeness. It has IMO an own direction of art and is definitively NOT surrealism, but it has a surrealistic appeal to many watchers. It is instead a deeply personal expression of fear and doubt, where surrealism in movies is much more a brain-game, a happening, a performance. Eraserhead begins, where surrealism ends, on a level where we begin to ask ourself how the world around us should be understood and how each of us could fit in - or not.For about 30 years I never encountered a movie like Eraserhead, and when I watched Lynch's other works I was always disappointed, like with George Lucas' works after THX1138 or John Carpenters' movies after Dark Star.I recommend this specific title - seriously! - for high school classes to watch and discuss later.",Eraserhead

So I consider myself as someone who knows more about movies than the average Joe. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Actually it's not even a movie. I would describe it as a collage of pictures and sound. The sound is so annoying that my head started to hurt. It does not have a plot or even believable acting, at least movies such as ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" have a ""plot"" that you can follow and laugh at. I really don't get why people consider this cheap piece of **** to be one of the best movies ever.Most overrated movie ever!",Eraserhead
119,imbluzclooby,A Real test of Patience!,6,11 October 2007,"Let's accept the fact that this is one of the most notoriously bizarre, weird and idiotic films ever made, we cannot deny that it made an impact on experimental cinema. If we were to believe that this film is nothing more than psychedelic fodder for abnormal or curious minds then we are discarding it, perhaps exalting it to an avant gard status. Is it just random imagery shown for ""shock value"" sake? Was David Lynch some goof ball in his youth that he was just some fool who embarked on a five year project, which isn't anything better than someone showing weird people and weird things just to discover what the reaction would be? Likely. But I think it's a bit of that and more.Eraserhead, in itself, is often boring, engrossing, drab, quirky, freakish and grotesque. The real crime here is that it absolutely refuses to explain itself and leaves you impatient and angry, but awaiting anxiously what will happen next. It's not suspense. Because suspense will clue you in to what will happen. In Eraserhead, you have no idea what will happen at the next moment. And we are at the beginning of our frustration with this movie. It has virtually no plot, minimal dialogue and just seems to venture into its own indulgent surrealistic voyage with uncompromising willfulness.But it somehow works through its convoluted logic. Yes, Eraserhead is a movie that will spawn reactions, both positive and negative. But this movie is likely to give art students ideas. And strange minds will likely be attracted to it. I happen to admire it. I don't admire it for its result, but rather the effort put into it. Any film maker should remark that a lot of effort and work went into this production, regardless of the budget. Five years is a long time and quite a sacrifice to have such a modest payoff. Lynch took a gamble with this movie, and I praise him for that. It is evident that after watching it we come across some elaborate sets and special effects. I'm not here to defend the film, but rather the painstaking work of David Lynch for having dedicated himself to such a torrid and abominable piece of art.",Eraserhead
120,jay4stein79-1,Cough cough cough,7,1 April 2006,"Eraserhead is a dusty, dirty little film that makes little sense to me now and made little sense to me as I sat watching it. Having had the benefit of watching it with two friends who, like me, are enraptured by David Lynch's high points, I can say that I am not alone in my confusion. I don't think a coherent narrative is the point with Eraserhead, though. Like a lot of Lynch's films, it seems guided more by mood and theme--like music--than it does by an actual plot. So, even if you don't fully understand the film, it's an enjoyable piece of modern-day surrealism. Its debt to Bunuel and Dali should be clear to anyone with a passing interest in film history. Unlike those early purveyors in the unreal, I'm not entirely sure what purpose the surrealism in Eraserhead serves. Bunuel in particular used his unique imagery to make oblique satires of government and religion and the bourgeoisie; he also had a wicked sense of humor. Eraserhead is a little too self-serious and I for one am at a loss to explain the woman in the radiator's significance. Is the film about the growing dehumanization of mankind? Is it about Lynch's adolescent fascination with and distrust of sex? It doesn't matter, of course, because the vision is entirely unique. Eraserhead is an experience and as such it should be experienced--not understood.",Eraserhead

Then you have to apologize to anyone to whom you ever recommended a Lynch movie. Then you must recant every bit of enthusiasm you ever expressed or felt for that execrable TV series of his, or for the loathsome movie based on it. Then you have to accept with good cheer the inevitable oblivion into which Lynch and everything he ever did will drop like a stone into a bottomless well. And finally, you must resolve never to discuss, much less debate, Lynch's work with those who still pretend to respect it, understanding and accepting that the appropriate punishment for pretending to like Lynch's work is...pretending to like Lynch's work.Okay, so 6 steps.",Eraserhead
122,quinimdb,Eraserhead,10,16 April 2016,"Okay, so ""Eraserhead"" is basically a disturbing mix of surreal imagery and industrial sound design and it's hands down the most bizarre movie that I've ever seen and probably ever will see (and I've seen ""Synecdoche, New York"" and many other bizarre, surreal films, including the others from David Lynch - but trust me, this one takes the cake). Most of the film is very ambiguous, so this is going to be basically what I got from the film on my first viewing rather than an actual review, but let me just say, I wholeheartedly recommend that you watch this one if you're into film and especially if you enjoy art-house, or even if you just want to watch something that is entirely original. The film uses a perfect combination of make up, set design, editing, industrial sound design, costume design, lighting (or rather lack thereof), black and white grainy cinematography, acting and long, uncomfortable takes to create terrifying imagery that sticks with you long after you'be finished watching. It also creates one of the most oppressive, bleak, and absolutely nightmarish or dreamlike atmospheres, even though there were even parts that I chuckled at, and it's worth watching just for that completely unique experience, but I do believe there is a hidden meaning behind most of this film. Again, keep in mind that this is a very, VERY ambiguous movie and this is just my interpretation.So this film takes place almost entirely in Henry Spencer's mind. The film starts with a shot of what seems to be an isolated planet with a dirty man on it whose only purpose is to pull levers. Then once he pulls the lever a worm-like thing that strongly resembles the baby in this film comes out of Henry's mouth. Now I believe that the man on the planet pulling levers is what henry fears he is: A small worker who's a sole purpose is to reproduce and have a rather small role in a larger company. This idea is reinforced by the following shot which shows Henry looking scared and then quickly walking further and further into the background, growing smaller and smaller until he escapes behind a wall. He then goes ton his girlfriend(?)'s place where he meets her mother, who plays her role by supporting her mother, helping her play her role by helping out with the food, even after it seems she may be brain dead. The father is a hard working middle class plumber who works a lot with his hands. This reinforces Henry's fear that he may be only an insignificant cog in a much, much larger machine. He gets the news that he has a son, and I'm and the mother very much do not want it. But of course they feel pressured to take care of it, so they bring it to Henry's apartment. It's worth noting that before they even bring it there, it seems the apartment begins to become a sort of nest like habitat, showing that Henry is worrying about his singular place in the world before he needs to start caring for this baby. The baby itself is disgusting looking and horrible sounding, and this is to start how that to Henry and his girlfriend, this baby is a very ugly burden, not a wonderful blessing. The girlfriend starts to get more and more anxious about this baby, and eventually just leaves. Eventually, the beautiful woman he sees at the beginning of the film seduces him, and it seems he sees this woman as a way out from the dreaded responsibility of having to deal with this child. The film then shows a woman in a dream that has two tumor like things on her face on a stage, and we've seen this woman before stepping on these worm like things that look very similar to the baby. This time she sings a song to Henry, saying that ""everything will be better in heaven"". I believe this woman represents a way out of his anxiety, especially when juxtaposed with the beautiful woman. However, when she says ""heaven"" she obviously means death, and Henry then has a terrifying vision that maybe even after his death, the baby will live on as the only part of him left on the earth and he will still just be used as a tool in the machine and no one will remember him. He decides he needs to use the beautiful woman as his way out instead. However, next time he tries to meet with her, he sees another man with her and she sees him and he fears she can only think of the baby that has been dominating his life and driving him insane. Now it seems the baby is laughing at him rather than crying, and he decides that the only thing he can do is murder this baby. He does that, and whether he kills himself after or not, it seems he's escaped this vision of himself considering it shows the ""planet"" that the dirty worker from the beginning was on blowing up and the lady in the radiator kissing himSo, in short, I believe the film is about the fear of growing insignificant or unimportant in a society more and more heavily reliant on machines, the fear that you have only one purpose in this world and the fear of parenting and marriage and all responsibility that comes with it. Those are basically my raw thoughts on the film after my first viewing, and there is obviously a lot that I skipped out on because I didn't understand it. And you know what? That's OK. I don't think I'll ever COMPLETELY understand this film, but that only makes it more rewarding with each viewing really, and that's hard to come by in a film.",Eraserhead

The kind of nightmare where nothing seems to make sense, yet in a strange kind of way it almost does? David Lynch has obviously had that kind of nightmare, and he has captured it in this truly surreal and strange film. Though seldom used, there are some very good special effects in the film, the ""baby"" being the most obvious and most disturbing. The directing by Mr. Lynch is truly amazing: the stark black and white, the dismal look of the city, and on top of all that, he brought out some amazing performances from the cast. Nance was great in the lead; he almost made you feel sorry for him, but not quite. Which I think was Lynch's purpose. Underneath all the beautiful and bizarre images however, Lynch hides messages that are still important in todays culture. He touches on topics like fatherhood, suicide, adultery, not to mention the overall state of the world. This is a great film, though I think it must be watched at least twice for the full effect.9/10",Eraserhead

125,zfiany,It's a rare jewel for it looks nothing like anything else!,9,9 November 2009,"Awakward characters, there is no character in the movie that looks like a normal human being! Usually people fear what they don't understand and in movies viewers usually tend to give up on the movie if they don't get what they're watching. But, not this movie! The minute you start watching you realize that you have no idea what's going on, however, you are attached to the screen and you want to understand. There is a certain sense about the movie that drags you to the end of it because you refuse to feel stupid. Definitely there is a clear indication to the nuclear era and this appears evidently in the deformities of the characters. The gloominess of the places and characters is another obvious suggestion of the war times and how they affect people mental well-being. Despite all this, you can't but focus on the central character of Henry who seems to be a person void of everything but his sexuality. His world is so empty as his house and you never know anything about his life but the fact that he works in printing and his lust for his neighbor and the blond woman in his head. This is another genius interpretation of what becomes of a depressed person in a war society with no pleasurable act but sex.Eraserhead being written, produced and directed by David Lynch is definitely a vision. I can only say that this work is a jewel that is similar to a wise book which includes the knowledge or discovery of one person and must be experienced. There are lots of smart/genius details in the movie that hold so many intellectual interpretations that the viewer needs to pay attention to. The old lady in the kitchen who sits like a dead person and the mother makes her shuffle the salad. When Henry takes the knife and the chicken bleeds. When the mother licks Henry's neck. When Henry's head is used to sharpen pens! This is like the most beautiful and smartest symbolization of a human's head in this era. We have no heads of our own anymore. Our heads are just pencil's sharpeners for the politicians who are writing our destiny.A movie to the brainers only!",Eraserhead
126,chelano,Mind melting with sounds,8,18 October 2010,"I seriously felt like I needed to watch something happy after this film. My mind just felt tired after watching the film. I also feel like I could not watch it again. But that will not change that I thought it was very creative and very well done. David Lynch really wanted to mess with anyone who watched this film and I believe he accomplished that. The story line was so hidden it was hard to figure out. The scenes throughout the movie though were beyond the strange. From what I can figure out, this takes place in a destroyed world. Most of the green is gone and what is left is pain. Jack Nance plays the main role. His acting was all in his expressions. I loved his expressions. I also read that the script of this movie was about three pages long. So the acting had to be in movement. Then the movie would have to rely on everything else to make it whole. Charlotte Stewart plays the girl he is in love with. They have a baby together, but because of this crazy polluted world, the baby is a bit; strange. It is hard to explain and better to experience the madness than describe it. Lynch's idea of putting mind ripping sounds throughout the film really got to me. Through the whole film it makes you very uncomfortable. I am sure that is what he wanted though. For example, the first ten or so minutes of the film is one constant sound that gets louder and louder. You almost want to pull your hair out. By the end of the film I said to myself, ""God what an uncomfortable movie"". Then it came to me how brilliant David Lynch really is. Many will make a comedy and say that it will make people laugh. That is why many comedies do fail. But Lynch's warped mind probably thought why not make a film to really mess with people and make them feel just weird by the end of it. He made it happen and that is what makes this film excellent. There were some small things I would change in the film, but nothing to the point of a complete change because I would never want to mess with Lynch.",Eraserhead

128,Meganeguard,Are You Henry?,8,6 December 2006,"What is a cult film? Is a cult film a film that lacks many of the components of a mainstream film, but somehow or other is able to garner many fans through its artistic merits, bizarreness, racy humor, etc.? If so some films like Kevin's Smith's Clerks and Jim Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise might rank highly in some circles because of their use of black and white film and their ability to find humor in the mundane life. However, what about the films of Kitano Takeshi and Miike Takashi? Their films are vastly different, but they are both labeled cult film directors in the West. Maybe it is because they are Japanese. As one can tell when one goes to the local video story, if one wants to rent a foreign film it is automatically in the ""art film"" section even if they were quite mainstream in their home countries. What am I trying to get at here? I am just trying to say that the label ""cult film"" is just too easy to use. I mean, come one, do you really believe Kill Bill is a cult film when it garners millions of dollars at the box office. Who knows? It is up to the film viewer to decide. The reason I am bringing this up and why I went into the blurb above is because I've just watched one of the films that I have known as a cult classic for around ten years, but I have just gotten around to watching myself and that film is David Lynch's Eraserhead.Upon the films opening and it scenes of an urban wasteland of concrete, steel, and dirty water, the first thing I thought was that I can definitely see where Tsukamoto Shinya received his influence for Tetsuo the Ironman. Eraserhead tells the story of Henry Spencer a young man who works for a printing company, he is now on ""vacation,"" and who sports some very impressive hair. After returning to his apartment one day, the woman across the hall informs him that a woman called for him and invited him to dinner with her family. This is Mary X, and Henry goes there reluctantly because he has not heard from her for a long time. Within Mary's home we meet her parents. Mom is quite overbearing, Dad likes to cuss a lot and talk about his old injuries, grandma doesn't talk much she jut helps tossing salads and smoking, the dog seems to have just had puppies. Within these environs and after a dinner which consisted of Henry piercing a small cooked chicken that started twitching and bleeding, Henry learns that he is a father. However, he is the father of a monster not a baby. Henry and Mary decide to get marry and raise the monster, but Mary can not handle the monster's incessant crying and leaves it with Henry. Henry could not care less about it, but it seems it is also the least of his worries because some other bizarre things are happening. His radiator seems to be possessed by a woman with horribly puffed out cheeks and his head seems to fall off sometimes David Lynch's Eraserhead is definitely a trip into the bizarre, and I do believe that it is one of the strangest films that I have ever seen. Does the film actually have a plot or a deeper meaning behind it? Hard to say, but some believe that it shows the difficulties of taking on adult responsibilities such as raising children. However, does the film really need to have a deeper meaning to be enjoyed? Maybe one should just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Eraserhead
129,danielharden,Batsh*t Crazy,6,9 June 2016,"I have no idea what the hell I just watch, but i'm going to have a shot at figuring that out right now. Eraserhead is one of, if not the most famous WTF cult movie of all time. This uniquely unsettling film tells the bizarre story of Henry, a man living in an industrial area who is left with a mutated child to look after.My interpretation of the film is that it is about the psychological struggle of raising a premature child and fear of parenthood. The plot itself doesn't particularly develop very much, instead making way for unnervingly surreal moments that will leave first time viewers, like myself, scratching our heads.Some key wtf moments include; the lady in the radiator, the pencils made of human skull, the dancing roast chicken that sh*ts black liquid and literally every scene with the underdeveloped baby in it.The Audio for the film is enough to turn anyone insane. The sounds recorded are basically a collection of extremely unpleasant sounds from a babies never ending cries to that disgusting sound your eye some times makes when you rub it. This is great at further emphasising the grotesque nature of this film but it will drive many viewers crazy.The acting is weird, Henry looks worried and his wife cries start to finish. I'm not sure if the acting is bad or intentionally robotic to create further unease and make every situation incredibly awkward. I'm going to assume the latter.I really do not know what to think of this film other than it disturbing but also so wtf its hilarious. This is definitely a film you will need to see more than once to understand.

130,spacemonkey_fg,Strange...dreamlike...hypnotic,10,23 March 2006,"Title: Eraserhead (1977) Director: David Lynch Cast: Jack Nance,Charlotte Stewart, Judith Ana Roberts, Laurel Near Review: The ever elusive Eraserhead has just been released on DVD for everybody's viewing pleasure. Previously only available through bootlegs or through David Lynchs own website, this gem of surreal cinema is now on a cleaned up DVD transfer that does it justice. Though I thoroughly enjoyed this film cause I am a guy who can appreciate the strange and bizarre, I don't think this film will be a pleasure to watch for everybody.Some people find the story of this film hard to follow because amongst the main storyline Lynch squeezes in some bizarre images that I'm willing to bet only he can understand. But in spite of the strange images, there's a story about a lonely guy named Henry Spencer. Henry works in a factory 9-5 and lives cooked up in a claustrophobic little apartment in the middle of a dirty industrial city. He is soon invited to dinner by his girlfriend so he can meet her parents for the first time. Little does he know that he will get a life changing revelation during dinner.If you've seen Lynchs other films (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Mullholland Dr., Dune and Elephant Man) then you know you are in for a strange and surreal ride. Its no mystery that Lynch is fond of messing with your mind and spooking the hell out of you with surreal nightmarish images, so I was ready to submerge myself once again into David Lynchs subconscious. What I wasn't ready for was how deep we were going to go.This movie really is Lynchs most disturbing film and I love it for that. I actually screened this one with some friends in my house and at one point a friend of mine turned away and said ""I don't want to see this movie anymore! I refuse!"" and he actually turned his back to the TV! I was like ""hell yeah!"" I love movies that can evoke that type of reaction, and let me tell you I understand my friend perfectly. The images and situations are deeply troubling, so be ready for some truly messed up sequences.The movie is sometimes slow, but it more then makes up for that with its visuals. After all, this isn't an action film, this film is something artful, quiet yet unsettling. You see Lynch took extra special care here in making every scene perfectly eerie, perfectly dark and very very atmospheric. The movie doesn't have many outdoor sequences but the interiors of the apartments and the sets suggest that it isn't a pretty world that Henry Spencer lives in. And even the pacing might get slow at times but trust me, when something does happen, well, it blows you out of the water. So be patient and enjoy the beautifully dark and surreal vistas that Lynch has concocted for you.One of the greatest things this movie has going for it is the sound design. There is sound in every square inch of this film and it greatly enhances a lot of the sequences.A cool thing to remember is that this was Lynchs first film ever and man, I have to tell you he was off to an incredible start. He filmed this movie through the course of six years during the time he was in film school, but Ill damned if it doesn't look as professional as all his other films.So when you rent/buy this film, remember you are in for some truly strange and bizarre images. You wont understand everything, but you don't have to. I understood the film and I really appreciate the message that its conveying with its story. There's themes of loneliness, fatherhood, abortion...the film goes into a lot of important themes.Just don't expect a normal film cause you ain't getting one. This is David Lynch after all.Rating: 5 out of 5",Eraserhead
131,NateManD,In heaven everything is fine !!!,10,28 July 2005,"David Lych's ""Eraserhead"" is a strange, surreal and nightmarish masterpiece. The monster baby is sooo creepy and disturbing, that it makes the viewing experience difficult. Until this day Lynch will never tell how the baby was created for the film. The story concerns Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a clergyman with a fro like hairstyle. He seems to be stuck in a bleak and dark environment of abandoned buildings and decayed streets. Henry enjoys a strange dinner gathering with his girlfriend Mary and her family. Well sort of, until the roasted chicken on the dinner plate comes to life. Then he finds out that Mary was pregnant and had a premature baby. O.K babies aren't too bad. But this is no typical baby. It's a hideous, crying, screeching embryo, penis type creature covered in bandages. Freaky!!! And of course who could forget the singing girl in the radiator. She sort of represents a peace of mind state. ""Eraserhead is full of strange images and was made when David Lynch was living in a slum section of Philly as an unplanned father.

132,macpet49-1,Lynch Is Eraserhead,8,20 March 2010,"Like most of Lynch's work, this too is autobiographical. Lynch lived a small, repressed closeted life growing up and then in art school met and married a wealthy woman with Hollywood connections to get where he wanted to go. This could be the biography of most of Hollywood's giants including Howard Hughes. As with all closet cases, he seeks to find a sexual mate with whom he can find happiness but despises his own sexual orientation. This is evident in the fact that in all his movies women are either virgins or whores. He also devotes many scenes to the debasing of women much like Hitchcock. The main character and the couple's evil baby are all Lynch. He will never be a happy camper until he comes out. Cinematically, he's brilliant; as far as the plot, nothing is new here.",Eraserhead
133,chucknorrisfacts,Horrible movie!,1,18 March 2011,"In the past, I've walked through many video stores and have seen the box for ""Eraserhead"" staring at me on the shelf. Although I was oddly curious about the movie, I never rented it.Recently, I discovered the movie was available instant stream on Netflix, so I decided to go ahead and give it a chance, why not, right? Well, now that I've watched it, I'm sorry I did. Not because I found the movie to be terrifying or anything, just stupid! It's such a waste of time to watch this ""movie"". The first ten minutes nobody says a word...not that people have to be talking all the time in order for a movie to be good, but ten minutes of silence was excessive. Even if you're trying to establish mood or setting or whatever, it doesn't require ten minutes of footage. It just seemed an effort to increase the running time to me.I'm not familiar with much of David Lynch's work, other than ""Mulholland Drive"" which I also hated, but if those movies are any indication of the kind of crap he normally makes then I advise people to avoid his films at all costs.It seems like Lynch thinks he's an artist just because he purposely makes weird stuff. Just because it's weird shouldn't automatically make it art. This movie is proof that no matter how bizarre something is, it'll find an audience...no matter how small. It's definitely a cult film, that's for sure.Do yourself a favor, pass this movie by. You're not missing anything, trust me!",Eraserhead
134,wandereramor,"In heaven, everything is fine",10,19 February 2012,"A remarkably self-assured nightmare vision of the world we live in. Lynch takes the domestic world and reveals the horror that is only thinly hidden inside of it -- the things we feel deep down and wish we could express, but can only do so in our nightmares. Everything is twisted, but with its own logic, one that remains fundamentally out of human understanding -- or at least the understanding of humans that aren't David Lynch.And then we have Jack Nance, the titular eraser-headed man, trying to survive in this world -- although, in the end, he's every bit as warped and vile as the rest of it. Still, there's a kind of everyman sympathy that Nance brings to the role, that films the basic human connection that makes this movie so great. My favourite films are the ones that combine an unique aesthetic vision with a tangible human component, and Eraserhead easily fits into all these categories.I've liked the rest of Lynch's films that I've seen, but all of them have felt a little distant and gesturing at something that they don't fully express. Eraserhead, on the other hand, is a complete statement in one haunting package. Maybe that completeness is something Lynch wanted to abandon, but in any case, it makes this film great.",Eraserhead
135,Perception_de_Ambiguity,Eraserhead or: How Henry Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Death,9,28 March 2013,"Played as an absurdist nightmare I think the idea that dominates David Lynch's 'Eraserhead' is that man is a destructive being while woman is a creative one, at least that's how the man from whose perspective the film is told sees things in the face of his own inability to create life and inadequacy to even sustain life as well as his general feeling of worthlessness, especially now that he's on vacation (which is what he tells people, he may or may not have actually lost his job given that we never see him at work) and left in charge of his baby which he doesn't really know how to handle.Being in a relationship with a highly erratic woman and faced with sexual temptations Henry even struggles to keep his relationship alive. After having sexual intercourse with the sultry neighbor woman he gets into a mood where he feels especially inadequate and lacking in control so when he is losing his head it is replaced by the baby's, he feels as helpless as a baby and it maybe also indicates that he sees the baby as threatening to eventually take his place. As for his real head, it drops on the floor and becomes a commodity. His brain becomes pieces of rubber on the end of pencils, again even in this state the only thing he's good for is being a tool that is of a destructive nature. The kid who brings his head to the eraser factory receives money, even dead he's worth more than right now while he's alive.The ""plant"" in his apartment is a pathetic-looking branch sticking out of a big pile of earth on his nightstand and some little maggot thingy that he receives per mail he just puts into a cabinet in hope for something to grow out of it, instead it doesn't even move anymore the next time he opens the cupboard. In bed his girlfriend ejects big sperm-like thingies in her sleep and he can't help but throw them out of bed and against the wall in disgust. When towards the end the man tries to overcome his inadequacy to create by at least wanting to understand how things work he cuts up the baby's bandage just to have the baby itself cut open with his only option left being to put the baby out of its misery and killing it, and not even this he can do well.Henry occasionally drifts into a more blissful fantasy state which in his little apartment is usually triggered by the humming of the radiator. But rather than just harmless escapism I think this is more indicative of his flowering death drive. ""Behind the radiator"" he at first just imagines an empty stage. Then there's a woman on the stage who crushes those sperm-like thingies which have heads that very much resemble the baby's. Later the same woman sings about everything being fine in Heaven (in Lynch's own angelic high-pitched voice) and after killing his child the film ends with Henry and the woman embracing each other while light embraces them and the screen fates to white.

136,pekinman,2001 meets David Lynch,10,20 June 2008,"My in-home retrospective David Lynch film festival continues. I hadn't seen Eraserhead since it was released in art theatres over 30 years ago. At the time I was living in a ""garden"" apartment in Chicago not much nicer than Henry Spencer's in this film. After seeing the film I found it difficult to open the door to my place. It was winter, it was raining and the steam radiator was hissing loudly. You get the picture.The result was that I automatically blocked-out most of what I had seen and did not return to this Lynch classic until now. Like most people I make the mistake of attaching meaning to Lynch's stuff. Maybe I get close to the mark, maybe I don't. I am not privy to Lynch's commentary on his motivations and visions for his projects, I like to figure these things out for myself. Usually, as with 'Lost Highway', I am defeated and simply watch the films like exhibitions at a freak show at the state fair.'Eraserhead' is extremely funny. Lynch at his most cynical and slapstick. At the end, when the thing (baby) is unleashed from its cocoon by Henry and grows into a devouring planet, or something, Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' popped into my head.I can think of no closer comparison in the film world. Where Kubrick leaves us with a vision of hope and feeling uplifted, Lynch offers up something more substantial... hopeless reality and eternal groping in the darkness. The key, I think, is in that hit tune ""In Heaven, Everything will be Alright"" sung by the girl in the radiator. If you haven't seen 'Eraserhead' this will make no sense. I urge serious film buffs to give it a look-see. I may not live long enough to want to see it again but I won't ever forget it.John Nance is rather wonderful as Henry, reminding me of a couple of city-dwellers I've known in the past. Befuddled at his very existence in a nightmare world of sunless poverty and dead-end striving. I was interested to see Catherine Coulson (the Log Lady from 'Twin Peaks') credited as assistant camera operator. Like Orson Welles, Lynch has gathered a group of stalwarts around him over the years and stays loyal to them. I like that, as it is so rare in the movie biz. But that will only be of interest to dwellers in Lynch-World. This is NOT the first Lynch movie that a novice should watch. In fact it is more interesting to view several of his later works first. The zig-zag floor from the red room in 'Twin Peaks' makes its first appearance in 'Eraserhead' leading me to ponder on what THAT signifies; like the ubiquitous red curtains in many of his films.'Eraserhead' love it or hate it glues itself to the brain. Not light viewing, though possibly a party movie for those special friends who are tired of the usual crop of scrawny STARS who populate most of the junk coming out of Hollywood.",Eraserhead
137,isaacsundaralingam,Eraserhead is weird. And I like weird.,7,29 January 2021,"What fascinated me throughout the entire movie was how David Lynch built a world that looks like it could be familiar to the audience, but feels like something entirely alien.This is not my first David Lynch movie, as I watched The Elephant Man some years back, but I remember it being nothing like this in terms of its weirdness.Definitely looking forward to getting to know more of Lynch's work!",Eraserhead
138,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"A visual, creative trip into a world we hope we'll never have to live in.",10,16 January 2005,"Eraserhead is by far the most bizarre film you'll ever see. One time I asked my Dad what it was about and he said ""it's about everything except nothing."" That's the best way you can define Eraserhead. Eraserhead was an experimental film by the genius director David Lynch. Everything about it is repulsive, horrifying, disturbing, and yet there is beauty in how it all works so well. This is a very hard film to write a review on. Eraserhead isn't anything a film critic could analyze. The film is the way you interpret it(Spoilers) The world in eraserhead is a place where a man inside a planet pulls levers and there are horribly repulsive noises. A world where a paranoid man named Henry lives alone in his apartment, across the hall from a beautiful girl, has a girlfriend who is part of the insensitive X family, is the father to a hideous mutant baby, and has a very strange looking lady lives inside a radiator. That's what the film is. There is no way anyone can possibly interpret what everything is really supposed to mean. The film is how you interpret it. You might absolutely love this film, you might be horrified by it, or you might absolutely hate it. Everyone experiences Eraserhead differently, I'd suggest finding someone who has the movie, as it is very rare, and experiencing it for yourself.",Eraserhead
139,matlock-6,"Overrated, self-indulgent",2,21 January 2002,"After hearing how wonderful this movie was from multiple friends, I gave in and rented it one evening. It was an evening that I wish I could have back.Very rarely do I stop watching a movie before it is done, but that's exactly what I did here. The thing was so ridiculous that I simply could not bear it.The film opens up with the main character of the movie, Henry. Henry is a very strange man, as he seems to walk around in a daze, and live in a very strange and rundown building. In fact, most of the people seem to be walking around in a daze. I guess that's what happens after nuclear disaster. which is what is supposed to have happened, according to a friend.After 30 minutes of film (or did it just seem like 30 minutes), Henry has done nothing nothing whatsoever except walk around in a daze and mutter to himself, all very strangely; finally going over to his girlfriend's house for dinner. His girlfriend and her family are all blank stares and three-word phrases as Henry is. When the dinner is served, the main course, which appears to be some kind of game hen or pheasant, starts moving around on the plate, making little noises and oozing a black fluid. Henry and crew give their game hens blank stares and seem vaguely sad. It was at this point that I shut the tape off. I contemplated opening my second story window and casting it out, saving my town from the stupidity that is that film, but thought better and returned it instead.I have never liked anything else David Lynch has directed. Most people are convinced that he is a genius, so perhaps I'm just not clever enough to ""get it"", but I don't think so. I had the same kind of reaction when Twin Peaks was on television. I watched one episode because everyone said it was ""genius"", but it did nothing but irritate me throughout, and surprise me that people could be such horrible actors.If you are bound and determined to rent Eraserhead, then please find a discount rental store, or use a free rental coupon or something. Perhaps you will see in it something that I did not, this ""genius"" that everyone else seems to see, but if you are like me, then it will be all you can do to restrain yourself from taking your VCR, Eraserhead and all, burying it in your backyard, and going off to live with the Amish.",Eraserhead
140,ciscokid1970,Wow...so that is what erasers are made of,7,6 August 2010,"Whoathis is a trippy movie. This movie is classified as a surreal horror film. But to me it is more of a experiment in cinematography, plot symbolism and imaginative sets. If you can appreciate movies for art, sound, lighting and cinematography then you will enjoy this, but you must have a seriously open mind. David Lynch makes Kubricks movies look like normal films. If you liked movies like Pi, Twin Peaks, Dreams May Come or 30s German Cinema then you may like this movie. If not well then at least you can say you have seen it.I found Lynch's usage of black and white with subtle lighting and surreal sets incredible. This movie may be freaky and disturbing for many, particularly those under the age of 16. I bet this movie gets a lot of play in film appreciation classes.The plot of the movie? Hard to tell but my opinion is dreams, regrets and horrors of a dying man. The purpose of the movie? Who knows, practical joke by Lynch or desire to experiment. Watch it see what you think.Most of the positive in my rating is due to the sheer imagination and creativity of this movie.",Eraserhead

It's dark and apparent lack of dialogue make it hard to go by and to pay fully attention to every detail and it has a lot. I truly believe you must see the movie several times before beginning to understand the huge plot going around. Going to see it knowing nothing about it can be shocking but you'll quickly forget it abd be submersive into its world. It's not meant to be enjoyed but to be reflected upon. A must-see for every moviegoer.,Eraserhead
142,mungflesh,the Misery of an Urban Prison,6,21 September 2004,"I recently watched this again and in most scenes I felt physically sick. David Lynch manages to combine the right sets and images to create a very uncomfortable feeling right from the outset.We're not allowed to see a world outside of that of Henry's and for the most part not outside of his tiny apartment. Anyone who is claustrophobic to any degree will find this disturbing. The song ""In Heaven, everything is fine"" which features towards the end suggests to me that Henry is trapped in either Hell or a Hell-like life where the only escape is death. However, the sequence where his head is turned into pencil-top erasers hints that even after death he'll be recycled into the same grim existence with no possibility of escape.Whether the director intended it to be interpreted as I have done I don't know but this is what I take away from one of the most unusual films around.The sound effects are great; well-worth watching with the sound turned up loud.",Eraserhead
143,loufalce,An Experience,10,1 April 2008,"A film you either love-or hate. Don't ask me to describe it, but it contains elements of horror, fantasy and has a surreal dream like setting that leaves you with an unsettling feeling. Filmed in beautiful black and white, the title character Henry X lives in sort of an apocalyptical industrial hell. An extreme version of the 1950s ""square"", he has a pen procter in his shirt pocket, his pants are too short, and his hair stands on end. After eating a man made chicken dinner at the equally bleak home of his girlfriend, he finds out that she is pregnant. The ""offspring""- you can't really call it a child resembles a skinned rabbit combined with a human? fetus, and all it does is cry. After several more surreal and bizarre events take place- like the chubby cheek ""girl"" in the radiator singing ""In Heaven Everything is Fine"" and the leech like worms Henry takes from the box in his suicidially depressing apartment, the girlfriend and offspring leave. Leaving Henry alone, more bizarre things take place. The assembly line at the pencil factory, the horribly scarred man at the control lever sitting by a broken window pane. Does this represent human conception, is he God, or are we being taken to another planet? Film does not give you any answers. You are on your own. A triumph of design, the dreamlike ,trance like quality really gets under your skin and is further enhanced by the soundtrack which features Fats Wallers organ music, the noise of pipes and steam escaping , barking dogs and weird electronically synthesized sounds.Be careful to who you recommend this film to. They will think you are either crazy- or brilliant. A genuine, honest to God cult film, it is best viewed on a cold, rainy night. You definitely will see it in your dream. Not for the timid or easy to please viewer, this dark and disturbing movie transcends the idea of what film is, and creates a totally new form of abstract art.To this day, elements of this film continue to surface in Lynch's work. About the only other film it can be compared to is Dali and Bunuels avant garde 1929 masterpiece ""Chein Andalou"" A unique and challenging experience, to say the least. Are you up to watching it?",Eraserhead
144,joshuafagan-64214,Surreal and Stunning,8,10 September 2016,"11 minutes. That's how long it is before a single line of dialogue is uttered in David Lynch's breakthrough masterpiece Eraserhead.During the latter half of those 11 minutes, I thought this was going to be a silent film. Sure There Will Be Blood, which gained kudos for its lengthy silent opening sequence, didn't have a single line of dialogue for the first quarter-hour of the film, but you knew it couldn't last forever. In this film, in Lynch's arcane madhouse, it could have.And in a real and significant way, it should have. It would have been more natural, more appropriate. Despite that, I'm not saying that this would have been a better film had their been no dialogue, though it still would have worked. The dialogue seems alien, like an intruder to the world Lynch has created, which in turn makes that world more eerie and disturbing. Humans are adaptive creatures. When we are presented with a bizarre dystopian wasteland for an hour and a half, we adapt to that bizarre dystopian wasteland. Lynch counters this with his dialogue. Its clumsy awkwardness acts as a counter-rhythm to his world, keeping the audience on their toes.The acting this film is as out of place as the writing. It's not grave and serious but stilted and, well... bad. It reminds me more of a Shyamalan movie than a Fincher flick. The wooden spaceyness that pervades most bad acting is there in spades. But that's not a bad thing. It helps the film turn on a light in our heads, a dark light, a light that says something is seriously wrong. With normal bad acting, we are pulled out of the atmosphere. But Lynch, who unlike Shyamalan knows exactly what he's doing, has the film structured such so that this style of acting pulls the audience in further into the world he's creating.This just goes to show that there is more than one way to skin a cat. Most film critics, even good ones, are too set in their criteria. Anyone who has a checklist that says 'If a film does this, this, and this, it's good/bad', is missing out on entire worlds of possibilities. Film is not politics, people. Being extremely forward on one stance or another is not a good thing. There are many good options, many good styles of going about filmmaking, and a good critic learns to appreciate them all.Art is the process of tapping into- and refining- the web of emotion that courses through the world. Any work that does that well is worthy of respect and admiration, no matter how it does so.But I'm afraid this review has made Lynch and this film come off as infallibly perfect. They are not. Lynch is a fantastic director, but this is not his best work. That would be Mulholland Drive, which I have talked about in detail earlier. Recently, the BBC named it the best movie of the new millennium. While I wouldn't go that far, it's an incredible, sultry, dark, carnal, glorious flick that takes Lynch's insane mind and applies it to people and a story we can actually dig into.This film is nowhere near that good. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be experimental. Lynch worked every dollar of the microbudget he was on. This isn't Lynch, distilled and refined. This is full-on, fierce, ambitious Lynch madness. Some things work, some things don't. I wish it added up to more, but what we got is wonderful. It feels like David Lynch's first feature film through and through, and that is not a bad thing.It's the perfect movie for Halloween, midnights, or any other creepy time. Give it a watch.",Eraserhead

There are lots of interesting things going on here as far as film-making is concerned but storyline or random interpretations are just a waste of time. Its a boring film without any storyline. If there is a storyline then Lynch has got to be the worst story teller. I enjoyed the film for 'how did he do it?'. I think thats the only reason one should watch this film rest is Jazz. Also the background music is very interesting and eerie. All zombie public may like blood and brainless gory sequences but i think this film has nothing to offer to a man who doesn't bother about the making of a film. 5/10.,Eraserhead
147,unakaczynski,So this is what the world looks like through the eyes of insanity...,9,27 September 2005,"As with any fan of horror or cult films, I have an interest in extremely bizarre cinema as well. And, as many of us undergrounders know, one doesn't get much more bizarre than David Cronenberg or David Lynch. So, after viewing Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" and ""Blue Velvet"" it became a goal of sorts for me to locate and view ""Eraserhead,"" generally considered his first feature-length motion picture. Firstly, you really have to like this kind of off-the-wall strange kind of sh*t to appreciate a film like this. The story revolves around Henry (Eraserhead, we can assume), his girlfriend/wife, their baby and his life in what would appear to be some sort of ghetto apartment building. Really, what we have here is a lunatic montage of images and scenes that do a wonderful job of twisting viewers' faces into various shocked grimaces and exasperations. It's a beautiful cinematic piece just to watch, even without trying to figure out what the hell is happening. The imagery is eye-catching, shocking, and insaneand despite the relatively slow pace of the film, it does a fantastic job of holding attention through the unusual visuals. Here's my standard breakdown:The Good:--The cinematography is outstanding, as is the atmosphere and sound.--It has a feeling of a film from the 40's or 50's because of the extremely dark style of black and white photography, and the film grain (keep in mind that some of this grain could be related to the old video on which I viewed this psychotic montage).--Excellent lighting.--Lynch's direction, of course, perfectly holds the insanity together.--The special effects and shock value of the film still holds up extremely well, even after nearly 30 years.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help It:--The acting is pretty good.The Bad:--The style of the film and its lunatic-artsy style will be a turn-off for a lot of people, as will the extremely dark atmosphere and slow pace. But those are also the qualities that would be appreciated by fans of this kind of film, so there's kind of a catch-22 here.The Ugly:--Seeing the baby all sick and covered with sores.Memorable Scene:--Too many to mention, but I'm going to go with a scene near the beginning when Henry has dinner with his girlfriend's family and he is asked to carve up the chickens.Acting: 8/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 7/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 7/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 Violence/Gore: 6/10 (there wasn't much, but it was good) Music: 9/10 Direction: 9/10Cheesiness: 1/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 9/10Definitely not for everyone, mostly for genre-fans and cultist movie-goers. If you like psychotically bizarre and frightful films, then you will likely enjoy this, for instance, if you like the following: Naked Lunch, Lost Highway, In The Mouth Of Madness, Jacob's Ladder, Videodrome, Blue Velvet, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Evil Dead, Gozu (Japanese), Audition (Japanese), or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, then you may want to seek this one out.www.ResidentHazard.com",Eraserhead

I would have thought it would have been bashed by the flock!As it's certainly the strangest movie ever (even ""Erendira"", ""Naked Lunch"" or ""Santa Sangre"" look ""normal"" compared to it!), and expresses such a high artistic ambition, along with a strong will of depicting ill oniric fantasies (a little like Giger's painting/sculpting), it may be quite disturbing. It's definitly not for kids.After having seen it about 5 times to have the opportunity to really appreciate it, I have to say it's probably one of the more unique artistic productions of all times. Eraserhead is a genre in itself, and as many great peaces of art, has this timeless feeling which makes it look and sound like some dream you'd have had...

I didn't laugh at anything. I simply felt the need to clean things afterwards. I certainly wasn't going to be able to sleep. The imagery is quite striking very frequently. I winced uncontrollably a number of times. After I knew it was a comedy I could find some humor in it - but Lynch's idea of humor is a bit challenging.

I found this film to be dark, witty and funny but also very intelligent. The film tells the black and white story of Henry Spencer(Jack Nance), a fine and quiet young man with wild hair who lives in an apartment. One day, Henry gets a call from the beautiful woman across the hall that his girlfriend Mary has invited him to dinner. On that bizarre night, chickens bleed and Henry discovers he is now the father of a monstrous child that will spin his life utterly out of control. The film mainly explains the analogy of the nightmares of parenthood, fatherhood, actually. Because Henry soon becomes alone.

151,A-Ron-2,Distilled Lynch,7,29 August 1999,"Lynch is one of those directors that seems to latch onto a theme and go with it for his entire career.  His theme appears to be that of masculine responsibility (and the fears that this can evoke).  Lynch climbs into the souls of men and tries to explain what we are (this is sometimes interpreted as misogyny) and why we do the things that we do.  He tends to deal with men in crisis and to show us what our reactions are to these crises, on  a very abstract level.  Eraserhead is about the ultimate male responsibility, that of a man to his child (although we are never really sure if the baby is Henry's, he assumes responsibility).  As Henry tries to work out his anxieties and fears through dreams, imaginings and actions, we are taken along.  Ultimately, Henry fails and we see the consequences of his actions (the world blows up), but this is not meant to be taken literally, it is meant to be viewed as a metaphor about how men feel about responsibility. Lynch always portrays strong male characters, who often fail or get into situations that are over their heads, but try to cope with them regardless. Eraserhead is simply the outline for all of Lynch's later works.",Eraserhead
152,nhlgumby,Most frightening movie ever.,8,31 January 2002,"I am more than happy that I watched this movie more than once when I rented it. I am only upset that I couldn't have kept it so I could watch it more and more and more. The first time I watched this movie, I was scared out of my wits. And to make matters worse, I had to go into work immediately after watching it, sitting alone behind a low lit desk, begging for the place to close sooner. David Lynch was either a weirdo or a psycho when he directed this movie. I don't know how this movie was made to be so eerie and omniscient: maybe it was the black and white film that made all of the blood effects indistinguishable from the real stuff. Maybe it was the incredible make up work used on the baby thing and the Woman in the Radiator. Maybe it was the sound track throughout the film. There was always some type of noise constantly going on, whether it be a rain storm, some type of metal creaking, the radiator hissing, or the baby's constant crying, but it took a toll on the viewers' toleration. Like Mary X, you too will eventually lose your mind and become very paranoid.I am VERY happy that I got the chance to watch this movie more than one time. For me, the first viewing was sort of like a ""This WILL scare you and if you want to enjoy this movie, you are going to have to accept that you will be scared"" kind of statement. The movie made it's point to me the first time I watched it, while the second time I watched it I actually payed attention to the more subtle topics of the movie. Fortunately I didn't watch the movie the second time alone, otherwise I don't think I would have gotten much more out of it. I saw it with friends, namely one who is as much of a movie man as I am. The other two people who saw it had no conception of art, only making fun of what they didn't understand (it took me a while to get them to shut up). But the other guy, he pointed out that the premature baby thing VERY closely resembled a goat fetus. He also pointed out the the song of the Lady in the Radiator was actually a Pixies song. He said that they used that song to close gigs they had in bars and taverns. I also want to thank him for helping me put together the significance of the last shot with Henry in it where the eraser dust flew from behind his head. (This was my best interpretation: Everybody used him, and then forgot him). Those few seconds where the eraser dust flew around the back of his head was in my view, the best use of symbolism in a movie. Mr. Lynch deserves much credit for making this movie. He was something out of this world, let me tell you. Thank you and good day.-Scott-",Eraserhead
153,Ben-Hibburd,Eraserhead Review.,9,7 June 2017,"Eraserhead is David lynch's directorial debut. It follows a man named Henry played by jack Nance. Henry is a shy loner, holding down a job at a local printer factory. The film starts by following Henry go about his mundane life. After an awkward dinner at his girlfriends house he's informed that he has a baby. This sounds like a fairly simple story, but that's where the normality ends.Upon learning this news he soon finds out that his baby is a mutant. When you first witness the mutated baby it's something to behold. It's both surreal and incredibly disturbing. Especially in a scene towards the end of the film where you see it fully. The practical effects used, make what I can only describe as a cross between a worm a chicken and E.T. The film is shot on an extremely low budget and what lynch is able to achieve on screen is nothing short of remarkable.This maybe Lynch's debut, but it's definitely a film from his wheelhouse. It is filled to the brink with all his usual motifs. The film opens with a deformed man in a room pulling levers, what's he doing? why Is he doing it? It's up to the viewer to interpret. Watching Eraserhead feels like being stuck in a nihilistic lucid dream. Just when you think you've got a hold of the film, something new comes into play and throws you off.Eraserhead is Lynch at his most surreal, however it's still an accessible film to viewers who aren't familiar with Lynch's films. The film can be taken at face value. It doesn't ask the viewer to answer any questions or decipher it's deeper meanings. Rather it's to viewed as a cinematic experience, one that everybody should at-least try once. It's a beautifully shot film, one that washes over you with it's intoxicating atmosphere. It's a film that can be appreciated on just its visuals alone.However should the viewer decide to delve deeper, into it's meaning and subtext. There are themes of fear, guilt, sin, good and evil, and the contemplation of life, that is an even more rewarding experience to be had. Eraserhead is a film that requires multiple viewings like all of Lynch's films to be truly appreciated. It's a film that is both engaging and rewarding on many different levels.",Eraserhead
154,Genkinchan,Masterpiece or just another piece,3,11 October 2021,I had just finished watching Dune 1984 prior to watching Dune 2021 which will be release just a few days in my country... to be honest I was quite entertained by it given the year it was made will write the review it the page after I finish watching the new version.. so let's get back to Eraser headI enjoyed the movie so decided to watch the film debut next I really does not grasp what the director is trying to convey after watching the 90 minutes movie in my theory all of the character is alien hence the alien baby.. to add in the finale that the head can be turned into an eraser was not properly explained what the films lack is substance and in a messBut the one thing that i can really praised for is the make up department and the puppets is very real too so all in all is just feels like an experimental movie put on the big screen and the time length should be 45 minute instead of 90 minutes.,Eraserhead
155,Cyber256702000,A movie that has to been seen,7,23 April 2002,"Eraserhead is David Lynch's directorial debut and his most personal film. It takes place in a weird world where Henry after finding his old girlfriend has had a premature baby is told to marry her.  The plot to this is very bizzare and hard to follow.  It is completely uncommercialized and it is very hard to soak in everything that is seen.  The movie has some classic Lynch moments and it is a good movie that should be seen if you are lucky enough to find a copy.  This movie is not for everyone and most people will not like it, but if you want to see the weirdest movie ever made, give this a try.*** out of ****",Eraserhead

Yes I said it, this was a very stupid unfulfilling film. Let's break down the film as a whole to find out what went wrong.The Acting-The acting was terrible, which consisted of characters that were forgettable and not likable. I think a frying pan has more character development than the actors in the schoclk of a film.The Script-The script was painfully awful and felt that it was written by someone that had just finished elementary school. The dialogue was not convincing and the pace was waaaaay to slow. The script should have been proofread a hundred times over.The Plot-Maybe I didn't understand the film, but the plot made know sense. The whole time I was watching the movie I thought to myself, WTF! This is a true travesty of a film.It is hard to see how this film became a cult classic. It was boring, dull and pointless with no redeeming qualities. So far, this film goes down as the worst film I've seen this year.""Eraserhead"" should be erased.",Eraserhead
157,evilmatt-3,Surreal film with a very real impact,8,20 November 2000,"This film absolutely floored me.  I can't think of another film in recent memory that has so chillingly and effectively addressed the issues of sexual relationships and accidental parenthood in such a dark manner.  Quite simply, this is a film for and about men; it is a nightmare so chillingly familiar that is almost imbedded in the collective unconscious. Thematic points aside, there are a few technical aspects of this film that potential viewers should be aware of.  First, there is very little dialogue in the movie; Lynch prefers visual to auditory communication.  Second, it cannot be stressed enough that this film is indeed what could be called surreal and thus is not very keen on ideas such as linear narrative structure or objective reality.  However, once one gets past these elements, one can appreciate the way in which they add to the dreamlike feel of this film.",Eraserhead
158,Naoufel_B,""" It's about ideas"" David Lynch.",8,17 April 2021,"Basically, it's David Lynch converting his midlife crisis into a 10,000 dollar project, in which he tells a disturbing story with a surreal approach involving parental anxieties.",Eraserhead
159,stephenlovelette,Unsettled,2,1 May 2014,"Eraserhead's been on my Netflix instant queue for six years.It looks scary and it's by the writer/director of Mulholland Drive (a film I enjoy; check out my review) and Blue Velvet (a film I'm still 'back and forth' on.)It was playing at midnight at the TCM Film Festival in Los Angeles, so I was pretty excited to watch it on the big screen.The man introducing the film was Patton Oswalt, so amongst a number of funny things, he also shared the following. Mel Brooks used the resources of his own production company, Brooksfilms, to give David Lynch his first chance at a mainstream directing job with The Elephant Man. Patton reiterates that Stuart Cornfeld convinced him to do so by dragging Brooks to a midnight screening of Eraserhead. Since I was young, I've had the utmost admiration for Mel Brooks. And let me tell you something sister, E-Head's unsettling.I hate this movie.Slimy slithering intestines don't flutter my fancy.Did that sentence make you feel gross? It should; hopefully it scares you away completely. Because that's all this movie does; it seeks to disturb the viewer. So in that department: Mission Accomplished, Mr. Lynch.This is by far his worst.It's smart; don't get me wrong. But originality only goes so far with me. When the ride gets painful, stars begin falling off. It's not fun, enjoyable nor educational.Some consider it thought-provoking. I don't.To be more specific, Eraserhead is about the fears of fatherhood. Despite the cover, it doesn't disturb in a manner akin to horror flicks.It's about depravity and inhabits it's own dark shred of sadness that doesn't require a specific genre. Let's call it what it is: A student film.There's a lot I don't like.In particular, I really hate the fetus-stomping blonde (or Lady in Radiator, played by Laurel Near) with the fatty cheeks. It's never fun when she shows up; out of tune and singing the saddest song ever. Any scene involving the deformed baby, its grotesque skin disease or the anxiety-inducing wail of sorrow; I'd happily discharge from my brain. It's the single cringe-worthiest hundred minutes of my life. And I've seen a couple movies that'll convert an entire nunnery.Jack Nance as Henry Spencer is very good.The Girl Across the Hall (played by Judith Anna Roberts) is also solid. She dons a low cut dress and walks with a sinewy strut that'll entrance.But all the acting is good, I suppose. Allen Joseph as Mr. X is an oddball who offers the only chuckle.Lynch apparently likes featuring scenes of a spotlight on an empty stage. The shame idea shows up in Mulholland Drive. I don't know what the hell with to do with it.More often I wonder whether it's worth the ponder.Towards the beginning, Henry traverses squat mounds of ashy dust while a train whistle blares in the background. Considering the subject material, I wonder if it's in reference to Ernest Hemingway's Hills Like White Elephants. That short story's about debating abortion and a couple torn up by unexpected pregnancy.And it's Hemingway; it's wildly unpleasant. But much more enjoyable than Eraserhead.Okay, I'll slow down with the pessimism for a moment.To be honest with you I could hate on this movie a lot more than I'm going to. It has redeeming qualities but they bring the rating up to a whopping one star. I'm not mad about it; it's just not what I go to a movie for.These moments of redemption are few and far between. There's a lot of intricate camera angles involving shadows and how they fall on the characters. Even the majority of the smart stuff leaves a bad taste in my mouth! Like the leafless twig thrust into a pile of soil upon the nightstand. Dirt granules certainly spill onto his mattress on occasion.There are two particularly noteworthy scenes. They're both gross and unsettling, but somehow they shine amidst the pit of yuck.When Henry's in bed with a woman, they're wrapped up in the sheets like a spider, and her teeth are chattering like she's freezing. The spindly way she's twisting, contorting and toiling amidst the covers is creepy and discomforting.The other scene involves Henry making love to a woman, and their infidelity descending into milky white tub water situated in the center of the bed. It's a beautiful shot and really a thought-provoking scene with a fascinating dynamic.But even then, it's still pretty unsettling.Ugh! There's so much filth in Henry's room. The sound effects and score are constantly ghoulish, grotesque, creaky, whistley, shadowy, lurid, crackly, scratchy and overall irksome.It's an Odyssey through disgust, silt and darkness. And it's the rockiest ride amidst a meteor shower.Do yourself a favor and skip Eraserhead, and check out Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet instead. Only the biggest of Lynch's fans will like this. It's 'un-good.'By the way, I don't know what he saw in it, but I still highly admire Mel Brooks.Looks like it's time to catch The Elephant Man.",Eraserhead
160,tyranid_slayer,It's like he took our nightmares and put it on film.,10,2 October 2007,"Eraserhead.After months of researching and searching i have finally obtained a copy of David Lynch's Eraserhead.I knew what to expect from it but the final result was beyond my expectations.The story is your average guy named Henry has been invited to his girlfriends house and informed that his girlfriend Mary x has had a baby. The baby is deformed. At that point things go from eerie, creepy to skin-crawling. The line of story and dream like scenes get blurred. Things start to build up until it's strange and frankly rather disturbing end.David Lynch is possibly one of the best directors ever.His sense of style is amazing and he captures the idea of nightmare/dream like weirdness perfectly. And even though people wont like films with almost no dialogue you can almost ignore it in this film.Overall you should see it, it's a little known classic.",Eraserhead
161,Magenta_Bob,Hell on film,10,23 October 2010,"From the first shot of Jack Nance's head hovering in space, Eraserhead is a dark, puzzling nightmare that left me so disturbed I could not think of anything else than the film for days. It might not be a horror film per se, but the pitch black atmosphere makes it one of the most terrifying films ever made.Eraserhead is about Henry Spencer (Nance), an angsty printer who lives in a desolate industrial city and one day finds out he is the father of a terribly deformed baby. To say that it is about a man having a child is a bit of a stretch, however, since that merely provides a backdrop for a series of unnerving events. There is a lady stepping on semen like creatures while dancing inside a radiator, there is the world's most awkward family dinner with a bleeding chicken, and there is a darkly humorous factory scene that gave the film its name. Needless to say, Eraserhead is a strange film that does not quite resemble anything else that I have seen.There are two aspects that really tie the film together and make it into a true masterpiece. Firstly, David Lynch's direction is superb, not only for a debut but compared to any film. The droning score matches the abandoned settings perfectly, while the magnificent lighting gives every scene a certain mysterious aura and is also stunning to look at. All these things blend together so well, creating a singular atmosphere unmatched in his later works. Secondly, Jack Nance deserves much more praise than he gets for his role. Some might say that it is a one note performance, but even if that were true, he plays it to perfection. However, I think he displays a wide array of emotions using nothing but his facial expressions.Stanley Kubrick allegedly showed this film to the cast in The Shining in order to set them into the right mood, and it is easy to see why. Eraserhead is one of the most original films ever, and every bit as frightening as The Shining.",Eraserhead
162,bedazzle,"bliss, interpretation",10,12 June 2001,"I was very hesitant to see this movie for fear that it would ruin my high regard for Mr. Lynch. Gladly, my anxieties were unwarranted. I'd have to rank this movie as Lynch's second most thought out - and therefore second best according to me - behind 'Lost Highway.' If you are a fan of Lynch, enjoyed running the 'Lost Highway' maze, or enjoy symbolism and artistic imaging, you would definitely enjoy this movie. But, sadly it will probably be hard to find. I ended up driving a total of 3 hours in renting this movie, but found it to be completely worth the effort.
I have a 3 page interpretation of this movie for anyone interested. I think I've taken account for everything (It should be recognized that everything plays its part in the film. Some scenes may appear long and lacking dialogue, but it is done like this for a purpose. There are enough prompts to thought that you will not be bored unless you find thinking boring.) and it all fits together into a general theme.",Eraserhead
163,gsh999,Not really very entertaining.,4,3 January 2008,"I have a couple college degrees but none of them are in film making. I enjoy movies, mostly horror and sci-fi, but movies of all genres. I enjoyed Blue Velvet because there was an understandable story but that element is completely lacking in Eraserhead. OK, so it's an art film but one that lasts for 90 minutes and doesn't really entertain. The movie starts with a fetus-like thing apparently being extracted from the title character and later the character becomes a spouse and the father of a mutant baby. The movie apparently invokes fatherhood, abortion, marriage in a highly repulsive manner. Lynch is apparently disgusted with the prospect of fatherhood or the prospect of forced fatherhood. Eraserhead's baby is a wailing, grotesque monster so I think that's a fair conclusion. Like many art movies, this is not a flick for entertainment. It's a movie to analyze the mind of David Lynch. Weird, gory, grotesque but not necessarily entertainment. 4/10",Eraserhead

The film is slightly important because of its old age but it's no more than a 6/10 today mainly because there is no much of a movie here, there's mainly dark imagery that could be done and done in 30 minutes at most, so you could give it a 7/10 for the historical importance it has but it should not get more, because it's not good to encourage empty stories.",Eraserhead
165,mrspasm,What The Balls!!?,1,11 June 2009,"It's black and white. 2. There are no subtitles. 3. It makes no sense! What we have here is a pile of drunk and drugged art students who found an old camera behind a dumpster and decided to make a film before they passed out. Want to see little girls hiding inside radiators with their mouths filled with golf balls? Want to see her dance? Want to see a little odd chap with funny hair stand in the dark, in the same place without moving for 10 minutes while the camera zooms in and out of his face? This wouldn't be so bad except his expression stays the same- he looks like he has soiled himself and doesn't want Mr Lynch to know. But Mr Lynch does know, and there is a game of wits to see who breaks first.The madness continues- the man who may or may not be married to one, none, or two women is disturbed to learn that he is a father. Of course, these being drunk and drugged hippy art students- the baby is a fish! And not even something pretty like a Salmon, no, this looks like it has been swimming in a toilet all its life. The girl dances in the radiator for a while, the man soils himself again, and the film ends. What was the point? I'm sure the director was making some sort of extraordinarily intelligent and important point about War or George Bush or something, but all I got from it was a sick feeling. I had to skip through all the moments where nothing happens (most of the film) wishing that the man would go crazy and shoot someone, or at least the fish would turn evil and try to eat someone. I like films where lots of things happen, explosions and fights and fast stuff. Nothing of the sort happens here.This is like picking up a comic only to find that all the pages are black and white, with no pictures or words or X-Men. Luckily no-one has ever heard of this movie. Maybe I'll give it to that fool Brendan who lives on my street and he can watch it and self combust. Knowing him though, he'll probably love it. Fool. This film is not right. It is the product of a disturbed mind. It's like reaching into your wallet and rather than extracting 5 bucks, you pull out 2 burnt sausages. Half eaten.Best Bit: When it ended and I threw it out the window and I watched some A-Team instead. It took at least until halfway through the 3rd episode till I felt clean again. It was the one where two fire stations are fighting each other for power and Decker is replaced by Briggs (who himself is re-replaced and vanishes mysteriously)",Eraserhead
166,cheathamg,Genius or Just Plain Strange?,6,22 June 2006,"I was scanning through the other commentaries on this film and I noticed that most of them used either the word ""genius"" or the phrase ""work of art"" in reference to Mr. Lynch's work. If we define genius as an unusually powerful capacity for doing original, inventive work, then we must decide whether or not this film meets that criteria. It is unusual, there's no denying that. If by powerful you mean that it stirs the emotions, and we are discussing a piece of work in an art form and the measurement of whether or not something is a work of art is if it affects the emotions, then yes, it is powerful. Emotions can be affected in a positive or a negative manner by a work of art. The imagery in this film is dark and disturbing. It is an experimental film, which tends to make one think of it as original and inventive. It could easily be said that it is not, in that dark, spooky films about grotesques have been made almost from the beginning of movies. But just because a certain type of film has been made before doesn't detract from the quality of the film under discussion. The real issue here is whether or not Mr. Lynch's work can stand as an organic whole. This is where I think it begins to get into trouble. Mr. Lynch has filled the film with images that probably mean something to him. However he doesn't communicate that meaning to his audience except for an overall feeling of repugnance and dread. If we go back to the concept that a work of art's primary function is to communicate an emotion, that perhaps that is enough. However, a film, and this one is no exception, is a narrative. Narratives are supposed to communicate ideas. They tell stories. This film tells a story, but the characters are doing things, and events are happening that don't make any sense. Mr. Lynch probably knows what's going on but he doesn't share that knowledge with the audience. The film is filled with powerful images but they don't coalesce into a coherent story. There is no why and wherefore. I'm sure many people will say that a work of genius doesn't have to explain itself. It just is. That's a point of view, but most people require some sort of meaning in order to derive enjoyment from a film. Is mood enough of a meaning to make people want to sit through a movie?",Eraserhead

Up until about a month ago, I had never heard of this movie, but a friend recommended it, telling me that it was extremely f***ed up, which is typically what I go for. The soundtrack was the first thing that really tipped me off that 'Eraserhead' was going to be a different experience of a film. The harsh noisescapes permeating the background at nearly all times is cacophonous, and the black and white images make it seem like a really long music video for a modern day noise artist. David Lynch did the music himself, which I thought was really great.The film at times reminded me of the silent classic 'Nosferatu' with all those eerie shots of Jack Nance reminiscing Count Orlok. I read here on IMDb that Stanley Kubrick would make the cast of 'The Shining' view 'Eraserhead' in an attempt to get them in the right frame of mind that Kubrick wanted, and I can definitely see that.My initial thought interpreting the ""meaning"" of the film, and I use the word ""meaning"" lightly, was that the entire thing was just one long nightmare, but who can say for sure? All in all, 'Eraserhead' definitely demands multiple viewings. Highly recommended.ERASERHEAD ----- 9/10",Eraserhead

Highest compliments to the unbelievably chosen shots, cinematography, and superior sound design. These mesh to create a audio-visual fusion that is nearly unparalleled in all my years of movie watching. Stylistically, it's a masterpiece.But your guess is no better than mine as to what the story resembles. A mentally ill father pushed past the brink of sanity? A commentary on general societal perceptions surrounding sex? What should be said is that it contains purely terrifying, nightmarish imagery and it will lodge itself in the pools of your mind for long to come.Amazing horror, sure. But I can't rate it very much for any personal connections I might have to the film. And that removes an essential part of a film, identification with characters or a message, et all.

I have seen a large number of weird/disturbing/dark movies...but I have to admit in all honesty...NEVER BEFORE have I seen anything quite like this..anything so bizarre and otherworldy....! I have been a David Lynch fan ever since I came across Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive (2 of my most favourite movies) and I had heard/read a lot about his first full-length feature, Eraserhead, but had never come across a decent copy to watch.And finally I found it!! And the experience was.....mindblowing!! (although that word won't do complete justice to how I felt as I watched it.)

171,RaiderJack,Truly Twisted - I LOVED it!!!,7,3 February 2012,"I finally got a chance to view this much-hyped, forever-talked about freak fest known as Eraserhead by David Lynch.First and foremost, I am QUITE sure that subsequent viewings will find me liking this movie more and more. To date I have only seen it once. I KNEW I would have to write a review and my thoughts about it were all over the place - I was disgusted, frightened, amazed, laughed like hell but ultimately was THOROUGHLY entertained.Secondly, I had to come up with a plot line to couch a review in. After only one viewing that seems virtually impossible. Hello folks, this is a David Lynch film - plot is ENTIRELY too restrictive a concept. Suffice it to say, it deals with loneliness, insecurity, frustration, a horny mother, an endlessly smoking grandmother, a hapless father, a mysterious Lady of the Evening, and a VERY disturbing baby.Lastly, pegging it as merely ""different"" is a masterpiece of understatement and for a directorial debut is MOST unforgettable. Actually, I have come to like most, if not all of Lynch's work because it was NEVER commonplace, trite or contrived. Lynch is behind such fascinations as ""Lost Highway,"" ""Blue Velvet,"" ""Wild At Heart,"" and, of course, ""Twin Peaks."" My ultimate justification is that David Lynch and I share a birthday which probably explains a lot.Nonetheless, I most certainly recommend.",Eraserhead
172,roystephen-81252,A jaw-dropping nightmare,8,24 February 2016,"David Lynch's feature film debut is a genuinely spine-chilling, black-and-white, surrealistic nightmare. All common traits and recurring themes of his films are already present here, from repressed fears and sexuality to mental and physical disfiguration, from split personality to blurring lines between real and unreal / conscious and subconscious, from the use of slow, sinister panning and zooming to the use of otherworldly music and an eerie, unnerving soundscape. The latter, consisting mainly of low-frequency hum and other background noises, will definitely haunt you for a long time.It is grotesque and repulsive, and although it does have a bizarre story, it lacks a real narrative thread. Yet, at the same time, it pulls the viewer into the black pit of the subconscious with an irresistible force. I must admit, I couldn't really remember any of the story even right after I saw the film. I just sat there dumbfounded, mouth hanging open.It is the least accessible movie in Lynch's catalogue, but it is probably the most powerful, and certainly the most terrifying one. One of the scariest films I have ever seen. It doesn't belong to the horror genre any more than Bunuel's surrealist vision Un Chien Andalou, but it is more frightening than 99% of any horror films ever produced.",Eraserhead
173,lucianomarzo92,Eraserhead,5,2 October 2009,"I just saw Eraserhead a week or two ago. I was very impressed. I had heard about the movie a while before then, but didn't get interested in it watching until recently. A friend mentioned having watched it to me, so I decided to watch it. It was like nothing I had ever seen. It was also the strangest movie I have ever seen, yet one of the most original. I admire David Lynch for this achievement.While looking on IMDb I noticed that the opinions on this film were mixed, ranging from ""a masterpiece,"" to ""a waste of time, and boring."" It could indeed be argued that Eraserhead is a masterpiece. Many reviewers said the movie was hard to understand, or that it had no plot, or that it didn't make any sense. I think the film will make sense, if you pay attention to it closely and analyze it.That's the thing about Eraserhead; unlike almost any other movie, it challenges the comprehension of the viewer. There were a few very puzzling scenes but apart from that I understood Eraserhead. I think these peculiar scenes, that leave the viewer scratching his head, are best how they are. Not everything in this movie is supposed to make sense, and some of it isn't going to; its going to weird you out. I mean, a lot of movies have weird scenes. Some have very weird scenes.Eraserhead takes the cake. It's just downright weird. A lot of scenes may be disturbing, but if a weird scene make no sense, it's going to be even more disturbing. That's part of what I liked about Eraserhead. I also believe the film does have a plot, and a pretty good one. It is just an abstract one. The plot of an abstract film is going to be very different from that of a normal film; viewers should understand this. Just because a plot is different or odd, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.The film does start off very slow, but it picks up after that and delves into the story of the movie. I also noticed that some reviewers said that this movie is better if you don't classify it as a movie but instead as ""art"". Well, I wouldn't go that far. No matter what you call it, it's still a movie. Now, for the story of Eraserhead. Eraserhead is primarily a surreal tale of a taciturn man living in an apartment in a barren town, who is coping with bad insomnia one night, because of his newly born mutant baby, and his cumbersome wife.Now for how he got in these circumstances, he usually keeps to himself, but he is invited to a dinner. He decides to attend this dinner, where he meets some friends. He eats with about four other people. It is there that he finds he has impregnated one of them, and she has delivered the baby. He is also informed that the baby is premature, which is presumably why it is mutant. He experiences a lot of visions during this night. I call them visions, but some could just be nightmares. Others are supposedly happening in real life.It is in these scenes, where the viewers may find themselves lost. It's really not that difficult to tell which is which though. Eraserhead does start off very slowly, but it gets better and better. I would recommend it, if you are interested. I would not recommend this movie to someone just because you are a horror movie fan; however. Eraserhead is sometimes classified as a ""surreal horror,"" which is true, but in this case a surreal horror is a completely different animal from a horror. I am myself a horror fan, who liked this movie, but I think part of that is because I really like surrealism. I can see a lot of horror fans disliking it. Eraserhead is a very good film for its genre. I would recommend it to any one who likes surrealism.",Eraserhead

I would need to watch it several more times to try & unpack the symbolism to its full extent, but if I'm following Lynch I think its a visualization of a nightmare, or his deep impressions of what oppresses him in life. The movie is commendable for its originality, its creepy atmospheric soundtrack, its imagery & its ability to capture that same inescapable ""doomy"" feeling you have in a nightmare. The reason this won't won't go on my favorites list is because the lingering impression I have makes me feel yucky inside. My favorite artsy movies are ones that leave me feeling inspired & hopeful, not like Eraserhead which makes wake up out of this nightmare.",Eraserhead
175,Dark Eye,It's just like going to an art museum!,10,28 April 2001,"First of all, there are many pretentious arty-farty films out there that I loathe.  Why?  Some directors are too self-indulgent and beat around their own bush, they forgot that they have audiences to manipulate.  I have no idea why I fell asleep watching Fellini's movies, but upon watching Eraserhead, man ... I was riveted from the beginning until the very end. Although this movie has no plot whatsoever, it has to be one of the most disturbing film I have ever seen.  Every scene is a bleak depiction of horrible nightmares, and there is nothing the main character can do about escaping it.  Feelings of uneasiness came to me when I saw the ""baby"" and the psychological torture it plays on my head.  Whatever it was, I feel what the main character feels.  David Lynch has managed to string up a series of powerful images, which I really appreciated.  A very, very uncanny film, very surreal, very mysterious, and no, it's NOT very strange at all!",Eraserhead

177,terraplane,"A horrific, unsettling, unique masterpiece with no comparison.",10,22 March 2000,"This is not a movie.This is a download direct from David Lynch's troubled mind.This is an impossible film to describe, it has no comparison that I've ever seen except perhaps ""Un Chien Andalou"". Eraserhead is an extremely disturbing experience that holds your attention with a horrific fascination, even though you know you don't like what you see. There are things that happen in this film that make no sense until you begin to recall your own dreams, and then you wish you hadn't made sense of it because now you won't be able to get the images out of your head. There are moments of very, very black humour ( the chicken dinner comes to mind )and moments of very strange sexuality but the overall feeling is of alienation and cruelty. The final part of this nightmare, if you make it that far, is so tragically cruel that those not in possesion of a strong stomach may find themselves feeling disturbed, queasy and almost certainly angry. It has been said that David Lynch made this movie as a reaction to his child being born with a deformed foot. If that's true then he has succeeded in making us share in his pain and suffering with Eraserhead. See this film because it truly is a unique experience but be warned, it really is a disturbing experience that will stay in your head for a long, long time.",Eraserhead

It's a very hard film to sit through because it's just too bizarre and it doesn't make any sense! I think David Lynch had a nightmare one night and decided to put that nightmare onto film.............. this being the result!!! I love horror movies, i love bizarre movies too, but i didn't enjoy Eraserhead unfortunately.Most people will have trouble watching this to the end, most casual movie watchers will almost certainly switch off after 10 minutes or so! But it's a cult classic, but thats because it's one of a kind, most people who are fans of this movie, are fans of David Lynch.

It is like a pollock painting in that it appears to be random things just thrown together with no forethought or reason or big picture in mind. It has some neat special effects but over all it is a movie from 1977 that has worse production quality than some tv series from the early 1950s. It is a ""horror"" movie that at an hour and half long is relatively short compared to some during which I struggled to stay awake, ignore the tag line there is no nightmare there isn't much of anything to this movie.",Eraserhead

When we see a magic trick, our brains scramble for an explanation before shutting down metaphorically and thats where the amazement comes from, it comes from not being able to find an explanation for what you just saw. Eraserhead is a magic trick, you watch it and, while you maybe have a small idea of what was going, your brain just goes blank and you accept what you have just seen cannot be explainedYes, just like everyone else, I have my own 2 or 3 theories on what the film is about but I see no point in telling them to you. You will watch the film and you will have your own ideas. The film isn't even a film, its an experience, like viewing a painting. There is no story to a painting, the viewer simply constructs a story, a meaning to go along with the painting, their own little interpretation of what it means. Exactly like Eraserhead.

181,silentcheesedude,Can't get Eraserhead out of my mind,9,17 May 2009,"I first saw this with a friend who, sadly, is no longer with us. He loved the eccentric, the unusual. Every time I watch or think about the movie Eraserhead, I can hear him saying ""This is going to just blow your mind!"" And that it did. I can not compare this movie to anything else out there. Sure, I have seen some art movies that drag you into some strange territory never brought by regular Hollywood movies, but this... this was so different. Are you supposed to be watching a story with a beginning and an end, or is this just a day or two of the life of a man? Is he crazy, or is everyone else? Does the word crazy even apply here, and if not, what does? A regular review cannot suffice in even attempting to describe the story. Surly, there have been several sites online that have gone through pages of attempting to describe what goes on.I can tell you that Henry gets his girlfriend pregnant, and that the baby is the scariest looking creature ever to come out of a human body. But if I tell you about the lady that lives in the radiator, the (what I call) floating man, & the creepy parents, we are going to disagree in what we think we see. For example, I saw a world where nothing was working out for Henry, and that Earth, if that is the planet he is on, hates him. Stepping in a puddle, having an elevator disagree with his presence, and generally being the cause of everyone's trouble gives me the feeling that poor Henry has bad karma issues. Someone else will see a nightmare. Or perhaps Henry is in hell, custom made for him. But is it really depressing? Or is that just the way I was seeing it? It's worth detaching yourself a bit and feel the movie's dreamy state set in your brain for a while. Rather then analyzing everything, allow it to seep in and ""haunt"" you for the rest of your life.I can continue telling you all kinds of things that happen, or I think happened, such as adultery, murder, & suicide, but you probably won't find all of these things in the movie. You may find that adultery is just a fantasy, murder is actually love, and suicide is an awakening. Or none of these things. Or something different.Regardless, you must see Eraserhead. It's a film that begs conversation after you see it, but that's just what I thought. To someone else, this may be over-indulgence, egotism by David Lynch, a weird movie that must be forgotten to others, and to a select few, the most imaginative, visually stunning work of art on film.",Eraserhead
182,soymilk,One of the most profoundly paradoxical movies of all time,9,8 January 2005,"And that paradox is to how a movie as outwardly grotesque and macabre as this one should prove so enigmatic and alluring at the same time.Very recently, my brother and I decided to go out and rent 'Eraserhead', having been tipped off on numerous occasions that it was positively THE weirdest film we were ever going to see  a film so mind-blowingly bizarre even by David Lynch standards that it makes his more recent workings (even 'Mulholland Dr') look like straightforward conventional films in comparison. Well, it had quite a reputation to live up to there, and I can safely say it lived up to it. It lived up to it and then some.'Eraserhead' isn't merely weird  it's also chilling, ominous, dark, sinister and certainly not for the squeamishor at least anyone likely to be intimidated by the sight of miniature roast chickens that writhe and bleed, women with monstrously puffy cheeks, overgrown worms, umbilical cords, dodgy pencil factories, and 'premature babies' that come up in boils and resemble a misshapen hybrid of a rubbery human embryo and ET. It combines its assortment of creepy and fantastical elements in a way that steers clear of the run-of-the-mill trippy and focuses instead on capturing the actual feel of a string of nightmares. As our protagonist 'Henry' drifts in and out of sleep, he experiences a series of horrific visions which presumably embody his waking fears and concerns. But just what exactly are these fears and concerns? Is it death he's so afraid of, or just fatherhood? And just where in this film do the nightmares stop and reality begin? These are all questions which arise throughout the picture and, as we've long since come to expect with the wily David Lynch, go completely unanswered. As per usual it's up to us, the plucky viewers, to draw our own conclusions. I have my theories on a lot of it, but there's probably an infinite number of interpretations out there somewhere.Whatever you choose to make of it in the end, it can't be denied that 'Eraserhead' is a brilliantly-made film, and it's no surprise to me that it found its cult appreciation soon enough  even the more intense moments where the imagery completely repulsed me, I found it impossible to turn away. What makes it so effective comes largely down to its meticulous scenery and camera-work  a slick combination of b/w shooting and murky, run-down interior settings that produce a world so bleak and colourless that escape and revival seem totally impossible. Furthermore, Henry's stunted interaction with the rest of the cast can't help but drag you even closer in. Often when they're looking at him, thanks to the positioning of camera angles, they appear to be staring directly at the viewer, or just past them, grinning menacingly or chanting ominous phrases like ""In Heaven, everything is fine."" We may never fully understand Henry as a character, but thanks to these technical aspects we're almost forced to feel an affinity with him.If you haven't yet seen 'Eraserhead', and think you can handle the unease and grotesquery, then I'd strongly recommend it. It's one of those films that you may not even necessarily like as such, but still have to acknowledge what a great piece of craftsmanship it is in a league of its own  a technical masterpiece that makes the most of its budget and limitations, generating exactly the unsettling atmosphere it aims for, and one of the most unique and challenging viewing experiences I've ever come across. What are the odds that you'll ever see another movie even remotely like this one? Grade: A",Eraserhead
183,DrPhibes1964,In Heaven Everything Is Fine,10,19 November 2020,"Nothing was ever quite the same after the seeing Eraserhead for the first time. It was a VHS rental from a local video store and not the best format to view the film. It was very dark and many details were lost and would be much clearer when I got the DVD version initially available on David Lynch's website. For the first I saw tiny details and textures that bring this nightmare world to life. Until that first viewing I had only read a few articles and saw a handful of photographs, a couple of the ""baby"". It became something of an obsession to see this film. It did not disappoint and regard Eraserhead to be one of the most original American film ever made. It had no antecedents or category. It is frequently listed under horror. This is somewhat misleading and is bound to puzzle and irritate the average gorehound. It is not horror but has certain elements of the genre.From the opening image of Henry, the film's protagonist, it is obvious that we are not in the ""real world"". This is a dark and troubled world within the mind of Henry Spencer. Perhaps he doesn't even look like this in his waking life and this is a distorted dream image of himself. If seen as a nightmare everything is a dark reflection of Henry's waking life. A person in throes of a very high fever might conjure up some images, exaggerated beyond comprehension but still has some core logic ,even if it is not apparent to the dreamer at the time. The foetus being extracted from Henry's mouth suggests a birth, perhaps that he is a collaborator of his own miseries. The man with the horribly scarred body pulling the levers might be a person who is causing a lot of suffering and now assists with the activation of this nightmare world.Henry lives in a desolate wasteland that looks like the landscape after some apocalyptic event. He works at a printing factory . He lives in a tiny apartment which will shortly be invaded by his girlfriend Mary whom has just given birth to a mutated baby. It can be best described as E. T. if all of its limbs had been removed. It is a truly remarkable effect. Lynch has refused to divulge any details about it was created. There has been speculation that it might be a sheep calf. The articulation of its face and eyes makes this creature more real than any monster in movie history. One feels a mixture of sympathy and loathing for it. When Mary leaves him one stormy night the baby becomes ill. It is a truly horrific moment but Henry, the devoted father, tends to it and sits up with it. His escape from this nightmare world is a woman who performs a little dance on a stage located behind the radiator. She is the one hopeful character in the film.The film is open to numerous interpretations. Lynch refuses to disclose his own. He has declared it to be his ""most spiritual"" film but will not elaborate on this idea. He wants the viewer to arrive at their own interpretation. He has never done a commentary track for any of his films. On the DVD there is a special feature where he give anecdotal stories about the making of the film but never goes any deeper. He allows the film to stand on its own.The most obvious interpretation is that it is the nightmare of a man totally unprepared for married life and fatherhood. In this nightmare he has turned his wife and child into freaks to validate the anxiety they are inflicting upon him. Perhaps the woman behind the radiator is a woman he is either having an affair with and feels he belongs with her. Another possibility is that this is nightmare of a man who has just killed his wife and child and in his guilt has turned them into monsters in order to lessen the trauma of his act. But I'm sure that there are many other interpretations that are just as valid. The film is a cinematic Rorschach test that demands that the viewer engage with the story and the characters. Like most David Lynch films there is seldom easy answers and he makes watching them into something more than sitting passively in a dark theatre.",Eraserhead

185,AdFin,To spend a day in the mind of David Lynch,10,6 January 2002,"I'm at odds think of any other film that has taken on the narrative structure of a dream and managed to pull it off, well Lynch has made the first cinematic ""dream"", or should that be nightmare? Eraserhead's best feature is that it makes no sense, now I'm aware of the contradictory nature of that statement, as I have already belittled and criticized such other films as Fellini's Satyricon and Bergman's Persona for the same thing, but in Eraserhead it really doesn't matter in the slightest. The film follows a young man named Henry Spencer (a bizarrely coiffed Jack Nance) and his girlfriend Mary X. The fist part of the film shows Henry mooching around the dilapidated industrial bombsight that seems to be the earth before going back home to his apartment to sit on his bed and stare into his radiator? (Like I said the film makes no sense). But the questions it raises makes the film, you can try and interpret the images as much as you want, but only Lynch will ever know what the film is about.After the most disturbing ""meeting you're partner's family"" dinner scene ever committed to celluloid we find out that Henry has fathered a child with the spasmodic, twitchy Mary, and pretty soon Mom and Dad have made sure that Mary and ""child"" are living ""happily"" ever after with Henry. This being David Lynch of course, a man not know for his promotions of family values, happiness is something Henry can only dream of. This vision of happiness comes in the form of a small hamster-cheeked woman who lives in the radiator? (Once again, it makes no sense) She sings to Henry, with a song that can only be interpreted as a cry for suicide (In Heaven everything is Fine) and it's not long before Henry is having visions of his head falling off and being made into an eraser tip for pencils.Lynch takes the ordinary and the mundane, and mixes it with a stunning sense of avant gardsim; his interpretations of commitment, sex and childbirth are all made clear. The child that Henry fathers is no real child, but a deformed slug, constantly crying and screaming until he has successfully driven Mary back to her parents. In one scene towards the end, Henry is turned away by the mysterious ""Woman across the Hall"", he watches through the keyhole as she cavorts with a balding, middle-aged man, until his baby begins laughing at him. Eraserhead is a bleak and gloomy film that one must see at least five (?) times before the initial shock of the film's surrealism finally is erased, composed in constant darkness, with a soundtrack that has a unvarying hum of industrial machinery. I've spent quite a bit of my comment room trying to gather my thoughts about it, and I'm still getting new ideas as to ""what it's all about"" a good three years after first seeing the film, for that it receives a 10/10",Eraserhead
186,SweetWilliam63,E.T. We'll Phone You,2,4 December 2018,"'Eraserhead' has an audience rating of 81 percent on 'Rotten Tomatoes'. (I strongly suspect this is the same eight-one percent who said they read 'War & Peace' cover to cover but really just made it through the first forty-five minutes of the movie.) Not unlike politics today, 'Eraserhead' seperates people into three distinct categories. There is ""us"", those who see this for what it is (a ridiculous vanity project that is boring and psuedo pedantic); ""them"", the small cult following of cinephiles convinced of their elevated powers of discernment and ""everyone else"", those who recognize the title, the hair and have a vague idea of it's cultural relevance but don't care much beyond that. Each curious about the other but also relieved that they are better off where they are. Perhaps, we can all agree that what explains any phenomena surrounding this movie is that it was the early work of David Lynch, American filmmaker, painter, musician, photographer and strangeling thought by many on all sides to be a significant director of his time for such mainstream successes as 'The Elephant Man', 'Blue Velvet' and 'Mulholland Drive' and, of course, there is 'Twin Peaks'. Believe me, without that filmography this movie is 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' with admittedly, better production values. While I am confident most of you will fall into the ""Us"" category, it is a free country after all, and to each his or her or their own as the case may be. (Hey, you're reading the review of a guy who listed ""Hello Down There"" on his list of '100 Greatest Movies Of All Times'. What do I know?) I suggest that if you do see 'Eraserhead' you watch it in the relative captivity of a theatre with someone you may be falling in love with as seeing this through a neurochemical lens of oxytocin and dopamine may vary your opinion and or tolerance of what is most commonly referred to as an ""unconventional"" film.

Certainly, it's hard to watch in places (Laurel Near's facial deformity is particularly repugnant, as is the sequence where Charlotte Stewart rubs her eye), but the rawness of the images make it compulsive viewing. How sad that Lynch couldn't match this in anything he's done subsequently (Twin Peaks, which I simply adore, still can't come up to the same standard).Here's an interesting thing to try: go and get a recording - any one - of Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony, and listen to it all the way through.

This is indeed one of the icons of cult movie making and one of my top 10.  The problem is that, it is almost unwatchable on first viewing.  It took me three or four tries to get through the entire movie back in the early 80s. Also, I would not recommend anything except an excellent reproduction such as the Lynch DVD in order to make out all the details in the sometimes grainy B&W.  Thus rentals don't work out here.  If you are a committed fan of unusual films, give it a try.  What is the allure of this film?  First, it's dreamlike quality.  Second, Jack Nance's performance as the main character Henry.  Third, Henry's interaction with the ""baby"", which moves from puzzlement to annoyance, then fear and finally extreme hatred.  Upon multiple viewings, it does start to exhibit its own logic, but insisting on this is like saying that a dream is only interesting if it makes sense.  Is it entertaining?  Yes, I reached that point somewhere around the 10th to 15th viewing.  This is a bit of a commitment.

What disappointed me, was that Eraserhead is a film which appears to be weird simply for the sake of being weird. What I really like about this film, is that everything is down to your own interpretation and Lynch directs you to make a decision rather than to simply think what he thinks.This film relies almost solely on imagery, especially considering the acting is pretty poor. Some images in the film are very disturbing and Lynch definitely achieves his goal of disgusting the audience. The first sight of the deformed baby is genuinely shocking and considering this film was on a near zero budget, shows the talent of Lynch as a creative visionary. Lynch is an artist as well as a film maker and Eraserhead is a definite cross over between film and art.Perfectly accompanying the images are a variety of industrial noises and sounds of extreme weather. This gives a wonderful sense of your head being pounded, giving the audience an idea of how John Nance's character is feeling.By no means great, Eraserhead is definitely not for people simply looking to be entertained and is mostly suited to hardcore Lynch fans.",Eraserhead

Iwould say this is just as good as Mulholland Drive, even thought I find that film kind of overrated. My second David Lynch film, and its even stranger than the first. First of all I wanna say that this movie was boring and one of the single most twsited hard-to-understand films I've ever come across. BUT... this is not a bad thing. If someone were to ask me ""what is a movie that would genuinely SCARE me? I'm tired of all these mainstream horror movies not scaring me."" One of like 5 recommendations would be Eraserhead. This psychologically destroyed my brain. Crazy how a $10k black and white movie that nobody understands from 1977 can be scarier than a multi-million dollar mainstream ""horror"" movie.So from what I understand this film is trying to explore the horrors of becoming a new parent. These horrors are truly things that every man and woman experience (if they are about to have a kid that is) in their lifetime. Their worries are off the charts and it can cause constant stress. I believe that may be what happened to our main character here. Honestly though, I could have that completely wrong, but who cares. Everything that happened in this film may be an interpretation of what is happening inside Henry's head, all caused by the stress of having a new child. There are still many moments and things I don't understand about this film, so I'll have to watch a few videos on it to grasp it better.

You'll really, really love it, or you'll really, really, and I mean, really, hate it.""Love"" might not be the right word.  I consider it an amazing film, but this is not a movie that one can exactly love.  ERASERHEAD creeps into you and does damage to you; the people who hate it don't just indifferently dislike it.  They genuinely resent this movie.  I saw one comment (which I feel safe in quoting, since many others will say this as well) which said that two hours of their life had been wasted on this film and they wanted it back.  I smiled in recognition, since a friend of mine had said exactly the same thing after watching it several years ago.As a personal opinion let me say that it is a worthy heir to the surrealist films of Dali and Bunuel, and has a focused intensity that even their collaborative films lacked.  (This is the purest, most focused work Lynch has done.  He has interesting passages in all of his films, but overall only BLUE VELVET comes close.)There's no point trying to intrigue anyone into watching this movie, so let me just say that you should be prepared for a slowly-paced film, that the black-and-white photography is inarguably beautiful, that the imagery is (genuinely; I can't think of another live-action film like it) unique, that the sounds are very unsettling, and that no matter what you think of it, you'll always remember it.

195,phatdan,Macabre Visions of Propaganda,7,27 May 2007,"Tennessee Williams, apparently antagonistic towards some Christian orthodoxy, contrived scenarios that refuted the justness of legalistic morality. Who can be sympathetic to a bigoted, wife beating husband, and unsympathetic to his victimized wife who falls for the decency of a vagabond with whom she eventually commits adultery?(Orpheus Descending). A presumed moral paradox is established, but, even the more sanctimonious should accept her infidelity. It has been written that we should. So it is with Eraserhead. Are there valid reasons for infanticide? For abortion? Perhaps. But Lynch's gun is loaded with William's ammunition: A contrived depiction of a very bleak reality. God is presented, grinding the wheel of random predetermination, Mother Nature is transfigured into beautiful grotesqueness, and life itself is shown as a hideously deformed baby, perhaps half worm, half human. Who cares? Existence is so coldly stark in Lynch's eyes that any deformation would allow itself. Perhaps the worm unnervingly gives light to his attitude towards humanity.",Eraserhead
196,anthonymora2,Eraserhead,9,26 April 2014,"Strange, that was the word that described this entire movie to me. Once again, a movie has gripped me with it's slimy, creepy hands and once again a movie has taken me on a pure cinematic journey, even though that journey was an hour and a half of pure insanity. Movies like these are special to me because they are pretty much open for interpretation. A plot or story might be hidden somewhere in the film, however Director David Lynch has crafted a movie where the meaning can really be up to you and what you make it out to be. This is what I think the movie is about. Henry, a man of very small and little words makes a trip his girlfriend Charlotte's house. It seems that aren't the peachiest of couples, and to make it worst, on this visit, his girlfriend and her disturbingly strange family inform Henry that he and Charlotte have conceived a child. But not just any child, a very premature baby. The rest of the straight story is of Henry and Charlotte trying to live with this forever crying baby and keep their sanity. The last perhaps 30 minutes of the movie is nothing but surreal and haunting images and scenes. If the viewer wasn't already turned by the already hypnagogic scenes with Charlotte's family, the final parts, which include a big cheeked songstress living in Henry's radiator, giant sperm like things, and Henry taking a pair of scissors to the baby. I really dig this movie, the odd, dark, eerie black and white cinematography; it fit well with the industrious setting shown. There's too much too say the look of this movie, the pipes that run through and around Charlotte's home, the stage where the Radiator Girl sings my new favorite tune ""In Heaven Everything is Fine"", and Henry's small apartment which reminds me of an insane asylum prison cell. There isn't much in the acting area; there's very little dialog. The actor who played Charlotte's father was a stand out as was the mother, they both boosted the insanity a bit. This is a technically impressive film; it's almost forty years old and the practical effects used throughout were very compelling. The movie may come off as too odd and artsy to most; there isn't a traditional story telling movie here. At some points I would agree. Being that this movie is seen by many as a horror movie, I would've liked to see a tiny bit more of a horror story with the movie, but with my taste in strange cinema, this was visually horrifying enough for me that it really was quite scary.",Eraserhead
197,heywood100,"I Don't ""Get"" It, But I Love It",10,28 January 2003,"I have to admit that when reading the user comments of films I like, I only read the negative ones. I already like the film, so there's no real reason to read other people saying they liked it. I just want to know why people don't like the film. And there's a lot of people that don't like this film (particularly the guy who's written about seven paragraphs explaining why)Their argument seems to be that only pretentious, arty people with goatees enjoy this, and even then it's only because they feel they have to or they're not smart. Although that may be the case in some instances, I don't think it applies to everyone. I don't ""get"" this movie, but I love it. It's mesmerising.David Lynch himself often says that his movies have no deeper meanings. That's a bit of a lie. There are infinite deeper meanings, so everyone can end up with a completely different interpretation of what they've seen. Just because something means nothing to one person, it could explain the essence of the whole film to another one.But the real reason for writing this review is to say why I loved Eraserhead. I love it because I find it hypnotising. It probably helps if you like the art of H.R.Giger (the designer on Alien), or the strange pictures inside early R.E.M. albums, because this film appeals largely on a visual and aural basis. The world in this film is a very dark and despairing place, all derelict buildings and industrial noises. It's like a horrible nightmare to begin with, but then you see the baby...Essentially, I think you already know if you're going to like this film or not. If you've taken the trouble to actually search for Eraserhead and read reviews before you've seen it, then it's worth a look. If you've accidentally stumbled onto this while searching for Eraser, then don't bother. It really is the ultimate love it or hate it film, as you can probably tell from the reviews that are all calling it the best or worst film ever made. So I'll nail my colours to the mast and say:THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER.",Eraserhead
198,Hairy_Lime,"A little tale, with a lesson",1,11 March 2004,"So, I was in college at the time, see, and a few of my rather mix and match friends were sitting around my dorm room and for the lack of anything better to do, we decided to catch one of the movies playing on campus.  The movie we chose to see was Eraserhead.  We made it through the movie all right, but as we left one friend exclaimed, ""That was the worst movie I have ever seen!""  ""Me too!"" said a second, and one by one, we all jumped in with the same verdict: Eraserhead was the worst, vilest, boringest piece of crap any of us had ever seen.But the story does not end there.  Some weeks later, one of that set of friends noted, ""Hey, remember that Eraserhead movie?  That scene with the girl in the radiator?  Well maybe..."" and off she went on an interpretive spree.  And later, another friend found himself recalling the film, and a scene, and what he felt it might of meant, and another and another... Until we finally realized that the movie was not bad; we were a bad audience. We had not captured and seen the quality of the movie, the ideas being expressed, the depth of the allegory, and stuff.  The next year, the movie came around on campus again.  The same group, minus one who had graduated, armed with our prior viewing experience, ready to meet the director on his own terms, marched to the on campus theater to see it again.  The result?Eraserhead was the worst, vilest, boringest piece of crap any of us had ever seen.There's a lesson in there.",Eraserhead

I'm sure Kafkawould have enjoyed this immensely.Eraserhead is an intriguing movie to say the least.  It has a lot ofelements that will later appear in Lynch's movies (the checkeredfloor, freaks, that stage-backroom, etc.), so there is that familiarity. However, whereas later movies have sex and violence, this haswormy things that tend to be pretty gross.  It doesn't ruin the movieat all, but I wouldn't advise pregnant women to watch it.The music, as always in Lynch movies, is neurotic and soothing. The lighting gets too dark at points sometimes and making out theaction can be hard.  It is, however, definitely worth watching, anddefinitely worth watching more than once.",Eraserhead

202,neil-upto11,Some value as a curio... but that's it.,3,26 May 2011,"Plenty of differing opinions out there about 'Eraserhead'. My own explanation about its significant cult following is that a great many of its fans took their lead from very positive comments made by other directors. Now, it's easy to imagine why it appeals so much to other film-makers: it is a supremely self-indulgent piece and appears to have been produced without any directorial limitations whatsoever. For better or worse, Lynch's vision is there in all its unadulterated completeness.Little wonder that other directors find the whole thing so attractive. However, a regular cinema-goer invariably approaches a film with no such envy and need give no particular credit for such 'individualism' (other than a bit of a nod for originality maybe).Personally, whilst I am always positive about original features in film, I thought that beyond the surrealism and bizarreness, 'Eraserhead' delivers very little.",Eraserhead

204,nataraj,Etude in gross sharp,6,1 January 2004,"I always found it amazing, how very beautiful the pictures are in Mr.Lynch's films, how VISUAL a director he is. This time, I realized that the soundtrack plays an important role as well - disturbing sounds, noises rather, suggesting doom like those deep rumbles do - or feeling of anxiety, fear, like fingernails on the blackboard...And the pictures are anything BUT beautiful.There is in fact a story to the film, but I think the amazing thing is what can be done, emotionally, using only 2D B&W photography without computer generated effects and a (mono?) soundtrack.In music, this piece would have been called ""etude"" - a practice piece - to try out some novel forms of expression; newer works like ""twin peaks"", ""blue velvet"" and ""mulholland drive"" use those same means in a refined (and much more enjoyable) manner.For those who don't mind touching the RAW ingredients of a perfect meal before it is cooked and served on a silver platter - a very interesting film.",Eraserhead
205,willwoodmill,One of the most terrifying and atmospheric films ever.,10,13 March 2016,"David Lynch is one of the most experimental and well loved filmmakers of all time. He has career that ranges from slow family friendly dramas to dark surreal horror films. Yes their are few directors that are as skilled and innovative as David Lynch. With a career as vast and impressive as his, you have to wonder where he started. Was he someone like Akira Kurosawa whose earlier films are almost entirely forgotten, or was he someone like Orson Welles who came out of the gate swinging. Well luckily for the world David Lynch falls into the second category.Eraserhead is a small, low budget, minimalist, surrealist, atmospheric, horror film. And it's plot is, well open to interpretation. It's difficult to make out exactly what happened in the film, (especially on your first viewing.) but the things you will pick up on are basically what follows; there is a guy with a weird haircut called Henry Spencer who lives in a nearly empty apartment building. Henry's life is filled with many strange things like a seductive neighbor, a large pile of dirt on his dresser, and a strange fascination with his furnace. Henry then gets invited to dinner by his girlfriend, Mary X, who he hasn't seen in a few months. At this dinner many bizarre things happen, but the main point of the scene is that Henry got Mary X pregnant a while back and she has now given birth. But Henry points out that she couldn't possibly have't oven birth yet, Mary X tells him that it's premature and the doctors aren't even sure if it's a baby. After this it slowly becomes more and more difficult to figure out what's going on as Eraserhead dives deep into the mind of its protagonist, penetrating his deepest thoughts and darkest fears. Eraserhead is one of those films that is ""open to interpretation,"" basically meaning that there is no one objective thing that the film is trying to portray or mean. This simply means that the film is going to mean different things to different people. David Lynch crafted a surrealist film that called back to the creator of the surrealist film genre, Un Chein Andalou. Both films contain macabre images that were ripped strait out of the directors minds and then put to film. Many of David Lynch's early short films were supposed to be almost ""adaptations"" of his paintings, and that's what it feels like in Eraserhead. (I'll talk more about the imagery later but I'd like to get back to the Un Chein Andalou comparison.) The one major difference between the two grotesque sets of images is that, Luis Buñuel said that you could play each moment in Un Chein Andalou in any order and it wouldn't make any difference. But Eraserhead definitely needs its order and structure. In Eraserhead it's not just random things that are shown completely unconnected, which is what Un Chein Andalou is, a lot of the horror and tension comes from the slow build up to the really horrifying parts. Eraserhead would not be nearly as memorable if it just 90 mins of intense random horror.Eraserhead is a film that has complete mastery over both its visuals and sounds. The cinematography, first done by Herbert Cardwell and then by Frederick Elmes after the first died, can only be described as creepy. And when it's matched with David Lynch's flawless inventive production design, it's able to give the film a thick an unnerving atmosphere. The way Lynch lingers on each shot for so long, letting the audience slide into his disturbed world. Not to mention the way each scene is lit, I mean it really is just one of the most atmospheric films I have ever seen. And the excellent sound design and score, both done by Lynch himself, are incredible. In each scene their are so many layers of the sound that all come together, and it somehow never feels muddled or weighed down by all of the layers, in fact it only adds to the experience. Eraserhead was basically produced in purgatory. David Lynch made the film while he was studying at AFI (American film institute) and he was given full access to their studios. However they under estimated what Lynch was cable of, the script he turned in was 21 pages long, so they predicted that the film would be 20-30 mins long. And when they found out how long the film actually was several members of the AFI tried to reject it. So the film spent nearly seven years in production. Jack Nance who played Henry Spencer and his wife Sissy Spacek, helped fund the film through its difficult production and I have to say I'm very grateful of that. Eraserhead is a landmark in surrealist filmmaking, inspiring people everywhere to make films no matter how small or insignificant they seem. Eraserhead forever changed not only the way films are made, but the way their watched.9.7/10",Eraserhead
206,highkite,This is a movie that REALLY stands out. A little too much.,6,7 July 2006,"I couldn't help but think one thing while watching this movie: ""so... this is where Tim Burton got his influence"". I've seen all kinds of movies, some I thought were brilliant, some overly pretentious. ""Eraserhead"", though brilliantly directed, lacks a lot of support and relevance, and overtly attempts to be deeply symbolic. I remember when I enjoyed creepy characters and random disturbing scenes, but this film seemingly dumbs down the audience in an almost conscious manner.The story centers around Henry Spencer (Jack Nence) who lives in a world that either resembles a nightmare or a different dimension. His days revolve around walking around his industrial town, and sitting in his small quiet apartment suspiciously observing every angle as if he's never been there. He's told that his girlfriend (?) awaits him at her house for dinner, and with hesitation he joins her, again, in an awkward suspicious way. The girlfriend, named Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) lives with her parents and grandmother who follow lifestyles of some impulsive serial killers. After Henry finds out that he and girlfriend Mary X have a premature baby, he falls head first into a world of mayhem, delusion, and sexual provisions. His girlfriend gives birth to a mutant baby, and leaves him to take care of it by himself.""Eraserhead"" is really unique, but over-stylized and pretentiously dangerous. In the world we live in today, an audience will fall in love with any movie that has some level of cult status. While I'll agree that the directing is superb, especially on such a low budget, the story itself lacks any drive. Albeit the movie has a massive creepy feel to it, from the subtle build up of bizarre sound effects to the sinister-like score, it leaves you empty and cold asking yourself what you had just seen. I've never been one to hold a good deep screenplay that leaves you thinking for hours against the movie, but in this case there's just way too much false instinctiveness.The mutant baby is a motif that the movie attempts to force in order for us to feel scared and shocked. And in the center of it all, the baby looks more like a dinosaur than a disfigured, dream-like figure. Then there's the ""creepy"" girl who sings a song about life in heaven, which Henry listens to for comfort. Her presence is almost unnecessary and oblique, making you tilt your head back more asking ""why?"" is this a film that observes the life of one man? Did he suffer from a traumatic experience? We don't know, and director-writer David Lynch seems to think we don't care. The movie opens up with a scene of what seems to be an asteroid and an overlapping image of Henry floating around. He then wakes up on the road and sets out in Chaplin-like posture, passing and dismissing anything out of the ordinary. In one scene, he invites his next door neighbor in and lets her seduce him into sleeping with her. They then end up in Henry's bed, falling deep into what seems to be water. A pretentious goof might say it's an excellent way of showing sexual desire and an atmosphere that seems to give Henry the relaxing feeling he's always wanted. I say it's the first thing that popped into Lynch's head.Half way through, I looked at my watch asking if it'll be over soon. Really, you don't have to watch the rest to get the basic idea of the whole thing. However I stuck around for the beautiful cinematography and excellent underrated directing. Lynch uses his camera and works with it like an Axe murderer would with a good victim. He separates reality with non-diegetic sound that the main character can actually hear, and really knows how to handle the framing in each shot.I watched the extra features and David Lynch put into words what I thought was a true representation of this film: ""I have no idea how the idea came to me, or when it came to me"". How could you? It's completely random and spontaneous. It also suffers from a weak ending, Henry gives up and murders his baby only to see the little asteroid -- or his shell of life -- burst and explode, leaving him to go into heaven with the strange butt-face girl who sings in his radiator. Well, problem solved, kill the itch and join peace for eternity. I think that's the idea the movie was conveying. As for the title itself, it's really pretty interesting. ""Eraserhead"" refers to the term 'erase your head,' which means to get rid of any awareness or consciousness of what you're doing. Something Lynch must have done when he was writing the script.",Eraserhead
207,chanvat,What in the heck is this?!?!?!?,2,3 August 2003,"This seems to be the type of film that you either really like or you really hate, in my case I definitely choose the latter.Ok to start off, what is the point of this film?  I realize the allegories about fatherhood and all, but whats the deal with a friggin dinosaur that she gave birth to?  Do you need to understand this film to like it?  Maybe thats why I hate this surreal effort so much.Oh yeah the pacing.  Everyone in this film does everything sooooooooo s-l-o-w-l-y and deliberately it grates on your nerves.  If they just sped up the movements in this film you could have cut it from 90 mins to 45 mins. For example, the first 13 mins has that whole birthing allegory with no a single word of dialogue.  That whole part could have been cut to 3 mins tops.I will admit some of the visuals are shocking, but what else is there to hold it together?  This movie just seems like a series of shocking visualsheld together with no purpose, or no glue for that matter.  And when a movie like this has no glue to hold it together, it becomes pointless just like this crap.  I dont care how artsy it is, I dont care how original it is, I just care about plot and story and pacing, and in all three this movie is seriously lacking.  Heavy recommendation to avoid!",Eraserhead
208,Skeptic459,The reason that I got into films in the first place!!!,10,28 December 2003,"In film school it is not cool to say you like David Lynch. Film students claim he is just a poor mans version of Luis Bunuel. Yes, I would say that Bunuel is more talented and is the king of surrealism. But Lynch is very good and his films do challenge the viewer. I actually have a deep affection for his films. When his films work, they really work! However, when they do not work, for example, Twin Peaks, Fire, Walk with Me or Lost Highway then they quickly launch themselves into self parody. Many people claim his material is too inconsistent and indulgent to be really liked very much.  What I find strange is that one reviewer here states that he feel duped by Lynch. Duped? Why? The films all have a story. They just have a narrative that works differently to conventional film making. If you look hard at the film and try to understand the subtext then you will pick up  on what the film is about. I saw this when I was 16. I knew nothing about films or film making then. A friend and I were bored so we decided to see a movie at capitol cinema. Capitol cinema used to be a cinema that played arty or small independent films. They used to play midnight showings of eraserhead. There was always someone smoking a joint in that place. However, you don't need drugs for this film. Lynch is drugs. This film just buzzes you out.
 I had no idea what Eraserhead was about. I had never heard of Lynch and knew nothing about surrealism. I went in and was just totally blown away! Before this I had only really seen commercial blockbuster movies. Lynch gave me a whole knew perspective on what cinema is capable of. Eraserhead is the stuff of dreams. Lynch believes that watching a film is entering a dream state. Both my friend and I did not know what the hell was going on. I was fascinated...    Later I would learn this is a film about Lynch's own obsessions. His hatred of Philadelphia. His fear and anxiety at being a father. The film is just full of a kind of a compulsive, paranoid neurosis. It is a waking nightmare. He also seems to parody the nuclear family. 'Did you have sexual intercourse with my daughter?' Meanwhile that weird blond woman in his radiator seems to represent his escape. A way to transcend from his grim world. What I also find bizarre is that people then accuse him of having no sense of humor! What? There are always funny moments in his films. 'Did you have sexual intercourse with my daughter?'Jack Nance is also very good as the main character. He seems to be playing the director and he gives a performance that is distant, spaced out and yet emotionally vulnerable. A really strange mix. The imagery is just brilliant. Black and white in an industrial wasteland. There is smoke here of course. It wouid not be a Lynch film without smoke! It also has a cool, grating industrial soundtrack that sets your nerves on edge. This is perfectly effective for the bleak tone of the film. It is so visually striking that the viewer will not forget the imagery quickly. There is a reason that this is a cult film. The other distinctive feature of this film is the long lingering shots. This reminds me of Jim Jarmusch and his movies like Dead Man and Ghost Dog. The length of the shots seems to have the effect of immersing the viewer in this strange industrial wasteland.I have my own copy that I lend to friends. They then normally give it back to me saying that they only got through the first half hour. They also normally tell me that I am a weirdo for liking it. I think what frustrates people most about Lynch is that he will not give any explanations of what the film is about. So any interpretation is as good as any other. People want the film to be explained so they can understand it. Who said films must be understood or comprehensible? Why can't a film be abstract piece of art like a painting? Lynch's films are like an acid trip. To quote the great gonzo, Hunter S Thompson, 'buy the ticket, take the ride and if it gets a little heavier than what you  had in mind, then put it down to forced consciousness expansion.'  So in other words, relax, stick it on and just run with it. Travel into someone else's nightmare for a change...",Eraserhead

The first time I saw this movie was in my film class. I had no idea what to think of it. This is because the movie simply blew my mind. A friend and I had a discussion after watching the film. I said I had no idea how to interpret it. He said that this was his second time watching it. He said that I would like the movie a lot more if I watched it again. After watching this movie for the second time, I have learned to appreciate and love this film. It is pure surrealist art on film. It never explains itself because it doesn't need to. My favorite part of the movie was undeniably the visuals. Absolutely gorgeous. They blew me away. The movie definitely warrants multiple viewings. The ending scene honestly scared the hell out of me.

There is no doubt that this film is very strong on audio - in fact the soundtrack really gets under your skin and creates such an ambiance right from the outset that you almost feel yourself being reeled in. The main character - Henry - is surely a modern day version of Buster Keaton. You really do feel that there is a nod to the silent films era, not only with the visuals but with the humour, most of which is unerringly black. There are many set pieces in the film which serve to both unnerve and amuse you in equal measure, which in itself makes for quite an unsettling experience. The supporting cast are nothing short of excellent. There are several other reviews out there which label this film as groundbreaking and I would say that that label is certainly justified. It will be obvious to those viewing this that certain directors of certain movies now regarded as classics will have had the seeds of an idea from this movie. For those die-hard Lynch fans out there, you will LOVE this film. For those who have never entered the bizarre world of the director, you will certainly take something from this.

Glad I didn't watch ""Naked Lunch"" right after this one.  I only saw it once and that's enough, will probably never view it again, except maybe to impishly watch others reactions (will make sure I'm drunk, so I can laugh at their angst - can just hear their innards crying out, ""Existence is so pointless!"")

The acting was good, and the plot was .... different but not bad at all.  For fans of Lynch that haven't seem this classic, please do so right away.  If you are not a fan please see Blue Velvet, Lost Highway or Mulholland Dr as your first choice, these are Lynch's films that resemble the type of movies that he is more famous for.  Eraserhead is the kind of movie that is not for everyone, and I'm happy by just seeing it once.  For most people once will be enough, but if you are planning to psychoanalyze the film and find its true meaning, I think you should see it many times. My first thought while finishing the movie was that this guy had problems coping with parenthood but that's only my first impression, and it might change as I give more thought to the film.  The movie was really intelligent and well thought-of; it was a true horror but not the kind that has that much suspense in it, which is really hard to come by these days.

This is the second time I watched it, and I really feel no different.I think Lynch's main purpose for making Eraserhead was to give the viewer a unique experience that no other movie can offer. Lynch uses impressive visuals and otherworldly sounds to create a dreamlike quality. The dream soon becomes a nightmare when the plot develops into a commentary about the fears of unplanned parenthood.There are so many things happening in Eraserhead, it is hard to tell if there's a specific emotion Lynch wants the audience to feel. Some instances are straight hilarious, then five minutes later, the movie turns into pure horror. Confusion is the main thing I feel about Eraserhead.Will I watch this again? Yeah, probably.

They wanted the club to choose a movie to be played for the next meeting. I remember writing down ""Empire of the Sun"", as it not only was a classic war epic made by the great Steven Spielberg, but featured Christian Bale in his first ever starring role as a 13 year old kid when Christopher Nolan's Batman had recently been released. It seemed appropriate. The club chose Eraserhead. I watched in complete horror for what felt like 5 hours of just complete nonsensical story telling and randomly inserted clips that reeked of ""deeper meaning"" that just wasn't there. I remember looking over at the other members watching it with fascination and wondering if they were just faking it to gain approval with their enlightened kin-folk, because only a lowly commoner like me could not appreciate watching torture for an hour and a half. It wasn't out of the realm of possibility, as I had done the same thing as a teenager when attending functions for my high school's drama class. I know now my hypothesis has been proven. With the introduction of modern art, there have been hilarious examples of ""art"" that is so bad it has been sat on, thrown away by janitors and in numerous hilarious examples people leaving behind mundane objects on purpose, only to have people appreciating them as art. People want to be special. What better way to be special than to pretend to ""get"" something that no-one else can, except a select, privileged few? That is the entire essence of Eraserhead.",Eraserhead

Recently I rented the DVD and stuck with it through the end, even watching the director, Lynch, tell about making it. Give a weird guy the money to spend making a movie, and he'll make a weird movie. Watch this movie and you may be kicking yourself for wasting the time, like I did. Yes, the sound was cool and the lighting was great. But so what? There are many things in this film that make a normal person feel uncomfortable. But hey, isn't that why we watch films? This film could be seen as making fun of people with mental challenges. But hey, it's freedom of expression and boy, and didn't he use some great techniques? I can't help wondering what those guys were on when they were making the movie over several years. Be sure to watch the special story (It's a hum-dinger!) of making the movie. I WILL say that I liked Lynch's Elephant Man, but I haven't seen any of his other stuff.",Eraserhead
220,yearspew,A Nightmare On Film.,8,21 June 2008,"David Lynch's Eraserhead is a film that not only needs to be watched, it needs to be appreciated.To me, this film is the closest thing to a nightmare caught on film. The settings, the characters, the mood and atmosphere, everything combines perfectly to create this extraordinary experimental work that many people have grown to love, and hate as well.Is it a difficult film to get into? Yes. Will a casual viewer be bored to tears? Perhaps, yes.I love Eraserhead and I consider it Lynch's best work. Not because I like to pretend I'm an artsy person who enjoys weird, obscure stuff. I love this film because I like a film that creates its own atmosphere and makes up its own rules. Eraserhead is nonsensical, oddly-paced and downright strange, but that somehow fits perfectly within the film.The visuals are creepy, disturbing, and have a very eerie realism to them. I'll say again that it does look like a filmed nightmare. The visuals have that surreal quality enhanced by the characters and the story itself.I think Eraserhead is a proof of what can be achieved as a filmmaker and how ideas, no matter how messed up, can be translated into the screen with talent.",Eraserhead
221,Cloud20,"So Weird, Confusing, and Bizarre.",7,10 July 2005,"Eraserhead (1977) John 'Jack' Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Judith Anna Roberts, Allen Jospeh, Jeanne Bates. Directed by David Lynch.Spoilers herein.David Lynch's best known early film from him is also known to be his strangest. One could agree with that, but some also think it is also one of his greatest objectively. Even if I don't think it really is a great film, it is an interesting and innovative one that lead Lynch to further his career.Henry Spencer is an alienated and afraid worker who lives in an abandoned-like town where machines are constantly working. The world that he lives in is slow, dull, and purely weird. When he finds out that his soon-to-be wife has had a hideously deformed child, we are taken into the mind of Henry as he overlooks his child with horror.First of all, the DVD from Netflix has the picture remastered so well that I was almost shocked. Lynch's direction is very pure and near perfect. What makes the film unique is mostly the way that it is daringly executed and made, but some of it I did not enjoy much. However, though I didn't find much, I felt that there was much symbolism and meaning in the end. While I was entertained and interested by the amazing, atmospheric beginning, the film began to fall a little short of greatness by showing bizarre and at times disgusting imagery. The ""baby"" effects are dated, yes, but the idea that Lynch gives about the world we're living in is growing shorter is brilliant. Throughout the movie, not much dialog is even given between characters. Lynch is reflecting on the quietness of Earth (or is it?). Is it a post-apocalyptic world, or is it just an experiment of an environment gone bad?Overall, I would say that this is Lynch's purest film, though not one of his best. The direction and cinematography are perfect for a surreal film, though I am not sure how many will be fascinated by random, bizarre imagery. Recommended for the non-squeamish; proceed with caution. 3.5 stars out of 5.",Eraserhead
222,jukangliwayway,"""A dream of dark and troubling things""",9,26 July 2013,"As the taglines imply, this movie will keep you floating in a weird & troubling dream-like state of mind. It's dark - technically and thematically speaking. It requires an open mind, a desire to watch something new or challenging, and rapt attention for the viewer to fully appreciate it. Eraserhead is the kind of film where you can analyze it for years and still you wouldn't be 100% sure. Watch it with ten of your friends and you'll get different opinions and interpetations. First few minutes, I was reminded of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The long, lingering shots. The seemingly random images or sequence. The unsettling sound. It takes you out of your movietime comfort zone. And I liked it. So I continued watching. Eraserhead is terrifying in such a way that it takes you in, unsettles you, includes you in Henry's nightmarish world, and fascinates you with it's striking visuals and camera shots, unnerves you with the grating almost mechanical musical score, and keeps you intrigued with its two lead stars: Henry and the baby. I sat and watched, fascinated & unnerved at the same time, not wanting to see the ugliness of it all and yet I know for sure that I will watch this again as soon as possible. And therein lies this film's beauty. Really not for everybody.... But I suggest you watch it if only to see Jack Nance's enigmatic facial expressions and cool hairstyle. That's one movie character I will never forget. And this is one movie that I will continue to re-watch for reasons pretty much like why people keep on looking at works of art, as if there's a secret hidden in it.",Eraserhead
223,Senator_Corleone,Probably the weirdest movie I've ever seen,9,9 November 2002,"***There might be spoilers in the following summary*** ""Eraserhead"" is the weirdest movie I have ever seen (like that hasn't been said before). It is David Lynch's first film, and it really showed the world what this controversial filmmaker would be creating throughout his career. Now, when I say it is the ""weirdest"" movie I've ever seen, I do not mean ""weird"" in a negative sense. It is strange, but it is also intelligent, challenging, experimental, thought-provoking, and breathtakingly ambitious (especially when you consider this was Lynch's first major film). The film contains maybe 8 characters (some of whom are more implied than actually seen), but the film really revolves around Jack Nance, a truly likable screen presence with a malleable face who, despite his wicked-vertical hair-do, is probably one of the best everyman in film history. ""Eraserhead"" shows how Nance's character, who seems to be an ok guy, has his life tipped-turned upside down and right-side up again. He accidentally gets his girlfriend, Mary, pregnant. That is bad enough, but it gets even worse when the ""child"" turns out to be a horribly mutated accident of nature. The rest of the movie takes place over one night and shows how this offspring effects his life. My opinion is that the film is a nightmarish vision of a possible apocalyptic future we are headed toward-but that is just my interpretation and should not be taken as fact. I could go on and on, but there is a 1,000 word limit to these things. So let me just say that ""Eraserhead"" is a truly unforgettable film full of images, ideas, and thought. It is one of the great art films, and possibly one of the great films, of all time.",Eraserhead

One of the best thinker films of all time.If you like David Lynch's work and you haven't seen ERASERHEAD yet, you're missing out on a truly wonderful experience. Keep in mind that this film takes a few watchings before you will fully understand it.
The acting is incredible! So good in fact, that the actors prove that a great film doesn't need a lot of dialog. Each character's personal tortures exist, throughout the entire film, in the characters' faces. Jack Nance's performance is especially strong.Watch this film in a dark room (or theatre, even better) completely isolated from the rest of the world. Don't take your eyes off the screen even for a second because you will miss something. Highly recommended for a thorough brain massage.",Eraserhead
225,tangietangerine,"In heaven, everything is fine",9,22 June 2014,"I have seen almost every movie Lynch has ever directed, and Eraserhead really stands out from the rest, although my favorite remains Mulholland Drive. As a first film, it stands out because it shows what a promising career he had ahead, similar to when Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs was out in 1992. Anyway, i'd say it's a very authentic and bold movie, overall. From the sceneries - the window blocked by a brick wall and the apocalyptic vibe - the eerie ways the characters seem to move inside that universe, to its surrealistic roots, i never came across anything else quite like it. It all appears to happen inside a nightmare, but whose nightmare is it, ours or Jack Nance's? Hard to tell, when some of the imagery makes us physically uncomfortable. Particularly, to me, that scene with the ""Radiator Lady"" singing, and the squashing of the mutant babies - even thinking about it makes me cringe. It's a hard movie to watch, not advised to sunny days, but are any of Lynch's films? Finishing it, i felt just like i had awoken from a nasty nightmare, only it was one i had put myself under voluntarily! Anyway, i admire filmmakers who can set up an atmosphere, and who manage to connect with the audience somehow, i'd imagine it's not an easy task, but it's one David Lynch can pull off alright.",Eraserhead
226,roundtablet,awful,1,10 June 2018,"I think that Eraserhead is what no movie should be. That is because this movie revolves around two things: Its heavy usage of pretentious symbolism and its imagery being mostly gore. This movie has nothing more to offer than seeing disturbing imagery while listening to jarring noises. I saw many people say its about the experience, but honestly if I want a 1,5 h long experience about gore images, I can also watch a documentary about the holocaust, or some other cruel part of our history. In this case I actually learn something and care about what is happening, because it happened to real people. This movie doesn't manage to make me feel anything, other than being bored and a little disgusted. I don't know if the movie is supposed to make me feel anything but I think there are only 2 reasons to watch a movie: 1.to feel some kind of emotion. Can be anything, fear from a horror movie, sadness from a drama, excitement from an action movie. I guess that is the main reason why people watch and enjoy movies. The other reason which I personally think is more important is to watch movies to learn something. By that I don't only mean actual knowledge. Learning new perspectives of looking at things, new ideas that may be meaningless in actual life, but keep you awake at night. Now you might say that's what ""Eraserhead"" is trying to do, but like all Lynches movies and like all of these, ""over the top"" symbolic movies are their messages too hidden behind symbols. Sometimes it's even not clear if the movie even has a meaning behind its symbols, something the writer actual intended. You know you don't learn something new by interpreting symbols, you only learn what you already know, because YOU yourself are interpreting what is going on. That is my biggest concern about Symbolism. Sometimes it can be quiet interesting to have symbolism in your story. It can make the experience feel unique because it depends on the viewer. But I think that only works if you have a story line as a base to begin with, something to care about. There are some movies, like Eraserhead where this isnt the case.So does ""Eraserhead"" at least have a meaning behind its images?
I don't really know. While watching the movie it seemed to me that with including all this gore he wanted to portrait life as being this inherit ugly things, or if you turn it on its head, that being creeped out is something irrational because it is normal and all around us, because there are a few scenes that show rather unusual, probably even disgusting scenes and all the character react as if it was the most normal thing in the world. He shows events that may occur in anyone's life at some point. Mostly events that can be very unnerving, such as a dinner with your partner's parents while finding out that said partner is pregnant. Or later in the movie it portraits the many sleepless nights a young couple must endure after having a baby and the psychological stress this inflicts onto a person. The movie takes those realistic scenes and sets it in a world full of strange and creepy occurrences. For example, the meal they eat at the dinner is a moving half sized chicken that spills blood constantly, or the baby the story focuses later on is some sort of alien looking creature. But I don't really see that message portrayed at the end with all the overload of gore and the main protagonist's reaction to all of it, which makes me unsure what this movie was all about.Now I watched a few of Lynches other movies. For example ""Lost Highway"", which is equally meaningless, but at least had some nice cinematography, a few interesting lines of dialogue and something you might even call a story. Eraserhead however had none of it and was a very disappointing watch.",Eraserhead
227,TomC-5,a surrealist masterpiece,10,4 November 1999,"David Lynch came to a film with a background in painting, and here he reveals a stunning visual imagination to depict the surreally nightmaresque existence of Henry, a lonely factory worker and father of a deformed, amphibian-like monster with whom he lives. In the meantime, the monster's mother, Mary, has returned to the bizarre circumstances of her freakish family, and Henry, in turn, sits within his dark, squalid apartment, contemplating the specter of the strange, grinning puffy cheeked lady in the radiator and feeling hapless about the child. Yet, a brief description of the key elements of this great film fails to do justice to Lynch's mesmerizing vision, arguably the greatest piece of cinematic surrealism since Dali and Bunuel's shorter ""Un Chien Andaleu.""

232,Sewaat,Is everything fine in Heaven?,8,26 June 2016,"I put off watching this film for five years, so it was always in the back of my mind. On a post or just a click away in a related video. I even tried to watch it about three years ago but shut it off after the first ten minutes. I just assumed it was going to be one of those movies that was too weird for me to even comprehend. I was too scared to even try, so I avoided it.But then my curiosity for the film became riled up again when I saw a clip from it on YouTube. I became entranced and then realized that even after all this time, I still had a copy of the movie in my possession. Untouched and unwatched. Finally, on a Tuesday night with nothing better to do...I sat down and watched Eraserhead. It's taken me some time to fully process the film, find the answers I needed and complete my honest analysis. With all of the information I've gathered, I can finally deliver my conclusion.This is the most bizarre film I've ever seen in my life. To sum it up briefly, it's dark, tense and fraught with terror. I consider myself to have a very strong stomach when it comes to violence and body horror in film. And I can say honestly that there were many sequences that made my skin crawl with disgust. But in the best possible way. It was a superbly thrilling experience. I had absolutely no idea what to expect. It wasn't that the film was overwhelming; it actually suffers from the opposite problem. It's too subtle and not enough explanation is given. For example, the characters in the film do not behave like any decent human beings you'd find in the real world. They display habits and behaviours that are suddenly triggered like a bomb going off and then are never spoken of again. Swept under the rug and leaving the viewer scratching their heads, wondering what possible relevance could that have to anything? The breath of fresh air and definitely the only character that we can relate to on a basic, human level...is the film's protagonist, Henry Spencer. The only person in the film who reacts normally to the events that unfold throughout the story. But even he is eventually led astray into the surreal and dream-like world in which he inhabits. It was many days before I realized that Eraserhead is a film that is not meant to be understood. You're not supposed to feel any particular way about it. Some critics would have you believe that this is a ploy used by David Lynch so he can watch us in delight as we scramble to try and find a deeper meaning to it. But I prefer to think of it like this: With Eraserhead, Lynch is laying out all of the cards on the table for us to see and observe. He isn't hiding anything. He has no tricks up his sleeve. He makes suggestions here and there but everything else is left to our own minds. He's putting the truth in our hands, essentially. Think about it: when was the last time you watched a film where YOU, the viewer...got to decide what the film was about? That is a very rare and beautiful thing to behold. My advice? Try not to look to deeply into the film and just accept it as it is. Or not. It's entirely up to you. But if you tilt your head and squint to try and find a deeper meaning, you'll only be left with a sore neck. Perhaps that's what the meaning of the title has been all along. In order to spare yourself the headache of over-analyzing it, you would do well to ""erase your head"" beforehand. Clear your mind of whatever you thought you knew about story telling and toss it out the window. The only expectation to be had about the film is that it will change the way you look at movies forever.",Eraserhead

235,KubricksRube,I Think My Take On This Film Is Different From Most Other Peoples',10,14 July 2010,"I can't help but be amused by the people who call it frightening, disturbing, nightmarish, etc. There are nightmarish aspects of the movie, sure, mainly the Lady in the Radiator (maybe it's just organ music that gives me a Carnival of Souls nightmare vibe), but I thought it was a hilarious movie. Hypnotic, fascinating, you have to see what weird or funny thing happens next. The gag with the suitcase had me laughing as hard as at anything else. I thought it was sad too. The baby's mother didn't love him, and he was always crying and got sick. I wasn't disturbed by the baby, I wanted to give it a hug. Deformed cow-fetus babies deserve to be loved too.If I can get a smidge philosophical, I think the film stretches cinema to limits it hadn't been stretched before, although Bunuel, Kubrick, Fellini, and Tarkovsky are definitely forerunners. As an adherent of Tarkovskyish views on cinema, I think this is a very good example of what he called ""sculpting in time,"" and the irrationality of so much of the movie underlines the irrelevance of plot, characters, stories, 2+2=4, etc., of cinema itself.",Eraserhead

Whats wrong with that baby? why are her cheeks so big?"" or wonder why I was so captivated by a dead cat being wriggled around by a hanger. I was too mesmerized, and disturbed, by the beauty and obscurity of every scene to even bother with symbolism or deeper meaning. The light and contrast used was lovely- black and white, with more black than white, really added to the nightmare/post-apocalyptic feel. Every second of every scene could be paused, printed, and the result would be a perfect still. There was always noise- sometimes music, but a constant whooshing that sounds like hard wind from inside a building. Every scene was an uncomfortable existence.

This has to be seen to be believed, a truly breathtaking account of a man who doesn't do very much, depicting a desolate modern world and telling so much without talking down to the audience.The film plays like a visual poem, from the Man In The Planet (representing fertility) to the mutated baby, which in turn drives Henry to despair, we are transported through this industrial waste-land (the sound effects are awe-inspiring), and we end up in Henry's head, filled with weird and wonderful things.Lynch rightly became noticed for this film, and went on to make some superb films (Blue Velvet, The Straight Story), but this ranks as his best, not being afraid to be itself, not a mainstream film, but a work of art.",Eraserhead

241,Dr_Drew_Says,Dr. Drew says... 5 out of 10,5,21 March 2014,"Eraserhead (1977) - The Good, the Bad and the Interpreted Synopsis: An art-house tale of domestic repression. Henry is a quiet man in a dystopian, industrialized world. He is thrust into a relationship and fatherhood he's not ready for and slowly finds himself succumbing to the pressure of it all.The Good: This is the hardest type of film to review. It's one of interpretation, symbolism and hidden meanings. Ten different people can watch it and come away with ten different interpretations of the film, which is likely what Lynch was going for in the first place. For me personally, I am not going to take some artsy-fartsy approach to this movie and simply state ""if you can't understand the meaning, then it is too artistic for you"". I hate that sort of thing. I get that this isn't a movie for everyone, but you have to be able to relate to the film one way or another or the concept is simply lost on the viewer. Lynch didn't lose me, but there were times when I was certainly confused. What I did love about the film was how well Lynch conveyed the plight of Henry without dialogue. The industrialization of the world Lynch portrays is a hissing, steaming, rumbling, disconcerting environment that grates on your nerves as you watch Henry toss and turn in the unsettling apartment. It reminded me a lot of the Japanese film ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"". The imagery, such as the un-potted plants (basically, just mounds of dirt with plants in them) the radiator, the constant rain and whirring of machinery, the dream sequences... all these things captivate the viewer and regardless of whether it all makes sense, you understand Henry's fears and inner desires. As a husband and a father, I can understand the stresses of that role and for someone not prepared for it, this is a great visual and visceral way to watch that experience play out. Who wouldn't be haunted by finding out your girlfriend just gave birth to Admiral Ackbar? The Bad: The movie simply gets too ""out there"" at times. I've only watched the movie once, true, but there were too many head-scratching moments and they begin to stack up by the end of the film. It ends up feeling cumbersome to watch. I feel like I could watch it ten more times and still not understand certain elements of the story. There is most certainly a core storyline to be followed that is somewhat clear and the viewer clings to that (even if it that storyline is itself somewhat ambiguous), but when we start getting to the Eraserhead sequences, most viewers are going to get left in the dust. Art-house folks will praise it for that value and give it a 10. Mainstream movie lovers will give it a 1 because, at times, it makes no sense in logical movie terms. Me, I found it fascinating, yet too metaphoric in parts, so I can give it nothing but a middle of the road grade.The Interpreted: I find that films that require too much interpretation can be taxing on the viewer. I'm not saying everything has to be spelled out or wrapped up nice and neat with a big, red bow, but interpretation has it's limits for me. This one somewhat exceeded those limits. While certain aspects of the film (mostly the cinematography) were visually appealing, the feeling of ""what is going on?"" isn't an enjoyable one when watching a film, especially when the story isn't tied together all that well at the end. There were metaphorical props in this movie that, aside from not even knowing what they symbolized with respect to the story... hell, I didn't even know what I was looking at! It's really tough to fully enjoy a movie when you are scratching your head through half of it.",Eraserhead

243,hcfernandezpa,Not so deep or profound but somewhat interesting...,6,3 April 2021,"I was not into David Lynch during my early 90's college days when he was at his peak. Some scenes do remind me of my own junior year film project, filmed in a high grain 16mm b/w film stock.I get his deliberate American Gothic post industrial version of Surrealism. I even appreciate the textured layering of his aesthetics both visual and auditory. It has a nice grittiness to it. I much prefer the surrealism of say Fellini though.As far as story line or ""meaning"", well it's quite simply an autobiographical commentary on the fears and hang ups of marriage/monogamy and ultimately fatherhood. Not that complex, not that profound. The guy had insecurities about his role as partner and father and obviously carried around some guilt regarding some obvious internal rejection of those roles... Ehhhh...",Eraserhead
244,Win-5,See it twice - 30 or so years apart,7,10 October 2012,"I saw this when it was new, at a midnight movie. It was about a step and a half too weird for me - I stayed for the whole show, but I never knew what I was seeing. I knew it was creative, I just didn't know what it was creating, rather like The Baby - I don't know what it is, but it's a creation.So, after an appropriate pause (30+ years), I watched it again. It's still weird, it still shows the low-budget style (yet it seems no money was spared in getting The Baby just right), but I now see much more of the narrative, probably thanks to Twin Peaks and Mulholland Dr. - Yes, it jumps or wanders or steps smoothly from the film's dreamlike reality into the movie's realistic dreams, but it all makes sense. I'm not sure it's *supposed* to make sense, but it does, especially if taken from the point of view of Henry, the ""hero.""Try it once - if you don't get it, try it in thirty years, and get back to me.",Eraserhead

247,gunslinger861,a true testament of the strange,10,14 July 2010,"Like many people this was not the film through witch i discovered the work of David lynch. Not to sound cliché'd but like many my introduction through the elephant man. I actually found this film through a horror website called losamans lair of horror. What hit me about this and many other experimental/art films was the thin line between art films and horror. I've seen art films that have been far more disturbing then most horror,like vase de noces,begotten,pig and so fourth. Yet i've seen horror that had tremendous artistic value. This film has all the above qualities. Basically the film centers around a peculiar man named henry Spencer. He is a hapless man who drudges through a black and white post industrial waste land. Yet through all the eccentricities there is something both relatible and sympathetic to our hero. He strives to live normal in a world that seems to grow more and more unstable as the movie progress's. He does normal things. He works,lives in an apartment,even spends time with a girlfriend. Things start to get a little strange from here on out. We watch as He stares over his dinner which bleeds when punctured with a fork.All the while the girls father watches in anticipation. Henry is soon informed that a child was born and he is the father. We see the child witch is wretchedly deformed to the point where resembles an unborn goat fetus. We soon see the two new parents living together,but the incessant crying of the child drives it's mother away. Leaving an already daunted henry alone with the child. A child with needs that henry can not provide for.As the time passes henry grows unstable and becomes plagued with delusions. A range of visions pass before the screen. A woman who preforms on a stage inside the radiator. She dances on the stage and steps gleefully on small fetuses. As henry watches his head falls of his shoulders and is replaced with the head of his deformed son. falling into a pool of blood. His head is then taken to a badly scarred man who runs a machine that creates...you guessed it eraser heads. He invites a woman home and gets intimate only to be interrupted by her horror at his child's appearance. Furthering in the two of them melting into each other in a bathtub.Finally in an act of desperation or madness. he slices open his child's bandages only to reallies the bandages were his body and then proceeds to stab and kill off his child. In the last scene we see henry watch in horror as his ons innards foam and he is surrounded by white light. The last image we see being embraced by the dancer from his hallucinations. This film really had no effect on me when i saw it as a young man. However when i saw later on after having a child i saw it in a much different light. It deals with a lot of the anxieties that i believe most expectant parents go through. The fear of raising a child alone, the fear that you wont measure up. And of course the overwhelming anxiety that your child will be different. Although sometimes disturbing it deals with these issues in a very sophisticated manner. The sound track that consists mostly of industrial noise would prove highly effective in later work. Filmed in a very striking black and white,It gives the film a very claustrophobic and schizo feel. Although beyond all oddities of this film, It's been incredibly well received. Being applauded by the likes of john waters and Mel brooks. The later of which would lead him to great mainstream exposure and success. Although arty and a bit strange it's well worth the watch 100 times over.",Eraserhead

250,comfortablynumb_1,No masterpiece,3,9 December 2005,"David Lynch films keep getting better and better. This early effort is difficult to follow like many of his other films (Lost Highway), is darker (Blue Velvet) and is patchy. Recently, I saw Mulholland Drive which is an awesome improvement on any other film he has made and one of the best this century to date. Eraserhead is more of a collage of disturbing images and sequences than most normal films with a free flowing plot and theme.I don't think Lynch had a premise with this film and wanted the audience to develop their own story from these images and and sequences. I didn't bother to conceive of what this film could mean. I didn't enjoy it enough it really was a waste of time viewing it, although some parts are memorable. I will never forget Henry and Marie's disfigured child or the dinner which moved and oozed blood. Why? Because it was both funny and shocking in its own way which is rare.I believe it is about lower class people losing their moral values, hope, faith and even sanity in a decaying society. The industrial setting, for me gave the film a British feel, I imagined it to be Manchester in the 1930s - 1950s.Overall the solution to this jig saw puzzle is don't take your anything you value in life for granted because life can be much worse. This is in hindsight, the film possessed no emotional stimulation and did not provoke any thoughts.",Eraserhead

Which is OK, as one should try to please everyone. Eraserhead is one of a pretty short list of movies that are very hard to swallow (I don't pretend to know all such movies, but judging from what I've seen, from a statistical point of view, this seems to be the case). There are several reasons for this, and I guess it all starts with the intentional lack of human touch and positive emotion. This alone gives it a sour, metallic taste. Add to this a mix of darkness, visceral and venereal horror, and that's it - if you think you're going to see a regular movie, you've got another thing coming. This movie has a very vague resemblance with Cronenberg's Videodrome (and Crash, why not). Lynch's movies refuse to explain themselves and leave one with the pleasure - or burden - to do so. I reckon Hollywood fans will be pretty mad because no one tells them what happened and how to feel about it.",Eraserhead

No, I wasn't lucky I saw a great film; I was lucky I didn't waste my precious youth, valuable chronic and the price of admission to see this POS. This movie is somewhere between a big budget Ed Wood film and a C- student film. Pointless, plot less, mindless, and most of all, just plain boring! For the life of me, I can't see what all of the fuss was about.As bad as this was, I liked a couple of things. First, I'm a sucker for black and white cinematography and Lynch does a good job of it. At times you get the feeling of being in one of those late 50-early 60's British films with all of the grunge and dirt of urban industrialization. The other thing I liked was the special effects. Being a low-budget film, I was impressed with the mutant baby and other effects that were used.Other than the two above mentioned item, this film sucked.

257,Lexx-2,Nobody does it like Lynch.,7,13 August 2002,"One of the most impressive pieces of surrealist cinema ever, David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" is a 90-minute filmed nightmare that everyone should see once. Even if you don't get Lynch's vision, there is still no denying the power of his ideas and imagery.  Its interesting that Lynch dislikes the idea of applying psychoanalysis to his work as this is some kind of Freudian archetype spilled on to celluloid, with many sexual and psychological avenues explored and depicted.  Profoundly disturbing (especially the final scenes) and surprisingly funny at times as well. Topping it all off is the eccentric presence of the late Jack Nance in his definitive role.And remember folks: ""In heaven, everything is fine""....",Eraserhead

While Avant Garde may be the correct label to place on a film of this magnitude of nothingness, Masterpiece is a stretch measuring light years across. DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE GREAT MYSTERIES OF THIS MOVIE REVEALED TO YOU.After years of research (not) and study (not)of this most unusual film, I have arrived at the following undeniable answers to it's many puzzling questions.Q.

Because he looks like a deformed tadpole.Q. Why do the small chickens (really Cornish hens) spit out globs of coagulated blood between their tiny drumsticks. A.

260,fruitbat319,my reaction was..............huh.,3,28 March 2007,"I admit i was a little disappointed in this movie, being a fan of Mullholland Drive. (I know someone somewhere is going to attack me for that, but it's true.) I found it to be pendulous and too long, but to its credit, it offered some interesting things to ponder. I didn't suppose the freaky wormbaby to be a premature birth, but rather, an abortion, and that its presence was symbolic of the trauma and ""sin"" of that action, which was being ignored and suppressed by Henry and Mary. It could also be just the illegitimacy of the child, which would render it socially freakish in a repressed society. Make sense? Based on that, I also thought that the image of the fluffy-faced woman in the radiator trampling on sperm-like little things was an indication of Henry himself being trodden down by the life he was forced into. But I think the point of Eraserhead is that it's able to be interpreted in different ways.but that doesn't mean i would watch it again voluntarily. nor does it mean that when it ended, i didn't start laughing and say, ""why the hell did i spend money to rent that?""",Eraserhead
261,BIOSphereopts,Regrets and Realization,3,28 April 2011,"Perhaps from the summary title you may be thinking that this review is an opinion of what the film is about. Well, you're wrong. In fact if you want an interpretation, look elsewhere. I haven't one.I actually passed up watching this film years ago due to the fact that some of my pot smoking friends thought it to be a work of genius. My reasoning was that if THEY thought it to be genius then it must be crap. After all, these were the ones who laughed hardest at ""Americas Home Videos"" just because someone got hit in the ""nads"". So, based on this prejudice, I avoided this so-called work of art.Fast forward x amount of years later and I decided to give it a look. First off, I'm glad I did. Second, I did miss something but NOT for the reasons most pretentious reviewers will lie about. For one, the movie is interesting. It is campy and off the wall which is why I regret missing it so many years ago. Outside of that, I find no meaning whatsoever in the film. As I understand it, this film took over five years to make, however it was not due to the depth of meaning but rather the shallowness of funding. And after viewing, and bearing in mind the context of the time I can see why no one wanted to back its production. It would have only been of interest to either pretentious film students or pot smoking friends such as mine.Now to the bread and butter. Yes, I did like it. I liked it for the camp and bizarre awkwardness of the characters and sickness displayed. As for ""art"", ""meaning"" and ""genius""...not so much. Why? Its not there. Not even Lynch can or will explain it.

262,dell_of_dreams,Lynchian Brilliance,10,6 April 2003,"Eraserhead was the debut release for arty film director David Lynch.
The film is shot in black and white with generally (at the time) unknown actors like Laurel Near, Charlotte Stewart and John Nance.
What the film is actually about is open to interpretation but watching the film, one can't help but find some misanthropic view of a post apocalyptic world where mundanity has turned into something truly horrific.
John Nance stars as Henry Spencer, the films big-haired hero, Henry is followed on a strange course of events made strange by David Lynche's bizarre take on normality. Henry finds out he has a child (a strange alien looking creature), gets married, has an affair, and even, in a metaphorical blurr, has his head turned in to erasers for pencil tips.

263,gautamajovi_95,Film of the Future,8,27 August 2010,"David Lynch is one of the best and most important directors of the twenty-first century. Before his breakthrough, The Elephant Man, Lynch made his low-budget Eraserhead, a tale of Henry and his struggles.Now Lynch's films are surreal. This one was too....but there was something more....something personal and something eerie about the film. I'm not just talking about the overall look and how it's classified as a ""horror film"". All that aside, Eraserhead has this strangely disturbing atmosphere hovering around with it and however impossible the film may seem, you always seem to put yourself in the situation. He calls it ""his most spiritual film"".The actors were creepily accurate (once again, credit goes to David) and there was a constant ""delay"" with most events in the film, thus adding a hint of realism to it. However surreal it seemed, there was always a back-way which made the film seem so real, so impossible but real.This film is definitely not for the average movie-goer or for a film critic {I don't care for film critics, do you?""}There are scenes in the film which what was new back then is what we call ""a Lynchian moment"" today. These include rare premeditation to the upcoming events, simple yet striking dialogs and a sense of unexplainable creepiness. Eraserhead plants itself as a piece of sheer genius and plays its part as a prologue to Lynch's career and showcases his brilliance. I recommend you guys to watch this film because somewhere in the corner of my head, I'm thinking ""This is what films are gonna be like in a bit"" and y'all better get yourself tuned in.Remember- ""The dumber the audience gets, the dumber the films get""",Eraserhead
264,samsara761,An intense trip into a mind,9,14 July 2010,"Eraserhead is David Lynch's first feature film. It was completed on a mere $20,000 budget, coming from an initial $10,000 grant from the college where he was studying, and loans he collected over the years from friends, when the grant money was over. This is why it took Lynch six years to complete production.It's the story of a few days in the life of Henry Spencer, a printer on vacation, and his relation with his estranged girlfriend, who leaves him with the mutant monster of a baby she has just given birth to. It's a post-atomic society, as we see from the atomic mushroom portrait picture, hanging on top of Henry's bed.Most of the characters aren't meant to be the representation of people, but rather that of dreams, psychoses, literary topoi, grotesque allegories maybe, but certainly not people. But here and, as the audiences will discover, in his later films, Lynch gives themes and motifs actual roles in his films, personifying certain types or characters, so that they can openly and directly show us the interaction they have with the people in the story. This is why some characters in Eraserhead have names like Beautiful Girl Across The Hall, Lady In The Radiator, and Man In The Planet.#The director defined this debut film as his most spiritual to date and, personally, I do appreciate it from a spiritual point of view; the sense of immanence of which the movie is permeated is a clear sign of the presence of a longing for something higher, an attempt to discover the mechanics behind everything and move in unison with them.This film is Lynch through and through, as we have come to appreciate him and his visions, but it does have a certain naïveté about it, and the sense of active experimentation is very strong; possibly, because of this, his best film to date.",Eraserhead
265,glddraco666,Boring and near unwatchable,3,19 December 2010,I know that David Lynch relies on a lot of surrealism for his movies and this doesn't make him a bad director. In fact I like surrealism but the key is moderate amounts and not too much or it becomes distracting and hard to follow. His movies are sort of boring and hard to enjoy at times although I can see how some may object to this I felt Eraserhead in particular was so tedious that I had to just stop watching it.After thirty minutes of nodding off I realized finally that this movie is way overly hyped and tends to rely to heavily on abstract concepts for me to really stick with. Maybe I'm being biased in thinking that they movie could have been much better if their was some sort of plot and dialog.,Eraserhead
266,Johnny-Sack,One truly unforgettable film,10,4 September 2004,"To begin with i personally, and i guarantee I'm not alone here, think David Lynch is one of the greatest filmmakers ever. And Eraserhead is one of his greatest. The film is not necessarily a film of full on symbolism. Its more the phenomenal director pouring his thoughts, moods and subconscious feelings into what is essentially a fairly straight forward ""plot."" He is interested in mood and imagery, obviously more so than dialogue. This does pit him aside from Mamet etc obviously and does limit his commercial appeal but it does not render him some arty weirdo. It is perhaps a mistake to view this film as a puzzle you must solve, unlike Mullholand dr, it is more you just surrendering yourself to Lynch's completely bizarre style and thoughts. Because more likely than not you'll just tie yourself up in knots about subtext and symbolism although I'm not saying its wrong to do this. Anyhow, instead you should just buckle up for one the most imaginative, surreal and unforgettable films in the history of cinema.",Eraserhead
267,Shnorg2342,Eraserhead- A Descent into Strangeness,10,24 November 2019,"David Lynch's Eraserhead is one of the best films ever made. The film is about a mans slow descent into madness, caused by stress from his new marriage and his unwanted newborn mutant child. The movie is based on Lynch's own fear from his first marriage and child. Like much of Lynch's work, the final third is completely strange and psychedelic, though this movie contains an in movie explanation, Henry's madness. When Henry first gets back to his apartment with his new wife and child, he stares into the radiator, and sees a stage surrounded by curtains. Stages and curtains are recurring imagery in Lynch's work, and I still have no idea what they mean. This is the only time in the film we see Henry smile. Later in the film, Henry sees the stage again, and he sees a woman with enlarged cheeks. She sings a song about how in heaven, everything is fine. The Lady in The Radiator could mean one of two things in my mind. Either she is a symbol of hope, promising Henry happiness in her plain of existence. There is some evidence of this later, most notably the scene where she squishes sperm like worms on her stage. She is also hugging Henry at the end of the film, and Henry looks satisfied and freed. The Lady in The Radiator could also be a demon of the mind. These monsters are in some of Lynch's other work, most notably Bob's character on Twin Peaks. These monsters often attach themselves to those at their weakest. Her stage first appears to Henry when he is most stressed. The Lady in the Radiator's song is seemingly her trying to get Henry to commit suicide. The ending of the film is very disturbing, Henry murders his child with a pair of scissors and seemingly kills himself. A lot of the beauty of this movie is how open ended it is. Almost the entirety of the ending (and film for that matter) is up to interpretation. Both of my theory's about The Lady in the Radiator can be equally applied to the plot, and they both make the film way different if you watch them with these ideas in mind. This is but one example, the entire film is like this. In my opinion, Lynch's best work, and the best horror film ever made. 10/10",Eraserhead
268,Evan Anderson,About f#&*ing time!,10,29 December 2002,"I say that in the one line summary because this film is harder than hard to find.  I finally found it in a video store that had rare cult movies.  If you live in N.C. and want to see it I found it in Boone at Fat Cats video store.  There's not much point in persuading someone to watch it, but if you want to watch it here are some guidelines. 1) You have to accept the fact that the movie will (most likely) scare you, depress you, weird you out, and CONFUSE you.  Might bore you. 2) Don't try to understand the movie.  You won't!  Even if you've never been confused before in your life you won't understand this movie!  I don't think David Lynch even really understands all of this movie. 3) This isn't essential but it helps if you sympathize with Henry.4) Be prepared for a slow movie with some images and sounds you've never seen or heard. 5) Remember it's just a movie. 6) Laugh or smile at the parts that are funny. 7) If it's getting to you too much stop the tape.  It's not essential to life. 8) Don't watch it if at the time you are already depressed. 9) Unexpected things happen all through the movie. 10) Read the other user comments of Eraserhead. 11) You will either love or hate it. Overall a great movie!  I hear that people that watch Eraserhead are trying to be artsy or intellectual or even refer to us a psuedo-intellectuals. We aren't, and to the people that think that please let's just leave it at the fact that we liked Eraserhead and not hold any hard feelings toward each other.  This movie is the weirdest but probably not the best of David Lynch. I like Blue Velvet more.  You won't really know what to make of the movie as and after you watch it.  The sound in the movie is to die for and the baby is... well... hard to describe but scary, weird, gross, animal-like, etc. You have to watch this movie more than once to get the movie.  The sperm scene was probably the scariest part of the movie.  The beginning is fantastic.  It gets weirder as it goes along.  I think David really just wanted to evoke a response from the viewer more than he wanted to entertain but it did both to me.  I don't really know what else to say except it will change the way you look at chicken forever.",Eraserhead

I can honestly say there was a period where I sought out strange movies but nothing could ever quite hold a candle to this one.I'm not even sure why someone would want to see this film, don't get me wrong, I like it, but when you break it down it's just sort of a continuous mish mash of craziness that isn't exactly as entertaining as it is scary.If you haven't seen this film you will realize after seeing it that Lynch moved ""mainstream"" or at least in that direction with each film after this. As weird as they are, they look like little house on the prairie compared to this. What I can tell you is that, after watching it a handful of times you will come away with some quotes that only you and your fellow ""I survived Eraserhead"" mates will understand.Like: Chickens! Their the damnedest things, smaller than your hand and their man made! or Look at my knee!!!!! None of these actually make any sense or have anything to do with the movie but they certainly are strange and no one other than those who have braved the film will have the slightest clue as to what you are talking about.Lastly though, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS FILM IS ABOUT.

And I'm happy with horror or any movie going back to the silent era. I have a complete open mind.Unfortunately I did not enjoy Eraserhead at all and I was happy when it was over. Why so critical of one of David Lynch's acclaimed early work you may rightly ask? Well nothing really happens in it. For most part of the film centres in one room and on two things: the main protagonist and a very unusual looking baby. There is little dialogue, no plot or story or character development. My imagination was put into overdrive working out the scenes, any metaphors, whether the story took place in the past, future, some parallel universe or the warped mind of the protagonist of the film. Not a lot is given away. Eraserhead is abstract art in black & white. This may have worked in 1977 but now it feels very dated, not the least bit frightening, way too long and I am afraid boring.",Eraserhead

In an industrial backdrop full of constantly grinding machines, harsh and contrasting light, rusted metal and rotten wood, blackened buildings, and victims of grotesque afflictions of the body, you find Henry and his girlfriend Mary. After discovering Mary is pregnant with his unexpected child, Henry tries to cope with his predicament, her melodrama, Mary's overbearing parents, his lust for his neighbor, his unwanted child, and an all-around miserable existence. Their existence is complicated when prenatal tests force Mary to question if the child is 'even really human.' As Henry and Mary try to force themselves to love the child, their world spirals into oblivion as prophetic and twisted nightmares, strife between them, and a demanding infant take their toll. Eventually, it appears that Henry's only source of salvation comes from the terrible and loathsome acts he dreams and fantasizes about... or are they dreams? Ultimately, Henry's despair consumes him, and he begins to think and do the unspeakable... or does he?I gladly give this movie a 10, despite how discomforted and uneasy it made me feel, as no other movie I have seen has ever been able to wrench such a reaction out of me.

272,friedem0n2004,oFfIcIAlLy BlOwS,6,10 July 2007,"Yea thats right this movie blows. I've watched it twice or at least tried to watch it twice. It just plain sucks. 8==>, thats what I'm talking' about. The only David Lynch I really have appreciated so far has been The Elephant Man. That was well done. This is an incoherent story and its f'ed up in a big way. The oozing liquid that pours out of the chicken grossed me out the first time I tried watching. I went a little farther in the film and then when the mutant baby came up, that was the last straw. I turned it off. Returned the DVD and didn't think twice about it. Until recently, when I went to my local video store and rented a bad quality copy on VHS. I got a little farther, but not much. At least I got to the part with the lady in the furnace, that was well, interesting to say the least. I couldn't take the part with the sick mutant baby, so I turned it off. Thats it, I've had it, I don't want to watch this movie anymore. One person wrote that this film is tough to stomach through, I agree, don't watch while you are eating. The movie is repulsive in its nature, but I guess thats one of Lynch's talents and I'll respect him for that. But what I don't particularly respect him for in this film, is his lack of story telling. It has great technique and you can clearly tell that he was thinking. But it doesn't fit together, it feels like a mi-sh mash of boring imagery thrown at the viewer from an obscure angle. Let me add that I love the Black and White photography, I still prefer Black and White, done well that is, not just for the sake of it. I mean don't get me wrong because I love personal films, just not this one. I love indie features because rebel nature against the Hollywood system. This film clearly finds its cult following with the midnight crowd. It has all the right ingredients to fulfill that boundary, and it does so with style, just not substance. Yes they are two different things indeed. An example of a movie with all style and not substance is 300, and I hated 300 more than Eraserhead. To even say that I hated Eraserhead would be mean, but I do feel that it doesn't quite live up to all the hype. So, occasionally I enjoy the big Hollywood boom blockbusters and maybe thats what I was in the mood for while trying to watch Eraserhead, its clearly my fault. But I have the courage to write this review of the film, therefore I must have something to say about it. Right. Well yea, I stated what I liked and didn't like, more or less Eraserhead has redeeming qualities, just not enough to out weigh an incoherent story. Like I said it's great for the midnight crowd, I just don't want to be part of that crowd tonight.",Eraserhead
273,catheter1st,"Eerie Landscapes, Dreams of Desire, And Nightmares of Haunting Proportions",10,5 September 2009,"Eraserhead is the pinnacle of surrealist, subconscious film-making. That is not to say it is for everyone. On the surface, it is a narrative about a man trying to cope with the uncontrollable forces of his everyday life, but underneath it holds a meaning far more sinister and foreboding.My take on this film is that the main character Henry, is haunted by an unknown, unseen demon, whose presence is indicated by fluctuations in electricity, and shifting of light sources. During a cold, uneasy dinner with his supposed girlfriend's family, Henry learns he is now the 'father' of an extremely premature, possibly inhuman child.While Henry tries to make the best of the situation, by marrying the girl, and bringing her and his 'child' home to live with him, he cannot escape from the clutches of this demon, which continues its reign of terror over Henry and his family. Mary, his wife, unable to sleep due to the crying baby, packs her bags and heads for home, but not before being seemingly raped by an unseen force at the foot of Henry's bed.The 'child' is clearly not human, and it manipulates Henry through the same type of malevolence that his true father, the demon, does, instantly feigning serious illness, and cackling maniacally at Henry's failures. Henry dreams of salvation through his savior, the woman in the radiator, but cannot escape the demons that hold sway over his life, represented by large sperm-like creatures that surface both in life and his dreams.In the end, Henry tries to kill his demon, the 'child', but only sets in motion his own demise. But his savior comes to him at the last minute, to assure him that In Heaven, Everything is Fine, or so he hopes....",Eraserhead
274,sullymazda,"No, the film does not make sense--and it isn't supposed to",9,13 January 2015,"I noticed that one of the negative reviews for ""Eraserhead"" referred to it as a ""nightmare"". That, rather ironically, is correct. David Lynch has successfully managed to take a bad dream--or perhaps a series of them--and commit it to cinema Remember that dreams are evanescent --they don't exist in real time, are fleeting, and we generally don't recall the details of them. But I think Lynch, as soon as waking up from one, wrote down its particulars.Maybe in a diary that he kept (talk about a labor of love). I can just picture him telling people ""Wow. What a whacked-out dream I had last night. There was a grossly deformed woman living inside my radiator, dancing on a stage where fetuses were dropping on the floor. She would use the heel of her shoe to crush them."" Yikes. There was another commentator on this site who said that the film has a dated look to it. ????? It features nothing that one would associate with the mid-to-late 70s. There is no Disco, or its accompanying fashion(s)--certainly not the clothes and hairstyles among any of its characters. There aren't even automobiles,graffiti- ridden subway cars, etc, that allow you to identify the time period. In short, you really have no way of knowing that this film is nearly four decades old. And people are still talking about it.In sum, it's like Rob Zombie said in an interview a little while back. He noted that it is over forty years later, and people to this very day continue to debate/interpret this motion picture, ""Night of the Living Dead"",and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".

278,padawandoug,A Strange and Funny Dream about Fear of Commitment,10,7 February 2003,"The thing I find most odd about the many comments about this movie (other than many of them being so recently made), is that they all miss the humor of ""Eraserhead""!  Jack Nance's Henry Spencer is the perfect schmuck, a guy whom nothing goes right for.  And in David Lynch's world, that is a very dangerous thing to be!  Here are listed a few of the humorous moments or incidents in the movie . . . .(SPOILER WARNING)The scene with Nancy X's parents is almost all humor (until the menstruating chicken at the end, that is), from Henry's approach (when he's scared by a barking dog), to the yelling of Mrs. X at her husband (""Bill!), to the conversation (""What do you do?"" ""Oh, I'm on vacation.""), to the accusation and Mary's reaction (""They're not even sure it is a baby!"").The ""Erasherhead"" scene:  this dream sequence is part disturbing, part humorous.  It gives me the biggest laugh of the movie, when the kid goes to the ""eraser factory"" or whatever it is, and the guy at the counter starts pushing that buzzer -- over and over and over!  Slam! the door opens and that big guy comes in, points his finger and bellows ""OKAY, PAUL!!!!""  I still laugh when I think of that moment.The suitcase under the bed:  when Mary leaves Henry, she tries to get her suitcase from under the bed, and has to yank for about 30 seconds before she gets it to come free.  Her pathetic frustration is really funny, as is Henry's reaction to her jerking the bed around.The seduction:  ""Where's your wife?"" asks the woman from across the hall. ""I'm not sure.  I think she went back to her parents again.""  The ultimate schmuck can't even keep track of his wife (though I think this part is another of Henry's dreams)!The sleeping with the new wife scene:  her eye squeaks when she rubs it, and she hogs the bed.  ""Move over.  Move OVER!""These are the most humorous parts of the movie to me.  Admittedly, the Lady in the Radiator, and the baby-thing, are disturbing and dark parts of the movie; the last scenes especially, with the baby-thing being stabbed and then mutating into a giant grotesquerie are the nightmare side of this dream.  But don't forget the humor!I must confess that I am a total David Lynch fan.  My favorite thing to say when talking about him is: ""David Lynch is the greatest living American filmmaker.""  I would say the greatest in the world, (living), but I don't see enough foreign movies to accurately judge if there's anyone better somewhere else.  ""Eraserhead,"" with its slow pacing (a style, or trademark, he would finally return to in ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland DR""), use of dreams and darkness, and emphasis on the dark corners of our existence, is the first of many masterpieces from David Lynch.Final note:  I don't know if there is a DVD of this movie, but I have a laserdisc of it (a Japanese import), which is the best way to see this movie, as many of the darkest scenes (especially the one which seems to have been shot in almost total darkness, where Henry rubs at a piece of lint on his robe or pajamas) have poor contrast quality when seen on videotape. So look for that laserdisc if you are a Lynch fan (and get a laserdisc player, obviously, since there probably isn't a DVD of this movie -- though the Japanese might have made one; they seem to be the only ones who really realize, in a large way, what a genius David Lynch is).",Eraserhead
279,solarisdeschain,"An intriguing film, even if its hard to connect with",9,15 March 2007,"David Lynch's feature debut, Eraserhead, soon rocketed to cult status, and set him up for bigger things.The film tells the story of Henry Spencer, a printer on vacation throughout the length of the film. He has a girlfriend, and soon finds out he is the father of her child, which was born in the hospital premature. Then he has to take care of it.That's just about the best way to explain it, but there is really less of a story here than just an emotional throughline with the films visual imagery that is clearly visible, but hard to relate to. This is because the film is so esoteric, such an exhibit of Lynch's pure ideas, that it is incapable to relate to unless you were involved in the production. That being said, you feel sympathy for the characters, even if they are given a little too less time to grow, as the story soons sheds them to focus on Henry. Henry is a sad individual tasked with taking care of a child that burdens his every move. He's a guy you can feel for, because parenthood is an experience everyone can sympathize with. It's hard, and even harder by yourself.However, soon things go completely out of hand and body. The film becomes one large symbol for something else, and things may have a certain subconscious power, they, on the whole, don't mesh together or make an attempt to relate to you, like most other films would do.That being said, Lynch's imagery is bizarre and mesmerizing, and sure to captivate you throughout the movie, and cause some serious intellectual discussion of differing interpretations afterword.Eraserhead is well-done and its imagery and sound-design meticulous and inciteful, but the esoteric nature of the film's story will fail to relate in most peoples heart.",Eraserhead
280,mike-seaman,Interesting if nothing else,6,20 April 2009,"Eraserhead is a student film or basically that from what I understand. It is very apparent, as it is filled with the normal slightly creaky acting seen in most student films and the ever present pretensions.It takes place in an industrial wasteland moving from surrealism that is somewhat translatable and then into incoherent symbolism for the viewer. Some viewers will find this annoying, others might want to keep view just to see what oddity will occur next.Everyone in the film really seems to capture the essence of their characters with their movements and facial expressions. The lack of dialog is actually a strength.Jack Nance gives a solid performance, he is the embodiment of a man who is consumed with fear, resentment, and the sense of being trapped. As he moves and walks around his nightmarish world he seems only mildly surprised by the dark images and occurrences around him. He seems to be too defeated to care or perhaps he feels he is unable to escape.Like Jack Nance's character, Eraserhead moves slowly, in fact, that's a bit of an understatement, at some points in the movie time barely seems to move at all.Eraserhead is an interesting movie, which has to be said for about any David Lynch. Eraserhead certainly has its flaws but I think it succeeds on the level Lynch was aiming for.",Eraserhead

Not through boredom however, but through the pure emotional onslaught that one experiences whilst viewing this movie. The dark humor in this movie is relentless. I use the term 'humor' loosely as it will take several viewings to pick up any at all, and when you do see it you will probably not laugh at it. This is one of those rare movies that can be considered to be ""art"" in its purest form. If you can endure this movie from beginning to end you will probably feel some type of emotional response, which is more than can be said for some of the more ""traditional"" movies. After viewing this movie you will either see it for what it is an ""artistic"" vision or you'll miss what the point of this movie entirely, that there is no pre-defined ""point"", it is up to the viewer to make of it what they will, and for that it is a true piece of art.10/10",Eraserhead

It has the reality of an anxiety-dream. It's both minimalist (particularly the acting, dialogue, etc.) and expressionist. The lighting and mise-en-scene are striking. Henry lives in a strange, cramped, monochromatic world of aloneness, emptiness, silence, doubt, unease, and horror, which has no logic or rationality and seems more a reflection of his mind than of external reality. None of the characters is likable (in my opinion); in fact, they're strangely emotionally shallow and small-minded, and they would be mundane if they weren't so bizarre; but all are interesting. Some parts are rather grotesque/disturbing, but it's not a horror movie in the conventional sense. It's a very different art film, and not everyone would be able to appreciate it, but I think it's wonderfully creative, dark, and strange.",Eraserhead

Well, that is what you should expect from watching Eraserhead. And do not think that you will only watch it once, because, trust me, it will be playing over and over again in your mind's eye, and ear, for a long time to come. Yuck!

285,mheuermann,"crucial, cruel and not really a feel good movie",9,30 January 2006,"For all its flaws Eraserhead still remains in my top 25 favorite films of all time. You can love it or hate it, but I think it would be very hard not to be touched by the very suggestive imagery. Lynch meddled with surrealism, the aesthetics of Edward Hopper and the dark side of the soul in most of his films but it was never more gripping or convincing than in his first full length film. In Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive he made just too many concessions to the mass market, while this is a perfect symbiosis between experimental and narrative cinema. Watching it you get the feeling he was making exactly the kind of movie he wanted to, or needed to and there are just a very few films that fall into that category methinks. Frankly, you have to take into consideration that it is obviously low budget, but how Lynch employs his humble means to maximum effect is simply breathtaking and provided a blueprint for fledging filmmakers all around the world. There isn't much of a plot, the whole thing is basically a never ending nightmare about getting to grips with fatherhood, and yet that seems more than enough to keep our anti hero occupied for 90 minutes. Taking his inspiration from silent movies and German Expressinist cinematography (i.e. Film Noir), Lynch takes the audience on a tour de force through the bleakest and most depressing scenarios you can imagine. A seriously disorientated Jack Nance stumbles through an industrial wasteland, feels decidedly out of place at the home of his fiancée and finally cracks up in the kafkaesque claustrophobia of his hotel room. It always holds the perfect balance between sinister fantasy and drab reality so that although there isn't much acting or action to speak of you remain on the edge of your seat the whole time through. Lynch went on to make some memorable films, but he never managed to capture the emotional depth of Erasurehead again. All this said, I would like to discourage you from watching this film should you, or your girlfriend/wife be pregnant. Also, as this is most definitely an underground/independent classic, it might not appeal to your common multiplex visitor, but if you have any interest in what went on off the beaten track in the 70s, this is a pretty good place to start.",Eraserhead

With an outstanding performance from the cast and beautiful directing and storytelling, the sense of unease is wonderfully juxtaposed with whimsical imagery. It's one of the most outlandish films i've ever seen but somehow, also the most profound. I wholeheartedly believe david lynch when he says it's his most spiritual film. It's not one for the faint of heart i would say. It's quite a disturbing film, but that's what makes it so great. The black and white coloring of the film really adds to the unsettling vibe and the dread. It may be a little slow but the story is intriguing and weird that it doesn't feel like it at all.

290,Rachmaninoff28,One of my watch-it-again-and-again favourites!,10,16 June 2018,"Here's my take on this incredibly disturbing delight of a film.The film is an aural and visual depiction of Henry's nightmarish mental struggle with the idea of abortion -- of ""erasing"" the mistake of his and Mary's baby. A few examples:The lady in the radiator represents abortion/an abortionist. The first time she appears, she's ""cajolingly"" standing on fetuses/sperm/babies (they're all the same in the symbolism of the film, I belive) while there's the sucking sound of the abortion procedure going on in the background. More evidence of that is that she's both repugnant and beautiful, like the idea of a abortion to Henry.More evidence is the scene in which Henry finally touches her. She's been ""wooing"" him throughout the film with the idea of an abortion with her sweet smile and her song about heaven, and when he finally touches her (accepts the idea of abortion) he's released from the dark, troubling place depicted so well in the film (worry, fear, guilt over the pregnancy) into pure light. Not only that, after he touches her/accepts the idea of an abortion, you hear the suction used in the abortion procedure once again, and see what looks like a fetus, umbilical cord and placenta being sucked away across the stage.
 BTW, I believe the little chickens are Mary's sexuality: They're tiny and underdeveloped, and when Henry sticks his phallic fork into one, it bleeds, like breaking the hymen. Mary's mum's reaction to the bleeding chicken and her announcement that Mary's had a baby straight afterwards make perfect sense, if that's the case. So does Henry's amazement that the baby's already at the hospital!If you agree with me, or anyone else, or not about what it all means, it doesn't really matter"" This film succeeds in creating its own incredibly engaging ""dream"" world (emphasis on the word ""dream"" because that's precisely what the film is depicting: Henry's dream) even without a thought about what it might all mean.

Words cannot describe what Eraserhead will do to you. I would advise people not to watch this if they are in a ""bad place"". You really have to be prepared for it. I know it sounds like I'm being hyperbolic but I promise, I'm not. Despite the fact that it is not a horror film, It is the most disturbing and terrifying film that I have ever seen. It gets at the root of our deepest fears. But, although it is disturbing, it is also extremely beautiful, and completely takes you into another world.
As strange as Eraserhead is, it is not as confusing as many people think. The film is ""about"" - what it's about. You are seeing a man's greatest fears become a reality. And his fears are the same as all of ours. That is what makes it so terrifying and so hard to deal with.",Eraserhead

For me, what Eraserhead does is to create a macabre, nightmarish world more effectively than any other movie I have seen. It is a trip to hell, and when it is over you feel completely disoriented. I have shown this movie to friends, and they all were ""wierded out"" by the experience. And that is what Lynch, I believe, really is trying to do. He wants to suck you into his bizarre fantasy, and he succeeds quite well.  The only movie that had the same effect on me was Adrian Lyne's 1990 film, Jacob's Ladder. That movie is also an emotional roller coaster, with some of the most disturbing imagery ever put on film.

I understand why this film isn't getting a lot of recognition, because it's extremely unpleasant to sit through, and most people won't understand the hidden message, but this film taught me that being a parent can sometimes be absolute hell, and can change a person's life for the worst.
The technical aspects of this film are impressive, the use of practical effects is astonishing and can be at times be unsettling, and the sound design is ahead of its time. The performances from the actors (especially the phenomenal Jack Nance) are captivating and chilling to watch, and the black and white image perfectly captures the tone of the film and feels very natural.I'll probably never see a film like this that is this bold and personal.

They scared me pretty badly, but after being tucked in, I slept fairly easily. I am currently 18 years old, in college. I have a girlfriend I plan to marry and a nice dream to be a writer living in a nice house with a little white picket fence. Call me old fashioned like that. Less than 5 minutes ago, I finished watching the film Eraserhead. I... I can't think about it without shaking. It was not the typical horror by any stretch of the imagination. Yet the whole thing was like this malignant nightmare. It spreads, lays its roots down. Raises a few screams in the night like a handful of ghastly children. A black picket fence, perhaps. I'm... I'm probably going to be impotent for months. Too scared to even get it up. While watching, I began audibly gibbering, I got up and hid in the corner. And I started listening to The Beatles to diffuse the horror of it. Nothing worked. I can't listen to Yellow Submarine without remembering that baby... oh god, the baby.... x_xIf you think there's no such thing as a scary movie, sit down and watch Eraserhead. Keep an open mind. Don't jump at your chance to be critical. Just sit and watch it.You'll learn abject terror soon enough.",Eraserhead
299,undercover_at_the_movies,Weirdness Exmeplified,4,29 October 2010,"Eraserhead is the first feature length film from writer/director David Lynch, who has brought us Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr. While I have heard great things about both of those films and Mr. Lynch in general, this was the first of his movies that I took the time to watch. If I only had one word to describe this movie, it would be bizarre. One type of movie that I am always a huge fan of is bizarre, but this film took it way over the edge. It took the weirdness so far that it distracted from the plot which there was not much of anyway. David Lynch has gone on record as saying that no one has ever gotten the true meaning of the film and that he likes it that way.Jack Nance starred as Henry Spencer, a man living among many peculiar people, who must learn to survive after his child is born as a deformed mutant. In a very Stanley Kubrick manner, the first ten and a half minutes of the film were silent. Throughout the film, there were cut scenes of a woman with a deformed face singing and dancing. It was unclear whether this was a ploy to show Spencer's unraveling sanity or not; however, all I obtained from it was a very uncomfortable moment. To add to this, it has been reported that Lynch used a dead calf to portray Spencer's baby, making this movie all the more unsettling. It was shot entirely in black-and-white, causing it to appear much older than it really was.At the end of this film, I felt incredibly creeped out. It took disturbing to a whole new level but not in a good way. All of the characters had extremely strange mannerisms and some were just scary looking. This movie came out in 1976, so for the special effects to have spooked me is nothing short of impressive. If David Lynch was attempting to create a movie so weird and disconcerting that viewers do not understand the plot and get nothing out of the movie yet feel almost violated by the oddities, then he did a great job. When taking everything in the movie into consideration, it appears that maybe this was his goal. The black-and-white camera-work, the troubling storyline, the calf corpse, and the woman with the deformed and engorged cheeks singing all seem to come together solely to create the chills moving up your spine. After seeing this movie, George Lucas and Mel Brooks offered Lynch directorial positions, and Stanley Kubrick even named it as one of his favorite movies. Lynch turned down Lucas's offer of directing Return of the Jedi, and instead directed The Elephant Man, which Brooks had presented to him.In conclusion, all I can say is that I would not suggest this movie. At all. I respect Lynch's first attempt at a full length movie, and I saw several redeeming directorial attributes throughout. As I said above, his camera work and lack of dialogue remind one very much of Stanley Kubrick and cause you to focus much more on the character's actions and mannerisms. He also seemed to very successfully show you things without explaining them (i.e. the deformed woman singing), which is always useful in making a movie more thought provoking as it inspires the viewer to contemplate meanings behind visual sequences. So, if you are a fan of having to think very hard about what a movie means and being put off by some of the visuals, then this would be a great film for you to watch. Some would argue that it laid the stepping stones for some great psychological thrillers of this decade, such as The Machinist and Christopher Nolan's Memento. I will be completely willing to watch some of his other films, for instance Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive as they have received much better reviews overall. Despite all of these things, this movie was much too strange for my taste. It looks as if I may be mostly alone in this deliberation though.",Eraserhead
300,omelette007,"Weird, wonderful introduction to the mind of David Lynch",9,12 March 2012,"David Lynch is easily among the most uniquely talented and fascinating of directors working today. He is a truly unfiltered artist who puts all his fascinations, fears and inspirations down on film - for better or for worse. Eraserhead is Lynch's first film - essentially, this is little more than a bizarre feature-length student film. It's low-budget and experimental, with untrained actors and not much plot or character development to speak of. Yet Eraserhead is crafted with such care, and has such confidence and consistency in the strange, dark world it builds up, that it clearly stands out from just about every other amateur art-film ever made. This movie boldly and unforgettably marked the arrival of a genuine new talent. David Lynch is one of those rare directors who are already capable of filmmaking genius on their first try. Eraserhead is filled to the brim with strange, evocative imagery: I doubt I will ever forget the sight of the mutant baby, or the ominously cheerful puffy-cheeked lady, or sad-sack protagonist Henry as he shuffles through an unnamed industrial city. Eraserhead also is the rare movie capable of earning different reactions on each viewing - I initially found it weirdly hilarious, but on repeat watches it is sometimes frightening and discomforting. And while movies can't get much more abstract or bizarre than Eraserhead without spinning off into utter incoherence or perversity, there are some grounded, real fears to be found here. Much of the movie's imagery and scant story revolve around the terror that everyone experiences at some point when entering the responsibility of adulthood and parenthood. For some new parents, Eraserhead could function as an offbeat therapy session.By design, this movie is not for everyone. Be aware of that before watching. But it is one of the best directorial debuts of all time - not to mention one of the flat-out strangest films I've ever seen, without coming across like it's 'trying too hard'.",Eraserhead
301,smeisky,Movies have a purpose,1,1 August 2008,"That purpose is to tell a story. I don't care what anyone else tells you otherwise, the reason movies exist is to tell stories in a visual form. The stories themselves can be about whatever the filmmakers want them to be about, but it should at least tell some kind of story.Okay, so before I start sounding like a broken record, I'll just cut to the chase - Eraserhead was a colossal failure as a movie. Yellow Submarine made more sense, and I've never been high in my life. Fewer things actually happened in this movie than a typical episode of Dragon Ball Z. The plot (if there was one) was so wrapped up in multi-layered metaphors as to become completely irrelevant. If you want to use metaphors and symbolism in a movie, that's one thing. In fact, one of my favorite uses of symbolism in a movie comes from another David Lynch film (Blue Velvet). But in that instance, the metaphor was perfectly clear to anyone who had been paying attention to the movie. Here, the metaphors lose any meaning Lynch may have had by becoming so convoluted that nobody, not even the man who made the movie, can glean any sort of meaning from them.To summarize, I disliked this movie for the same reasons I dislike abstract art (which I do not consider to be art, as it requires no actual talent to produce) and poetry: it manages to find the most confusing way possible to say absolutely nothing.",Eraserhead

Watch it in a bad mood.Sorry .. but the final step is the most important.It's hard to find a real good amount of entertainment value in this film anyhow, as it is more a work of art than an actual movie -- so I suggest that you take advantage of the main highlight here: It's terrifying -- if you let it be.

303,myownme777,A Surrealists Fever Dreamed Masterpiece,10,2 November 2013,"The definition of surrealism is an artistic movement that attempts to express the workings of the subconscious and is characterized by fantastic imagery and incongruous juxtaposition of subject matter. This is for people who are always trying to find meaning in David Lynch's works. Was Salvador Dali always asked to explain his works? Bunuel? In general, artists don't appreciate having to explain their art, why should they? Art can be interpreted in many different ways, depending upon the individual. An explanation would only ruin its merit. This is my belief. This is not to say that Eraserhead and said works are meaningless, quite the contrary. But I won't go into it by contradicting myself other than to say that this is a film that should be seen for the open-minded and perhaps the not-so to re-open ones way of thinking for the better. Lynch's imagery, lighting and over-all direction is masterful. I only wish there were more films/filmmakers like this to choose from. Unfortunately and on the same hand, fortunately, Lynch is one-of-a-kind. Sure there are others but lynch productions are his own and not copied from others, at least I haven't noticed as of yet who or what he has copied. If wanting to expand your mind and experience difference this a nice starting point, along with his short films, have you not discovered them yet. For those who have, you know what i'm talking about. This film can also be used to put a chill up someone's spine. Might I recommend viewing with the lights out at night, at a decent volume, preferably in surround sound. This is labeled a 'horror' not because it's a slasher/torture/rape/exploitation flick but because its like anything you've ever seen. This is one that definitely lives up to its hype and nothing has come close since. Enjoy!",Eraserhead
304,Poshlust,Paints a bizarre world with little merit,6,29 September 2017,"I don't quite see the high praise. I appreciate the industrial aesthetic and soundtrack, that part was very well made. Visually, there isn't much else like it. There's quite a bit of surrealist imagery that is used effectively to the themes Lynch was attempting to convey - it certainly makes a world that seems alien, bizarre. However, my main gripe is that the meaning and themes are not very complex or engaging. Surrealist imagery is not inherently brilliant or visionary simply because it succeeds at being strange - at least not in a film, to me. I should mention that practical and visual effects are very well utilized at making grotesque and shocking moments, alongside more subtle humorous ones. Though you've probably already heard at this point that if anything, this movie is strange. The world presented, alongside its characters, all act out of line and out of the norm from our own - and it admittedly is funny to see at times. Despite this, it's a drag for the most part. It was fairly one dimensional in how seemingly the main focus was the protagonist's fear of being a parent, and mostly revolves around that. It almost feels as if the fantastic final scene was written and filmed, before having to arduously attach an entire hour of material to it prior.",Eraserhead
305,Stef-22,Trash,1,5 February 1999,"This film is the kind of self-indulgent trash which gives independent movie-making such a bad name. Truly a film which provides more nightmarish visions of filming technique than nightmarish visions. The actors can't act, they can't react, they look awful, and consequently none were ever heard of again. The positive aspect of this film is David Lynch's example that no matter how big a screw-up you make you can still achieve success!The worst film I have seen (out of around 1,500 films).",Eraserhead
306,Robby-17,Lynch's tour-de-force debut. Art-house at its finest.,6,8 February 1999,"David Lynch suffering from depression, and the confusing emotions that a new parent suffers, on finding out that their new-born has a deformity (a clubfoot in this case), formulated these feelings into one of the most startling works of cinematic art. Filmed in low-budget, grainy black and white. With a pulsating and throbbing industrial noise soundtrack. The film starts as it means to go on, throwing image after surreal image at the viewer, for the viewer to interpret as they wish. Lynch knows the score, he knows how personal art like this is. It is not for the film-maker to tell his audience what he thinks it's about, it's up to the audience to work on it themselves. In this way Eraserhead can be seen on so many different levels. I personally felt the emotions of the confused X - beautifully played by Lynch regular Jack Nance. I saw the world, for eighty minutes through his eyes, his scared young eyes. Nothing makes sense to the put upon young father anymore. He was emotionally stunted to begin with, but is now presented with a world that is unrelatable, paranoid and lonely. Every character in the film has a problem communicating, whether it be the crazed mother-in-law, who attempts to molest 'X' after dinner; or the mysterious 'woman across the corridor', who cuts a perfect picture of loneliness. Ultimately it is 'X' rapid decline into fantasy, as seen in the running dream of 'the lady in the radiator', and his doomed affair with the 'woman across the corridor', that brings the sexual and emotional repression to a head. The 'baby' then becomes a hate object, a thing so hideous that it cannot be touched. It also acts as a mirror to the young 'X' as he see's it's repugnance, as a further sign of his own irredeemable awfulness. Not since 'Stroszek', has a film captured what it means to be genuinely alone in the world. For such a bleak film, full of inventive imagery, the one image that always stands out in my mind, is that very first shot of the young 'X' walking through the desolate wastelands of an industrial hell. That in itself captured the very essence of modern urban life. A brilliant, but flawed movie. In years to come I'm sure it will feature more and more as an item of study.",Eraserhead
307,taylorlferrell,Had to watch a 2nd time,9,16 March 2020,"I had no knowledge about the plot or anything else about this movie, except it being David Lynch's first film, before watching. I also had never seen a David Lynch film before so I did not know anything about his style. So once this movie was over I found myself very lost but very intrigued so I re-watched the movie the next day.
I enjoyed this so much more after the second viewing. I could pick up on such a small amount of meaning on my first watch but with the second I was able to understand a lot more of what was happening. I don't really feel like getting in specifics; all I want to say about this is that it is very creative and that is inspiring to me. There is no reason at all for someone to feel like they need to make a film, or write a story, that follows typical narrative or visual structures. You can make whatever it is you have a desire to make and you should not worry if it is something that people will like more than you should worry if its what you want to make.
I can't get this film out of my mind since I've watched it. I really want to watch it a few more times and I've been meaning to look for some more commentaries or really anything good I can find about the making of, or interpretations of, this film.",Eraserhead
308,toxicwaste,Brilliant Lynchian nightmare,9,9 June 2003,"What a brilliant movie. It makes no sense at all, but it still gives you this strange feeling only a lynch movie can give you. I say it makes no sense but actually it does. I watch most Lynch movies as a dream. You watch it without much thinking and let the images work on you, and then you watch it again, trying to understand it. But since everything is in a dream you can't explain it with normal logic. You have to use dream logic, going from one scene to another without an obvious link. But unconsciously Lynch has a link between the scenes so it's up to the viewer to find that (or another own interpretation) link between the scenes.And if you watch all of Lynch's movies like this you don't have to explain the ""weird stuff"" (like the switch of bodies in Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive)but they make sense in a dream-like way once you find a link between before and after the weird stuff. What's different  about this movie(when compared with Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive, Dune, ...) is that here Lynch uses actual dreams and ""reality"" together, although reality seems to be the nightmare. And the dreams of a (not that much) better place (like the song about heaven) make sense when living in this nightmare.So when you watch this (or any other Lynch poetry) just let the images talk to you, let it get you in the mood of the movie and try to link things with each other, but don't try to explain it, that's impossible. I loved this movie and every frame of it will be in my mind for several weeks (maybe months) and that's exactly what this movie wanted to accomplish. I give it a 9/10.",Eraserhead
309,IggyStooge,A film that i'll never forget.,10,5 November 2009,"Alright, this is for the people interested in seeing ""Eraserhead"". But for those who just want to read my comment on the film, you may do so. So the beginning of how I found this film was very strange. I kept looking at what films people were talking about all the time. And I knew the director David Lynch at the time, but never seen any of his films. I always kept seeing the cover of ""Eraserhead"" and hearing the title everywhere it felt like. I was saying to myself, is this film any good? So I decided to check it out and get the DVD.....i've never felt the same since.This film really changed my ways at looking how directors make these strange, bizarre stories that are surreal. I am a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's films, and I have seen all of his and then ""Eraserhead"", and I got to say, ""Eraserhead"" is a bigger step towards figuring out and questioning these movies. ""Eraserhead"" is perhaps not for everyone, but for people that love to 'think' in these films, (for example: 2001: A Space Odyssey), then this is a good film for you to watch.There is really no explanation of this film. But so far its basically about a man who lives in an industrial enviorment, is struggling with certain things in his life. His mutant baby, his girlfriend, and a whole mind full of things on his mind. He starts having hallucinations of these bizarre characters, and crazy dreams. However the film is intended to not make perfect sense. It presents a totally different look in movies. It also probably gave some influence for other directors, like Tim Burton, who has made so many off-the-wall characters in his films.In my opinion, I think this film should be acclaimed as one of the best surreal/horror films in film history. An experience that will leave you stuck there wondering what your thoughts of the story means. And the funny thing is, the director David Lynch doesn't explain what happens in the film, or really anything that makes you guess what its about. So if you think about it, its pretty creepy how the film is left alone by itself, and maybe.....this film has a big significance, that we all can't figure out. I find that simply amazing.10/10",Eraserhead

311,kennethpitchford,An eerie masterpiece,9,13 September 2009,"I'd heard of this movie for ages, but never saw it till now. I watched it in a mood that excluded all its baggage as a cult movie or as pure trash. With no preconceptions, I was completely taken in by its mood. Someone mentioned Kafka as a reason to denigrate this film. I have spent a lifetime admiring Kafka's work, every word of it, and I'm not even through. With Lynch, I had liked 'The Elephant Man,' and a few other films, but had a basically negative attitude toward him as being pretentious. Strangely, this movie just captured my mind completely. I watched fascinated. Those who want to hunt symbols can put equal signs between a detail in the movie and their bloviations, but that's not how symbolism works. I'd say I re-experienced the hideous sleeplessness of the first months of parenting, but I just don't see the worms as spermatazoa. The nightmare family of the 'wife' is right out of Kafka, but the singing lady with the doughy cheeks is absolute;y original - and brilliant. This last image scared me more than anything else in the film. What power that image packed! All in all, I'm still staggered by the demented intensity of the film and find my ignoring it before deplorable.",Eraserhead
312,Bukronik,Overrated but enjoyable,8,19 April 2014,"I love when people call things art. Everything is art if its different. I saw this movie because it was on a list of the Most Disturbing Films ever made. Come now people, this movie is barely disturbing. Sure the overall tone is dark and what not, but most things are just weird. There is 0% chance of me losing sleep over this. Don't get your opinions mixed. I am not one of those people who have no trouble watching disturbing scenes in films. I have watched parts of Cannibal Ferox and Cannibal Holocaust and i REFUSE to watch them anymore. Those are truly disturbing films and ONLY because of real animals being killed, which has no place whatsoever in movies. This film had a small amount of gore and it was almost comical. As for the plot you can barely call this a movie. I mean yes there is a plot and you can understand whats going on for the most part, but really no ending. Long scenes of awkward silence and people acting weird, which I assume is due to radioactivity. All in all it is still watchable and enjoyable too! Just don't think you need a barf bag or the lights all turned on. SERIOUSLY, if you get disturbed by this film, maybe you should stick to Disney",Eraserhead
313,katana-t,The Greetings From the 20s Artists,9,6 July 2007,"EraserheadThis contains some spoilers.I was expecting this movie to be slick, unpleasant and uncomfortable for the thought. That was a result of familiarity with the other Master's works. My first acquaintance with him and love was the Twin Peaks TV series. I was twelve and watched it in petto, so, I missed a number of episodes. What I saw was confusing, but fascinating, like some violent and mystic fairy tale for the grown-ups. I honestly believed that I didn't get it simply because I hadn't seen all the series. Silly me. In fact, years later, when I saw all the episodes, the questions brought me just to the more academic ones.So, this time, watching Eraserhead, I was equipped with non-susceptibility intricacy-wise  my credo being: ""never get surprised no matter what, no matter how hard He tries"". From this point of view movie seemed a little boring, but still I couldn't resist a certain charm of Lynch's that is peculiar to everything He touches. The picture is dark and has a smell of a mould. Existentialistic moods, the early stuff, I would say  the cinematographic materialization of Kamyu's ""Sickness""  the sickness, or the landscape that makes you physically sick. But Kamyu's man was going to his mother's funeral, while the Lynch's one  to meet the parents of his girlfriend. Everything here is designed to shock you. Everything, but the baby. The baby is absolutely normal. What is interesting, some critics say the baby is a mutant, but do they think so in the movie? They treat it like a normal child  feed it, talk to it, and the child acts like a normal one  screams, gets sick and plays up. OK, it looks ugly, but it looks so to us, how do we know how it looks to them? Or how do we know, that we see what it IS, and not what Henry and his wife SEE it to be? The answer is  we don't know that. The child is bald, big-headed and nasty. Babies are usually such. Or they are such to Lynch, Henry, etc. They didn't need that baby, didn't want it, it caused some troubles to their lives, it changed them for worse, it took their sleep away (actually, this list of pains all the babies bring) - they are definitely not happy with it, so it IS UGLY TO them.This dimension of the movie raises everyday life misfortunes and reflects social consciousness of some family issues. Everything that concerns society and social perception is more or less clear and familiar (like the marriage she -doesn't - want thing). But when it comes to personal visions and submergence you fall into the jack rabbit's hole. Talking about horror effect, the Lady in Radiator is brilliant. She is the most terrible and terrifying thing I have ever seen, but you like her! You can't take your eyes from her, she has a mesmerizing effect of some unknown power. It is disgust, shock, interest, confusion, acid in the mouth, fear, desperation, and paralysis that you feel all at once, almost physically in your body. Her song is just continuing what her dance started  but now she gets the total possession of your mind  the rhythm sticks to you and you can't get it off your head even hours later. In the end, I'd like to point the stunning work at spec effects - the baby is made perfectly, and you don't have a clue, how  you can tell it's alive, a real alive repulsive creature. So, I can't say, that I liked the movie. ""Like"" wouldn't be the word, I don't usually like the movies like that. I don't really have a word for the feeling this masterpiece gives me. What is more, I can hardly call it a movie per se. It's rather a picture. Yes, an alive, moving picture by an artist of some Dadaist or Surrealist circle of the 30s. Now, I feel all the absurdity of a try to explain it  surrealism, cubism, even impressionism, - you have to feel them. Once I had a discussion with a literate individual on Malevich's ""Black Square"". After an hour of my speech, he says he still doesn't understand it, and won't understand it until he hears a SCIENTIFIC explanation. The moment he said that I knew I was wasting my time  ""What a jerk, - I said to myself, - when on earth art needed scientific explanations?"". The attempt to analyze Lynch now reminds me of that talk, and now it's me who acts like my thickheaded friend then. You can't catch the elusive. You can't UNDERSTAND it. You can only SEE it. That's why the Master himself never explained it  because it's not for understanding, it's for seeing your own, unique eraserhead.",Eraserhead
314,Anj-Avraam,Incomprehensible gash,1,28 May 2016,"A man with ridiculous hair goes through a series of torturous torments within a surreal yet consistently monotone unreality, of which a deformed, ever-squealing baby is the epicentre. Completely indecipherable from beginning to end and stupendously, agitatingly boring.I know, to some, this review will come across as mean, or even short-sighted; I'm not denying that David Lynch is a great director who went on to redeem himself handsomely with many far more worthwhile projects, but this film, to me, fails on every level.I consider every film I review on ten different levels to help me stay balanced in my final verdict. The criteria I consider, that I think help me assess a film, are as follows:Overall production quality Entertainment value Interesting Score/Soundtrack Quotability (including memorable shots or scenes) Originality Writing Use of budget Elements fit together Bonus (anything that the film deserves extra credit for in my opinion; this could be clever use of symbolism; exceptional cast; featuring a legendary car chase; etc)Now I actually happen to like weird films, but I still think a weird film should be entertaining in some way. Eraserhead is not. It's a hard watch, and you don't get anything out of it. There are no ingenious developments or revelations, it just drags on and on. Is it interesting? His haircut is interesting I guess, but I don't end up caring about him as a character.Nor is it by any means a beautiful-looking film; the production quality is, well, I could probably get the same quality results using the money I have in my wallet right now, and with the help of the first Media Studies student I wave it at. Obviously you can't do much on $20,000 but I've still seen more done with less. I've certainly seen better writing. And by the way in 1977 you could buy an actual house for twenty grand, just to put that figure in perspective.So on we go without Eraserhead picking up any marks, until we get to Originality. This I can't deny. It is one of a kind, and so accordingly I've given it top marks for that category, which is how come it gets anything at all in my book.Do the elements fit together? Well, I think it's safe to say the film is deliberately jarring so I'm not marking it down. However I'm not marking it up either, because there is no real sense of the story building towards anything, or telling me anything, or reaching a conclusion of any kind. All I'm doing is looking at how much longer I have to sit through this nonsense.Hats off to David Lynch as Eraserhead has undoubtedly served its purpose as his debut feature. It's still talked about as being the weirdest film of all time, but the weirdest thing, in my eyes, is how anyone can genuinely claim that this film is remarkable, as a film. I mean, aside from it being a great marketing gimmick for the director. I think the black and white truth of it is that it hides its lack of substance behind its arty-farty veneer and for that reason it grates on me when people praise it. I don't want to be part of that pretence and I feel I have watched enough weird films and films in general to assert that this one is absolutely one of the worst.",Eraserhead
315,porbeagle_zen,Lynch's gift to cinema,10,6 March 2007,"The first time I heard about ERASERHEAD was as one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films. That alone got me interested, but I was turned off when I read several reviews. It seemed to be weird for weird's sake, like a mash-up of BRAZIL and the FORBIDDEN ZONE.After seeing MULHOLLAND DR., BLUE VELVET and DUNE, I was ready to accept David Lynch as a great moviemaker and storyteller. Biting the bullet, I found myself a copy of the film that had disgusted me a year and a half earlier.Wow. From those first shots of Henry floating in space, to the enigmatic Man in the Planet sitting in his cramped little room, I was hooked. This wasn't a movie- this was an experience. I hadn't been this absorbed by any film since before middle school. When the credits flashed by to Fats Waller's gleeful music, I was shaken- in all the best possible ways.You have to keep in mind that ERASERHEAD is a film aimed at the soul, not at the brain. Yes, not everything will be explained when the credits roll. In fact, most of the imagery isn't explained at all.The story itself is deceptively simple, and not as inaccessible as most reviewers describe. Henry Spencer is an depressed man living in a world of abandoned factories, railyards, and mounds of dirt. His one-room apartment is a Lower East Side tenement from Hell. One evening his temptress neighbor tells him that his ex-girlfriend and her parents have invited him to dinner. This dinner turns out to be perversely awkward (like MEET THE PARENTS on acid), and it so happens that his ex has given birth to... something (imagine the offspring between a raptor from JURASSIC PARK and a human, except in fetal form). Henry is forced to marry his ex, and they live together in his apartment with the ""baby"". Revealing any more would take away from the fun.The cinematography is amazingly beautiful. It seems Lynch and crew have discovered at least ten different variations of ""black"", making film-noir look like THE WIZARD OF OZ. The rumbling, everpresent soundtrack frequently shifts from sensually overwhelming to breathtaking. When the Lady in the Radiator (Henry's muse) sings ""In heaven, everything is fine,"" you are both repulsed by her deformed face and enchanted by one of the most eerie songs in the cinematic universe.It took a grand total of six years from getting financing to putting ERASERHEAD into theaters, and it all seems to have paid off. 1977 is best remembered for giving the world STAR WARS, the beginning of the end of the New Hollywood auteur era. But while studio execs were envisioning the profits of mass-marketed franchises, David Lynch was watching audiences vomit and literally run out of the theater (including the projectionist) at the premier of his first film.Not because it was God-awful, but because it gets into people's heads the way very few other films can.",Eraserhead
316,papp1308,It doesn't tell a story,5,19 September 2020,"Well, I didn't like it. It might be because of my uneducated eye. In a nutshell, it doesn't tell a story.
I know that judging cinema by its ability to narrate is, if not wrong, at least very simplistic. However, some cohesion throughout a film, even if not in the form of strict cause-effect narration, is necessary to catch a viewer's eye. This movie doesn't successfully tie together the monsters and Harry's ""story"". Their relation could be interpreted in an oniric sense but... Meh.
On the other hand, it has some great use of light, and that I admire. Papp",Eraserhead
317,mkczup,A man's personal journey into fatherhood,5,30 May 2012,"The only honest rating one can give a movie like this is a five. It is filled with striking and disturbing imagery, it is slow-moving, and its score is minimalist. For these reasons you will either love it or hate it. It's a movie that doesn't fit into any other genres or rating systems. It is psychological to its core and symbolic in its blood.Many things have been said about Eraserhead, but it is a monster of a different breed and to truly begin to develop an opinion on the film, one must attempt to understand it.I'm going to start out by saying that Eraserhead is not as complicated as people make it out to be. Eraserhead is the autobiographical account of the anxiety experienced by a young man who is struggling with his new life as a a father and provider in a relationship which has taken an unexpected turn. Everything about the film is exaggerated and reeks of fear and dissatisfaction. From the start we feel pulled along by the man in the planet as he pulls Henry's life force out of him (seen as a sperm-like worm). Henry feels a terrifying lack of control as we can clearly see, which only magnifies his sense of isolation at the absence of his lover Mary.We sense Henry's growing anxiety as he meets Mary's family. What once a pleasant clandestine liaison between he and Mary has been interrupted by her insistence on meeting the family. Henry senses something is amiss and his feelings grow more intense as he is exposed to the family's eccentricities. He asked by Mary's father to carve the chicken, a duty reserved typically for the patriarch of a family, and hallucinates a menstruating chicken, a manifestation of his suspicion, which is confirmed in the following scene: Mary is pregnant.Soon it is not simply Mary's family that is encroaching on his personal space, but also Mary herself and their newborn child. We sense that Mary and Henry have become far more distant, but also that Henry feels no personal connection to his unplanned child. The child remains a worm-like fetal abomination. Despite its infant-like qualities, Henry sees it as nothing more than a personified sperm and does his best to repress the remainder of his own worm-like sperm.He fantasizes constantly about life beyond his tiny apartment. He is plagued by the thought of sexual responsibility and through the voices in the radiator he imagines a paradise where his sexual actions have no consequences. It may not be perfect, but to him it means freedom. A world where women swallow.Mary, meanwhile feels overwhelmed at Henry's lack of interest in anything but sex and her new motherly responsibilities. She leaves him in a fit of rage, yet we can see her desperately wishing for Henry to reach out for her as she prolongs her goodbye. Henry is left to care his child, which he feels grossly unprepared for. As the child grows ill he again looks for a way out of his predicament.This way comes in the form of the attractive neighbor, whom Henry uses to escape his responsibilities. He dreams of abandoning his child for a life of freedom, but he knows that inside he was once a child too and imagines what kind of a person he would have been had his father ran out on him. He sees himself as a sperm-like child with an inability to care for himself, just as his child requires his care.This is the first time Henry feels a real connection with his child. He realizes that in order to keep his child healthy and safe he has sacrifice himself and his desires. This culminates in an elaborate scene where Henry hallucinates his own head falling off and bleeding, while a young boy takes it a factory where it is turned into erasers. The eraser dust of his dreams and desires is blown away by the hand of the factory owner. An elaborate illustration of the plight faced by breadwinner who works to feed his family.Next, Henry is faced with a hard task. He has to let go of his fear of fatherhood and embrace his responsibilities. In this final scene Henry destroys his preconceived notions about his child, through a symbolic murder of the worm-like creature. He realizes that only he has control of his actions and through his conquering of his fears destroys the man in the planet. Having accepted his responsibilities and conquered his fears he moves into the light of existentialism.It's a story about sacrifice, fear, responsibility, and single-parenthood. It may or may not be your cup of tea, but it does a remarkable job of expressing the anxiety that a new parent feels.",Eraserhead

But, as you are mystified, baffled, and intrigued, you will also be extremely, extremely disturbed by it's grossly dark nature. You will not know what to make of it by any means. The ending is extremely gross and disturbing. Now, at the same time, one or two parts of the film get kinda boring towards the end of the second act. Overall, a crazy, dark, gritty, gross, mystifying, baffling, weird, strange, and disturbing film that can really never be compared(in terms of the story and the world Lynch creates) to another movie.

To really sink into the movie, the nightmarish psycho mind of henry's thoughts elude him to end up killing his mutant babe, which in the end, brings him to peace.Artistic value is brought up in ever aspect of David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"".

I'm not very good at reviewing things, and only write when I feel REALLY STRONGLY about a film, and this is the film I feel strongest about.  There's just one thing I can't figure out (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT): What significance is it that Henry is a printer, yet they make his head into an eraser?

I don't mind,and in fact actually like, movies which may be ""unconventional"" but nevertheless have a meaning or message to the audience. BUT THIS ? I admit I'm not a David Lynch fan, but Eraserhead was just stupid. Aside from viewing the miserable existance of the protagonist's life-for no real reason- other annoying factors include that ""woman"" behind the radiator, who just sings endlessly, and goes on and on, I just wished she would stop, it got so unbearable.

Your'e gonna hate them after have watched this... Intense, dark, drone-filled, disturbing, weird, genius! My few words can hardly describe what I think about this film, but I must say my repertoire in English vocabulary is not too big, sorry..;-)FOR ME THIS IS ESSENTIAL FILM-MAKING! REDUCE TO THE MAXIMUM!!! This film has no ""normal"" story-line or something. This is pure nightmare, a bad trip experience. Welcome to your deepest, deepest inner thoughts! I would call ERASERHEAD an ""anti-film""! See this as a big, BIG compliment! Not creating a complicated story, trying to make you laugh or cry or whatever, but catching the viewers senses, crushing and mangling them, and leaving you back very very disturbed! Leaving you being brainfucked, thinking about it, and you know that you have seen a very very special and unique piece of art. I would call this a minimalistic, nihilistic statement.For sure, without those all-disturbing sound walls the film would not function in his intensity. I think this sound (...perhaps the whole film) is a big inspiration for drone groups like EARTH and sunno))), who I love and who I highly recommend to those who like and love the mechanical, disturbing and annoying sounds of ERASERHEAD.I DON'T think that you've got to be a crazy freak or a underground horror fanatic or some weird folk to love ERASERHEAD. Though I think that ERASERHEAD is not for everybody. You gotta be some kind of open-minded and you have to have the will of getting disturbed, you gotta have to have the ability to let yourself fall and be taken on a journey through darkest pictures, thoughts and sounds; some kind of masochism wouldn't be wrong;-) Maybe this IS for weird folks only..?! I don't know... I think I'm no strange guy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this film! Yeah, I'm very into those movies who are leaving you disturbed. Some examples? The Evil Dead, Man Bites Dog, The Ring, The Blair Witch Project, Brasil, Kafka, some of my all time favorites, highly recommended to those who like ERASERHEAD.Enough said..This is an all-inspiring masterpiece!

324,jakejoseph-05058,Dark and mesmerizing surrealism,9,7 July 2021,"I didn't understand nor appreciate David Lynch until I watched Eraserhead last night. I learned this film directly inspired The Shining, and much like Kubricks horror masterpiece, David lynch's Eraserhead pulls no punches in its obscurity.It's a beautifully black and white film about a man returning from vacation to his dystopian, post-industrial hometown, where he rejoins his wife and newborn mutant infant as they struggle to maintain sanity. (This is about as simply as a person could boil down the plot, the story itself is 100% metaphorical and I'm sure anyone you'd ask would give a different interpretation.)Having said that, the art direction in Eraserhead is like nothing I've ever witnessed. From the opening sequence and peppered throughout, your shown images of our wide eyed, bushy haired protagonist floating sideways staring at you. He floats in front of an all black screen with black matted imagines of (what appears to be) spinal cords, or parasites, or worms.He makes his way through the foggy urban hell scale towards home, a small dilapidated row home where his ""nuclear family"" await him. The whole thing feels like a waking nightmare. His wife cries constantly, his crying mutant baby requires constant care, the mother-in-law creepily makes a pass at the protagonist.Nothing in this movie feels real or normal. Every human interaction and facial expression is slowed to a crawl, the use of horror props and set design is so deliberate. The acting is so iconically strange and well orchestrated (especially from the protagonist).Lynch raises many important existential questions through subtle imagery and metaphorical contexts, and ultimately Eraserhead was a vessel to express his deep-dark criticism.This film accomplished horror in a way that's never been done before: through unwavering obscurity. Eraserhead is palpably dark and mesmerizing, and it will follow you forever.",Eraserhead
325,fakeatbeingasnob,Not going to pretend I understand it.,10,5 February 2021,"First of, this is one of those rare films where if you give it a 1, I totally get it and vice versa. This film does not hold your hand at all and there really is no plot. In fact there is barley any dialogue at all. And yet for reasons I cannot explain I was put in a trance by this film. I was horrified and mesmerized at the same time. I never wanted it to stop and I was begging for the credits to roll at the same time. I like to believe that I am an objective person. There are movies I found boring or flat out didn't like but I was able to acknowledge that when you break them down piece by piece (Acting, editing, cinematography, etc) I am unable to label them as bad films.I will tell you right now that I JUST finished Eraserhead and these are the immediate thoughts that come to my head. The rating I gave this film is based of my own personal experience. I was confused as to what was happening, didn't understand the metaphors, can't even begin to imagine where to start disecting this film. By all accounts I should be calling this movie pretentious. I should have hated it but I don't. I love it. No other film has made my heart pump like this one and in all honesty I don't know why. But isn't that the beauty of film? How 2 people can watch the same movie and have completely different reaction? I recommend you simply watch it and see for yourself. I guarantee you will hardly understand anything. Maybe you will finish it and make plans to watch it again soon or maybe you'll be repulsed by it. See for yourself. I will end with this. Just because a movie is confusing does not mean that it is pretentious and just because a movie is confusing does not mean that it is a work of art. Pretentious is such a subjective term and I have seen it used to describe many films that I do not believe to be pretentious in the slightest. You look up any movie on IMDB and you will see 10 star reviews for horrible films and 1 star reviews for incredible films. I read reviews to see what others thought about the movie after I have watched it but PLEASE do not make up your mind about a film based of someone else's review.So that's my ""review"" if you can even call it that. Love it or hate it, there is no other movie like it and after I recover from the near heart attack the movie gave me I will watch it again.P.S WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH HEADPHONESThe best aspect of the movie by FAR is the sound. It's kind of like if Jaws did not have that iconic score. It would not be the same. The Sound offers so much atmosphere and is in my opinion more than half the experience. You don't need a fancy expensive sound system although that is preferable. I personally just hooked up my blue tooth headset and buckled in for the ride.",Eraserhead
326,emiranda13,Wish I had that hour and a half back,1,1 August 2019,"Everyone knows David Lynch's works are weird. That said, Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet were both highly entertaining.

327,minmax,"The worst kind of pseudo-surrealistic garbage disguised as ""art.""",1,25 March 2005,"I normally don't like to badmouth a film, even a bad one. I try to find some sort of redeeming value for the time I invested, even if it's just to laugh at the badness.This film however takes the cake. I want my 88 minutes back. I want to kick David Lynch's behind. The only ""power"" this movie had for me was the power to sicken and irritate.Art films are fine. There are many out there. ""The Seventh Sign"" by Ingmar Bergman for example. Watch those not this. I've always prided myself on attempting to be cultured enough to watch even the most tedious of art films and find something redeeming or artistic.OK, OK, I'm ranting. This film is THAT bad. It's made far worse by the vast amount of praise it gets when, in my opinion, it's a sophomoric attempt at surrealistic grandeur.Lynch has serious problems. I might have been willing to give the movie a 2 or a 3 for at least attempting to be artsy but then I watched the extras and was subjected to him stuttering on (even more time he owes me) in disjointed paroxysms about how awesome the drawer of pudding and peas was, etc. *sigh* Many reviewers here have already said things like this and I want to back them up! The Art Institute that gave him the grant should have been shut down (and possibly brought up on charges for damage to the psyche of viewers). This film really is, as one person here put it, like ""The Emporers New Clothes."" All right, alright, I'll calm down and try to give a more direct synopsis: **SPOILER ALERT: MILD SPOILERS AHEAD** The film is set in a dreamy sepia-toned gritty world of industrial decay. The characters seem to follow no known pattern of behavior, the ""monsters"" are very, VERY poorly animated (in the opening sequence you can actually see the strings...maybe THAT was supposed to be artsy too?), the FX are simplistic, and even the dialogue is secondary to the parade of lighting and attempted artsy camera-work that fails abysmally by being both unnecessary, overwrought and FAR TOO TEDIOUS.While it's obvious, especially after listening to Lynch's monologue, that there ARE some themes going here, parental fear, fatherhood and the nascent horror of being, the actual delivery of the film is so languid and...words just don't exist to describe it...overwrought, overreaching, etc. are the best I can do...that the film made me almost catatonic while watching it.I will concede that there are many people who might enjoy this, especially those who enjoy disjointed and/or viscerally disgusting images.OK, I take one thing back: there IS one redeeming thing about the film that being the sounds. In their ability to raise one's hackles they succeed (and I have to think that was part of what Lynch was trying to do). The ongoing, seemingly incessant strange thumpings and undertones of distant factory noises, is like Chinese water torture. If that's what he was trying to accomplish then the film ""succeeded"" in that one way. Not something to be proud of or praised for. I could as easily listen to fingernails on a chalkboard for 88 minutes and get as much artistic value out of it. To say nothing of entertainment.Movies are made to entertain, that is their function and reason for being. This film does not entertain, it sickens, repulses and BORES. I cannot recommend enough avoiding this sepia-toned waste of celluloid.P.S. I apologize for the rant but it's just THAT BAD and I feel it my civic duty to warn viewers.P.P.S. What the heck was with those cheeks???! I kept expecting cockroaches to burst from them or something. Sick.",Eraserhead

A portion out of a mixed bag of life,10,6 May 2013,"The movie title 'Eraserhead' made me to expect this movie as a normal sci-fi thriller and even I thought the poster of that movie is misleading me. But when I watched this movie, it did really blow my mind out and I am really happy that I really chose this movie to watch, because this is not a movie this is just a mirror of life in deft style. Many a times whenever we go through a nightmare we feel that we are out of our mind we have something in our mind called sub-conscious that view or think things weirdly, that is the same sub-conscious is what David Lynch should thank himself, because at the time he made this movie his sub-conscious mind was at peak I think, so that he could create something which could not be re-created anymore not even by himself. Similar to some people I also feel that this movie is surely a cult in itself. Many gifted directors like David Lynch really use their sub-conscious mind a lot because creating a non repeatable movies like this which requires equally that much enormous amount of creativity.We keep saying that life is a mixed bag which prominently holds mostly happiness and sorrow, yes Lynch here outlines all those in a his own dimension. He uses symbols as his main tool for encryption of his facts he wanted to portray here, these facts aren't analyzable in a uniform way because these facts may vary for person to person depending on their mindset and that's just what the David Lynch wanted!This movie not everybody's cup of tea.

Film does not have to be about boring plot lines in order to entertain. Lynch filmed his dreams and we can get a glimpse of whats going on in his mind. Very personal stuff and a brave film to boot.

This film to me feels like someone got lost in the Twilight zone and i didn't have Rod Serling there to tell me why he was there, what was happening to him, or what the theme of the episode was suppose to be. This movie does not have any kind of plot or structure, it's more like an art house project that is suppose to be taking a look at what absurd means.

It is certainly a visually stunning piece of work, with a very particular attention toward lighting (which helps to ignite a very moody atmosphere) worthy of attention, but other than that, it falls flat. If Lynch had any other intention with this film aside from to make a visually pretty, so-called 'WEIRD' and abnormal film, than I'd be hard-pressed to find an individual who actually managed to tap into what his intentions on actual content were. If you liked the artfulness of this film, then I'd like to encourage you to do some real art- house film homework, because you will find there are actually visual and *really bizarre* films out there that manage to either a) contain an engaging plot or b) possess enough intellectual content to get you thinking (neither of which this possesses)...

David Lynch's first feature length film that consisted of 21 pages of script and was stretched out to 1 hour and 48 minutes of indulgent strangeness. I rented this so I can see what else the creator of Blue Velvet had done earlier. What I found was obviously an experimental piece that has less plot than a Kafka story. To say that one scene to the next is discontinuous is to be very generous. It is a nightmare more than a movie; a collection of scenes and fantasies thrown together under one roof for no apparent reason other than to see what it is like. It's like 20 different ideas juxtaposed in a collage with none leading to any conclusion or explanation. Interesting but why?

It's the movie equivalent of a fever dream.David Lynch risked a lot for this film and from it we get a taste of what he is all about. It's a movie that is completely him and his style. Every filmmaker should have a movie they can call their Eraserhead. A film that is their stylistic and personal calling card. Something that will mess with minds or freak you out.This movie paved the way for Lynch to continue in the film business and spread his genius further, but it may not have been possible without this freaky debut.I love this film so much. Even if it's not so digestible or entertaining in the conventional sense, I just find it so inspirational, engaging and haunting. The cinematography is amazing, the direction is out of the box and the performances have this aura of dark comedy about them. So much so that they boost the mood of the picture.And then there's the sound. Possible one of the most ambient and lively sounding films out there. It's a pretty industrialised sound that stays in your head ages after watching it. It's incredibly mesmerising.This movie is a classic in cinema and one of the most important films I've ever seen. It's an acquired taste but it's too interesting not to watch at least once.",Eraserhead
342,stjones01,Hmm...,8,2 April 2012,"With the notion that this could quite possibly be the most difficult film to critique, it is important to know that rating 'Eraserhead' on a scale of 1 to 10 is pointless. So why did I do it then? I thought 8 was a reasonable number, because it is high enough to garner attention (which this film definitely deserves), but low enough to suggest that it is not one of the greatest film achievements of our time. With that in mind, I'll begin my exercise in futility. Excluding all of the surreal events and scenes (which may or may not contain symbolic significance), the plot is fairly straightforward. Henry Spencer works at a printing press, and is on vacation. He is invited to his girlfriend's (Mary's) house to have dinner with her and her family (The Xs). Upon visiting, he's informed that Mary had given birth prematurely, and that he had an obligation to marry her. From that point forward, the film delves deeper and deeper into Henry's psyche, as he is bombarded with the consequences of his situation, psycho- sexual imagery, thoughts of suicide, and hellish fantasies. Those who have seen ""Eraserhead"" will testify that it is undoubtedly the most bizarre film ever created--they could very well be correct in saying so. It would be unjust for me to elaborate, because excessively describing any of the surreal scenes in the film would cheat any would-be viewers out of the surprises the film has to offer. David Lynch has referred to this film as ""a dream of dark and troubling things"", and the film is closer to that description than any other film before it. It is as if Lynch has analyzed every aspect of a nightmare and created a film from them. The black and white color scheme was a good choice, seeing that some dreams take on a colorless form. Other aspects of the cinematography contribute to the enigmatic, sinister vibe of a nightmarish vision. The beginning shot that sets this disturbing, abstract nightmare in motion is an extremely unsettling image; one that has stuck with me since the first viewing. When making a movie, it is important to establish a connection between the audience and the main character. Lynch has accomplished this with little to no character development whatsoever. There is no deep back-story provided for Henry. He never gives a gut-wrenching, insightful, Oscar-worthy monologue to win the audience over. Lynch instead uses the barren, bleak, and uninspired landscapes as his medium for characterization. The strange sense of isolation Lynch creates as Henry stumbles through his nightmare is an indirect way of personality-building. Henry is alone, helpless, and doomed, and the audience is right there with him every step of the way. The screenplay is staggered; sparse. Nightmares may contain this awkward pause-filled dialogue, but seeing these conversations play out in a movie comes across as a disturbing mess, because much of what little dialogue there is in this movie simply makes no sense at all. ""Makes no sense at all""; this impulsive statement is unfortunately a good description for the bulk of the movie. The film has prompted many responses from audiences, including hand-to-mouth surprised expressions, as well as knee-slapping laughter (to name a few). When critiquing art, the comment that a piece ""makes no sense"" is an irrelevant and juvenile judgment. Art doesn't have to make sense--by that rationale, films don't have to make sense either. Reviewing this film is like critiquing the abstract pieces of Jackson Pollock, or Salvador Dali-- ultimately, there is nothing bad or good about this movie. What is certain, though, is that Lynch has created one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. 4/5",Eraserhead
343,cbrunson100,"maybe art, but not a narrative",3,22 January 2007,"Before the advent of film and radio and television, elders told stories to their juniors. Some started with the phrase, 'Once upon a time...' and others started, 'A long time ago in a land far away...' What they had in common was that they were narratives; they told a story with a beginning and end; the stories went somewhere. 'Eraserhead' goes nowhere, which is okay as long as the viewer knows what to expect. If I go to an art gallery I don't expect all the paintings or photos to work together to tell a story, but when I see a movie, I do. 'Eraserhead' is like a disjointed dream, where events happen without reason or rationale and immune to the ordinary rules of genetics. I think Lynch is very creative and imaginative and a talented cinematographer, but he is no story-teller in this effort. I liked the B/W treatment and I thought the movie has terrific visual impact, but very poor narrative. It's almost as if Lynch had been given 10 different story elements to put in a single story but couldn't tie them all together. Who is The Man in the Planet and what do the broken windows, levers, sores and twitches represent? What does the burned-meatball-of-a-planet mean? No one seems to want to discuss these items. Does it mean anything or is it all part of a inexplicable nightmare? I recommend the movie for its visuals and quirkiness but it's a bust as anything else.I have read the 'fear of parenthood' theories and the 'fear of aging' theories and the 'fear of intimacy' theories, but none of those make sense to me in the movie's context. And maybe Lynch wanted to make a movie that wasn't sensible or logical. If so, mission accomplished!",Eraserhead
344,james-re,Genuinely feels like a nightmare,10,31 October 2019,"Possibly the most accurate depiction in cinema of how a nightmare looks, sounds and feels. The dark cramped spaces, the unusual behaviour from the people around me, repetitive uncomfortable sounds. This film has it all. In fact it captures it so well that once youre watching it you barely even question it. It instantly grips you with its surreal imagery and hypnotic sound design. Yet when I was sitting there watching eraserhead and seeing such strangeness, I barely even questioned it. It was as if I didn't need to. It was like stepping into a dream. How can something so utterly strange feel so familiar. It is as if lynch has gone into the dark recesses of my mind and pulled out my secret fears and desires and presented them to me in an incredibly abstract yet deeply powerful way.
Calling it a horror film which its often labelled feels wrong, this thing goes beyond that. It goes deeper. Forget about classifying it into a genre. It's a film that even defies words. Just don't even try to sum it up in words. You'll sound like a fool. This is something that you immerse yourself in. This is something that needs to be experienced",Eraserhead
345,nikonanii,"Lynch as a poor reader of Kafka, and a strong viewer of Welles",6,4 January 2016,"I don't believe that David Lynch is much of a reader. I strongly believe that his ""attachment"" to the ""surreal"" is entirely an excuse for his style, not the cause. The viewer gets the feeling that his grandiose scenes were thought out first -- and at the barrage of critics and their ilk, Lynch, running to his local library, ran to the ""kind of weird Freudian fiction"" section, grabbed a Kafka, and went, ""well, I mean, must I say more?""His characters definitely should have said less. The ticking of clocks, the the steaming sounds of the radiator, the puling of the ""child"", prove far more effective than the few banal (and poorly mixed!) words from Henry's mouth. Lynch, while generally visually talented, clearly had no idea how to present the dialogue of the film as visually as he presented its connotation. Hence, superfluous dialogue to help even the slowest viewers. Perhaps to help himself remember that the film is ""well, kind of like this German guy, Kafka!""Kafka isn't the predecessor; it's Welles, specifically ""The Trial"". ""The Trial"" is Welles' personal reading of Kafka; ""Eraserhead"" is Lynch's personal viewing of ""The Trial"". And there is much insight between the two; but little of it solely that of ""Eraserhead"".Make sure the volume is up high.",Eraserhead
346,serriricky,An absolute nightmare,8,11 May 2021,"This film is a nightmare, in every sense. The plot sees a man, named Henry Spencer, who finds himself having to look after his son, who was born prematurely. The fetus does not look human, but looks more like an alien.In this view you will not find a classic setting of a story. This film is not linear. In fact, very often, you will find yourself disoriented in the face of the irreconcilability of certain scenes. The structure that we will face will be that of how we remember a dream, or with a lack of continuity and vague and senseless moments. Despite the appearance, I will not consider it a horror film, but more a film purely focused on disturbing the viewer. The scenes that we will face are made in such a way as to increase a feeling of disgust and discomfort in the viewer. Black and white accentuates shadows and darks, making the film look more bleak and sinister. The characters are incredibly surreal and disturbing due to their behavior and looks. It is not a film that tries to scare you with blood or violence but wants to haunt you with its atmosphere, its construction and its language.I think this film is a masterpiece of its kind. Not one of my all time favorite films, but undeniably important for what it brought. With this film, David Lynch brought a new genre to the world of cinema. Its absolute uniqueness makes it a very important film even today.",Eraserhead

I'm surprised i lasted the full running time. i don't think there's a film out there that i've seen, that has made me want to pierce my eyes and ears more than when i watched eraserhead (ok, 'love, actually'). And maybe its designed to make you feel uncomfortable, maybe that's part of its 'power', but to me that doesn't make it a good film.as far as i know, there are very few people who would actually take pleasure in wanting to stab themselves in the eye.To its credit, its a film open to interpretation, but all the people i know who enjoyed it are annoying film students who like to over analyse movies (but if he puts his hand there, what does that mean???... er nothing) and look as if their cultured and have a grasp of film language.Watch it if you like, you may take something away from it that i missed or ignored, but don't say i didn't warn you if you find your eye on the end of a fork.",Eraserhead

Is it in the name of art I watched close up after close up of some guys head who is staring at the wall with annoying background noise.  This makes it the laziest film I've ever seen it is as if Lynch just turned up every day and filmed a particularly uninteresting wall and threw in some words here and there if the thought passed his mind.

It's a deformed world but he lives in it. Other people prefer to say that it's all fantasy or , on the opposite , it's all real but caused by aliens.

350,ScorpioAscending,Does anyone else find this film beautiful?,9,29 March 2000,"Most of the comments I have read define this film as ""darkly disturbing"" or something to that end. I may be the only person on the planet who found it disturbing, and beautiful at the same time. I didn't try to make much sense of it, rather I let it consume me. I think I watched it in the best way possible, other than the theater. I just now watched it as a teen, and sat about a foot away from a 12 inch TV, with a pair of headphones plugged into it and the lights off in my room at 1:30 in the morning. It was a disk of the laserdisk that was released in Japan, and the Japanese subtitles served to add to the surrealism.The reason it was beautiful lies in the sound, the shot composition, the timing (particularly the elevator ride), the dream sequence the dog, and the embrace of the radiator lady with the dust dancing and the blinding, warm light.More disturbing than this film is the amount of people who post messages describing how much they disliked it, and the amount of people who posted what they thought to be the ""obvious meaning"" behind it. There is no definite meaning, you find your own which is relevant to you, and you recognize that it is not the ""one true meaning.""

There is virtually no dialogue, much less meaningful dialogue.

The film revolves around Jack Nance and takes us through the sub-conscious of both his and the director David Lynch's disturbed minds. The symbolism used in the film is often times deliciously disturbing in a ""dismembered bodies in a car-crash"" sort of way. And the score for the flick is amazing. Lynch did the score and it's this type of ""audio-holocaust"" that continues through the entire flick. A dreary, depressing, droning sound that really sets the mood. The symbolism is difficult to understand as is the story... if you can call it that. Because of such a vague storyline, we the viewers have the opportunity to interpret and play out the story in our own minds to however we see fit.

359,TheBryanWay,Best Possible Example of Film as an Abstract Art,10,14 January 2005,"When on the hunt for cult films, this one should not be overlooked. Filmed over the course of five years (1972-1977), this film is the very first full-length masterpiece of artist David Lynch. I say artist because he began not as a director, but an art student. Finding canvas too confining, he moved on celluloid, eventually moving on to AFI to fund his script 'Eraserhead'. According to Lynch, the film was inspired largely by his stay in Philadelphia. To know how he views it, the film must be seen.The script itself was only 21 pages long, so it was assumed to be roughly a 21 minute movie; most people wouldn't expect that the film would be a living, breathing piece of art.The elements of the film cannot even be understood by film scholars. Lynch himself has said that in the 25 or more years it has been out that no critic or viewer has given an interpretation that is in line with his own. There appear to be prevalent themes of sexuality and conception, not to mention claustrophobia and physical discomfort in simply living. The film is definitely very affecting on a visceral level in certain scenes where Lynch appears to deconstruct the simplicity of family life and bring to the surface the inherent disgusting nature of feeding. Near the end, simple curiosity gets the best of the main character, played extraordinarily well-reserved by Jack Nance, and his mistake ends up causing his world to fall apart. Overall, the film logic seems to be one of a nightmare, an open-ended metaphor dealing with one man's fear of fatherhood.Put simply, there is no other film like it. Not even Lynch's later work can compare. This is on the must-see list for any film student, however, it may be annoying and make absolutely no sense to the casual viewer.",Eraserhead

My parents told me this was the worst movie they had ever seen, but I decided to see it since it was already on my Netflix queue.Back to the review. Tool came out in the 1990s and Eraserhead came out in 1977. Tool's music videos are haunting and disturbing and magnificent. They also have very great heavy metal music. This movie is almost psychic.

The plot does not really matter; it is more of a chronicle of different occurrences than a story. However, the film captivates you with it's atmosphere; all aspects of the film contribute to a hypnotic, nightmarish feeling. For one, all of the actors have a very bizarre way of enunciating their words, where they talk slowly and with stilted pronunciation. Almost no context is given to the world this film occupies; only two characters have names, and even then, they are only first names. The soundtrack is nothing but whirring industrial sounds and shrieking sirens, which makes sense considering the factory surroundings the main character occupies. While the film is very abstract, it is definitely very interesting. This movie is something you will either love or hate; my review will not help you decide.

Nine years prior to the debut of Lynch's Eraserhead Jennifer Lynch was born filling David with fear and uncertainty about his own ability to raise his daughter. These struggles in David's life can be seen represented in Eraserhead in sequences such as the crying baby scene, and meeting Mary's parents. Dealing with a crying baby and meeting a partners parents are normal events that cause anxiety in anyone's life, but for Henry they are the most terrifying and uncomfortable experiences of his life. The baby's skin melts and bugs crawl out, while the parents miss every mark to have a normal conversation, with the mom beginning to scream and moan uncontrollably while the chicken bleeds and squirms. These events result in Henry contemplating suicide multiple times represented by the Lady in the Radiator and the song that she sings. Eventually resulting in Henry finally taking his own life to escape from the hardship and uncertainty of his mundane existence. Eraserhead is shocking and hard to sit through at times, especially on the first watch through. However it is worth multiple viewings and is a must see for any serious film fan. With every watch through something new can be seen whether it be surface level or deep insight into the uncertainty's of life and fatherhood.",Eraserhead

368,D Kieckh,Subliminal imagery,9,28 February 2000,"A few minutes from the beginning of Eraserhead is a single image which unlocks the whole film - a nearly abstract shot from above the radiator, with a sock drying between the third and fourth coils.  The first two radiator coils form an `H'.  The sock's placement suggests the letter `O', and the remaining verticals complete a jolting likeness of the famous sign in the Hollywood hills.  Henry's walk home, the puddle, and the wet sock are simply a `deus ex machina' leading to this shot.It turns out that the radiator plays a major role  it is home to the only semblance of entertainment in the whole movie.  (In a way it takes the place of a television set in the apartment.)  In its next appearance the radiator opens onto a stage, and later a dolled-up girl comes onstage to sing and dance.  The song is a caricature of Hollywood:  `In Heaven, everything is fine!/You've got your good things, and I've got mine.'  Eventually this becomes  `...you've got mine,' pointing to Hollywood's seductive use of glamour.The indication is that Eraserhead is about Lynch's struggle with Hollywood.

Anyhow, those were my opinions of the film, as for reasons: the worst lighting and sound I have ever witnessed; nearly nonexistent dialogue; multiple shots of over 20 seconds wherein it was not possible to know if it is merely one still frame, or just no movement; and finally, a dinner scene that haunted my memories for days.

370,daniel_damaged,"creepy, original, thought-provoking",9,23 August 2000,"This is a film that has to be viewed again and again to even begin to understand what the film is about. I've read many interpretations of the film, though i've found them interesting i've never really been satisfied with any of them. I'm not sure if David Lynch had a direct meaning behind the film but i'm pretty sure he wanted people to make up their own interpretation. What i love about this film is the imagery, it's so dark and bleak but really beautiful as well. The fact the film was made in black and white makes it all the better because you couldn't put a date on the film, it could be from 20 years ago or 20 years in the future. You can't even figure out if it's reality or a dream most of the time or is it on another planet? The sound (created by David Lynch) is pretty amazing on this film as well, it's like the first ever ""ambient industrial noise"" music and it fits the film perfectly. Overall, a creepy, original, thought-provoking, scary film that will stick with you for a long time, it's also my favourite David Lynch film",Eraserhead
371,Vedder13,"""In Heaven, everything is fine""",10,21 December 2001,"Eraserhead is one of the most difficult movies to categorise into one genre. David Lynch's cult directorial debut is a disturbing, thought-provoking, bizarre and scary tale of a depressed and lonely man named Henry (brilliantly played by Lynch regular Jack Nance) who is forced into marriage after his spastic girlfriend gives birth to a premature ""baby"" who craves his attention.The plot sounds simple enough except it isn't. It takes so many different topics (original sin and forgiveness, premarital sex, suicide) and moulds it into a well-crafted ""experience"" full of over-the-top symbolism, scary sound effects and Jack Nance's crazy hair. Nothing is pretty in this brilliant movie. Plus it is also filmed in gritty black and white to enhance Henry's nightmarish world.A lot of people don't like this movie. Some say it's makes no sense, others say its way too disturbing. I believe it isn't supposed to make any sense, and for all those people who don't like disturbing movies can go back to mainstream Hollywood films.If you haven't seen Eraserhead (and view yourself as a serious movie watcher) I highly recommend that you do. It is a monumental achievement in modern film history. And when you do, watch it by yourself with no distractions, in the dark, late at night with the volume turned high. This is the best way to experience this movie.10/10",Eraserhead

What is missing in this movie is any sort of soul, plot, or character development. I enjoyed it in the sense I would enjoy art at a museum but it is hardly a coherent film much less a masterpiece. I could go for incoherent scenes one after the other but many of them are simply uninteresting and you are left with 90 minutes of bizarre nonsense.The meaning I see is the main character killing his mutant child as a form of catharsis for his screwed up life, which he won't get anyways.

There is no more than two lines in the first 15 minutes of the film. Then as people start talking you wonder WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE COME FROM?! My first viewing of this film was most mesmerizing. C.G. Jung would be very proud of this masterpiece! Stanley Kubrick also said this was his favorite film and he saw over 30 times. It is a tale of confusion, solitude, and alienation. This film isn't for everyone, but i think it the most original work of art in cinematic history. Lynch was way ahead of his time in making this. People these days are more used to seeing this sort of metaphysical and strange material. I can imagine how hard it would be back then to even think Eraserhead had any realistic quality at all. But like most of Lynch's film's, it takes the audience 5-10 years to except his film for their greatness since they are so far out there. Lynch still hasn't made as perfect film as Eraserhead to this day.",Eraserhead

376,stormcrow225,A frightening but humorous dream within a dream within a dream...,10,7 December 2010,"If you ever wanted to see a nightmare on film, David Lynch's first feature film, Eraserhead, pretty much fills the bill. Filmed over a three year period (Lynch was a film student at the time and kept running out of resources but stayed persistent in seeing it completed), it tells the story of...well...um...that's a good question. There is a relationship, and a mutant baby and man-made chickens and a man in a dark planet and bum knees and a woman in a radiator who sings and a machine that makes erasers out of people's heads (but that might have been just a dream...inside of a dream...or something like that)... well, I think you get the idea. Eraserhead (like many of Lynch's later films) has its own dream logic that, for some inexplicable reason, works (that is, *if* you allow yourself to be absorbed into its world and throw reason aside for its 89 minute running time) and you find yourself understanding it without really understanding it. Yeah, it's *that* weird. It's also a film that is bizarrely humorous while being disturbing and frightening at the exact same time. Most people don't ""get"" this movie but those who do LOVE it and find themselves returning to it again and again. I'm definitely in the latter group and have Eraserhead on my ""short list"" of all time favorite films. My daughter is also in love with Eraserhead and we frequently quote lines from it to each other whenever the opportunity presents itself.",Eraserhead
377,ryan42790,A Love it Or Hate it Deal,10,29 August 2007,"Plot: Just looking at the basic Plot, it doesn't seem that far fetch as the movie portrays it. Never the less, it is a truly gripping plot that can make u think.Acting:Not Oscar worthing performances, but u can tell that the actors and actresses followed completely in the direction that Lynch wanted them too, which I give them the tip of the hat.Mood: Very Dark, basically the closest to black than any other film I have Ever seen. Though The Lady in The Radiator brings a little bit of light to the movie considering she looks creepy, but she looks really happy,and innocent.Directing:The Films Highest Point. Lynch's camera work and patience give the film such an amazing effect. The Film could've been turned to garbage if it was someone else.Personal Thoughts: This truly, a very emotional film. I know many people would disagree by stating ""O, the characters are too 1 dimensional."" I believe that the lack of emotion the actors show, makes the film so much more emotional. The fact that the characters act the way they do with all the craziness around them makes the viewer realize of the true alienation one might feel towards a society which is also madness. This is a Dark Beauty that radiates amazingly. It challenges the viewer (Which some people do not like) with their patience and imagination. It Carries its own unique message about the personal human psyche, and society.Yeah Its very Weird, But Its Art, and great Art isn't always easy to digest.",Eraserhead
378,Videoloot,Utter Crap,1,5 December 2012,"I can see why all these film school students, hipsters and self acclaimed art gurus love this movie. It goes against anything you would expect a movie to be. There is nothing to understand about any aspect of what is shown.I can understand people feel baffled and amazed after seeing this but just because it provokes those feelings doesn't make it a good movie. To me this movie is the equivalent of some 'painter' randomly splattering paint and swinging a brush against a canvas. The 'artist' doesn't even have to explain anything, just give his work an obscure title and due to the mere fact that it can be connected to anything the viewer wants, it is transformed by criticism into a 'mysterious unexplainable masterpiece'.To go against the general opinion is kind of like swimming against the current but if you look at what the general public has accomplished in the past, you could only describe them as asinine, delusional and amnesic. Which, in many cases gives me all the more reason to doubt the validity of the general opinion.In my opinion, this movie is just a deranged mess of ideas, held together by many moments of awkward and nonsensical moments. I could see some references to the circle of life and death but it was far from profound or inspiring. All in all it was depressing to watch, it would've been more entertaining to have hung myself upside down for 1 hour and 28 minutes.",Eraserhead

380,MarvinCandle,Extraordinary and beyond bizarre. A surreal masterpiece,9,14 January 2010,"I watched this expecting a ""different"" kind of movie, but that doesn't even come close. From the very opening scene everything about it makes it unique, the sounds, pictures, the wonderfully unusual way its directed. Watching it is not like watching an ordinary film, its more like being in a Ripley's Believe it or not theater. Don't let the black & white scare you, Eraserhead is way ahead of it's time. David Lynch's portrayal of a nightmarish world is beyond imagination and totally unpredictable. Telling what it's about doesn't really do any good, that's part of the point of this movie, is to figure out what's really going on for yourself. The answer is different for everyone because it's messages mean something different for everyone.Don't go into it expecting usual David Lynch, it's not a movie with a straight-lined plot. When I first started watching I had that wrong mindset and thought it was kind of boring. But after watching again I realized you can't try and figure out what Henry's doing or what's happening while watching. Just watch and take everything in and let your sub-conscience think about what it means. Though slow and bizarre at times there is a lot going on, possibly multiple sets of symbolism and that's what makes it difficult to get a hold of, if you're too focused on discovering the meaning. The message is dark and disturbing but important, and in the end, I personally believe, has a positive note to it.It's not for everyone but if you like stuff that makes you think, or like really weird stuff, watch this movie. Or if you're just tired of the usual, hero fights against enemy-saves crowd-sleeps with a girl-gets rewards type story; I'm not sure what category Eraserhead fits into, it probably doesn't. It's a masterpiece of abstract art that deserves more attention. I wish there were more movies like it.",Eraserhead
381,the_jesus_2000,A masterpiece of cinema. A boring one.,8,15 June 2008,"Here is a classic, one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films if that mean anything to you. Like Lynch efforts after this, it is a puzzle to decipher but of course with no set solution. There are two movies that have one occurrence of music where it is instantly memorable and sticks out it the film. One is Deliverance with the Dueling Banjos, and this film with the song ""In heaven everything is fine"" . That song just gives me creeps me out and is hauntingly beautiful at the same time.It's confusing but that only adds to what the films main objective is. To make you feel like you are in a nightmare. Like a nightmare, things are illogical and doesn't make sense. Jack Nances performance is chilling as an everyman with a one of a kind haircut that must have inspired old school hip-hop artists. If this is a nightmare, then what cold reality awaits the protagonist when he wakes up?Truly a disturbing and unforgettable film.",Eraserhead

I love movies which force me to think about them. I love to have my head full of ideas and thoughts while I'm leaving the cinema. No doubt that Eraserhead by David Lynch force people to think about it but there are many questions and not even one answer. I share the meaning of some that David Lynch wants people to be angry while the  film is over (and probably long time before the end).May be it's art, may be it's bull****, all-in-all it is not my cup of tea. I haven't found any possible reason why to rank it better than 3 (out of 10). It was hard to decide but there is nothing but some impressive moments and excellent actors performance.",Eraserhead
383,DanSTC,A dark dream of disturbing things...,10,4 November 2002,"First of all, let me say that Eraserhead is not a film for everyone.  Many people will find themselves confused by the strange atmosphere, surreal imagery, and signature David Lynch sense of purposefully awkward pacing.That out of the way, I would have to say that this is possibly one of my most personal favorite films.  It is dark, tense, atmospheric, and filled with sounds and images that will send chills up your spine.  It is a film that takes more than one viewing to truly begin to comprehend, but is quite a ride nontheless.  There are moments in this movie that will literally scare you, so much so that one could almost call this eerie surreal art-film a deconstructed domestic horror movie.  This film, along with the original black and white Night of the Living dead, are two of the only films in existance that still scare me to this day. (Side note: Also, I reccomend that you see Luis Bunuel's movie ""Un Chien Andalou"" to see where strange art-films like this originated from.)Anyway, the film's plot while initially incomprehensible to most, can be broken down into the tragic tale of a man named Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) stuck in a dark decaying city overrun by industry.  During the film, he is forced to deal with the prospect of taking care of an illegitimate premature child birthed by his girlfriend, Mary X. (Charlotte Stewart)  However, he is consumed by his guilt, and begins to comprehend suicide as a way out.  But the story is told through such a swirling mixture of dreamlike imagery that this is not always readily apparent.However, in order to better understand and appreciate the film, one must figure out what each of the images mean.  Here's a short cliff notes guidline to some of the more common recurring images in the movie:***THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS***Worm = sin. These creatures appear all throughout the movie.  Henry even tries to hide his ""little"" sin from Mary at one point, only to have a nightmare where Mary is consumed by worms.  Henry's room is also filled with piles dirt and dead plants as one might notice, which makes his room a breeding ground for worms.The Baby = The product of sin. You might have noticed that the baby looks an awful lot like a worm. Futhermore, the baby is a part of Henry, and later during the dream sequence, we discover that Henry IS the baby.  When Henry kills the baby, he kills himself.Eraser = Memories. Henry feels that his memories, or his brain with his bad memories, is like an eraser that needs to be rubbed out.  In his dream sequence, he sees himself losing his head, and having his brains turned into eraser bits to be rubbed out and blown into dust on the wind.The lady in the radiator = Death. Death looks grotesque, yet strangely appealing to poor Henry.  The radiator gives off warmth and seems to become a stage where death performs for Henry, promising to stamp out his sins (worms) and telling him that ""in heaven, everything is fine.""  At the end of the movie, Henry embraces the lady in the radiator before blackness falls.The man in the planet = God. In addition to disposing of Henry's cofessed sins at the beginning of the movie (the worm coming out of Henry's mouth) the scarred man in the planet appears to prevent Henry from opting for suicide during his dream sequence. He silently reminds Henry of his sacrifice (the bleeding tree) though it is in vain as Henry shows God what he really is underneith.  (the baby)The last is a theme that occurs in all Lynch movies:Electricity and electrical lighting = The presence of good. Darkness = The presence of evil.There are other aspects of the film that keep popping up, such as the reocurrence of the unlucky number thirteen.  Henry waits thirteen seconds for the elevator to open up, the lady across the hall takes thirteen seconds to appear, Henry's apartment numbers add up to the number thriteen, etc. Also, there are many other images which I will let you figure out on your own.***END OF SPOILERS***All in all, the movie is quite an experience.  This is a film that you will either love or utterly hate.  For myself, I managed to ""click"" with the movie from the first time I saw it and have enjoyed it since.  Repeated viewings only add to the enjoyment of the film, as you begin to notice more and more that you never saw before.  All in all, I say that it is an excellent and extremely layered film.With that, I give you some fun facts about the movie:-The pencil eraser machine actually worked.  It was put together by Lynch and a friend of his.-To this day, Lynch will still not disclose how he constructed the amazingly convincing baby creature, though he claims is was created with substance/objects that anyone could find around the house.-Jack Nance's hair was incredibly malleable.  Literally, all it took was a little bit of trimming on either side of his head and some combing to get it to stand upright.-In order to get a better sense of textures for the film (possibly for the organs of the baby) Lynch dissected a dead cat.-When driving around town with the ""Henry hair"" Jack Nance would sit in the center seat while Lynch and someone else would sit on either side to keep his gravity-defying hair from being seen.",Eraserhead

So few words are spoken, and i absolutely love it. He really gets the phrase ""a picture says more than a thousand words"". I will not speculate on what the movies is about because i really believe in the same idea as Lynch, that each individual will interpret it differently. This is definitely a movie everyone should watch sometime in their life, and it really goes out to a lot of people. If you are into a visual experience or your just a big fan of a great story you should definitely watch this movie.

I now own the 2000 DVD. I always thought that this film was as though David Lynch had somehow wired into a person's mind and recorded an actual bizarre and truly weird nightmare.

And if I were to describe to you, what Eraserhead is like, I'd say it's like a dream. Despite all my praises, I have one problem with Eraserhead. And that is the fact that, Lynch doesn't remember where the idea for the film came from. He doesn't know what possessed him to make it. And that's a problem for me because, it's difficult to see what he was trying to achieve. For me, it's important, for me to see what he was trying to do so I can learn more about it. Understand it.

The editing and prop-work are another marvel. Handmade lamps and claymation worms show the intense hands on required to vivify Lynch's subconscious visuals. He seems to draw from a play in our brains normal consciousness cannot reach and pull the strings that draw them forth in the minds of anyone who indulges themselves in his craft.10 out of 10 for it's critical place in filmmaking history and the intense detail oriented perfectionism that he clearly orchestrated during the many year long production.

The only other filmgoing experience I can compare this too was watching Felini's Satyricon or Lynch's truly awful version of ""Dune"" ( Uh, dude, Lyle MacLanahan can't act!). However, I must give credit where credit is due, Lynch made time come to a standstill with this loathsome creation. The only other director that could give him competition in this regard was Edward D. Wood Jr. Ed at least has a charming eccentricity with his loopy, insane dialog and unlike Lynch he is at least trying to tell a story. Yes, I admit it, I enjoy a good story, it doesn't have to be predictable or linear e.g. Memento, but at least tell a story. Lynch is good at making you look at disturbing images. Slowly panning camera work through the industrial nightmare world that he creates here and in ""Elephant Man"", This director is known for his artistic vision with my favorite being his filming of the evolution of the decay of vomit in ""Wild at Heart"" and of course who could forget the barf inducing cutting the turkey with icky blood coming out.That doesn't change the fact that manure is manure, much like the Jules Feiffer character in"" Little Murders ""where the character makes a living taking pictures of manure.

Those people are actually trying to see and validate as much logic inside a pure chaos that such ""art"" actually is all about!While this FACT about modern society is being so openly finally said by someone,I must warn the people that this film is not only boring pile of gibberish but also a very VERY DISTURBING one,where both picture and sound is used as a weapon against viewers sanity. If you chose to watch this film,please BE PREPARED to be shocked and left emotionally drained while you ask yourself in the end;""What the F*UCK have I just watched and how something as sick and disturbing as this can ever be recommended as a decent or good movie!?This is nothing but a symptom of society where degenerated and sick things,peoples and ideas are being as equality OR MORE valued than healthy and normal.

397,TheMovieRealm,A Dream of Dark and Troubling Things,10,6 September 2014,"In the early 1970s, a young film student began work on his first feature length project, a surreal exploration of the nature of dreams and nightmares that would go on to be, in my humble opinion, one of the best films ever made. That young man was David Lynch, and the film was his work of surrealist art known as Eraserhead (1977).I first became aware of David Lynch after seeing Mulholland Drive as a teenager. While researching his past work, I began to read amazing things about something called Eraserhead, which was starting to sound like my fantasy version of the perfect midnight movie. Once I finally saw the film, I realized that is exactly what it was: THE definitive midnight movie. The film has affected me not just as a viewer but as an aspiring filmmaker. The first short film I made, Dreamspace, was heavily inspired by Eraserhead, primarily in the look and style of the film but also in the themes of dreams and the subconscious. David Lynch continues to be a major influence on all of my work.The beauty of Eraserhead is in its simplicity. It tells the story of an ordinary man living in an extraordinarily bizarre, dystopian industrial wasteland. Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is a man who is ""on vacation"" from his job at a print shop. One night, he goes to the home of his girlfriend, Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) to have dinner with her and her parents. After some strange behavior from Mr. and Mrs. X (Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates), Henry is soon told that Mary has given birth to a baby. Well, actually, they're not sure if it is a baby, but she's given birth to something - and Henry is the father. The couple decides that Mary will move into Henry's small, dreary apartment and they will raise the ""child"" together. When the baby arrives home from the hospital, we see that it's actually a small, dangerously premature, mutant creature that cries incessantly. After the baby continues crying and crying non-stop, Mary can't take it anymore and returns to live with her parents, leaving Henry all alone to care for the ""baby."" And thus, Henry Spencer's trip down the rabbit hole into a disturbing, existential nightmare begins.The theme of the fear of fatherhood is the most obvious one to spot. Lynch was a new father himself when he began working on the film, and I've read that his daughter was born with severely clubbed feet, which is metaphorically similar to the ""deformed"" baby in the film. Other themes explored are those of isolation, loneliness, urban decay, and the ever blurred line between dreams and reality.The pace of the film is very deliberately slow, but, in this case, slow does not equal boring. The film is designed to lull you in to its hypnotic world; to put you in a trance and make you feel as if you are in a dream. Then, once you have been fully hypnotized, the dream slowly begins to devolve into a nightmare and it takes you with Henry into a very dark and unsettling place.One of the most impressive aspects of the film is its stark and hauntingly beautiful black-and-white cinematography. Lynch uses heavy light and shadows to reinforce the surreal, dreamlike nature of the world he has created. The direction and cinematography are handled with a simplistic beauty and a self-assured confidence that is rare in a first-time director. The decaying industrial dystopia is captured in gritty, grainy imagery that makes you feel the dreariness and hopelessness that the characters live with.Another spectacular aspect of the film that adds to its entrancing effect is its sound design, done by Lynch and Alan R. Splet. The sound is meticulously designed and is constantly present at every moment of the film. The foley sounds are done with such an incredible and painstaking attention to detail that one can only imagine how they managed to achieve the sounds they did, especially with such limited means. I read that the sound design took longer to create than the editing of the film, and if you've seen it, you'll know why. The film is a perfect example of how important sound is to fully immerse your audience in another world, and how it can increase the overall viewing experience.Jack Nance's performance as Henry is excellent. You truly feel for Henry in his plight and this is largely due to Nance's quietly introverted and sympathetic portrayal. (And kudos to Jack Nance for keeping that hairstyle throughout all five years of the production). Charlotte Stewart is very good as Mary X, the young woman who regularly gives birth to strange flagellate creatures while she sleeps and doesn't know why. She portrays the emotional frailty and ultimate breakdown of the character of Mary quite well. Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates as Mr. and Mrs. X are extremely memorable and quite hilarious. Their scenes in the home and at the dinner table, particularly with the twitching chickens, are so bizarre but very, very funny. There are also very solid performances from Judith Roberts as the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall and Laurel Near as The Lady in the Radiator that add to the beauty and alluring mystery of this stunning work of art.Eraserhead is one of the most towering examples of pure, unfiltered creativity in existence. It remains high on the list of my favorite films ever made. This is one of the films I can watch over and over again and it never gets old. It's a meticulously crafted work of dark, strange, and surreal art that begs to be analyzed and examined with a fine-tooth comb. And if you do decide to sit down and study it for yourself, I think you'll be quite pleasantly surprised at the level of mad brilliance that comes through the screen.www.themovierealm.com",Eraserhead
398,dust86,Really? You can't be serious...,1,30 October 2007,"Alright, I can understand if you feel like you need to belong to some special club after watching this movie. Perhaps you feel like you are better off having watched this movie, because after sitting through mindless dribble such as this you might have the subconscious need for some sort of gratification. However, I found this movie to be a very enlightening lesson. That lesson being ""How not to make an enjoyable movie"". Some of you might say that this is a form of art, but to the average man, this movie was about as entertaining as a root canal. I warn you, if you are looking for an enjoyable experience, please avoid this movie, because this film was designed to carry out Lynch's deepest desire to confuse the hell out of people and get paid while doing it. I don't believe that there are any deeper meanings behind any parts of this movie and that Lynch is secretly sitting in his house laughing at all the schmucks out there willing to waste their time to debate it. But if you are an elitist yearning to be accepted in a pretentious group, well perhaps this is the film for you. Have fun making films like this without 1/100th of the popularity of Lynch (how he ever became known or funded is still a mystery to me).",Eraserhead

The baby is truly hideous, it looks like a combination of a worm and a fetus, and it wines and cry's so much that she leaves Henry all alone with the baby.After being seduced by the woman across the hall, he is relaxed by seeing the chipmunk looking Lady in the Raidiator who sooths his troubles.For a budget of 10, 000 dollars, it's quite amazing what comes out. Other than showing his weirdness, Lynch shows himself in his fear of fatherhood and darkness.A film of the ages, Eraserhead is a striking example of where movies can take us.",Eraserhead
400,Simbabbad,Way overrated (spoilers)...,9,19 November 2001,"OK, first to give you an idea, I do love many of Mr. Lynch's works, *especially* his stranger ones. I admire ""Lost Highway"" and ""Fire Walk with Me"", I liked very much ""The Straight Story"", ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Elephant Man"", and I found ""Blue Velvet"" interesting.I've also seen ""Eraserhead"" three times in theatre, and own it on DVD. I've made a virtual HTML simulation of Twin Peaks' ""Black Lodge"", and plan to include parts of ""Eraserhead"" in it.But ""Eraserhead"", as much as one may like it, is just not as deep, or artistical, or surreal a movie. It is, like Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"", a one-sided view from a pathologic mind, of a very banal situation.What's the ""plot"" ? A schizophrenic man discovers he made a child to a girl he spent some time with. Forced by her parents to marry her and to take care of the baby, he just can't cope with it because of his mental pattern, and therefore kills it in the end.That's it.The only original thing about this is that it's seen from the main character's point of view. But, like with ""The Metamorphosis"" this leads to :1) Weird scenes that makes sense only for the author and aren't meant to be communicated to an audience. It can make big suggestions to your subconscious, and therefore lead you to a dreamy mood, but many MTV music clips can do that as well. It *isn't* surrealism.2) Gory, barely justified gooey effects.3) One-dimensional atmosphere, in the case of ""Eraserhead"", a grey, dirty, greasy, industrial one that's not artistically justified - there goes the ""art"" side of the movie. It's quite well handled and interesting if you're into visual art as I am, but it's also boring because, well, one scene looks exactly like the other.4) (Nearly the worst) : one-dimensional characters. Since they're seen from a schizoid point of view, they're all weird, ridiculous, unpredictable and potentially hostile, in short, a nuisance (schizos like to be left alone). No character depth like in ""Fire Walk with Me"", for example. This simplification includes the baby, seen as a monstrous thing that looks like what it probably was on set : a dead animal covered with glue so that it wouldn't rot too soon.5) Passive main character. He's just not doing anything, except in the end (?). It makes the movie all the more, well, inept, action-wise.6) The worst : obvious meanings. Yes, ""Eraserhead"" fans, you read me. Henry (the main character) can't sleep with his pretty neighbour because of the baby ? The baby laughs. Henry is afraid to make his wife pregnant again ? We have a looooong scene of him pulling giant spermatozoids out of her vagina. Henry's mind is vanishing because of the baby ? The baby's head pops out of his body, and his brain is used to industrially make pencil erasers - hence the title. Gee, what may this all mean ?!So, all in all, what we have here are either symbols that mean something for Lynch alone (many of those themes, like the show scene with curtains, the zigzag floor, or the blinking lights, are by the way found in his other feature films, which are all better), or that are painfully shallow (examples above).So, in short, just a bad film in itself, which is quite normal for a first feature-length film which took five years to direct with no money. Still, it may interest you if you like Lynch, or visual art (flawed works are often more interesting to analyse than successful ones) - or it could just lead you to quite an interesting mood if you're not the dreamy type all by yourself, and like to be forced to dream instead of being gently suggested to do so.",Eraserhead
401,Lynchead,The most powerful cinema experience I've ever had.,10,27 November 1998,"I first saw Eraserhead (the remastered version) in a theater where half the viewers were laughing almost all through the film, and still it was the most powerful cinema experience I've ever had. Unlike what most people believe, it's not such a strange film. What makes it look strange is the preconceptions inside the viewers' heads about what an ""ordinary film"" should look like. I see Eraserhead as Lynch's Citizen Kane, for the following two reasons: it's his first feature film as well as the best film he has ever made (although some of his next ones came pretty close) and it was made with total disregard to the storytelling rules of the mainstream. It borrows from genres such as German Expressionism and the Avant-Garde, but combines them to create a masterfully structured new approach that remains faithful to its inner logic. I would have to go back to the silent films in the beginning of the century in order to find a movie that has such a strong feeling of trying to figure out what cinema is capable of. In my mind the strangest thing about Eraserhead is: how can people burst into laughter while watcing Henry and the baby at the ending? It felt like being inside a David Lynch film.",Eraserhead
402,Q.T,"Hard to find, hard to watch, not hard to remember",10,28 July 2001,"I had been looking for Eraserhead for the longest time, so getting it second hand for $5 was an extra treat when people sell it for over $150 on e-bay. I knew the basic premises of the movie and thought that I was prepared for a movie in which I would have to sleep on to solve (like Lost Highway), but as it turned out in the end I didn't want to sleep on it, infact I didn't want to go to sleep. The images Lynch presents us with can be so horrifying at times that you cant help but feel somewhat scared deep down inside. To this day only the people who made the film (which really only consisted of 5 or so people) know how the baby was made. In 1977 It's defiantly ahead of its time, and for a low budget picture it's even more of an amazement. You can't help but feel both disturbed and sorry for Harry disfigured little runt yet I feel as if I would have had to been forced to do the same if I were in his situation. I think that this was by far Lynches best work as it doesn't try and tell a complex story only David Lynch can understand, but instead we get a film in which we help contribute and make up in out own mind as we watch. It's in a league of its own and the best horror movie I have ever seen in my life. Yet it will leave you in total aw and have you thinking for a long time to come.So if you hated every other David Lynch movie, or you want to like him but sometimes his stuff is just to obscured you can't enjoy it, I urge you to give Eraserhead a viewing (that is of course, if you can find it first)",Eraserhead

It doesn't work.I'll also admit that I sat in a haze for decades, absorbed in the imagery. In awe of the impressions. And finally, an image crystallized, an image of what this was a portrait of.

The way he represents urban life as an endless industrial noise, dark, gross; How sex was still considered by some, a terrible sin; Death (suicide) as a wonderful escape from everyday problems.Film making is an art, when you see it as a means of expression for a person. There are many kinds of ""art"" but when it really makes you FEEL, it's definitely good. The artist told you something.

The story is drowned in overbearing symbolism and excessive comments which are either lost entirely to the viewer, or saturate him or her with their obviousness.

Of course the movie is very abstract and surreal, giving the viewer the option to enterpret the events unfoalding as they choose fit, but it never crosses over to the realm of wierd for the sake of weird, there is a clear story of a man desperate for escape from his hellish family life present throughout the film. The movie looks amazing and especially sounds amazing thanks to, for the time some groundbreaking sound design.

411,klemensliu,The individual experience of watching Eraserhead,10,3 March 2021,"""In heaven, everything is fine"" chimed the Lady in the Radiator, a personification of death in David Lynch's kickoff film Eraserhead, symbolizing the dehumanization of the industrialization, the horrors and nightmare we all face-
Wrong. The first rule of watching Lynch's movie is that you don't establish its meaning. I came to watch Eraserhead with an acknowledgement of its surreal nature, determined to break down each of its symbolisms. Interpretations after interpretations, hours of contemplation trying to make sense all secrets in the film. Yet the more I attempt to fit all bits of the jingsaw to one, the less it made sense. Slowly I realize that I have become the very thing English teachers would do- breaking down art when they were not meant to after all.
One should not simply adopt or propose a universally accepted interpretation of Lynch's surreal style, as he explicitly confirms this in an interview on Eraserhead, ""So I should know the meaning (of the content) for me, but when things get abstract it has me no good to say what it is, you know. It's better all viewers on the surface where all are different and we see something and that's where other place where intuition kicks in and inner knowingness; and so you see a thing, you think about it, you feel it, and you know- you sort of know something inside, and you can rely on it... and what you know is valid."" Lynch simply liberates the audience to create meaning in his works. It is true that not all piece of art are meant to be interpreted according to one's judgement, but Eraserhead's dreamlike quality opens subjective translations of what the film display to one's personal experience; in the case of Eraserhead, Lynch used disgusting imageries and ominous sounds, creating a nightmarish feeling everyone has experienced.
Art in films were traditionally used to deliver a particular message through a vulnerable media: entertainment. Its score, dialogues, costumes; everything integrates beautifully, opening the minds of the most conservative to the idea on another side. Both ""The Birth of a Nation"" and ""First Blood"" were effective at their times in making use of cinema as propaganda, with the former glorifying Ku Klux Klan, and the latter heroizing the USA in the Vietnam War. While some movies create a distinctive meaning for themselves, there are movies like ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise which have multiple dimensions to be analyzed. For instance, although those movies were said to be a direct parable of Christian teachings, some themes were based on Tolkien's personal encounter with the First World War, in which he fought in. Tolkien showed the horrid destruction of nature for political motives as prevalently done by the forces of Sauron. This second type inserted many values through all aspects of the film to be rendered by the audience, leading to much analysis in the end.
Yet David Lynch never intended to do so. Eraserhead attempts to precede the message by the experience felt. As said by Lynch, he did not want to storytell his view of what he personally experienced through the nightmare of Eraserhead, for it would no longer be personal. Instead, he understood that the best way of relating to all of his audience is by entering the world of the abstract. Only then can people grasp the universal idea and slowly ruminate on this ""feeling"" to fit it in their own lives.
All films have a message to ponder upon. Eraserhead has no particular message. Yet through its absence it taught me a whole lot more. In many cases, the abstract nature of art could be far more effective in delivering something to those who enjoy them. When watching Eraserhead, open your mind, do not try to understand the surreal; feel how the movie speaks to you, and perhaps your personal Lady in the Radiator could finally be understood.",Eraserhead
412,anthononymous,Intense,10,17 November 2006,"I saw this movie many years ago and I have seen many others since, but this remains one of the most intense cinematic experiences ever for me.

The pictures, the sounds, the utter weirdness of the 'story' just got at me, and I don't think I've ever experienced such a sense of relief in a movie before, as in that scene, where the girl from across the hall appears. The whole movie really seemed like a nightmare to me, and when I brought back the video and had a look at the back cover, there was a quote from David Lynch, saying that his aim had been exactly that, to put a nightmare on celluloid. I can only say: He was successful.",Eraserhead
413,kleptocracy-1,"David Lynch...Oh, he tries so hard.",3,9 November 2006,"David Lynch has got to be one of the most self-indulgent filmmakers to ever find an audience.I was extremely excited to watch this movie the first time. I'd heard so many great things about it, how it was more or less a ""filmed nightmare,"" ""incredibly weird,"" and even, ""mindblowing."" The high contrast b&w cameras, the strange and creepy imagery...all sound great in theory. But unfortunately, in reality, it's a film made by David Lynch.I can enjoy plots that develop slowly. I'm a huge Hitchcock fan. I even loved M. Night's ""Unbreakable,"" when most thought it was mind-numbing. But this is slow for the sake of being slow. Mr. Lynch isn't trying to build tension or eeriness, it seems slow because he didn't know what to film next and so just kept filming the same thing longer than he should have.I can--and usually do!--enjoy weird movies that don't make much sense (Or at least end with a violent upsurge of orthogonality): ""Pi,"" ""Itchi: the Killer,"" ""Tetsuo"", even ""2001: A Space Oddyssey"" -- all films I loved. But Eraserhead tries too hard. It nearly doubles over backwards to give you ""weird,"" imagery, but Lynch never stops to wonder just how interesting the image is. In every scene I can hear him mumbling to himself in the editing room, ""Look at that! Isn't that cool! Ooooooooh!,"" and meanwhile I'm watching the screen, thinking ""Nope. Not really."" In sum, this film is a young David Lynch trying as hard as he possibly can to do something strange, and succeeding I suppose, at the cost of a good movie. It's probably worth watching just so you can be conversant on it, since it seems to be such a staple of the weird-film-subculture, but, quite frankly, if this was my nightmare, I'd wake up bored.",Eraserhead

419,Nell_Smith,Vastly overrated and immensely disturbing: best avoided by children or psychologically vulnerable adults,1,31 January 2008,"This film has become a famous ""cult classic"" and thus attracts considerable debate and comment, both favourable and unfavourable. However, anyone who is tempted to watch it simply in order to discover ""what all the fuss is about"" should be aware that this is a *particularly* disturbing (I would say distressing) film, located at the darkest end of the spectrum of surrealism, and, due to its many very unpleasant and potentially frightening images, themes and inferences, it is best placed in the ""horror"" genre, despite its lack of traditional blood and gore.No matter what opinions of this film (both for and against) may be found on this website or anywhere else, this is not a film to watch without first considering the point that, whatever else it may be, it is almost universally considered to be extremely (even excessively) disturbing, and should DEFINITELY be avoided by anyone who is in a psychologically vulnerable condition.It is also probably best avoided by anyone who may find it upsetting to see imagery of premature, damaged, injured, deformed, mutated, mentally and/or physically abnormal, or dying/dead babies, as the film refers throughout to a ""baby"" which can, according to the viewer's interpretation(s), be placed into any or all of these categories (plus more, no doubt). Even though the ""baby"" in the film is evidently a model (and a poorly made one), it is still realistic enough, and peculiar enough in both appearance and behaviour, to potentially cause distress to anyone with psychological concerns regarding babies or childbirth. It is not for nothing that the term ""The Eraserhead Baby"" has entered the language, at least in the UK amongst adults over about 35, and is always used to mean ""something which is weird and scary"".In my opinion the usual certification of the film is not high enough; while it does not contain explicit sexual content, graphic violence, or any of the other conditions which would cause it to be rated as an ""adult movie"" (e.g. drug use), it DOES contain very disturbing imagery and, as the mother of three children, I would certainly not allow them to watch it until they were fully adult, i.e. 18 or older - and even then, I would warn them (and anyone else) to beware of its genuinely disturbing nature and advise them not to watch it at all, as in my opinion it has no merit of any normal cinematic kind and can serve at best to make the viewer wonder why it was made, but at worst to leave the viewer psychologically unsettled or even permanently damaged, depending upon the robustness or otherwise of their psyche. This really is NOT a ""watch it for a laugh"" film.Although some argue that this film should not be judged by normal ""movie"" standards (I'd say because it doesn't meet any of them, but that debate belongs elsewhere), the term ""film"" tends usually to mean something with a discernible plot/story, widely comprehensible (not necessarily pleasant) content, and some kind of meaningful or at least understandable conclusion, hopefully with a bit of entertainment thrown in. So if one is to judge this film according to normal cinematic standards such as intended meaning (if any), storyline(s), acting performances, quality of direction and/or production, entertainment value, and so on, it scores very low (in fact, I'd say zero) in all such typical categories. It can be argued that the absence of plot and the disjointed, inexplicable nature of the film's progression is of merit because it is not ""a film"", but is in fact ""a piece of art"", but there is no point in entering *that* debate here, either. I would simply like to say that, if the director was trying to make a statement, it is impossible to tell whether he has succeeded, since it is not possible from watching the film to tell what statement, if any at all, is being made; indeed, although many people have managed to find meaning in the film, no two of them agree as to what that meaning is, so if it is there, it is so completely obscured by the film's bizarre incoherence as to be impossible to deduce with any certainty.What is certain is that I have yet to find any person at all who has watched this film without finding it disturbing in some degree, with many considering it very disturbing and unpleasant indeed, and finding themselves stuck with mental images and concepts which they wish they hadn't acquired - in other words, most of the people I know who have watched this film genuinely wish they hadn't, as they gained nothing useful from it - not even entertainment, as, in spite of its many peculiarities and a lot of unpleasant imagery, it somehow manages also to be, overall, noticeably dull to the point of being boring.All in all - don't expect to be impressed, or even entertained, but do expect to be disturbed to some extent, unless you are exceptionally hardened against films which set out to achieve precisely that effect.",Eraserhead
420,fockzilla,A Beautiful Nightmare,10,6 September 2008,"Eraserhead is a great film! I bought the DVD after a friend in high school told me about it. I watched it alone in the dark and the journey was unlike anything I had ever experienced with any movie before. The industrial landscapes are so detailed and amazing that you almost want to jump into the screen and take a look around inside. The audio is so surreal that it leaves you on edge at all times.The best advice I can give to anyone who has never watched this movie before is: don't research the movie, don't look at the synopsis, and don't ask what it is about. Watch it and don't have any expectations, watch it all the way through and just experience it for what it is, clear your mind of all judgment until after the movie is over.If there is one thing about this film that no one can deny it is this, the whole piece is the refinement of an idea down to its purist idealized form, I don't know what that idea is exactly but it seems like a very dark, twisted, anxious, nightmare that is more beautiful in essence than anything you can imagine.Thank you David for a great experience in cinematic art.",Eraserhead

But there's a limit to everything..This movie is ridiculously slow (Nothing happens on the first 30 minutes) and long, and the plot is completely senseless and unbearable. There's no fun, there's no learning, there's no aesthetic value... I had lots of expectations from comments and other reviews and I got terribly disappointed by this film and its director.Really... don't waste 2 hours of your life.

Many who don't like the film say ""I don't know what it means!"" Well, guess what? It doesn't mean anything! That's right I said it doesn't mean anything. David Lynch hasn't once said what it means because it would take away the magic and the mystery. David put images and sounds together and made something people could remember. Eraserhead is truly the epitome of surrealist art. It is the Edvard Munch's The Scream of film. Nobody knows why the man in the painting is screaming except that what is lying in front of them is beautiful, enchanting, mesmerizing and haunting all at once. So don't question it.

Not so much a horror movie or a drama, Eraserhead is a fever dream of indelible visuals and unsettling ambient noise swirling around our harried (and frizz-hairy) protagonist. Lynch deftly crafts a world at once vaguely familiar and lived-in, yet cold, uncaring, and utterly alien, populated by characters as bizarre and off-putting as the world they inhabit. Eraserhead doesn't try to make sense; it tries to make an impression. Love it, hate it, or grudgingly appreciate it (as I do) - you will not soon forget it.",Eraserhead

I was expecting strange, film noir aesthetics, but I was not expecting a complete borefest.You can say all you want about how great this movie is because of open interpretation. The problem is, all I saw was a giant LSD trip by David Lynch. The acting was horrible. I know the characters were supposed to act like morons, but that just made it worse, not more extreme.Compared to his modern movies, this LSD trip is boring, takes 8 minutes before a word is spoken, and of course it is from a neighbor who doesn't know the main character's name!I watched it all the way through, read some people's interpretations and came up with my own. This is what happens when the writer takes too much acid and nothing makes sense, connects, and it is just a paranoid schizo with bad hair hallucinating the whole time.I only give this a 5 for effort to be something.",Eraserhead
425,iridescent-orchid,Unforgettable and Haunting,7,18 February 2013,"After watching Eraserhead for the first time, my initial reaction was: ""I have never watched a stranger movie; and possibly never will the rest of my life."" Frankly, I'm not even sure if I can rate this movie as 'good' or 'bad', simply because I have never seen anything even remotely like Eraserhead. But good vs. bad isn't really the point. It's how the movie made me feel.This isn't a warm, lighthearted family film. It isn't comical. I've seen it under the genre of Horror and Suspense, but that doesn't quite seem to fit. I wasn't horrified, I was perturbed. I wasn't in suspense, I was in shock. Eraserhead is quite uncomfortable to watch; not necessarily because of the disturbing props or character's strange behavior, but because it made me question everything that was going on in the film.Is Eraserhead about sanity vs. insanity? Marriage and love? Bearing children? Sin and lust? The dream world and the waking world? Loneliness? Questioning the world and your place in it? Questioning your consciousness and yourself? Heaven and Hell? Life and death? I tried to pick one of the symbolic themes I've named above (or ones I didn't feel or notice) and I've found it impossible. It seems to be about everything I mentioned; and depending on who is watching Eraserhead, it could be about none of the things I mentioned. That's what is so fascinating about this movie.Eraserhead is almost inexplicable to someone who hasn't seen it, but I feel it's worth a look. I will say it's not for everyone as it may keep you up at night.For those willing to take a peek at this mysterious film: Whether you find Eraserhead to be interesting or boring; symbolic or a silly mess; a bunch of nonsense or a work of genius, it is unforgettable and haunting.",Eraserhead

I understand that David Lynch is an acquired taste. His projects are strange and surrealistic, but this movie is just weird, nonsensical and depressing.

True story:Eraserhead--A Dream of Dark and Troubling Things (always thought it was necessary to include the subtitle) used to come around to theaters in my area just about every Halloween. On two different occasions, in two different theaters an identical thing happened in the audience: just as the movie ended, an anguished voice from the back of the theater shouted ""Good! It's over!""Same person? Perhaps. But it really could have been the reaction of a lot of people: ""I didn't want to keep looking at this but I did anyway and now I'm glad I don't have to look any more.""Is this the description of a good horror movie? Partly, but it isn't over yet...Many people, probably the theater-goer among them, can't escape this movie by just not looking any more. Once you've seen the images, they stick with you for days. It's like recalling--a troubling nightmare! There's something awful about it, but I can't quite say what... and also something funny about it, but...Why do some people, myself included, want to have this feeling once in a while? I don't know exactly, but I think it has something to do with finding a different way to enter a dream experience. It also re-arranges your head almost in the way that a potent drug can. You feel different afterward. Something HAPPENED.If you don't know what people mean when they say that something literally makes their ""skin crawl,"" and you'd like to find out what they're talking about... or if you enjoy that kind of visceral reaction once in a while, this is the movie that will deliver it.

I thought it was an 1hr an 30 of constant weirdness. The only weird parts are Henry's dreams. The rest is his incredibly slow boring and uneventful life. I think the girls mother coming onto him was more for laughs. The girls father was great. I rented the 2002 clean and remastered version. There were too many scenes of just no talking or just nothing happening. Jack Nance when he spoke was great. Other than that he took so long to respond to people. I will watch elephant man. I loved dune so. I loved the lady in he radiator song. I think the opening shot, the baby as a snake type creature overlapping Henry was I bet a reference to sperm",Eraserhead
433,Russian_Sundays,"A nightmare of the most horrific, harrowing proportions",10,6 January 2007,"Eraserhead has a reputation amongst directors, ranking as Stanley Kubrick's films. It's easy to see why, given that David Lynch created a cult classic on a pittance of a budget, showing off some masterful direction and producing a piece of work that is not so much a film as it is a piece of art.Henry (Jack Nance) lives in a run-down suburb in a nameless city. His life takes a turn for the worse when his girlfriend gives birth to a mutant child. Unable to cope, she leaves Henry with the baby where slowly his sanity starts to break down. While Eraserhead may have a plot, the story is unimportant; it's about the atmosphere and the feelings and emotions it conveys. Dialogue is sparse, but expressionism is rife, much like the old silent films. Moreover, the line between reality and surrealism is blurred, with the film often being punctuated with classic Lynchian dream sequences.It is important to realise that Eraserhead is not meant to be entertainment. In his debut, Lynch creates a nightmare, one that is disturbing, eerie and haunting. Eccentricity pulses through it, whether it be Henry's hairstyle or the fact that it is filmed in black and white, detaching it from the real world even further. As a film in technical terms, especially considering that it was made in the 70s over the course of five years, Eraserhead is flawless. While one can argue that it has dated and that it may look cheap, it hasn't at all, retaining the same effect that it did thirty years ago. The mystique and horror does not fade, and it remains as hard-hitting as ever, influencing later classics such as the Elephant Man (also Lynch).A truly timeless film; accomplished, beautiful, pure and horrific. The most Lynchian David Lynch film.",Eraserhead

435,tom___green,Like A Beautiful Nightmare,10,29 September 2006,"David Lynch really did some amazing work on this film. He successfully created a totally abstract atmosphere. The cast and crew definitely broke several barriers while making this great work: David Lynch is not just presenting a dark intense story here, he's painting a picture and the level of artistic creativity captured is astounding. Words truly are like aliens in this movie, almost non-existent, so the movie is more 'felt' rather than seen or heard. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie and visual metaphor.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is easily upset by disturbing images or situations, the movie has a way of completely immersing the audience into the feelings and emotions of the characters. If you don't like artsy stuff then this one isn't for you. Its definitely not for kids.This movie isn't a horror, but it is quite honestly the most terrifying movie I have ever watched.

Especially when you (or rather David Lynch) refuses to even remotely explain the movie. I guess that sense of mystery and interpretation may have some appeal to others but, to me, this is hands down the worst film I have ever seen. I don't mean I dislike it.

442,rtt-5,Poor Henry,8,22 September 2007,"Here's my take on it.The entire film is a dream that Henry's having about getting his girlfriend pregnant, his terror at the idea of becoming a father and his attraction/repulsion to an abortion. The film's full of symbols that suggest this (and I've heard that reading Freud's ""Interpretation of Dreams"" helps you unravel them). Two of the most obvious, I think, are the tiny chicken that bleeds, representing the breaking of the hymen when Henry has sex with his girlfriend (why else would the mum react like that and why else would she announce that the daughter's pregnant straight after that scene?) and the girl in the radiator, who represents an abortionist: she's both attractive and repulsive, like the idea of abortion for Henry.For example, the moment Henry touches the abortionist, who's been encouraging him with her song about heaven and her smile, he's released from the dark, troubling place depicted so well in the film (worry, fear and guilt over the pregnancy) into pure light (release from it all). Not only that, after he touches her/accepts the idea of an abortion, you hear the suction used in the abortion procedure and see what looks like a fetus, umbilical cord and placenta being sucked away! Maybe Lynch was also commenting on post-industrial society, but I'm more inclined to think that the constant industrial sounds in the background are more for atmospheric effect -- or maybe they even suggest the constant mental noise and confusion in poor Henry's head! There's probably much more going on in this film than that, but I'm actually more inclined to not over analyse it and just enjoy (or not...) the uniquely disturbing and uncomfortable moods and atmospheres Lynch has created in this film.",Eraserhead
443,c_eddleston,A great introduction to one of film's strangest characters and a fantastic feast of surrealism for the senses.,8,2 September 2008,"Perhaps the strangest film ever made, Eraserhead is open to hundreds of unique interpretations. The opening title scene introduces us to the main character, Harry, in the first of the film's many dream sequences. From here on we follow Harry in his day to day life. It just happens that this week, Harry's life becomes a living nightmare as he fails to cope with the drastic changes that take place for him. It doesn't have much of a storyline, the dialogue is thin on the ground too, hardly any character development takes place, and the soundtrack isn't likely to break the top 10; but this sparsity is an integral part of the film. Everything missing in this film is also what's missing from Harry's life; we're never shown that Harry has any friends or given any reason to believe he has any. We never see Harry listening to music, reading, playing sport, or in fact doing much of anything; he occupies his free time lying on his bed staring into his radiator and dreaming. Filming the film in black and white shows the lack of variety and life in Harry's world and brilliantly highlights the grim surroundings of his industrial hellhole slum. Harry is a wonderfully unique character and watching how he interacts with the equally eccentric in laws and joining him in his dreams is a very interesting experience. On top of this the film looks amazing. Harry's world is beautifully bleak and his dreams are sensational showcases of surrealism and though they lack any real point or relevance to the story, they have an enchanting strangeness about them which you can forgive Harry for loosing himself in. Eraserhead is brilliant as a character portrait or as a purely aesthetic film. As a straight narrative piece of storytelling; it makes no logical sense what so ever. But that's not exactly a bad thing.",Eraserhead

I nearly fell asleep with Lost Highway. Per a friend's recommendation, after I told him I felt Mullholland Drive is his best film, perhaps by accident, I watched Eraserhead.I want my hour and a half back. I've never been so bored by a movie. I've read countless testimonials at how disturbing and haunting this movie is and I agree, it's disturbing and haunting, if only because of the time it sucks out of your life through watching it. Perhaps at the time of it's release, it's imagery was more shocking and revolutionary, I dunno. It certainly doesn't shock me or haunt me today. I've read and heard many explanations as to what the symbolism of this film really are, some of which seem to fit. Frankly, it doesn't matter what this film is symbolic of, it's still mind-numbingly boring. I suggest that rather than digging and searching for the deep symbolism here and watching it 30 times till you ""get it"" as some insist, you drop a tab, smack yourself in the head with a frying pan and save yourself the hassle.

An eerie, oppressive atmosphere surrounds everything. Lynch uses the techniques of old masters of German expressionism of shadows and light (in a Black and White movie) to create a certain estate of mind, and to shock.People, creatures and situations that only have slight resemblances with real life but that successfully strike the deepest region of your consciousness and feelings. A very slow pace does not hinder the uneasiness Lynch wants to provoke, but enhances it.Death, life and sin are part of the film. It is full of symbolisms but it is really worth it to analyse them?. If we do we will lose the essence of surrealism itself. We must experience the film, not dissect it. It is a film to feel.**** Jack Nance's performance is something to be remembered.

The degree of physical and societal deformity portrayed in Lynch's film is stunning, but the most horrifying aspect of the film is in the characters' placid day by day acceptance of their grotesque circumstances even as they slide deeper into their pit. ""Eraserhead"" is the antithesis of a later film by Lynch, ""The Elephant Man.""  The latter film begins with grotesque deformity and horrifying circumstances, but gradually progresses toward a remarkable degree of normalcy. The former descends and decays in a manner unmatched by any other film I know. In it's art and execution, it's a masterpiece. I've viewed it perhaps three times, but I have never been able to watch it all the way through in one sitting.. something in my mind says, ""That's all for now,"" and I stop then and finish it a few days later.

450,stijndebaerd,"Walking with KAFKA in Prague, singing extremely beautiful lyrics",9,30 December 1999,"Some people maintain that Eraserhead is just a dream or nightmare, well I think that is too easy.  Lynch does more than just telling a dream he had. He gives a new definition of reality.  Looking inside of his brains, he found a 'new reality' and wanted to show that.  He told us the way we are living is just one single way, it is like telling us: don't stick to your safe warm and cosy feeling of realism, go and seek the other ones!So you can only appreciate ERASERHEAD if you try to think in a absurd-logic way.  However, if you do, you'll love this film.On the other hand, artists create beauty.  Although I haven't seen the film in quite some time, I can still remember and enjoy some specific scenes. These scenes often wander in my mind and make my day.  Imagine this: walking during a cold rainy winter day in a grey anonymous city while singing 'In heaven, everything is fine'.  ERASERHEAD has become a part of my life, that's why I think this is a piece of art.",Eraserhead

452,herihodiesemper,Worst Movie Ever! ...thank you.,1,28 November 2005,"An ode to David Lynch... the sweet misguided film writer/producer/director. His movie-maker skill falls somewhere along the lines of Fraud. Not Fraud, the elusive Czech musician, but rather the tricky cheater art student posing as a filmmaker. Lynch does not make Movies. Lynch does not even make ""films"". He makes crap, and he never flushes the bowl. So, those of us who are foolish enough to venture into his smelly lavatory are forced with the task of expelling his excrement.""Mulhollond Dr."". On a first viewing, this flick is mildly intriguing. Beautiful women and conspiracy will sometimes hold an audience. One may ask ""What of the jumbled ending with no resolve???"" Intrigue halts when research reveals the origin of the films footage in its entirety.Having gained said knowledge there should be no need to try another of his work. But, what better way to give the man a second chance than by watching his most esteemed 'cult classic'?""Eraserhead"". This film is a void. If you stay with it, you will soon realize that you have been sucked into ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Eraserhead is often likened to ""a dream"". This is a very romantic way to describe a series of nonsensical images. Dreams, at least, offer an array of emotional content.Thank you for wacky and unexplained ""movies"", David, but I will never again be tempted to watch one of your tortured conundrums.

For them Lynch's Debut wasn't more than one of these horror movies only understood by a freakish elite of weird dudes spending more time in their cellar watching old 70's suspense films than going outside.But it is a total different thing with Eraserhead. There is nothing that has to be understood in this movie. This movie is a trip, nothing more... the only thing on celluloid coming near to a bad dream than anything else I have ever seen. But despite of that the protagonist Henry is a sad character, there are lots of emotions in the movie, but the most people don't realize it, because they only think of it as some weird piece of dark-minded art.Eraserhead is undoubtable one of the (I will not say best, cause this is a matter of taste I think) important movies ever made.

And if you haven't seen this movie, you shouldn't be reading reviews. it needs a first-hand experience.Before I say anything else, I must say that was the most awkward dinner I've experienced in my entire life.What a nightmare. What a freakishly beautiful piece of absolute terror. Th night after I first watched Eraserhead my dreams were plagued with devilish, mutant fetuses with terrible laughs. I couldn't get the eerie song 'In heaven, everything is fine' out of my head for months. I slept barely, fearing I'd wake up in an alternate reality with dead, twitching chickens, evil babies, crazy seductive mother-in-laws and a consistency of visually disturbing hallucinations.But how awesome. This film is based around it's own world that you have to take at face value. I tried reading into it deeply, but I found myself far more confused trying to think of a real point, instead of just believing some poor fellow who sees things go stuck with a mutant child that seems to enjoy driving him mad.I've read reviews saying that... thing... was harmless but disgusting, but I have to disagree. It seemed like the whole movie centered around it driving him more crazy than he had been before. It's sickening laugh, horrible cry, the way it started crying every time he tried to leave the room, was like it was just trying to keep him in that tiny, windowless (the window on th wall had brick built in... what's the point of even building the window?) room with only his own insanity to keep him company. After a series of disturbing dreams and it started cackling... I don't know how anyone can perceive that as harmless.But, for the record, people say it's no a date movie, but I would be extremely impressed if a guy took me to see this movie at a theater. It's so beautiful terrifying that I think it's one of the best horror art films I've ever seen. Once a teacher told me a great movie is one that changes you life.

Then I saw it, and was disturbed similarly to the way ""Blue Velvet"" disturbed me. I have looked on IMDb for a long time to see if anyone else came away with what I thought the meaning was. And, nothing. Here's what I thought: This was a result of nuclear bombing. The atmosphere, the droning sounds, the shock and horror...apocalypse. It allowed it to make sense to me. It is a movie to like and hate at the same time. Seeing the ""baby"" was horrible. But it set the tone for what I thought was a film speaking about nuclear energy in its time. Maybe wrong.",Eraserhead
456,laughingparson,Darkness not sustained,4,26 August 2019,"For the uninitiated, the film forces you into a truly miserable, creepy, dark and hopeless world with little need to demand or justify an intellectual discussion on metaphor or meaning. It is simply enough to be disturbed by the obviously dream-like and subconscious opening sequence and your introduction to the main character (Henry) and the miserable, squalid world he occupies. Where the film begins to lose its influence on you is in the banal and mediocre dialogue between Henry and the supporting cast.If this film can be classified as a horror (and there are truly horrific elements to it, as well as an appreciable throwback to the classics of the genre - the mock vintage lighting and fuzzy black and white patina are obvious) it quickly nosedives into something more in the area of black comedy, yet the comedic content of the dialogue and situations becomes far less dark and simply overly banal, as if depending on banality to contrast with the dismal, dark overtones to create a sense of perversion that fails. Where the film succeeds is where it starts: the creepiness, the darkness, the bleakness of the industrial background and the overwhelming throb and grating of the audio ambience, but such effectiveness is simply not maintained.Overall the film drags on, especially where dialogue is concerned, and you'll most likely find yourself both annoyed at the dragging pace and disappointed that you found the beginning of the film more disturbing than the end. A piece with genuinely original and disturbing elements that never gathers pace and never concludes with anything satisfying for the viewer.",Eraserhead

This film was downright dis-interesting and boring, it's a relatively short film, but i swear i was sitting there for 3 hours watching this filth roll on. A film is also for entertainment. Film can combine both entertainment with symbolism and messages to create a piece of art that is aesthetically pleasing, refer to Stanley Kubrick and David Fincher. That is good film making. D'you know the real reason why Lynch never speaks of the meaning of this film? BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY. I picture, a uni student, with a bad haircut, taking LSD, thinking, ""I know what's wrong with the world, let's make a film that has hidden messages that no one will figure out."" wow great way to change the world genius.

465,wiebe_ben,Surreal Imagery,8,16 December 2006,"If you want to begin to understand Eraserhead, you must always keep the word ""surreal"" on hand as the mental lens through which you watch the film. It is a film in the tradition of Buñuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" (1929).In this his first film, David Lynch examines the common theme of fatherhood using surreal images. He also looks at some of the issues surrounding fatherhood (marriage, the in-laws, sexual attraction, infidelity) with that same surrealism.""Image"" is another key to beginning to understand this film. The dialogue in Eraserhead is sparse, to say the least. Like future Lynch films, much of what the director is trying to convey is communicated via the image, not the spoken word. Sometimes the image is a longer, more drawn out scene. Other times, it is a quick flash that hits you like a ball-peen hammer on the forehead.If you watch Eraserhead like you would watch, say, Father of the Bride or Parenthoood, then you will be completely lost. If, however, you watch it knowing that Lynch looks at common themes from a surrealist perspective, you will still be lost, but you'll know how you got there and will find your way back.A final word: always watch Eraserhead with other people. Watching it alone is not advised.",Eraserhead

The ""baby"" was well , odd. The film reminded me of ""im thinking of ending things"" another film where everything doesn't add up. This movie will be added onto the ongoing list of things i will think of often and deeply of. Fascinating. This film has made me want to learn more about cinema and what it can be.

467,arrrwen,Summary???,10,6 February 2007,"The first (and only) time I have seen Eraserhead was last year in 9th grade, we watched it in art class on the last day of school. Lynch could have just wanted to make it into a series of images with a malevolent, nightmare-ish vibe, but I believe that there is much more to it than it merely being a tool to draw out a temporary, superficial reaction. Of course not, because I think anyone who has seen it would agree that it draws out a much stronger, ""chronic"" reaction from the viewer rather than just a spark of sullenness. I have only seen two other Lynch movies, Stay and Mulholland Dr., and from what I gathered a viewer must watch his movies many at least several times to manage to make even their own interpretation, let alone try to get close to what Lynch wanted to prevail! To give a proper interpretation of my own I must watch it again (although, unfortunately, here in Cyprus it is very difficult to find it... I have been looking for it for a year now!), but I can surely say that anyone who sees themselves as any of the following will SURELY love to watch Eraserhead:-someone interested in dark images, surrealistic art etc. -someone who likes challenges of the mind and be left thinking for ages -someone who likes bizarre work -a Lynch fan :pWho you surely must not be to watch it is:-someone who's favorite movie is American Pie -someone who demands everything to be perfectly interpreted for them by the end of the film -someone who can only stay interested when the movie is mostly dialogue -someone who cannot be open-minded enough to appreciate or understand the expression of (a) strong idea(s) or meaning through art -someone who expects to watch a movie with a proper, sensible plot -someone who is preoccupied with the WRONG idea that Lych sucks (so what?

469,kostya_m,"No rationality, no culture - just fear",10,2 December 2001,"While watching `Eraserhead' I was asked by friends what this movie is about. I thought a little and answered: ""About people"". They were disappointed by the answer, but nevertheless I didn't find anything to add.I think that it is easy to say what a bad movie is about (briefly retelling the plot) but it is almost impossible to do this for a good movie. It shouldn't be about anything. It is about everything. The artist creatively mirrors the world on the screen. And as the world is tight together and it is difficult to separate something from it without simplifying it to a certain extent, so a work of art should be taken as a whole. And one more point: A work of art is not `What You See Is What You Get', it is much more what you see is what you have to think, feel, learn, experience. Since then, no one can tell the truce about a work of art. One can find (create!) the truce inside himself. But this demands not to watch passively a show, but to make your mind, your soul working while.All these words I have to tell because `Eraserhead' leaves nothing for those who used to the usual way of telling the story, usual way of depicting the world. It breaks up all the common cinematographic, and even human, standards for how the world, people can be perceived.Sometimes it seemed to me that this all is about how would an extraterrestrial being perceive humans. Sometimes it seemed that those extraterrestrial beings are already in our unconsciousness and looks out to the world without any rationality, without keeping all the common `how it should be'.Lynch creates a world without any kind of spirituality. Men and women look like human beings that lost all of their humanity  just flesh, and brain that is not able to manage the outside world. And the world disintegrates, falls into pieces of sensible reality that is not to be rationally analysed. This world scares. No rationality, no culture - just fear.",Eraserhead

To be honest, Eraserhead is not my fave. I feel that Mr. Lynch has done better than this...bearing in mind that this is a VERY early production, and noting that he has since honed his skills and craft. In this case, I feel that he was so busy striving to make a social statement, so busy being ""artistic"", so busy trying to prove his worth as an artist outside of the mainstream, that he was rather self-absorbed in imparting his vision. Yeah, I get what he is trying to say. I just think that he could have said it better. Less fartsy, less artsy, less with the metaphorical imagery (which was about as subtle as a freight train rolling through cross-town traffic))... In the end it comes off as a college project, and not a very good one. I give him an 'A' for the cloudy, moody, pensive imagery.

While dealing with the awful conditions of the city that surrounds him with giant machines that billow smoke and create a non-stop and inescapable noise, he learns that he is the new father to a mutant baby with extremely bizarre and in-human traits. Now Henry has to deal with the constant screaming of the mutant child and to somehow manage to take care of it.The only way to describe this post-apocalyptic tale that David Lynch brings to life is that it is more of a piece of art than it is an actual movie to sit down with others to enjoy. This movie is disgusting, dark, memorable, and disturbing, yet, I couldn't turn my head away from this cinematically perfect movie for a single minute. Eraserhead is an enlightening experience with an almost never-ending amount of symbolism that represents a deeper and greater meaning behind what is actually shown. Some of the actions that are depicted in this film can seem completely out of the ordinary to the average viewer, and it's meant to be that way, but none of those bizarre actions go without meaning. Along with the endless amount of symbolism that goes behind the plot, David Lynch shows why he is a master at the art of film making with his incredible execution of cinematography. Within each and every shot of this film, Lynch successfully disturbs and creates an unforgettable atmosphere that will leave an imprint on every person that watches this film regardless of whether or not they actually understood everything. His use of lighting, ambient noise, shots of isolation in the setting and the shooting of this movie through a black and white camera, more than effectively accentuates Lynch's skill as a film maker. Eraserhead is not a film for every person. In fact, this movie is not even aimed at entertaining the average movie watcher on any given day. It is for those people that like to analyze and decipher the hidden messages that are presented. One can easily say that this movie isn't simply just a movie at all, but a work of art that can be compared to the works of art by painters such Leonardo Da-Vinci and Pablo Picasso. Eraserhead is one the finest pieces of art that any person has ever conceived and without a doubt, it deserves a 10 out of 10.",Eraserhead
478,Eli_Onetime,it may be my favorite movie,10,31 January 2004,"Eraserhead is hard to sum up.  I could sum it up by saying that it's about a depressed, lonely man living in the absolute dregs of society who is forced, by some awful set of events, to raise the most hideously deformed child ever created while he's on vacation.  I could also add that he fantasizes about a world that exists behind his radiator, where a woman with oversized cheeks steps on worm-like creatures and sings songs about everything being fine in heaven.  And I couldn't forget to mention the strange planet inhabited by a scarred man behind a set of levers that appear to control....See?  What's the point.  Summing up the plot of Eraserhead is a ridiculous thing to do because it's not about its plot.  It's about the finer details of the film.  Without a doubt the most striking feature of this movie is its sound design, which adds greatly to the overall tone of the film.  The sound design that makes the whole experience feel eerie and somewhat wrong, that makes you feel trapped in Henry's world.  The next time you watch this movie, notice that there isn't one frame of the film without some sort of everpresent ambient noise, be it the sound of steam going through pipes in Henry's apartment or a litter of puppies suckling on its mother at the X house.  The only silence in the film comes at the end, after Henry embraces the woman behind the radiator.And the high-contrast black and white photography.  I thought it was a bit pretentious of David Lynch to include instructions on how to adjust your TV to make the film look better, but he's right.  It shows the painstaking detail he adhered to for the photography of his greatest film.  The shot of his neighbor walking out of the darkness and into the light before she asks to spend the night at his place is utterly breathtaking when viewed in this way.And that's what makes me so happy about the cleaned-up DVD release of this film.  I always had to watch third-generation copies of someone's bootleg Japanese VHS copy with Japanese subtitles.  This version really showed me how amazing this film could really look and sound.Everyone should see this film.  Not everyone's gonna get it the first time. I don't think I did.",Eraserhead
479,Moviemaji,"Lynch asks the viewer to decide what the movie means, here is my two cents...",8,12 June 2009,"The only experience I have with movies is being a couch potato since I was 11. I rented this movie a little less than thirty years after it was released. By then, I'd already seen Mulholland Drive and Wild At Heart. When I first rented this movie, I watched the first five minutes of it, chalked it up to being a weird silent film, and ejected the DVD. A year later, I rented it again after reading a blurb somewhere that it had an actual plot. This time, it took.After watching the movie, I was so intrigued by what the meaning was, I read the IMDb trivia section about this movie. After already seeing Mulholland Drive, I wasn't surprised to see that Lynch intended for individuals to make up their own minds what the movie was about.I figure myself to be an analytical person, no psychological elements left open and stuff, but you can't do that with this film. The first phrase that came to mind after I watched this movie was ""An alternate reality of mass insecurity and anxiety"" by the main character. Nothing seemed to be stable in his life. A picture of his girlfriend is ripped in half. I saw a plant growing out of dirt without a pot to hold it on the nightstand by his bed. The youngling chicken that was served at his girlfriend's parent's house was screaming and bleeding.I also saw the humor too. The funniest part was the Mother of the girlfriend tossing/preparing the salad with the old woman's arms. She couldn't toss it completely by herself so without anyone looking, she puts the bowl in ""Grandma's"" lap and uses her hands like a puppet so that the meal could be completed by the WHOLE family...of course, Grandma never got invited to dinner but she served her purpose.We live now in a cinematic world dominated by endless remakes, comic book movie overkill, and a dwindling demographic of adult movie-goers. For those of us adults who want to enjoy an original movie experience these days; David Lynch is the answer.",Eraserhead
480,Gobadape84,Eraserhead as Satire of Film Noir,7,13 October 2002,"Anybody know anything about film noir?  Examples of film noir include: Casablanca, Vertigo, Chinatown, L.A. Confidential, Fight Club.  They are films with a central character (usually male) that is in a desperate or confused state. He is usually seduced by a classic femme fatale who often has some alterior motive. He usually falls in love with this woman, begins to trust this woman, and then is betrayed by this woman.  Other characteristics of film noir include feelings of distrust toward society, the government, or just the world in general. Film noir is usually filmed in dark, dreary outdoor environments or in dimly-lit, seedy motel rooms. They are often black and white and use bright light or music only to symbolize hope or sanity. What's my point?  Take these characteristics of film noir and apply them to Eraserhead.  Now think about how ridiculously these characteristics are portrayed in Eraserhead.  Lynch seems to be poking fun at serious films noir (to the extreme).  This is satire at its best. Eraserhead may have virtually no entertainment value, but David Lynch is a genius.",Eraserhead
481,afrischnj,My interpretation of the movie eraserhead.,10,6 March 2009,"First, I'd like to say I've only seen the movie 3 times and David Lynch is now one of my favorite directors after also seeing Mulholland drive, Lost Highway, and The Elephant Man.Here is one interpretation out of many possible ones. All symbols relate to Harry in some way.The rock - represents Harry's brain. It's dark texture symbolizes Harry's poor mental health. As the rock get's closer, as does the decay of harry.The ""hairy whole of light represents a vagina. I don't know if it represents anything at all.The man who pulls the levers represents God and the idea that some things (or everything if you believe that) are out of our control as humans.The Worm - represents decay and Harry's problems. The dirt also represents Harry's decay.The woman in the room across from Henry's room represents temptation and lust. Perhap's God is angry at him when he commits adultery with her.The lady in the radiator is Death and the radiator itself is suicide. that's all I would like to say about this movie. I suggest everybody interested in experimental and surrealist movies should check this out.",Eraserhead
482,zebreng,"Plain, pointless, not very artistic",4,21 May 2009,"Mkay. I had to check it out for some reasons. Many adult and serious people i know told me that was the scariest and creepiest movie they have ever seen in their lives, not the massacre and blood and monsters Hollywood kind, but something talking to the ""deepest and darkest corners of your subconscious"". I read audience's comments and i was promised that it would literally damage my brain cells and stick with me for the rest of my life, and such epithets as haunting, disorienting etc. -.- Well, i must say that i get impressed easily (especially with the proper atmosphere and sound effects), oversensitive and schizophrenic and very phobic by the way.... But i didn't find a single merely impressive or frightening, disturbing or whatsoever thing in this movie. And i tried hard. it didn't move a muscle on my face nor a nerve in my spine. The only emotion that i felt roused is some anger toward the personages that looked plain dumb. Except for the baby. I honestly hate kids, but what of so scary there could be about that poor ugly creature that's half ET half baby dinosaur - is out of my mind (and maybe it was the only character i felt sympathy or compassion for, especially when it was ill or being killed)... and to me a common human infant can be much more annoying or menacing... Of course it wasn't meant as an horror movie, it's 'art'. Well i must say i've gotta ponder much over it's artistic value. I love abstract art and surrealism, and the plot itself is the thing i hate most in a book or movie. But come on! The plot, despite what was said, is quite clear and definite in this movie - couldn't be more. And surrealism and stuff like that should be really talking to the hidden sides of your subconscious, provoke inner images and emotions that are difficult to categorize or identify. Here we have only plain and obvious meanings and images, all of its symbolism lies on its surface, and can't for sure be of a revelation to an average modern decently open-minded adult... yes, there can be be multiple interpretations of it, but they are all still too obvious and superficial. The matter is not that you should dig deeper - you can't go any deeper because the solid concrete bottom is too close to the surface. It can't be called boring, not to a certain extent. But nothing more...",Eraserhead
483,bundita,Analysis fails here,6,23 July 2003,"Unlike some of Lynch's more recent works (""Mullholland Drive"" and ""Lost Highway"" for example) Eraserhead is a film that doesn't benefit from being ""figured out"".The film left me with several strong emotional impressions, mainly having to do with the hell of a forced marriage and the burden of caring for an unwanted child. In spite of truly bizarre occurances (Roast chickens start kicking and oozing blood at the dinner table while Mom has a seziure apparently unnoticed by everybody else; grandma seems catatonic, but mom still gets her to toss the salad, etc., etc., etc...), Mary comes from a rigidly ""traditional"" family, completely crass in it's need to know if Henry had sex with Mary, what Henry does for a living, and it's assumption that he will marry Mary after presenting him with flimsy evidence that they've had a child together. The values that force Henry and Mary to marry are shown to be as much a part of the machine that has created the industrial hell in which they live as any other force.Their universe seems post-appocalyptic in its desolation; not a wisp of vegetation anywhere, and almost no clues about time of day. I suspect a rational explanation for the setting of Eraserhead might include some alien takeover; Henry and Mary's ""premature baby"" doesn't really look human, and it's introduction to their lives is more than a little suspect. Not to mention the ""worms"" that keep appearing everywhere,looking like dissected human central nerve chords.While I firmly believe there is no one way to interpret Eraserhead, itdoes touch on a number themes that fall into the ""social commentary"" bin. Isolation deepening simultaneously with physical connection (pipes)as a metaphor for sex that alienates, marriage forced by  circumstance, etc. It manages to get the viewer (at least this one) thinking about these issues in an abstract way. I don't know that I really enjoyed the film (although Harry's dream where his brian gets turned into eraserheads was humorous) but I didn't find it worthless. As an image and soundscape, it was truly brilliant.The intentional mix of plot and diversion succeeds in tempting and then thwarting analysis, like a painting or a sculpture. As such, this film is guaranteed to alienate a large audience. Some of Lynch's more recent films (""Mulholland Drive"", for example) are puzzleboxes that start the viewer out in this state of confusion, but actually make a lot more sense once the puzzle is figured out. ""Eraserhead"" deliberately induces confusion, and intentionally maintains confusion throughout, with no resolution intended. As such, it is typical ""student work"", untainted by the need to be palatable to large numbers of people, unencumbered by the idea that many will lose interest because they do not see value in maintaining states of confusion (it's called developing an attention span). As with all things, it's a matter of taste.",Eraserhead

Before I get into why I would like to say first of all that I think the use of sound in this film is amazing for its time, as well as the special effects as the mutant child is very realistic (for a mutant anyway).What really got to me was the fact that the 'nightmare' didn't actually make any literal sense, as it was meant to be interpreted by the viewer. I cannot see how this film could be interpreted as anything other than bizarre and mentally disturbing! I feel that the overall concept of the film is David Lynch trying to creep out the audience as much as possible, without any consideration for the viewers feelings or mental state of mind after watching this film. As I said at the beginning of this review I have been mentally scarred by this movie and literally cried after watching it because of how disturbing it was!! On my own personal recommendation (rather a warning to others) do not watch this film as, while technically applaudable, will leave you very confused and disturbed no matter what you may have seen before. For those of you who do still decide to watch Eraserhead, don't say I didn't warn you.",Eraserhead
490,lynds,Eraserhead:An original and refreshing look at Christianity,9,22 July 2003,"Although at first glance Eraserhead may seem like a strange and non-sensicle film I think it is a great masterpiece. The theological ideas behind it, Lynch's view on organised religion and its effect on people is terriffic. Because of its ambiguity it definitely needs to be watched more than once but nevertheless it is still a fabulous look at one man's decent into guilt as he is consumed by his sins. A film not to be underestimated.",Eraserhead
491,ruddick-brandon,Eraserhead,8,21 March 2012,"Eraserhead follows Henry Spencer, a soft-spoken fellow with an extremely amusing haircut, as he deals with living in a small, isolated apartment and taking care of his newly-born, premature, mutant baby. It sounds ridiculous on paper, but strangely, makes less sense after viewing it. I have seen it twice in the last two months, and it has become one of my favorites.The acting in Eraserhead ranges from solid to outstanding. Jack Nance's performance as Henry Spencer is superb (at least in my opinion). The majority of his screen time does not consist of dialogue, and he conveys Henry's emotions well, particularly those of discomfort and uneasiness. Charlotte Stewart does a passable job as Mary, the mother of Henry's mutant child. Most of the movie consists of scenes involving these two characters. The other actors and actresses perform their roles as needed, and the film does not suffer from any bad acting.Eraserhead's cinematography is mostly standard, and serves the story well. The film utilizes some creative shots, and from what I remember, held my attention for the duration of the movie. Eraserhead's visual effects are about what you'd expect from a low-budget film. They are done well enough not to induce any cringing or vomiting, except of course where they are intended to. The sound effects, on the other hand, are the strongest aspect of Eraserhead's technical performance. Because dialogue is not featured prominently, what the viewer hears becomes a major part of their experience. In one scene, I was more concerned with a bubbling sound in the background then with what was happening on-screen, so much so that I had to rewind to see if I'd missed anything important. Not that the sound effects are distracting, but they are so captivating and pleasing. Even the sound of the baby's constant crying was mesmerizing.While all of these components affect the viewer's perception of the film's quality, it is ultimately its storyline that will either make them a fan or severely disappoint them. Director David Lynch is known for leaving interpretation of the film's strange imagery and shocking conclusion up to the viewer, and for keeping its intended meaning to himself. Those who do not enjoy applying symbolism or greater meaning to media, or are just too lazy to try, will likely walk away from this movie with disgust. Personally, I took pleasure in thinking critically about the film's message and applying my own meaning to it. My interpretation after my second viewing is entirely different from what I originally thought, and I'm willing to guess it will change after viewing it again, which I most definitely plan on doing.Eraserhead is not a film for every viewer, especially those accustomed to movies made purely for thoughtless enjoyment.

To this day it remains to me the most bizarre, intense, scary and at times hilarious mystery of a movie i have ever seen. That really sums it up for me as the movie the whole way through terrified yet at the same time compelled me. Every twisted image made me cower in fright and yet at the same time compel to exclaim, ""damn that looks cool!"" What really makes the movie amazing is David Lynch's extraordinary ability to recreate the same sense of confused fear we would have in a dream. The movie genuinely doesn't have a beginning or an end. The whole movie seems completely other-wordly but seems to make sense. The world portrayed here is absolutely insane but inside, to it's inhabitants, seems normal.

Where to start? This dystopian future/ world where Eraserhead takes place is not meant to be real. It's not meant to be believed. It's meant to be dissected. Every component of the world can be broken down for meaning. The old man at the beginning? Yeah, in my derivation, he's God. A decaying God, an image reflective on the state that the human condition has deteriorated to, which is represented by the nightmarish baby thrown into the vat (which is represented of human production on earth). But you know what? As correct as I think my interpretations of this movie are, they don't matter at all. It's up to you to give meaning to this movie, a movie that may not have a plot because it goes beyond plot. The only plot of the movie is the plot you give it, and when done right, this can be the most effective way to reach the viewer.

497,B-J-C,"Ask six people exactly what Eraserhead is about, and you will get six different answers",10,1 June 2005,"I sometimes dream of waking to a completely dark world, a world with no sunlight and minimal artificial light. My vision is blurred, but there is nothing to see. The streets are virtually empty, and my friends and family are lifeless; sitting, standing or even walking, but with nothing to do or say, and nowhere to go. No questions are asked because there is nothing to learn, nothing is discussed because nothing is interesting. And it is this dismal reality I am faced with, only partially aware that there is anything better.The existence I dream of is somewhat reminiscent of the world of Henry Spencer, the main character in Eraserhead, who becomes father to a hideously deformed baby. That's what the film is about at face value, but the very style in which it is portrayed is the real beauty of it. The setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately depressing I have ever seen. And although Henry seems to be devoid of any spark of personality, we can't help but sympathise with him throughout the film.Similar to my dream, the only form of light is artificial, the streets are virtually empty, and the only person in the entire film who has any personality is the father-in-law, and the only thing he has to talk about is his poor health. He also seems to be the only one with any link to better times. (""I've watched this city turn from pastures to the hell-hole it is now."") The city they live in is completely industrialized, and the only plant life seen is dead, and in a pile of soil on Henry's bedside table.Some have suggested it is based after a nuclear holocaust, but nothing is explained to any conclusion. One of the beauties of this film is that it practically begs the viewer to decide for themselves what any of it means, and there are many theories. I warn you not to read the message board of Eraserhead before you see the film, as it is so much more powerful and chilling to experience it first-hand.The first time I saw Eraserhead, I was completely confused. It is possible that David Lynch just put a load of random imagery together and called it a film. Maybe he wanted the viewers to put it all together and make their own sense of it (or not). On the other hand, there might actually be a set formula behind it and only the very open-minded and discerning audience can properly decipher it.One viewing of Eraserhead is enough to raise about a dozen questions, and to leave you gasping for answers. Two viewings are probably enough to give you theories about some of the cryptic depictions hauntingly portrayed. Three viewings might be enough to give you a completely different set of theories, battling persistently against your previous conceptions, but still leaving just a few details that don't quite seem to fit in. The truth is that there may be parts that don't make sense in one interpretation, but fit in perfectly to another. You could probably watch Eraserhead several times, and each time see a slightly different story. Or if you were to ask six different people exactly what Eraserhead is about, you would get six different answers, each equally correct in their own right, and each equally confused.That being said, this definitely isn't a film for everyone. This is the first Lynch film I have seen, and it certainly won't be the last. But there will no doubt be many who see this purely as a lot of clever mind tricks and special effects (for its time, anyway.) There will be those who don't like much to think about, and want it all explained bit by bit in perfect detail. Well, Eraserhead is an epitome of everything such moviegoers will hate. I will say this for certain: If your favourite films are 'Love Actually' or 'Dude, Where's My Car?', you probably won't get much out of Eraserhead. But for those who like their concepts challenged once in a while, this film will probably be one to watch again and again until you understand. This is also not a film to be forgotten easily.

It does a very good job of attracting the mind to think in a deeper sense and decipher what in fact is going on.

504,xpiths,unsettling and surreal journey,10,28 January 2017,"""Eraserhead is an unsettling and surreal journey, like looking into a mirror and seeing someone else's reflection. Floating in an inky nothingness, Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) appears serene but concerned. A rock appears superimposed over his features, with him yet elsewhere. Inside the pockmarked planet a man (Jack Fisk) exists, alternately staring intently out of his grimy window or considering the array of signal-box levers in front of him. Henry's mouth slowly opens, disgorging a pallid, stringy worm-like creature. Stung into action, the man in the planet grasps his levers and briefly struggles with them. The worm is cast into a muddy puddle, leaving Henry as he was before. Welcome to the world of Eraserhead.""",Eraserhead

If awards were given for worst movie then this thing would definitely be TOP contender for worst movie ever filmed.

A very disturbing film in it's own way, films like this have allowed directors like Lynch to carry on a tradition of macabre surrealism. David Lynch knows how to blend these elements and make them work. Eraserhead is surely one of the finest blends of surrealism and Avant-Garde to be seen.Every time I see this film, I always wonder what an expecting mother must think about the possibility of the pregnancy turning for the worst. One thing is certain when watching this film: you will feel more frightened than watching a slasher flick.This can be a hard DVD/Video to find, but that's why we have the fantastic ebay!

It had steadily drained from pop culture like the contents of a boil, and only existed in the hidden collections of a very, very few devotees for many years, like the most repugnant fetish porn.This would be a great loss. ""Eraserhead"" is the worst film ever made,and as such it provides the baseline for all film - including adhesive tape, pond scum and the stuff on the tile in the shower rooms of abandoned prisons. All filmmakers since 1977 have been liberated and emboldened by the knowledge that nothing they produce can be called ""the worst"" - not ""The Weatherman,"" not even ""Machete.""Mathematically, it proves that the concept of ""worst"" is finite - that alone is noteworthy.Just as importantly, it proves that no matter how bad something is, there will always be people that try so hard to be different that they will claim to like it.

508,WWEfanSince1997,One-of-a-kind,10,17 February 2006,"I have seen this film, by writing this, four times already and still haven't figured out what everything really exactly means. It is about Henry Spencer, his girlfriend Mary X and their new born baby; a little mutant looking freak. The rest is basically a mix of bizar and surreal imagery, the biggest strenght of this film; a powerful mix of images and sounds. A man in a little house in a strange planet, a 'chipmunk'-lady in a radiator singing about everything in heaven being fine, a more than strange family dinner and a pencil machine are among the things the viewer gets to witness. What it al means? I can't quite tell, and director David Lynch sure doesn't want to tell that himself. Which, in my opinion, is actually a good thing; to let the viewers make up their own minds to what it all means to them. It is a strange, surreal dream, a nightmare, a vision, thoughts born out of fear or frustration. This film is a lot to me, and I am pretty sure it is a lot to other people as well. Weither you love it or you hate it, after seeing Eraserhead you will think about it and you will probably talk about it, knowing you have never seen a film like it, and you never will again.

510,pligocki,Fear of fatherhood and and the father of all fear,8,11 October 2012,"ERASERHEAD has as its main theme everyman's fear of fatherhood. Or at least, it symbolizes MY fear of fatherhood, and quite possibly, the fear of sexual congress itself. The many visual references to fertility and to the tortuous hideousness of the zygote/baby reek of a permanent aversion to parenting (and the process of procreating).At times the bleakness of these characters is straight out hilarious—more pregnant pauses (as it were, a bizarre pregnancy) than in any Pinter play. And who hasn't experienced this situation upon meeting the parents?!? The film's own ridiculous ludicrousness brushes against truthfulness and the essence of art—its pervasive preposterousness reveals the inner workings of appalling (yet genuine) feelings. As if darkness were turned outside in and downside up, the certain and utterly desolating and isolating consequences of toying with societies black holes are all-encompassing. This dearth of anything remotely healthy inexorably grounds these characters towards a fate as apprehensively unpredictable as it is inevitable. If the film is shocking, so are the repressed thought-emotions that fuel its repulsiveness. Rather than simply concluding that such imagery and dialog is the result of some disgusting dream, it seems more accurate to say that ERASERHEAD can lead the viewer to a new state of awakening. The kind of waking up that forever precludes the blessed change to a sleepy and gentle state of mind. The kind of eternal awakeness that cannot be altered, understood, or endured.",Eraserhead
511,nekros150,One of the best films to date,10,1 June 2005,"I first saw eraserhead a week ago and from that point i saw it again 3 times to better understand the multiple meanings that lynch tried to communicate thru this work of art and every time i discovered something else. This is possibly the best film made by David lynch, the way it is shot the editing, the weird factor goes thru the roof, incredible acting by all the actors they played their roles to perfection making us feel that we were there right next to them in that industrial nightmare filled with strange noises and the feeling of anxiety at every step. The sound deserves a special note because it is one of the best scores i've ever heard in a movie. It's haunting, never stopping for a second never giving the viewer any time to recuperate and it contributes a lot to the general feeling of the movie along with the many themes and ideas that are hidden beneath the surface from alienation, abortion to the deep study of human psyche, ideas that pop out at every corner.

It's one of the films that I love the most, but will not watch very often. It's tough to watch. And that's a very good thing!For me Eraserhead is sort of a key to the collective works of David Lynch. There are so many visual, emotional and sound references that it cannot be counted on two hands only. There are floors and heavy curtains like the ones in ""The Black Lodge"" in ""Twin Peaks"". There are piles of dirt like the ones in ""Fire Walk With Me"". When ""The Lady . In The Radiator"" sings she reminds of the performance of ""In Dreams"" in Blue Velvet. The special effects is a pre-stage of what goes on in ""Elephant Man"" and (to some extend) Dune. And of course the entire mood is just so much ""Lynch""! Excellent.",Eraserhead

515,suhan01,"Captivating, Humorous and Disturbing",10,19 September 2014,"Eraserhead is either a film that you either, love, hate or grow to love. Most of the film is seemingly incoherent and lacks a typical plot line that is nearly standard in today's films. This type of indecisive directing by Lynch helps to establish this film as one designed strictly for audience interpretation although Lynch himself has said that he didn't anticipate the film to be viewed by audiences at all. While this film is highly disturbing, it is also quite thought provoking and can be universally related throughout many communities and cultures.While Eraserhead is from 1977 and had access to color, it was done in black and white. I believe that this intentional lack of color was to enhance the interpretation of Henry's character. Who is Henry? What is he thinking about? Is what is happening in the scene actually happening or is Henry delusional or suffering from a mental illness? The sounds of the creature child add to the chilling effect of this film.From a theme standpoint, I believe that Eraserhead deals with a number of common concerns that are prevalent in our culture, religion, sin, guilt, shame, regret, mental illness, sexual repression and suicide. While these themes are not explicitly spoken about or even mentioned throughout the film, the tone and the symbolism that is found speaks loudly. The lighting throughout the film is quite exceptional, it helps to define the symbols and gives the viewer a deeper understanding of the dark undertone of the film. Overall, I think this is one of the most artistic films that I have ever seen and is definitely one that film lovers should experience at least twice.",Eraserhead
516,Stew_Finn,An interesting experience,7,19 November 2005,"Eraserhead, David Lynch's first feature film, is perhaps the strangest, most cryptic, and generally bizarre piece of cinema I've ever seen.It is the story of Henry Spencer, a timid printer who is forced to marry his girlfriend after she gives birth to a deformed baby. What sets it apart from other films is that much of the film is shown in cryptic metaphors that take a great deal of thought to decipher. This isn't helped by the fact that what's real and what's not tend to blend together seamlessly. If you're anything like me, you will be absolutely baffled your first viewing.While the strange way the story is presented is enough to merit a viewing, it is clear that David Lynch is a master at creating powerful visuals. One scene that particularly struck me is where Mary comes out of the kitchen, sobbing, and can be seen behind her eerie, grinning father. While some of the scenes end being downright absurd, when Lynch gets it right, he gets it right.The soundtrack is another piece of interest. It's strange, fairly ambient, and fits the film perfectly. In Heaven is one of the most chilling uses of a song ever. Really an excellent score.Jack Nance does a superb job at the nervous, awkward Henry, but other than that, the acting is nothing spectacular.Now, this movie does do some things wrong. While it may come down to personal preference, I found the pacing to be excruciatingly slow. I honestly think that this hurt the film more than anything else. It became tedious and painful to watch at some points, because things go so slowly. Of course, the fact that I didn't get what was going on certainly didn't help, but the pace is still nearly unbearable.As I've said before, some of the scenes simply don't work. The grandmother, head, and chicken ones in particular come off more comedic than disturbing. It's understandable with a film like this, but it's a point worth mentioning.All in all, Eraserhead is an interesting, if flawed, film that is worth at least one viewing. 7/10",Eraserhead
517,lordofthegrave,Film of the 20th century,9,12 July 2007,"David Lynch's first feature is a psychotic nightmare set in a dark, industrial world where the constant whirling and grinding of the ambiance is enough to drive you to the edge of sanity, let alone the screams of the protagonist's mutation of a child or the lady that lives inside of his radiator or, in one of the film's most memorable scenes, the loss of his head (before it is concentrated down to form pencil erasers. And if you think that that explains the title, you're only just getting there). David Lynch's world is like nothing before it, introducing, with Jodorowsky's El Topo, 'the Midnight Movie', and while it influenced established directors like Kubrick, nothing has been committed to colloid since that comes close to what Eraserhead achieved in 1977. But behind the glass, soot and dirt and underneath its dream-like ambiguity hides a very simple film, with one simple theme. The fear of parenthood. Perhaps.In what might be reality or nightmare (or both) Henry Spencer (played by Jack Nance, who would go on to act in most of Lynch's films until his death in 1996) makes brilliant use of the sparsely written screenplay, delivering a solid performance based on almost the use of facial expression alone. And while he carries most of the film on his back, that's not to say that the supporting cast don't do a brilliant job too, Allen Job as Mr. X in particular adds an extra level of eccentricity to the already bizarre script ('We've got chicken tonight. Strangest damn things. They're man made. Little damn things. Smaller than my fist. But they're new. Hi, I'm Bill.') while Charlotte Stewart managers to deliver perfectly the most disturbingly enigmatic line ever-uttered in cinema ('Mother, they're still not sure it is a baby!') upon Henry's discovery that he is a father. But the real star of Lynch's sick show must be the baby. For Eraserhead to work Lynch had to, with the very limited budget he had, create something that perfectly captured Henry's disdain and confusion towards his newfound responsibility that came with his child. Here Lynch does not only accomplish this but he creates something so disturbing in Henry's premature baby that it will stay with you long after the credits role. Shaped like what one can only assume an aborted ET would look like, Lynch has remained typed lipped about how he created it since the film's release, but strong rumours suggest it was an actual calf foetus, adding even more to the thick air of mystery already surrounding the film. It's a testament to Lynch's skills that the baby is still as shocking today as when the film was first released.While a lot of people may dismiss Eraserhead for its lack of coherent narrative, this would be foolish, as even though the film relies heavily on Dali/Bunuel imagery and dream logic, it is far from the puzzles Lynch would later create (Muholland Drive, Lost Highway and INLAND EMPIRE in particular) and, in my mind at least, runs in a linear manner, thus making the understanding of Henry's decent into murder a little easier to understand then the study of some other surrealists. That's not to say that the plot holds one single, definite meaning, to one person Lynch's story maybe a tale of a man's decent into suicide, to another it's a study of life and death and what happens in the space afterwards and to a third person, a story of an alien visitor, lost on an alien world. The last one, metaphorically, maybe the closest to the truth.Lynch's characterisation and direction is flawless and Henry's situation in life is reflected perfectly in the slow camera movement and symbolism, most notably when we are shown the view from his bedroom window  a brick wall. Like the baby there are certain images in Eraserhead that will stay with you for the rest of your life, the 'Beautiful Girl Across the Hall' and her and Henry's embrace in what appears to be a bath of milk, the bloodied stepping upon of giant sperm and of course Henry's head falling off and landing in a random street are but a few. The black and white visuals not only aid the nightmarish reality of Henry's situation and show off the brilliant lighting, but give the film such a timeless feel that it will still be the same experience for decades to come. This is helped tenfold by the fact that even though surreal, Lynch's film taps into the realist and strongest of human emotions as its run it's course to bloody climax and then stays with you for days where it, like The Lady in Radiator, draws you back, beckoning you back into it's world. In Heaven, everything is fine. Lynch's visual poetry exhibits what should be done in cinema, in a world filled with the generic blockbuster. It uses the medium to its full strength and in that sense Eraserhead demonstrates what film should be about, creating a piece of art that has only been possible since 1895 and is only possible with the power of a camcorder. It is pure cinema and a pure masterpiece. Whether you hate it or fall in love with it, there is no denying that Lynch's hypnotic imagery makes you feel as you've woken from the deepest dream/nightmare you have ever dreamt and for that experience it is worth viewing alone. But once you've seen it once, Eraserhead can only be seen again and again. And with a film as frightening, strange and alarming as this, that is a real achievement. Jamie Panton",Eraserhead

Since the kinetoscope? What is film's purpose? What does this have to do with eraserhead? Nothing. Everything. Something in between?A lot of synopses I have read attempt to explain what this film ""is"" or ""means."" What it means is only as clear as the viewer's prejudice and subjective perception enables that viewer to see. I have studied film and literature and taught at University. What do I think that enables me to have? A more erudite subjectivity perhaps. Or a more westernized idea of what is ""going on."" What seems to be going on is time moving circuitously collapsing on some sort of religious/industrial idea of linearity. A solipsist nightmare perhaps in that we are all solipsists because that is all we can know in the end. There are many ideas of dreams present in the film. Dreams being interspersed with waking realities give me the idea that there are similar functions as that of lost highway at work here. I read one comment that said this film was ""art"" and it must be looked at in that way. I do not know what exactly is meant by this differentiation of ""art"" from film, as if they are separate-as if oranges and fruit are divergent species. One is merely a subclassification. Like other visual arts however, if one looks at this film from different angles, as if it were a piece of sculpture perhaps, or rather, not concentrate on what are given to us as the ""main focal points"" i.e. henry, mary x and her x family, the baby, the landlady etc. other things seem to be going on. What importance these other things have is left up to the individual's own god complex to figure out. Or, more simply put, I think folks need to stop wondering what this and that means, as if it means anything at all. What if it doesn't? What if it never has or will? e.g. Kurtz's horror in conrad's heart of darkness. There is an idea of absurdity, as in ionesco's rhinoceros. What is this thing or that thing doing here? it normally does not appear here? yet we use only 6% of our brains. perhaps we were meant to eat other foods and just do not know it. There can be seen several symbols. And if one looks hard enough, one can even make some up that are not even there! Mary X-is she a virgin? Did henry and she have sexual intercourse as mary's mother asked? if they did not, how did the child come to be? View the pencil as if it is Henry himself. one end negates the other. Does this have meaning? why is there always the need for some great moral? answer? to prove, to hope even, that morals do indeed exist. but this is not my idea of what is going on in the movie. I do not think anything is actually ""going on"" or that it has any real meaning, as in g.g. marquez's ""magically realistic"" tales told to him by his grandfather.

I've never felt compelled to write a review until today because my opinion on a film has never been so polar opposite to the consensus; even when I hate a movie, I can usually see how it might appeal to others. I'm not going to tell you not to watch this movie, but I will break the style down a bit and you can decide from there. If you like films like Possession (1981) or Suspiria that are 'artsy' and where nothing that seems to contribute to any sort of coherent plot occurs until 15 minutes from the end, then you'll probably like this (Suspiria wasn't actually too bad compared to this movie though). The only difference with Eraserhead is that there is no plot at all and nothing significant happens at any point (except the mutant baby existing). I have an image in my mind of how the idea of this movie came about... *Watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre*
""Why did Tobe Hooper go through all the effort of making Leatherface kill people? He's ugly enough that it would still be a horror film if he just sat around crying all the time.. but I guess a couple freaky dream scenes should be added to trick people into thinking something is actually happening in the movie..."" *lightbulb* I HAVE AN IDEA""....
.....I feel like this movie being called a horror film is insulting to real-life dysfigured people if you think about it, because there is no real danger in the movie, only an ugly baby. It's crazy this guy went on to direct The Elephant Man (which I haven't watched, but is supposedly sensitive with regards to the issue).I was reading an interview with the director David Lynch before I watched the film, and learned that when he first told the company he wanted to make Eraserhead, the script was only 21 minutes long.. Thus, he had to stretch it out. How did he do this? With long, drawn-out scenes where nothing of significance and no dialogue occurs, such as Henry looking at stuff or walking around. For example, the first 6-ish minutes consist of a slow zoom-in on a moon-looking planet. About 12 minutes in my dad asked if this movie has any dialogue at all, so I looked to see if there was any IMDB quotes. After watching the film, I'm convinced every line that occurred in Eraserhead has been documented by IMDB. Not much is said in the movie, and even less actually happens.I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 because I appreciate the visual style, such as the only view outside the windows being brick, which sets an ominous mood. Why can't movies have a stylish artsy flair but also have a coherent plot and move at a pace faster than a dead snail?

I guess I am not artistic enough, or intellectual enough.Yes, boys and girls ""artists"" and ""intellectuals"", the emperor has NO clothes, and this is a piece of crap of a movie.",Eraserhead
529,curekid238,i may know the point of eraserhead,5,15 October 2005,"What if Lynch is trying to give us an over the top image in order to make us think about this: I was in class the other day, and my professor's 4 year old son was there. The boy was constantly getting into things and making distractions for the students. As a result, the professor said to the class, ""that's why God makes kids cute, so that you don't kill them."" It got me thinking about Eraserhead and the wholy grotesque nature of the baby. It cried just as a normal baby cries, except normal babies are usually cute and so our first reaction is not to harm the child, but cradle it and comfort it. Reacting towards the baby's 'cry' in Eraserhead, Henry murders the baby. Think about it. I may be totally off, but give me some feedback.",Eraserhead
530,marcdavidperry,Don't watch this the same day you get your COVID vaccine,6,4 April 2021,"This movie came out when I was in Uni, and since I'd moved across the country I didn't have my regular gang of friends to go see it. So it wasn't even on my radar. When I became aware of it I was more into Rocky Horror or Monty Python if I went to a late night show at the revue theatre in Berkeley. So fast forward 40+ years and Eraserhead shows up on Netflix after nearly a year into the pandemic. Kudos to David Lynch for making a film that evoked a physiological response of sustained unease-but _some_ of those somatic sensations and symptoms turned out to be the flu-like side effects of the AZ adenovirus jab (it had been 12 hrs), but some of it was the movie.Imagine what it would be like if your favourite William Burroughs writing was turned into a film . . . .",Eraserhead
531,braxium,"Interesting as a whole, but not as a movie",7,15 December 2017,"The thing that captivated me most about this movie is that when you dissect it into its distinct elements, you get to see many different well made sides to it. The most important element - to me - is the soundtrack. The experience of the movie is aligned in such a way that it feels like you are listening to an album by David Lynch, and the picture is an accompanying video for it. I could even name it as a dark ambient masterpiece. Of course, there are all kinds of musicians of that movement who could comparatively be much better than Lynch, but nevertheless a soundtrack so much tailored for a movie being dark ambient in origin makes it really worthwhile. The imagery is quite cerebral, I even found some parts that belong to my dreams. And it isn't meant to be horrific, but something more rather innately disturbing, something that lurks beneath that is mutual for many people but unexplored. And of course, the soundtrack draws these out of the picture and makes it all work.My only issue is that the plot wasn't on par with the other elements, it feels like the movie isn't meant to be viewed as a film, but rather a audiovisual collage that aims to express something subliminal. That doesn't of course mean bad news, but there were shifts from the visual aspects of the movie to narrative sections that didn't really express as much and didn't really convey any useful information about the events. I didn't really expect the movie to tell me a story in the first place, I just wanted to see how dark ambient would look like, to be honest.Summary: The movie didn't need a story, it didn't even need to label itself as a movie. Really good soundtrack, accompanying and being accompanied by really nice subliminal imagery.",Eraserhead

533,jzdellnger,read this eraserhead commentary first,10,20 December 2005,"i have seen many films of many varieties from all around the world and from all different periods in time, including many cult favorites and ""masterpieces"". this is still my favorite.many people here and elsewhere are inclined to call this ""art"" and make a distinction between that and ""movies"". worse yet is the ""genius"" applause. these may be accurately proscribed comments, but the label's are frivolous, and limiting and i believe unnecessary. it is really a classic cult movie. and though it is severe and focused like an art film or a piece of art, it is entirely pedestrian in nature.however, i suppose it is necessary to ""warn"" people before they watch eraserhead, for a number of reasons. it is not fair to say it has no plot, but it is fair to say that the plot is eclipsed by the space and the light and imagery and actions. it imposes a particular experience of time which involves you in things most movies don't involve you in. the sound is a big part of this and you might say it has an embryonic quality. there is a very substantial progression to the film, and it is described and presented in intimately related dramatic scenes, ...but still you may be distracted (and intoxicated) at times, by divergent camera journeys through puddles of water and reflections of clouds etc. oh yea, it is also intermittently DISGUSTING.besides being a cult movie, i think it is an occult movie and i think it evokes its own totally unique and living, yet entirely familiar and mundane, symbolic language. (i am told that it set off a decade long chain reaction of ""weirdo industrial scenery student films"".) there is a rhythm and seduction to eraserhead that is irresistible, even when it is offensive and horrifying. after you watch it a while you may burst out laughing, i don't know. it is impossibly infernal and antiseptic at the same time and it may cause seizures for some.",Eraserhead
534,oxo80,"This won't spoil the movie for you, but it may spoil the fun of trying to figure it out yourself...",10,26 February 2006,"Now I'm not going to pretend that this is going to be a very well thought out analysis of the film Eraserhead, as I have only just finished watching it for the second time, and I'm still shuffling some ideas around in my hopefully not eraser worthy brain.I'll try to be coherent: The true story of this movie is not of a couple living in a post-apocalyptic world, with a mutant baby, as I have seen it described, but the internal decay of the main character Henry. From the beginning through to the very end, the surreal imagery is all relative to Henry's mental condition. Now it doesn't have to get this specific, but you can rationalize it down to the fact that Henry has a mental tumour or growth that is causing his grip on reality to fracture and decay and is slowly killing him.Everywhere Henry goes, we see destruction. It's in all things, -the barren dug up earthen fields he walks, the house with a hole in the roof and cracked windows in which sits the charred man pulling the levers, to his apartment which gives new meaning to the decorative term ""earthy"". Lynch uses the mounds of earth as a symbol for decay, much the way Dali does with ants in his paintings and short film ""Un Chien Andalou"". A recurring image of Henry's interior decay is light bulbs dimming or burning out altogether when he's around...and we take this as a figurative illustration of the sort of erratic synaptic firings that are happening inside the ol' Eraserhead.Now there may or may not be a Mary X and a Family X, it could all be part of Henry's dissilusions, but their roles are less important than that of the ""baby""...the fact that the ""Doctors aren't even sure if it is a baby"" about sums it up. Lynch couldn't have made it more ambiguous...it's not a proper baby, it's not a mutant...it's a growth. It's a manifestation of Henry's tumour or whatever disease it is that is eating him from the inside. Once Henry is ""left alone"" (it's all relative to who actually exists or not) with it, it suddenly starts decaying hideously. Henry's condition worsens. The only redemption he can find from his terrifying insanity is in a vision of a lady in his radiator inviting him to heaven through the radiator bars as if they were the pearly gates themself, telling him that there everything is fine. The woman herself is deformed as well, as Henry's projection of his sickness pervades everything around him. Yet the woman is his redemptor as she crushes the little wormly fetuses, helping soothe the spread of the tumour within. Henry's tumour manifests itself in a couple of other ways as well, one is the man in the house with the hole in the roof. The house is a cage, it's his skull, and it's got a severe deformity if it has a hole in the top, letting out all sanity. The man is charred, burned and twitchy, he's in decay, yet he's the one pulling the levers for Henry's brain. His tumour is a malignant, destructive thing, yet it is what is in control. It is what releases the worm like babies....it's sending itself elsewhere to create further decay. Henry's apartment is like himself...it's in decay, and the piles of earth do more than just remind of us that in a passive way...Henry's pet worm that he finds in his mail box tunnels through the earth gorging itself on it. That is what worms do, they eat their way through earth, and as a metaphor they are a physical representation of the destructive force of Henry's tumour, which is eating itself through his brain. Now I wish I could watch the movie again before I wrap this up, but I'll do my best with what my memory gives me. A couple of tangents...Henry fantasizes about his beautiful next door neighbour, but as she enters his world, he doesn't want her to see his growth...ie the baby, he doesn't want her to recognize his problem, but as they make love she can't help but notice, while all the while being sucked down into the void of Henry's psyche. The next thing that happens is that Henry's brain is being probed and drilled into, again highlighting the sensations and pains Henry must be receiving from this malignant growth. The next time Henry sees his neighbour, (in reality), he imagines she looks at him and sees only his decay, ie the head of the baby. This is when we come to the final destruction, the final decay, the final seizure or anneurysm.... The baby, the growth is only very precariously being held together by its bandages...as Henry's sanity is also dangling very precariously. Henry decides to stop fighting, and let the baby, let his sickness loose, to grow and overtake him, which it does, the insides of the baby swell and overflow and the baby's head increases in size 10 times, and the rest of the apartment self destructs, the power outlets spark, the lights go into epileptic fit, and the sound effects, which I have failed to mention but play an important psychological role all through, come to an excruciating head. Henry is left facing what it was we saw in the opening scene...what looked like a planet but what is actually his tumour, exploding towards him, and then it's all over and he's in the arms of the Lady from the Radiator, holding her, letting go of the pain and the trouble, and ready for his good thing. It's a very obtuse film, but very sad and beautiful and troubling all at once. It'll never leave you. -Ed",Eraserhead
535,kang-5,A memorable movie.....,9,24 March 2006,"when you're in your twenties. I've seen it sober, I've seen it drunk, I've seen it high and it's the strangest movie I've seen, ever. It's great talking to the current generation of young people who have heard about it but haven't seen yet. It sparks an interest to see something other than the mainstream stuff. Actually, I wanted to buy it a few years ago, but the price was $60! I would have thought Lynch's college bills would have been paid off by then. It's worth your time just to see it and make your own opinion. I keep wondering what flick to pair it with for a good double feature. Maybe one of the old French 'film noir' flicks.",Eraserhead
