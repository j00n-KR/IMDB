0,Leofwine_draca,Vietnam war epic is one of the best of its type,10,3 December 2016,"A solid and highly impressive war movie, one of the latest to follow in the wake of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and one which is no less moving and powerful. This time around the setting is Vietnam at the beginning of the war in 1965, but the setting and the enemy is not really important. Instead this film focuses on the humanity of the American soldiers involved and the way they must band together in order to survive, employing the now clichéd ""leave no man behind"" type morale to lead them through it. The film is utterly entertaining due to the tons of action and fighting that it offers and only now, with the modern advent of digital effects, can cinema deliver incredible scenes of action and violence in a realistic manner (check out the napalm bombing, where CGI planes fly past overheard and they look just like the real thing).Mel Gibson is a good choice as the lead, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, and even if the film hadn't been as good it still could have been carried by Gibson alone, who adopts the persona as his own and puts in an assured, likable, human but tough performance. Gibson's becoming a real pro at portraying military leaders these days and his performance here is no exception, one of the finest I've seen from the man. Similarly there are also some great supporting roles from Greg Kinnear (underused as a helicopter pilot sickened by the death toll) and Sam Elliott as a tough but worthy sergeant. Also worth watching for is Barry Pepper as an American reporter, forced to take up arms and fight for his life when the battle closes in around him.The film is strong on sentimentality and very moving in parts, especially the scenes where the wives back home decide to deliver the death letters themselves. Although sentimental it never gets overdone or mawkish like in a Spielberg movie, never uncomfortable. The action sequences are excellent and the movie has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. In the documentary on the DVD it says that over ten thousand bullet shots are heard in the movie and they come at you constantly from all directions, really putting you into the middle of the battle like BLACK HAWK DOWN did.The film is also pretty gory with one or two scenes of ultra-horror, such as the Chinese soldier who gets his body destroyed with napalm but still carries on surviving. Special effects, both computer and makeup, are outstanding and the music is more than appropriate, especially a Scottish ballad that they play which is pretty moving. I also liked the fact that we saw from the point of view of the Vietcong, albeit briefly; this humanises an enemy so often portrayed as simply demonic and evil and gives the film an extra level. WE WERE SOLDIERS is a prime-time piece of entertainment and one of the best films of the year.",We Were Soldiers
1,SnoopyStyle,Great war action,8,8 April 2014,"Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is a proponent of the new Air Cavalry strategy. He's a smart insightful soldier who forms an elite force combining ground forces with helicopters. The war in Vietnam is in its opening stages. The movie starts with their formation back in the States. It climaxes when in 1965, Moore and his men engage the much larger North Vietnamese force in a small battlefield in the first battle of its kind.Based on Moore's book, the action is compelling and realistic. The home front story doesn't detract from the action. It's important to see Moore's home life. The battle doesn't demonize the enemy, and shows as much as reasonably expected of the opposition. There is a few characters that is allowed to have compelling story lines. Even though the battlefield can be confusing, the movie never is.",We Were Soldiers
2,Prismark10,Graphic war scenes but inert story,5,13 May 2019,"This fact based drama stars Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore. He has gathered a force of 400 troopers and with aerial support they land in the Ia Drang Valley of north Vietnam in November 1965. It is the first major battle of the Vietnam War.The US 7th Air Cavalry are surrounded by over 2000 enemy soldiers and they engage in a bloody battle to break through the North Vietnamese lines.Back home the loved ones of the soldiers get news of what has been taking place. Moore needs to live up to the promise to his soldiers. ""I will leave no man behind...dead or alive. We will all come home together.""Randall Wallace who wrote Braveheart reunited with Mel Gibson for We Were Soldiers. This time Wallace also directs and the war scenes are directly influenced by Saving Private Ryan. It is bloody and graphic.However the story is pedestrian. When the action shifts to the family back home it becomes saccharine and even frankly silly as Moore's wife delivers letters to soldiers wives telling them that their husbands have died.The big explosions are done well. The story even if it is true does not compare with Platoon or Apocalypse Now. The characters are two dimensional, they are stock characters that could had arrived from any multitude of war films.Ironically, Gibson directed a better war film with Hacksaw Ridge.",We Were Soldiers
3,gavin6942,A New Perspective on Vietnam,7,2 October 2010,"Short review: I typically do not care for Vietnam War movies. Some, like Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" are good. ""Platoon"" is alright, ""Casualties of War"" is okay... ""Hamburger Hill"" is blah, ""Good morning Vietnam"" too happy. The running theme is either firefights (which is good eye candy but poor storytelling) or the futility of war.""We Were Soldiers"" has a different take. First, Mel Gibson plays a colonel with a degree, allowing him to not only think like a soldier but an academic. He understands military history and why strategies have or have not worked, and why Vietnam is as pointless as Korea was.But what really stood out was the focus on the wives. The story is almost always about the boys becoming men in the battlefield. We rarely, if ever, see their parents or spouses. Here is an exception... the wives are their own squadron, bonding together and keeping strong. And that's the reality of war: people don't just die -- someone else has to feel that loss.",We Were Soldiers
4,jboothmillard,We Were Soldiers,4,28 July 2006,"Based on a true story, a book called We Were Soldiers Once... and Young, this is quite an intriguing war film. Someone in a documentary about the film said that nearly all war films are not accurate, so director Randall Wallace stars as Lt. Col. Hal Moore and leads a bunch of recruits to the battle of Vietnam. You can see in this film why the Vietnam war was not only one of the biggest, but mainly one of the most unpopular, e.g. because of the amount of violence. The moments that mainly stick out are obviously the war, but also the letters to family and deaths of close friends. Also starring Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore, Greg Kinnear as Maj. Bruce 'Snake' Crandall, Sam Elliott as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley, American Pie's Chris Klein as 2nd Lt. Jack Geoghegan, Keri Russell as Barbara Geoghegan and Saving Private Ryan's Barry Pepper as Joe Galloway. Okay!",We Were Soldiers
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Violence Overdone, But Still A Solid War Movie",8,1 August 2006,"Although still a solid war movie, it wasn't up to my expectations, although it's still a ""keeper"" in my collection. With the cast, and hype of this film at the time of its release, I excepted something more, something akin to Saving Private Ryan.....but it wasn't to be. Even though the latter is known for its graphic violence, it's this film that I thought the violence was overdone, not SPR. The action here doesn't start for 40 minutes, but when it does it loud, it's heavy and it's continuous over most of the next 95 minutes.Shorter periods of the violent scenes would have made this much better, maybe even an ""excellent"" film.""We Were Soldiers"" had things I appreciated that are rare in today's action films: 1 - a pro-military film concerning a Viet Nam war battle; 2- fairly tame language. This is not pro-Viet Nam War. Hollywood would never do that, but at least it shows the soldiers in a solid, valiant light. It's also refreshing to see good references to God and prayer. Mel Gibson's character here is a decent Catholic. Greg Kinnear is solid, too, as the helicopter pilot and Madeline Stowe had a memorable scene delivering message of war deaths to their spouses. That was touching stuff. But, mostly, this is an action film and the battle scenes are gruesome at times, particularly near the end of the film.",We Were Soldiers
6,rmax304823,Portent of Things to Come,6,7 June 2003,"I wasn't expecting much from this film because many of the reviews I'd read at the time of its release argued that it, and the book it was based on, were retrograde. The US soldiers provide the heroes and the North Vietnamese the villains. But it wasn't nearly so simple as that.Obviously it's been heavily influenced by ""Saving Private Ryan"", at least in one respect. It's even gorier than SPR. If a phosphorous grenade explodes, we see the Grunt with the flaming stuff stuck to his skin and clothing, burning holes into him, and we see a buddy cutting away the burning flesh of his cheek with a knife. When a Grunt is caught in a friendly-napalm blast he really burns and afterward his charred flesh is blackened, so that when a buddy tries to take his legs and pull him towards a Medivac the flesh of both legs from the knees down peels off into his buddy's hands. And of course there is squib charge upon squib charge exploding in slow motion, an unfortunate cliché by now.One wonders just in passing how far this trend towards realistic gore can go -- and what the purpose behind the trip is. Well, it can't go much farther than it has. It seems just a short time ago that ""M*A*S*H"" had one shocking scene in it -- a wounded soldier in a hospital whose arterial blood pumped out of his body towards the surgeon. Actually it was more than thirty years ago. But our cinematic carnage has progressed by leaps and bounds. ""M*A*S*H"" was an early milestone. So was ""Bonny and Clyde,"" which introduced slow-motion death to American movies. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a shocking blood bath. Now we have ""Blackhawk Down"", with a still-living soldier whose lower half has been blown away. And now there's ""We Were Soldiers.""As for WHY there has been such an increase of realism in violence, well, that's a different question whose answer can only be guessed at. Many cinematic movements like this one seem to follow a trajectory in which each film must out-do the previous examples of the genre. If gore is good box office, then more gore is even better box office. There may be a sincere desire on the part of the producers to show combat as it really is, but like all motives this one may be mixed, with some commercial interests thrown into the stew. And the motives of the audiences who turn these films into marketable products? It would be nice to think that they leave the theaters having learned something about the results of combat. But if that's the case, we don't seem to be showing much evidence of having grasped the lesson. In a sense, sensational gore cheapens and degrades the experience of the men and women who have lived through these extreme situations. So much suffering brings tears to the eyes, especially when we see the survivors visiting graves and monuments after the battle, as we do both here and in ""Saving Private Ryan."" And then, having wept, the audience leaves the theater and embraces the next war. The arousal jag is over. Good intentions, when viewed from a slightly different angle, have an uncanny way of resembling exploitation.Okay. Enough philosophy. The movie is better than I'd expected it to be, the excess of gore and the slow-motion clichés aside. (I was also confused by the topography, although locations are clearly labelled. Where exactly is the creek bed?) There isn't much in the way of home-front scenes, but what there is neatly reflects the anxiety and pain of those left behind. The combat scenes are exhausting. A few hundred Americans opposed by some four thousand regulars of the North Vietnamese army. (About the same ratio of Americans to adversaries as General Custer faced, only he had no air support. Custer is brought up several times.) But, most important, this is the first film I can remember seeing about the Vietnam war in which the enemy is presented as something other than outright evil. There is a good deal of irony in the movie. Mel Gibson prays before the battle. Take us under your wing, and so forth, he asks. Then throws in, ""Ignore those pagans praying to a different God."" Much later in the film, long enough for us to have forgotten Gibson's racist plea, the commander of the North Vietnamese army is also seen praying -- presumably to the same God. And one of the NV soldiers is humanized to the extent of keeping on his person a diary written to his wife. (The soldier wears glasses so we can tell him from the other North Vietnamese and remember him.) He dies heroically and when the Americans take the diary from his body and flip through it, they find a picture of his wife, a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Gibson's wife, played by Madeleine Stowe. We win the battle (Ia Drang) of course, but even this is undercut by irony. The NV commander looks at the piles of bodies after the Americans leave. He shakes his head and says, ""What a tragedy."" The worst part of it, he muses, is that the Americans will treat this as a victory and the war will go on to its necessary end, although now it will mean just that many more deaths.Should you bother watching this? I think so. This one would have been a true original if it had appeared twenty years ago.",We Were Soldiers
7,Quinoa1984,"Contains too many war cliches to be easily enjoyed, but the battle scenes are quite good.",5,4 March 2002,"Randall Wallace, screenwriter of the great Braveheart, fair The Man In the Iron Mask and the horrible Pearl Harbor makes his directorial debut (I think) in this Vietnam war film that takes a different approach to the Vietnam war film- showing the first real battle over there back in late 1965.  Mel Gibson, who once directed and starred in Wallace's Braveheart, stars as Col. Moore, who is chosen to lead the 1st and 7th Cavalry divison of the army into the ""Valley of Death"" in Vietnam danger zone.  Other supporting characters include Greg Kinnear as a smart and efficient pilot with a knickname which would be censored here, Chris Klein who is always with a clean shave and little if no dirt during the battle scenes and honestly looks too womanly to be in such a army, and Barry Pepper as a war journalist dropped during the battle and witnesses first hand the horror that ensues.There are too many cliches to be considered totally realistic and in the early scenes, while interesting and even amusing, make Gibson seem a little softer than he should appear.  Yet, for those in the mood for a different war picture that eerily tries to balance 40's and 50's like corniness with graphic war violence and gives a good story in the mix won't be dissapointed.  Grade: Between A- and B+",We Were Soldiers
8,michaelRokeefe,Fighting men fall from the sky.,7,7 June 2003,"Director Randall Wallace gives us the riveting story of courage and sacrifice as Mel Gibson leads the 7th Cavalry into the first major battle of the Viet Nam War in November 1965. A harrowing event in the Valley of Death, where 400 American troops face 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. The fighting is relentless as both sides try to out maneuver the other. The combat scenes are gory and realistic. A strong cast supports Gibson in one of his better roles. Featured are: Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Madeleine Stowe, Barry Pepper, Don Duong and Kerri Russell.  This war drama is well produced and memorable. Worth your attention for a little over two hours.",We Were Soldiers
9,sunwarrior13,A Movie About Soldiers,10,21 September 2012,"We Were Soldiers is a war film that dramatizes the Battle of Ia Drang on November 14, 1965. It is based on the book,""We Were Soldiers Once And Young"" by Retired Lieutenant General Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway, both of whom were at the battle.The movie stars Mel Gibson together with Madeleine Stowe,Taylor Momsen,Luke Benward,Devon Werkheiser,Sam Elliott,Greg Kinnear,Chris Klein,Keri Russell and Barry Pepper.It was written and directed by Randall Wallace. Lt. Col. Hal Moore is the commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry and the same regiment fatefully led by George Armstrong Custer. As part of the Pleiku Campaign of late 1965, Moore is assigned to an action at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Drang Valley, an area that would come to be known as the ""The Valley of Death."" He soon finds himself and his men contained to an area about the size of a football field, surrounded by more than 2,000 enemy troops and engaged in the first major battle of the war. Heroism becomes the order of the day as men like Moore, chopper pilot Bruce Crandall, and Lt. Henry Herrick refuse to yield, in spite of heavy losses of life. We Were Soldiers is a fitting tribute to all the men and women who have fought and died for their country and for each other.The war genre does that by taking several steps backward with this old-fashioned moralistic saga and by doing a much better job of establishing the characters before they plunge into battle.Also,despite of the violence it portrays on screen,it has a good story and an important message that it wants to impart to the viewer.",We Were Soldiers

11,hitchcockthelegend,"Explosive, both in action and characterisations.",8,3 March 2010,"On Sunday November 14th, Lt. Col. Hal Moore {Mel Gibson} and his 400 strong regiment touched down at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley, Vietnam. Surrounded by around 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers who were well trained and well versed with the terrain, Moore's troopers fought for 56 hours. It was a bloody and brutal battle that was the first major engagement of the Vietnam War. It was ""The Valley Of Death"" in more ways than one.Directed by Randall Wallace, We Were Soldiers is based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once And Young"" by Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway. As always when a War film comes out you get the usual statements trundled out. Things such as ""the most realistic yet"" and ""finally a film to tell it as it was,"" both of which were applied to Wallace's movie. If they happen to be true I have no idea, what with not being a combat veteran myself. What I do know is that personally, We Were Soldiers hits many many high points in its running time of 138 minutes.After a crucial 30 minute build up of the characters, the film switches to the landing of the ""boys"" in Vietnam. From here the action never lets up, with Wallace and his team stunningly recreating the brutality and harshness of this bloody engagement. But crucially the action does not detract from its characters, having been engaged with them at the start of the film, the makers ensure that we stay with these men throughout the battle. Also of note is that the film shows the Vietnamese side of the battle, the fair treatment of both sides a most rewarding thing to see in a War film. There's brilliant cut aways to the Women and families at home, themselves fighting a battle to not lose their minds as their men fight in some faraway land. The emotional aspect significantly racked up high as the dreaded telegrams start being delivered by nameless, faceless yellow cab drivers.The men of the cast are uniformly strong, particularly Gibson, Sam Elliott, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper & Ryan Hurst. While Madeleine Stowe & Keri Russell deliver heartfelt and believable turns on the Women's side. Dean Semler's cinematography is done justice by the new High Definition age and Nick Glennie-Smith's score is just a wonderful, emotive arrangement that taps into the psyche of the viewer. It's looking like it is a divisive film now, certainly in the context of Vietnam War films. So with that it is in danger of becoming the forgotten ""Nam"" movie. Which would be a crying shame for this is a tip top dramatisation of an horrific historical event. Point made, nobody forgotten, great great film. 8/10",We Were Soldiers
12,Theo Robertson,BRAVEHEART Meets THE GREEN BERETS,4,28 September 2003,"Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART ? It starred Mel Gibson who also directed and was scripted by Randall Wallace . The film contains over 200 errors . Does anyone remember THE GREEN BERETS ? That`s the John Wayne western where the Duke saves a homestead called Vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . If you watch WE WERE SOLDIERS you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .First of all what`s with that Scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? I mean what`s the connection between Scotland and `Nam ? Maybe Wallace is using it in the vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - Undeservedly I might add - with several Oscars then so might this film ? Whatever reason it`s included it really jars . Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was expecting him to say something like "" They`ll never take our freedom - The hell they will "" and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and Moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movieWhen not reminding the audience of other movies WWS also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in America not Asia . Hal Moore might have brushed up on the French experience in Indo-China but if that`s the case then he was unique because the American military went out of their way not to read up on the French Indo-China war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict Westmoreland replied  he had nothing to learn from the French "" Who haven`t won a war since the days of Napoleon "" so I was confused as to the portrayal of the NVA in this movie , when in 1965 the American high command , brimming with hubris held the North Vietnamese and VC in contempt . It`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of Vietnam are superlative warriors . They are , but very few Americans believed this in the mid 1960sThere`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? No bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the La Drang valley . Likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the Americans out number the NVA ? I put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of Wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . Take the scene where the American burned to a crisp is flown away screaming "" Tell my wife I love her "" . This should have an emotional impact similar to THAT death scene in PLATOON but here there`s no impact . In fact I found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words "" Tell my wife ... "" while mutilated or dying , I counted at least two other characters use the phrase . Did characters actually say this at the battle ? I`ve no idea but since Randall Wallace wrote the script I do have reservationsI sat in shocked awe watching APOCALYPSE NOW , PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water , I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET , I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER , and after seeing WE WERE SOLDIERS I felt totally patronised",We Were Soldiers
13,zardoz-13,"Mel Gibson needs to make more movies as exciting and entertaining as ""We Were Soldiers.""",8,8 June 2008,"John Wayne would stand up in his grave and salute Mel Gibson if he saw ""Braveheart"" director Randall Wallace's patriotic tribute to the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry in ""We Were Soldiers,"" with Madeleine Stowe, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, and Sam Elliot. This sentimental but adrenalin-laced Vietnam-era war saga about the first battle between the U.S. Army and uniformed North Vietnamese troopers in November 1965 eschews politics and eulogizes the valorous Americans that fell on the field of honor. Unlike the best-known Vietnam War spectacles, such as Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), Oliver Stone's ""Platoon,"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), all of which loudly condemned the war, ""We Were Soldiers"" confines its criticism to the periphery of its explosive pyrotechnics.Nevertheless, this gritty, gung-ho, Mel Gibson, flag-waver is quietly contemptuous about this most ill-handled of American wars. When General Westmoreland wants Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson of ""The Road Warrior"" with a good ole boy southern drawl) to leave the battle and debrief him miles away in Saigon, Moore simply refuses and remains alongside his men. Chiefly, ""We Were Soldiers"" represents the first major Hollywood combat epic to portray the North Vietnamese as flesh and blood mortals with respect and dignity. How willingly American audiences embrace this surprisingly sympathetic treatment of Ho Chi Minh's minions will determine the success of ""We Were Soldiers"" at the box office as well as its overall role in healing our national wounds.""The Man in the Iron Mask"" scenarist-turned-director Randall Wallace based his old-fashioned but cliché-cluttered combat screenplay on the 535-page, non-fiction best-seller by Lieutenant General Hal Moore (Ret.) and war correspondent Joseph Galloway entitled ""We Were Soldiers and Young."" Opening in 1954, ""We Were Soldiers"" shows the wily North Vietnamese Army ruthlessly wiping out French troops in the Ia' Drang Valley, a.k.a. 'The Valley of Death.' ""If you kill all they send, NVA commander, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An (Don Duang of ""Three Seasons"") contends, ""they will stop coming."" Eventually, the French stopped coming. The U.S. military followed in their ill-fated footsteps eleven years later. The rugged terrain of Vietnam prompted Pentagon strategists to deploy troops by helicopter. They picked Lt. Col. Hal Moore, a Harvard graduate with an International Relations degree, to command the newly redesigned Airborne, 7th Cavalry. The first half of ""We Were Soldiers"" follows Moore as he acclimates his troops to helicopters. He instills in one young officer, Second Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein of ""Rollerball""), the importance of caring for his men. Veteran Sergeant-Major Basil Plumley (scene-stealing Sam Elliot of ""Dog Watch""), who prefers his reliable .45 automatic pistol to the new M-16 assault rifle, shadows Moore.Flying Moore's men into combat is ace chopper pilot Major Crandall (Greg Kinnear of ""As Good As It Gets"") in his best ever action role. Wallace provides glimpses of Moore's home life with his wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe of ""Bad Girls"") and their five rambunctious children. Inevitably, when President Johnson orders them into action, our heroesall 395 of them-wind up in the Valley of Death pitted against 4000 NVA regulars during a devastating three day engagement. The bullet-riddled second half of ""We Were Soldiers"" climaxes in Vietnam with savage hand-to-hand combat.Covering ground similar to Ridley Scott's superb ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""We Were Soldiers"" boasts not only more heart and soul, but it also exhibits bouts of grisly violence. Mel Gibson needs to make more movies as exciting and entertaining as ""We Were Soldiers.""",We Were Soldiers
14,grantss,Great battle scenes but pretty weak in many other areas,6,1 May 2016,"Great battle scenes but pretty weak in many other areas.A telling of the 1st Battalion, 7 Cavalry Regiment, 1st Calvary Division's battle against overwhelming odds in the La Drang valley of Vietnam in 1965. Seen through the eyes of the battalion's commander, Lt. Col. Hal Moore (played by Mel Gibson), we see him take command of the battalion and its preparations to go into Vietnam. We also see how the French had, years earlier, been defeated in the same area. The battle was to be the first major engagement between US and NVA forces in Vietnam and showed the use of helicopters as mobility providers and assault support aircraft.Very gritty battle scenes. Captures well the chaos and confusion of battle, plus the desperation and terror involved when things aren't going well. Mostly accurate, by most accounts, though some minor liberties are taken for dramatic effect.The problem, however, lies with just about everything else. Dialogue is quite over-the-top, as if just about everybody is played by John Wayne. Many simple passages of dialogue are turned into speeches, and cliché-filled speeches at that.In keeping with the cheesy dialogue, some pretty heavy-handed, overly gung ho scenes too. Once again, reminded me of a John Wayne movie.Overall, quite entertaining, just uneven because of the mix of gritty battle scenes and cheesy dialogue and other scenes.",We Were Soldiers
15,Boba_Fett1138,Has all the standard clichés in it but still is a movie worth watching.,6,16 December 2005,"""We Were Soldiers"" is a nicely made movie but isn't exactly memorable, original or impressive enough to leave a lasting impression.There are several problems I had with this movie. Perhaps the biggest problem was that it wasn't easy to follow. It was hard to tell who was where at the moment fighting. Basically all we ever get to see are the Americans and the NVA shooting at each other through bushes and running towards each other. The movie lacks a sense of scale and because of that the movie also doesn't ever really become realistic. It's interesting that they also show the NVA side of the battle, something that's a very rare thing in a Vietnam-war movie but it's all done in a very shallow and formulaic way.Which brings me to another problem I had with this movie. It's all too formulaic and not original enough. The characters are build up in a sappy way and they lack substance and aren't likable or interesting enough. And having dying soldiers saying 'tell my wife I love her' has got to be one of the biggest movie clichés in movie history. There were really some scene's that made me cringe such as the scene in which a dying soldier says 'I'm glad I could die for my country'. I know it is wrong but I actually laughed and I mean really laughed during that scene. It was so embarrassing and totally unrealistic to look at. It took away all of the emotions and sense of desperateness and danger. It was a very over-dramatized and because of that also not a believable enough movie, to follow. They over-dramatized it even more to add the wives of the soldiers to the storyline. For me those sequences didn't worked and were only distracting and felt unnecessary.The movie is good looking and the battle sequences are nicely set up but it never becomes really tense or spectacular. Because of that ""We Were Soldiers"" is a good looking movie that is worth watching just maybe once but at the same time is also very forgettable movie that lacks real substance.The excellent musical score by Nick Glennie-Smith is wonderful though and is to be honest the only reason why I ever wanted to see this movie.There are better and more realistic Vietnam war movies to watch out there instead. Randall Wallace has created a sappy, over-the-top dramatic movie that doesn't make an awfully large impression.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",We Were Soldiers
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Few shortcomings,7,10 June 2008,"I was positively surprised by this. While not always pleasant, this is well-done throughout, and great for almost the entire duration. The plot is really good, and never gets boring. The pacing is solid. The acting is invariably powerful. The characters, if not as interesting or engaging as they could be, are well-written. An awful lot of the way, this is credible. The action is well-done. The FX are incredible. The editing and cinematography are excellent, no exceptions. The use of slow-motion is effective in each case. There are some beautifully cut sequences herein. There is considerable violence, gore and disturbing content. This is evidently very authentic, but it does seem to give up trying for that near the end, and adds to the list of Hollywood moments, otherwise so short that it could almost be completely ignored, and introduces a deus ex machina(for those unaware, that's when you discover that you've written yourself into a corner, and decides to just throw in something that had not been built towards and which isn't necessarily even a little likely or plausible) of about the same level as Saving Private Ryan... the difference being that I felt I got more out of watching that than this, and what it all comes down to is that I doubt I'll miss owning this, as it only aired on TV, as opposed to aforementioned title, which I'm glad to be able to borrow from my father. It should be noted that this does show the Viet Cong without particularly demonizing or dehumanizing them. It is, however, clear who the film-makers were intending to support and honor. I recommend this to fans of war movies, and/or of the people involved(Randall Wallace ought to direct more often). 7/10",We Were Soldiers
17,view_and_review,A Vietnam Movie That Wasn't Needed,2,7 October 2021,"I've always said that the best Vietnam movies were made in the 80's and this crud helped prove my point. This was some ra-ra soldier superhero crap to put a better spin on the Vietnam War. Our heroes of note were Mel Gibson with gross overacting to play an American soldier, and Sam Elliott who was so tough that even death was afraid of him. These two bigger than life characters stood tall when everyone else ducked as though the bullets were too afraid to touch them. They stomped around the battlefield like maestros of an orchestra and they were duly rewarded for it. Mel Gibson got plenty of slo-mo hero shots while Sam Elliott called General Custer a p***y because it made him sound tough.""We Were Soldiers"" is a pointless piece devoid of any depth that wants us to believe that a few heavily outmanned and out-armed soldiers with the help of God and timely airstrikes were able to overrun the enemy. It was a whirlwind of action with everything happening almost instantaneously: charges into battle, airstrikes, even the official death notices came next day. All the slow-motion, heroic music, and explosives did nothing to help this movie. In the end this was a weak ode to the fallen soldiers of Vietnam.",We Were Soldiers
18,phd_travel,Old fashioned and modern at the same time,10,15 January 2014,"This very good Vietnam war movie about the first major conflict between North Vietnamese and U.S. troops is old fashioned in some ways and modern in some ways. It turns out to have the best aspects of being both old fashioned and modern.It's old fashioned in it's patriotic heroism of the characters and that the soldiers are too good looking. Chris Klein plays a brave hero, Greg Kinnear a brave helicopter pilot and of course Mel Gibson is the religious and dedicated Colonel in charge. Watching this movie in 2014 again it's quite amusing to see Jon Hamm and Taylor Momsen in a supporting roles. There is no political agenda here about being in a wrong war etc. It's about the heroism of the soldiers not whether they were on the right side or not.It's modern in the realism of the well choreographed battle scenes and graphic injuries. But it's not as gross as Saving Private Ryan. Also it's sympathetic and unbiased towards both sides Vietnamese and U.S. It actually is quite a clear depiction of the overall battle instead of a confusing mess that some war movies are. There is a good setup of characters prior to the battle and you can clearly see who lives and dies.There are some faults. The filming location & vegetation didn't look like Vietnam at all. Couldn't they have planted some more suitable trees here and there? Poor Madeline Stowe as the dutiful military wife, probably the most beautiful actress of her generation did something to her lips that made her look strange for a few movies. Thank goodness the cosmetic procedures have settled down since. And what is wrong with that crazy long hair? It's a good solid war movie that's moving without being preachy and exciting without being too violent.",We Were Soldiers
19,Aaron1375,Great emotional Vietnam film starring Mel Gibson.,8,25 April 2010,"I saw this film at the theater and it was a totally engrossing film. My dad, who served in the Vietnam War also enjoyed it as it was not a film that made the United States troops look horrible, while this one puts them in a more positive light. Though I would also say that ""Full Metal Jacket"" was a rather good movie about the Vietnam War as well. This one chronicles one battle during the conflict. I think it was like one of the first involving the Vietnamese and the U.S. military and it is a very good conflict on screen as it really keeps you on edge. You also get good performances from Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot and even Greg Kinnear. The film is very emotional as you get shots of the wife of Mel Gibson's character delivering letters to wives whose husbands are killed in battle in Vietnam. There is a little humor in the film, but much after the conflict starts which is understandable as Sam Elliot has a couple of good lines before shipping out. Like I said the battle itself is very edge of your sit type stuff, you have your drama and you have some very graphic kills as the one involving the napalm was particularly nasty. The movie shifts focus from time to time though so you are not sure at times how much time has passed in certain scenes, they also seem to ignore the fact that the M-16 rifle was not exactly a great weapon in its day, instead making it nearly flawless. Which it was when kept clean, however as my dad said if it got dirty it did not fire. Overall, though this movie was a good emotional film that deserved a bit more recognition in 2002 as I think it did not get any awards at all.",We Were Soldiers
20,Wuchakk,Square-jawed officers who weep at carnage and fresh-faced GIs who die too young,6,7 January 2016,"Released in 2002, ""We Were Soldiers"" stars Mel Gibson as Col. Hal Moore who leads the first major battle between Americans and the North Vietnamese Army in The Battle of Ia Drang Valley over four days in mid-November, 1965. Sam Elliott costars as the seasoned NCO and Barry Pepper as a bold photographer while Madeleine Stowe appears as the Colonel's wife. Greg Kinnear is also on hand as a helicopter pilot while Keri Russell plays a soldier's wife.The movie is based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once and Young"" by Col. Moore and the aforementioned photographer, Joe Galloway. As such, ""We Were Soldiers"" is a straight-forward realistic depiction of the battle and the first film depiction where Moore claimed ""Hollywood finally got it right."" This reminds me of something someone I know who fought in Nam said: All the other films about the war from the late 70s to late 80s didn't strike him as the way it really was, but after seeing ""We Were Soldiers"" he said, ""That's the way it was."" Be that as it may, it doesn't make it as good as 1986' ""Platoon"" or 1979's ""Apocalypse Now."" The former is so great because the platoon in the story is a microcosm of many platoons and their experiences throughout the war, which might come across as ""too much"" because the filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame. Incredibly, ""Platoon"" fleshes-out no less than a dozen memorable characters with its grunt's-eye view of the conflict while telling a compelling story. By contrast, ""We Were Soldiers"" only presents about four memorable characters during the battle and, while it's a solid war flick, it simply isn't as compelling.As for ""Apocalypse Now,"" it's useless to compare the two because (1.) the original version of ""Apocalypse Now"" (as opposed to the horribly flawed ""Redux"") is a downright cinematic masterpiece; (2.) it's way more than just a war movie; and (3.) its theme is deeper than the conventional and patriotic portrayal of the realistic ""We Were Soldiers."" If you're not familiar with the theme of ""Apocalypse Now,"" it's basically this: Capt. Willard (Sheen) comes face-to-face with two Colonels during his mission up the river to assassinate the rogue Col. Kurtz. Both of the colonel's names start with 'K,' which is no accident. Col. Kilgore (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war. Col. Kurtz (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's horror itself and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard.""We Were Soldiers"" instead opts for a simple portrayal of the first major battle of the infamous war and the bravery & horror thereof. The story essentially proposes the question: What would happen if you drop 400 American soldiers into a valley crawling with 4000 soldiers of the NVA? The fighting is presented realistically, brutally and relatively coherently given the chaos of the intense conflict. Col. Moore truly loves his men and Gibson carries the movie with the peripheral help of Elliot and Barry Pepper. On top of this, the movie gives quite a bit of time to North Vietnamese side of the story, which enhances the story.Some people have rolled their eyes at the Morro Bay locations of central coastal, California, but if you look at Galloway's real-life pics of the battle they chose a great stand-in for the grassy valley. I guess people don't realize that Vietnam isn't all conventionally tropical jungle.The film runs a little overlong at 2 hours and 18 minutes and was shot in Morro Bay, Pasadena and Fort Hunter Liggett, California; as well as Fort Benning and Columbus, Georgia.GRADE: B- (6.5/10 Stars)",We Were Soldiers
21,mm-39,Mel at his best,8,3 March 2002,I think you have to see the movie twice to fully appreciate it.  Mel Gibson at his best.  I was also impressed with Sam Elliot's role.  It was hard getting used to him without his moustache.  Mel put a lot of heart into this role.  I thought the troops would be more grittier.  It was nice to see the movie incorporate the lives of the soldiers.  It must of been real hard and very cruel for the wives to receive news of their husbands' deaths by taxi. I can see why Sam Elliot's character always thought of the worst.  This movie shows what good leadership is all about.  This is Mel's best performance to date.  A must see on the big screen.,We Were Soldiers
22,=G=,The harsh reality of Hollywood.,4,20 August 2002,"Many good films have been made about the American/Vietnamese conflict from the sensationalistic and unpretentious ""Apocalypse Now"" to many serious minded documentaries about the harsh reality of the war. ""We Were Soldiers"" is not one of them. A pretentious retelling of the first major American engagement with the Vietnamese on the battlefield (circa 1965), the film is one contrived, obvious, and fabricated scene after another from crying because you lived and your men  didn't (a success for a field commander) to coming home unannounced (yeah, right) to a feeble attempt to honor the Vietnamese warriors, etc. etc. etc. This flick is blatant commercialism under the guise of patriotism and a poor tribute to the fighting men and women who sacrificed during the Vietnam conflict. The only thing sadder than the mentality behind ""We Were Soldiers"" is the mentality that supported it at the box office and in critical reviews. (C-)",We Were Soldiers
23,disdressed12,We Were Soldiers,8,16 April 2011,"this film focusing on one particular battle of The Vietnam War was really well done.it really puts you right in the middle of the action,and shows you just how hellish war really is.it paints the soldiers as real human beings,with feelings and emotions,not as gung-ho trigger happy psychos.there's no bravado here,no over the top flag waving patriotism.the movie shows a bit of The North Vietnamese perspective too.i liked the music.it's very somber and fitting.the acting was excellent by all.i thought the ending was very good,as well.all in,this is a very good war film that never really got the recognition It deserved.for me,We Were Soldiers is an 8/10",We Were Soldiers
24,sddavis63,The Human Side Of This Is What Makes It Work So Well,8,24 November 2011,"The depiction this film offers of the Battle of La Drang (the first major battle fought by the United States in Vietnam) is brilliant. It's so well re-enacted and so graphic that it truly does give the viewer a taste (but only a taste) of the insanity and sheer violence of war. It's a taste. I was comfortably sitting in my living room watching this. I don't claim to have been able to fully (or even remotely) understand what the soldiers in the midst of the battle were feeling. But it is a taste. Well done, and very sobering. It has to be one of the best battle re-enactments I've ever seen in a movie. As well done as it was, though, it wasn't the depiction of the battle that made this work. One gets desensitized after a while. The sheer scale of the carnage being depicted is overwhelming and from time to time my mind just left the screen as if I needed a break from it. So if this had been all about the battle it wouldn't have been nearly as effective as it was. What made this work was the very effective interweaving of so many very human elements to the story above and beyond just the depiction of the battle. These were, indeed, soldiers, but they were more than soldiers. They were real people, with wives and children and friends back home. Real people with lives that went far beyond what they did on the battlefield. Real people that we cared about because we learned of their lives and of how much reason they had to live and of how tragic it was that so many of them died.The human elements of the story were shown in many ways. Although sometimes long introductions to a story bother me, I appreciated the somewhat lengthy introduction to this movie. After a brief look at the French experience in Vietnam, the movie shifts to a U.S. Army base where a new division is being put together to go to Vietnam and engage the enemy. We see the unit being formed. We meet the men - more importantly, we meet their families. It was a great way of drawing us into their stories; of reminding us that these were real life flesh and blood men, and not just destined to be battlefield casualty statistics. Later, after deployment and as the battle heats up, we're drawn into the anguish of the families as telegrams are delivered, telling wives that their husbands had been killed - telegrams originally delivered by taxi cab drivers because the Army wasn't ready with chaplains, until the wife of the commanding officer takes over the job of going door to door to break the news. I was impressed by the depiction of the North Vietnamese. They weren't depicted as evil; they weren't caricatured. They were the enemy - but only because this was war. They were soldiers, too - with people who loved them; a point brilliantly made by the use of one Vietnamese soldiers' notebook (eventually picked up by the Americans) that contained a picture of his sweetheart. And, in the end, the movie is clearly shown to be not about war, but about the relationship between the men, as we see Col. Moore's anguish at the loss of so many soldiers and his relief at returning home, and as the point is made that these men didn't fight so much for their country - they fought more for each other.Mel Gibson I thought pulled off the role of Col. Moore quite well: fiercely devoted to his men, and as commander of the 7th Cavalry determined to avoid the fate that had befallen the commander and troops of a previous 7th Cavalry - Custer at the Little Big Horn. That was an interesting connection that was made several times in the movie. This is a very good war movie, made even better by the fact that it's about more than war - it's about the people who fought and lived and died together, and about the people back home who loved them.

25,thesar-2,This is perfect to recruit new soldiers!,3,3 September 2009,"Strange, I had a weird feeling during 'We Were Soldiers.' I thought of aliens. No, I don't believe in extra terrestrials, but I had such an unusual feeling that if aliens were watching us when the attacks happened in this movie or in real life, what were they thinking? Oh, yeah – ""IDIOTS."" How on Earth can such sophisticated beings plan on continuing when they can't seem to get any conflict resolved? I honestly don't want to sound un-American or un-Patriotic, but what a bunch of losers the human kind can be? For the first part of 'Soldiers' we are given the normal/boring/typical vision of 1960's United States before it sent young men into a never-ending conflict bend on making money for the rich. Then we plunge into a fierce battle of unprepared Americans for the remainder of the movie. Very graphic, I might add. So it does add a lot of the realism to WAR – or ""conflict."" Unfortunately, it barely attempts an ""unbiased"" view of both sides fighting (notice a lot of sympathy on the American side, and somewhat, or little on the Vietnam side.) OK, I admit, I'm thoroughly ignorant on the whole war, especially this one battle, but someone had to get rich. Maybe more than one person. Again, let's focus on the outside influence that might be watching – perhaps, aliens – and see what they think of higher ups that plan on getting rich off of human beings being inhumanely slaughtered. Perhaps, I am bitter, anti-war, but seriously look at this enormously realistic view of a battle and tell me that it was all worth killing living, human beings foroh I'm sorry, what again were they trying to accomplish and failed? Side note: as much as I'm a Gibson/Elliott fan, they seemed very bulletproof whenever they stood up. Hmmmm.Overall it wasn't a terrible movie, (in fact, the fight scenes were thoroughly realistic) but it's so depressing on how STUPID people are. Seriously, you're a general, or top-ranking military person, or President (and wife) and you have absolutely no problem telling someone to go and kill someone of the same species (and die trying) because it will make money for some fool in the long run? I have the deepest respect for those who put their lives on the line for normal civilians, but condemn the leaders who put them in that position. This movie made me think I was at Woodstock protesting (before my time): ""Make Love Not War.""Question: Am I supposed to praise this General played by Gibson? Am I supposed to think, well, he did his ""civic"" duty and lead these men to the death because he was not supposed to question a higher rank?They finish the movie with the typical journey down the Vietnam wall memorial. Honestly, I don't see them as fools. I would suspect a great majority, if not 99.9%, were drafted by the same people who wanted more money – hmm, doesn't it always come down to money? I truly honor their lives as they're the innocents. It's simply unbearable how those who planned on profit for people's souls could still sleep at night.",We Were Soldiers
26,sol-kay,Dead or Alive we'll all come home together,8,30 May 2013,"***SPOILERS*** It's November 1965 and the US military's new formed 7th Calvary, the same unit commanded by Gen. George Custer at the Little Big Horn in 1876, is about to get its baptism in blood & fire in the Central Highland's La Drange Valley of Souh Vietnam. It's there where a division of battle hardened North Vietnamese regular troops reinforced by squads of Viet-Cong guerrillas are to meet them in what was to become the bloodiest US Military engagement since the end of he Korean War.Ferried into combat by helicopter gunships the 7th Calvary finds itself pinned down by murderous enemy fire as soon as its troops dis-bark from their aircraft. It up to US Army Let. Col Hal Moore, Mel Gibson, to not only complete his mission of wiping out all enemy resistance in the Central Highlands but bring his men, dead alive and injured, back to base at all cost. But the North Vietnamese troops and their Viet-Cong allies have other things in store for them. Which is to wipe out to the last man the entire 7th Calvary like they, as Viet Minh guerrillas, did to a unit of French Foreign Legionnaires 11 years ago in 1954.Non-stop action as US Calvary units slug it out with the communist forces who are determined to end the US involvement in Vietnam almost as soon as it starts. Having trained for their mission at Ft. Benning Georgia the 7th Calvary were ready for action in the highlands and jungles of South Vietnam but what they found in the fanatical and suicidal attacks by the communist troops were far more bloody and intense then what they ever expected. In the four days, November 14-18 1965, of combat the US suffered almost 300 killed and 500 wounded with the 7th Calvary taking the brunt of the losses. It was on the last day of fighting with the 7th Calvary down to it's last man and bullet that the US Army and air force finally came to its rescue. In them opening up a massive artillery and air bombardment that finally dislodged and had turn tail the attacking North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong forces.A quite and reserved, or strong and silent type, Mel Gibson was never better then in the role of Let. Col. Hal Moore who together with his top kick or sergeant major Basil Pulmley, Sam Elliott, kept their men from panicking by them being right out there, in the thick of the fighting, with them on the front lines and leading by example. Among those US soldiers who in the end didn't make it back was 2nd Let. Jack Geoghegan, Chris Kline, who despite being deeply religious and not wanting to take lives ended up losing his own in trying to save a fellow 7th Calvary men who was badly wounded. There's also 5th generation US soldier reporter and photographer for Stars & Stripes Joe Gallaway, Barry Pepper, who's willing if necessary to lose his life by him being a conscientious objector but not taking someone else's even an enemy soldier who's out to kill him. It's Gallaway who ends up getting the story of his career coupled with dozens of photos of the fighting to be dispatched and showed to those of us back home that the war in Vietnam wasn't the cakewalk that we were lead, by our leaders in the White House Congress and the Pentagon, to believe that it was. The Vietnam War went on for some ten years and costing 58,000 US servicemen and women lives by the time it finally ended. And sadly enough it ended with the North Vitnamese and Viet-Cong on the winning side!P.S The saddest and most touching scenes in the movie has nothing to do with it's combat sequences but the scenes with the wives of those who fell in the fighting. It was them who were to get a knock on the door and told by official letter the heart breaking and tearful news from the Secretary of the Army"": I'm Sorry to Inform You"".",We Were Soldiers

Black Hawk Down is a great war movie but that does not live up to this or Saving Private Ryan. This movie like Platoon did showed the atrocities of the Vietnam War and showed them well.This film is about the 7th Calvary stuck in ""the Death Valley"" with thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers surrounding them and their struggle to get out of harm's way.The acting is what blew me away about the film. Mel Gibson gives his strongest performance since Braveheart. Barry Pepper as the photojournalist gave me a few tears with his realistic portrayal.Overall, this is a true war film with a heart.

30,tabuno,"A Somber, Walloping War Drama",9,15 January 2019,"1 November 2014. Some people might refer to Saving Private Ryan (1998) as one the great classic war films, especially its extended opening scene of the landing on Normandy Beach on D-Day. Others might refer to Black Hawk Down (2001) for its extended failed military mission in Somalia as one of the most gripping battle action films. Still others would cite Apocalypse Now (1979) as the most intense, personal, surrealistic war movie. Other films that people would laud loudly about would include The Hurt Locker (2008)or Dr. Strangelove (1964) for their cynical look at war, Jarhead (2005) for its immersive, ambient experience of long moments of war.We Were Soldiers, however, is an unabashed look at the terror and fearsome pain and emotional ripping apart of familial bonds and the heat and sorrow and fear and honor and courage of the individual and team effort of battle. Regardless of how might believe, feel of President Obama's reluctance to continue American commitment to Iraq or Afghanistan, even Syria, this movie is a must see before one should reflect on the realities of war and its impact. Perhaps the closest this movie might come or a movie to compare We Were Soldiers to might be the epic Civil War movie Gettysberg (1993). We Were Soldiers is presented in a non-glorified way with an inclusionary experience of the wives of many of the soldiers as well. We see glimpses of the Vietnamese soldier themselves.The only small weaknesses of this movie might be its imbalance of primarily focusing on the American military experience with a significant but still token view of the emotive backdrop of the Vietnamese and one scene where there is an attempt to local lost American soldiers on the field of battle that doesn't seem quite realistic and perhaps even fool-hearty as well as omission of some of the more graphic hand to hand combat images while at the same time including the bloody bullets ripping through bodies themselves. But none of these weaknesses detract from the overall greatest of this movie.In sum We Were Soldiers seems to reflect some of the best, if not the best directorial, scripted, and filmed movie about the awfulness of war in a human and compassionate but somber way.",We Were Soldiers
31,slightlymad22,One Of My Favourite Mel Gibson Performances,8,4 February 2015,"We Were Soldiers (2002)Plot In A Paragraph: Focusing on the Battle of Ia Drang on November 14, 1965. It is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once And Young by Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway, both of whom were at the battle.This is quite simply one of my favourite war movies, Gibson's performance is the core of the movie, and is one of his best performances. I love his reaction to a certain characters death, almost no words except ""He died keeping my promise"" and pure raw emotion. Chris Klein gives the performance of his career, Sam Elliot is his usual brilliant self, uttering fine great dialogue, whilst Madeline Stowe, Greg Kinnear Barry Pepper and Kerri Russell all of stellar support. There are some strong female performances featured here, not commonly found in a war movie!! This is brilliantly shot, directed and scored. It does have a few cliché moments, but it's hard to criticise a movie for something so little, when it gets so much right. For some reason, audiences didn't flock to this one, it only grossed $78 million at the domestic box office, to end 2002 as the 34th highest grossing movie of the year. Which for a Gibson led movie, was pretty low for the time. Gibson is truly a great actor, and hopefully he can sort his personal problems and demons out, because as we all know Hollywood loves comebacks.",We Were Soldiers
32,tomgillespie2002,"Intense and well-staged, but nothing we haven't seen before",6,22 November 2017,"After Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan reinvented the way the brutality and chaos of war was depicted on the cinema screen back in 1998, Hollywood went slightly nuts for all things World War II. At one point, it felt as though we were getting one every other week, and fatigue naturally kicked in, especially since none measured up to Spielberg's visual masterpiece (if very flawed film), other than Terrence Malick's superior The Thin Red Line released the same year. By 2002, attention was moving towards the Vietnam conflict, an unjust and borderline psychotic war that resulting in heavy losses on all sides. It was a favourite topic for many filmmakers in the 1980's, and produced a few greats, but interest seemed to wane as we moved into the 90's. In 2002, We Were Soldiers was supposed to rekindle our fascination with Vietnam, but has since faded into a long list of half-forgotten war movies.Based on the book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young by Hal Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, Randall Wallace's film attempts to cover the Battle of Ia Drang from three perspectives: the 400 American men fighting at the front, the 4,000 Vietnamese troops they're up against, and the wives at home fearing the arrival of a taxi cab bringing them unwanted news. The bulk of the action follows Moore (Mel Gibson), then a lieutenant colonel, through training his troops and eventually onto the front line, where intelligence is so sparse that they have no idea what they are up against. It turns out that the Americans are greatly outnumbered, and so begins one of the bloodiest battles of the entire war. He is later joined by reporter Galloway (Barry Pepper), who captured much of the conflict on camera as well as picking up a rifle himself. At home, Moore's wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) intercepts all the letters informing the devastated wives of their loss to hand-deliver them herself.We Were Soldiers feels like more of a complete overview on the battle thanks to this unique perspective, while the action is some of the toughest and most unflinching in the genre. Perhaps down to its more observational approach - apparently the events take place almost exactly how it played out in real life - the film often gets criticised and labelled as a pro-war movie. I don't feel that what we see is glamorising or promoting war in any way. On the contrary, it refuses to really to take a stand, and this is what makes Wallace's movie far less interesting than it should be. It all boils down to 'war is Hell', but most people know this already whether they have experienced combat or not. The battle scenes are intense, horrifying and well-staged, and demand to be admired from a technical point of view. But it's nothing we haven't seen before. Despite Chris Klein's failure to really convince as a human, We Were Soldiers features many impressive performances, most notably by Sam Elliott as Sgt. Major Plumley, a gruff Sam Elliott-type who mows down his enemies with a revolver while the rest of his men pack automatics, and Gibson himself, who helps tug on the heartstrings during quiet moments of reflection.",We Were Soldiers
33,Movie Nuttball,Check it out just for Mel`s speech because its wonderful!!,10,25 October 2002,"We Were Soldiers is a great Vietnam movie and is arguably the best. Mel Gibson played a great and historic role in my opinion. The speech by Gibson was, in my opinion the greatest speech I have ever witnessed in a film. Though Mel`s character was focused on very much through out the film I feel when Barry Pepper finally showed up in the picture it then focused him a lot more than Gibson.To Me when Pepper finally arrived on the scene it seemed like it was Pepper`s movie and not Mel`s but that`s just Me. Sam Elliott was great and I feel he should play more roles like and was it just Me or did he resemble R. Lee Ermey in the film? Greg Kinnear was good for the role. I liked the film and I think most war movie fans will aswell but it has a lot of action and emotional moments but it didn`t have  a lot of ""war gore"" in it like most of the other epic war films such as Windtalkers and Saving Private Ryan so that may disappoint some but the film has good acting and such. In My opinion I think Mel Gibson performed better in signs but his speech in this film was terrific and I recommend Gibson fans to check this film out just because of his speech because its that wonderful!",We Were Soldiers
34,zkonedog,"The ""Saving Private Ryan"" of Vietnam",9,11 March 2017,"When Steven Spielberg released Saving Private Ryan in 1998, it set the new standard for epic war films. We Were Soldiers uses some of those same effects/devices to tell a compelling Vietnam War story.For a basic plot summary, We Were Soldiers tells the story of one of the first Vietnam battles. It follows the First Battalion, 7th Cavalry division through their training, deployment, and improbably ""victory"" (depending on your perspective) in that seminal battle.Strangely, this film doesn't stand out much on its own accord (it doesn't do anything all that original). However, it does enough things right to make for a very enjoyable, emotional experience.Mel Gibson shines as the lead actor, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, whose primary goal is to bring ""his boys"" back to the mainland alive. In fact, this is one of the best roles I've ever seen Gibson in, far better than the action-hero roles he often fancies himself in. The other members of the battalion are also well-cast and peppered with great actors.However, this film is at its best when it tugs at your heartstrings, which it does frequently. Whether it is the physical toughness of the soldiers in the field, or the mental grit of their wives/families back home, this movie really ""gets"" the emotions of that time period. Plus, it really does a good job of foreshadowing the rest of the drawn-out conflict.Thus, whereas First Blood is best in my book at examining the mental torments of 'Nam, We Were Soldiers touches on those same emotions but also adds the epic battle scenes.",We Were Soldiers
35,filipemanuelneto,The human side of war,8,21 February 2017,"This film shows us the first great battle that Americans suffered during the Vietnam War. Its difficult for me to assess how fair the film is in the picture of the battle, which I don't know very well, but I can say that I have not seen many problems with historical rigor. The film emphasizes the deficient American preparation for that type of war and the way that specific location was underestimated. It's a war movie and it has, of course, a lot of action but, despite some appeals to patriotism, it's not fanatical about it as some other films are (""Black Hawk Down"", for example). This moderation was something I appreciated, as well as the focus on the human drama of the soldiers and how they had to solve that difficult situation. The result is a war film that does not stray from the feelings, embracing its humanity even though it may displease those who went to the theater expecting to see another ""Rambo"". Mel Gibson is the main actor and fills his character with courage, heroism, faith and dignity. He is a good actor and is on a family record, not being the first war film in which he participates. The rest of the cast doesn't stand out much but fulfills our expectations and does what it has to do. The film uses sound and special effects very well, realistically portraying the soldiers' action on the ground. The scenarios contribute to this realism and have been very well reproduced.",We Were Soldiers

They always have to show the huggy body/kissy face family crap before the bloodletting. To me, ""Platoon"" was a more realistic Viet Nam film, but I must say the carnage was more graphic in WWS. Elliot was tough and amusing as the grizzled top kick, but Gibson came off as a tad wimpy for a gung-ho combat officer. His tears just after the big battle were a trifle trumped up looking. I liked the unbloodied Air Corp guys as they jumped over the parapets yelling ""Air Corp!"" only to be blown away. Amazing what you can get people to do in the name of democracy and the flag. This was a real gorefest, but let's face it: it's been done and done to death. One never sees the spraying multi-jets of blood coming out a human's back on the History Channel.",We Were Soldiers
39,Vartiainen,Intense battlefield re-enactment,7,1 February 2021,"A Randall Wallace film, starring Mel Gibson. Its plot focuses on Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Gibson) and his battalion of soldiers, who were chosen to be trained as air cavalry in the Vietnam War, using helicopters to land troopers right in the midst of combat. The film focuses on their training and their first major battle.What the film gets right is its realism. The book the film is based upon, We Were Soldiers Once... And Young by Hal Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, set out to set the record straight in terms of what happened in Vietnam. And I do believe that this film reflects that. Its battle scenes are a chaotic mess, yet there's enough storytelling magic happening that you can follow what's happening even through the silver screen. I also like the fact that the Vietnamese soldiers are given a few scenes without demonizing them in any way.That being said, the battle scenes are a chaotic mess. That's very much the point, but they're also so long that you quickly become exhausted. The film tries to give you some breathing room by occasionally focusing on the wives of the soldiers back home, but those scenes are so depressing and oppressive that they merely enhance the exhaustion you're already experiencing.Then again, it's war movie. A realistic war movie. Its point is not to make you feel good. There are war movies that will leave you feeling good and pumped. This is not one of them. It was never meant to be one of them. Its point is to drive in the fact that in a war people will die for absolutely arbitrary reasons. They will die because someone far above them decided that they should.A good film. A borderline great film. But not a nice one.",We Were Soldiers
40,bsmith5552,"""They Finally Got it Right!""",9,22 August 2002,"""We Were Soldiers"" is based on a real life battle of the Viet Nam war that took place in 1965 in a remote part of Viet Nam. It is based on a book by Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway who are portrayed in the film by Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper respectively. The film opens with a depiction of the 1954 slaughter of French troops by the Vietnamese army. Twenty one years later Lt. Col Moore (Gibson) and his battalion of 395 men are thrust unknowingly into the same hornet's nest consisting of some 4,000 battle hardened Viet Nam regulars who have been fighting their enemies for many years.  Director Randall Wallace tells the story from three perspectives. Firstly from the viewpoint of the Americans. Outnumbered ten to one they face impossible odds. How Col. Moore rallies his troops and gets them to pull together as a team is a central theme of the picture. Secondly, the story is told from the viewpoint of the wives and families left behind and the problems they have to deal with. Lastly, the Vietnamese army is shown not as unfeeling monsters, but as a professional army defending their beliefs and territory. The battle scenes are as realistic and convincing as any war movie that you will ever see. We suffer through the casualties both on the battlefield and at home along with the participants. The special effects are seamless and exciting. Mel Gibson gives a convincing performance as Moore and if you watch the DVD, you can see the amazing similarities between the two men. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore and Keri Russell plays Barbara Geoghegan two of the wives who take on the unenviable task of delivering those dreaded telegrams to the widows from the War Department. Chris Klein plays Russell's husband Jack a new officer and father. His scene with Gibson in the base chapel is memorable. Greg Kinnear plays Captain Crandall the head of Moore's helicopter fleet. Don Duong is very effective as the Vietnamese commander. But acting cudos go to veteran Sam Elliot as the crusty Sgt. Major Plumley. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a gripping Viet Nam war drama told in a way that reflects ALL of the participants in an impartially realistic way. As Hank Moore says on the DVD, They finally got it right.",We Were Soldiers
41,thinker1691,""" If you are heartless and without Compassion, this story will mean little to You """,10,6 July 2010,"The Viet-Nam War was not about one man, nor of the 58,000 we lost or even the Million America killed, it was more. The movie is called "" We Were Soldiers "" and it depicts the true story as recalled by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and Joseph L. Galloway. The Viet-Nam conflicted had already been waging between the French Government and the Vietnamese people, before it became a U.S. problem. In 1965, in a place called 'The Valley of Death' a company of French soldiers were ambushed and massacred in that valley. In that same year, Lt. Col.Hal Moore, Sgt.Maj.Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott) and Maj.Crandall (Greg Kinnear) and his men are given the task of going to Viet-Nam and assessing the military capacity, veracity and fortitude of the Viet-Cong soldier. Despite being a Veteran combat soldier, Moore and his skilled Air Calvary arrive in Landing Zone Ray and are immediately engaged by a highly seasoned and well disciplined armed force. For the next three days, Moore and his men are attacked, surrounded and nearly wiped out by veteran commander Lt. Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don) who proves an intelligent and worthy opponent for the American Commander. Barry Pepper plays Joe Galloway a courageous Photographer who captures the dark, dramatic action and all it's savage brutality on film. This film is a solid well-acted and beautifully choreographed action film which displays both sides of the battle with gut-wrenching reality. Be prepared for War at it's most horrendous. The heart of this movie is the fact the director includes not only the war-zone at it's most bestial, but the heart-ripping sorrow of the Women who loved one's are being butchered while they receive a telegram informing them of their loss. This is not a film for the faint heart, but for anyone who's brave enough for a Real movie of the Viet-Nam War. *****",We Were Soldiers

The strenghts of the film were it's focus on the preparation before deployment and focus on battle tactics as commanders react to events on the field with Hal Moore (Gibson) and the North Vietnamese commander (Don Duong) playing a deadly game of chess. It's great for history and military nerds. Unlike Braveheart Wallace did try to be more balance with the Vietnamese soldiers being protrayed as men fighting for their country or have families back home. It was also a brutal depiction of war: Wallace and his team went to great effort to show how horrible warfare can be and the types of injuries soldiers can suffers.There were some problems. Except for Gibson, Sam Elliott, and Barry Pepper most of the American cast blended together when on the battlefield.

One of the few things Harold Wilson is remembered fondly for is his refusal to commit British troops to this war of attrition where,basically,over a period of ten years from the events depicted in ""We were soldiers"" America's political will to fight was ground down and 58,000 of their fighting men died,ultimately,for nothing.God knows the military flesh was willing but the political spirit was weak,so to speak.I have nothing but respect for the brave Americans who fought the war both on the ground and ,afterwards, back home,excoriated by many for being sent against their will to be cannon-fodder in a foreign country for a cause that many were - to put it mildly - doubtful about. As a Brit with no axe to grind -and well aware that,along with the Russians,the Americans saved our arses in WW2 - I watched this movie with an open mind.I wouldn't presume to argue with the Vietnam vets who found it an accurate account of events,they were there,I wasn't. As a movie,per se,judged purely on those terms,it is a mixture of the harrowing and the clichéd.Sam Elliot's redoubtable Sergeant Major echoes back to Nigel Green in ""Zulu"" and many another gruff but caring noncom in movieland.Presumably there were such guys in real life,certainly if I were a grunt I'd feel much better having one around.Mel Gibson's Col Moore certainly puts himself in harm's way for most of the duration, a charismatic leader and a man of courage.Clearly the message here is the Americans were not lions led by donkeys. The NVA is treated with more respect than usual,as befits an organisation that out-thought if not out-fought a Superpower. I found the ending where the NVA leader replaced the tattered American flag slightly strained my credibility but maybe it happened.As Jonathan Miller said in ""Beyond the Fringe""...""Funny thing,war"". There is very little fresh that Hollywood can concoct in the ""War Movie"" genre beyond increased technical advances in sound and special effects to increase its reality factor,but until you actually have to dodge the bullets the cinema is never going to produce an ""authentic"" film. War is hell,soldiers die horribly,it's noisy,terrifying and very,very dangerous.Sitting in our air-conditioned,popcorn-crunching safety we have absolutely no idea of what it's really like.

44,lukem-52760,A Masterpiece war movie but everyone should be talking about Barry Pepper's incredible performance!!!!,10,1 May 2021,"""We were soldiers"" is an emotional & raw piece of Vietnam drama with an excellent ensemble cast giving it dramatic weight & the one who glows the brightest is the ridiculously underrated but extremely talented BARRY PEPPER as real life photographer Joe Galloway!!!First off in this great cast we have Mel Gibson giving his greatest performance in my opinion as troubled family man & warrior Col. Hal Moore, a man who has seen his fair share of horror on the battlefield & Gibson is superb!!! Moore has the tough job of leaving his troops into danger as this is the beginning of America's involvement with the Vietnam war in the 1960's & there's a weighty atmosphere of fear & sadness that hangs over the movie & in Moores eyes.The cast is filled out with many known actors & faces with Sam Elliott & Greg Kinnear & Chris Klein & Desmond Harrington & on the wives side back at home we have Madaleine Stowe as Moore's worried wife & is fantastic in her role & a sweet Keri Russell & both have a horrible job of taking telegrams from the army to hand out to the wives & families of the killed soldiers & those scenes are heavy & very sad.The cast is truly fantastic but best of all during all this horror, chaos & sadness is the powerhouse performance from Barry Pepper (possibly the most underrated actor in Cinema history?) Who portrays Joe Galloway a photographer who is taking pictures of the horror the men see & sending them back home so the people can see what's going on & that it's not all heroic but savage & disturbing. Pepper is amazing as he completely captured the fear & sadness in his eyes that we see the battles unfold from, he is us the audience & we see the real horror of the war through his weary eyes!!! He even starts the film by telling the story from it's troubled start & it's truly Pepper's raw & emotional performance that stayed with me all through the movie & after it ended!!!! Joe Galloway was a real man & what happened did happen & he has the photos to prove it. Galloway gets put in some horrific situations that are the standout scenes of the movie like the napalm bomb sequence where wrong co-ordinates end with alot of their own soldiers getting burned alive & Galloway has to help an extremely wounded soldier whose flesh is literally sliding off of his legs & it's horrible to watch & Pepper delivers all that horror in his eyes!!! Pepper is Outstanding & should've gotten some sort of an award for his performance!!! Galloway is the most likeable character too & this part cemented Barry Pepper as one of my all time top 5 favourite actors!!!!We also see this messy war from both sides with the Vietnamese & their troubles & their losses too & that is really touching to be honest as the whole war was such a horrible mess. Too many casualties & deaths & for what????The music is extremely moving & builds that lump in you throat & the movie directed with grit & ferocious realism & i know when it comes to War films everyone always goes on about Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, yes it's good but too long & Depressing in my opinion but again BARRY PEPPER stole that show too as the talented sniper Private Jackson, but to me ""We Were Soldiers"" is the best war fim in my opinion.""We Were Soldiers"" is all based on truth, it's characters were real & the battles & sadness was all real & chaotic messiness of it all is captured here on film properly!!!Even the real vets said ""They Finally Got It Right""

46,drystyx,Well done battle film,7,11 January 2010,"I am not a Gibson fan. He often appears in contrived plots and trite themes, but he is one of the best actors of this age. Here, he gives a superior performance, which, of course, also means the other actors also gave superior performances, and the direction and editing was superb.The story is about a battle at the beginning of U.S. involvement in Viet Nam. The story is nonjudgmental, and goes out of its way to be neutral. It is obviously anti-war, and depicts higher ups in a poor light, but the poor light is justified by being accurate, and well depicted in a way we can understand.It is a different style of war film. It has elements of the old war film, in which we see some camaraderie among soldiers in an isolated situation, along with the families at home who wait for news, and it has elements of the new war film, in which we see some of the politics involved in decisions higher up.It is high in action, and not many dull moments. We begin with the introduction of characters, the training, and the family lives of the soldiers, then we get into high gear with combat, and the combat is brutal. One officer leads his men into an ill advised chase of an enemy scout to capture him (his men must've been wondering why they couldn't have been told to shoot the enemy in the leg to capture him) and get cut off.We really see most characters come and go, but the film does follow 5 Americans in battle pretty well, one of them who does leave this world. One of the five is a reporter who makes the film a little weaker. By any definition, he is a moron, going into the heat of battle with no adequate explanation, except for his inner feeling of superiority. Without this character, the film could've ranked a 10 instead of a 9. But if he was there, he was there.Well done war film that takes no sides.",We Were Soldiers

The plan is to fly in with helicopter, and eventually pull out by helicopter. However their landing zone is very close to an Vietnamese base camp and the battle is soon raging.Fortunately, I have no personal experience of being in battle, so I can only speculate. The movie is based on an actual battle and I gather that it is pretty accurate. Still, the story is told as a movie and has to be folded into this format. I guess this leads to some details and subplots (thankfully) has been omitted. Many other movies may try this way and one hand can get more dominant than the other, i.e. a dull documentary or a pure war-fiction with no reality anchor. To be sure, there are a lot of effects in WWS as well, but they never go overboard with them. The story and the characters are always in focus.By doing it this way, we get to both see an entertaining movie (for us who likes war action that is) but at the same time glimpse the horrors of battle. There were really disturbing images, for example some badly burned soldiers whose skin just fell of, that made my stomach turn. Thankfully they were rather few and apart with more ""normal"" blood spill and splatter in between. Also we get an glimpse of the horrors the soldiers-wives has to live through, uncertainty and grief, as the notifications of their dead husbands are delivered to the wives by a cab company. It is also good to note, even if we mostly see the American perspective, that the Viatnamese command and soldiers is portrayed as soldiers as well. They just happen to ""on the other side of the fence.""To conclude things, an entertaining docu-action with glimpses of a scary reality.8/10",We Were Soldiers
49,a_chinn,Mel Gibson takes his savage depiction of warfare to Vietnam,9,15 July 2018,"Mel Gibson did not direct this film, but his production company made the film and he served as producer, so his fingerprints are all over this film, once again bringing his savage depiction of war to the big screen in much the same way he did with ""Braveheart"" and ""Hacksaw Ridge."" Randall Wallace was the writer and director of the film and had previously worked with Gibson as screenwriter on ""Braveheart"" and is currently working with Gibson again on his new film ""The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection."" With ""We Were Soldiers,"" Wallace and Gibson tell the true story of Lt. Col. Hal Moore in the first major US engagement with the North Vietnamese Army at the Battle of Ia Drang. Some of the events and characters were compressed for dramatic purposes, but the film is largely true to the real-life battle. The film beings with a Gibson and family living on an army base putting together a new unit for a mission overseas, entering into the first conflict of the Vietnam War, just as French forces were pulling out. Much time in this first part of the film is spent establishing the characters, two standouts being a grim Sam Elliott as Gibson's second in command and Greg Kinnear as a brash Cavalry helicopter pilot nicknamed Snakeshit, showing the men with their families, and introducing the various character dynamics while on base, but once they hit the fields of battle in Vietnam, the film is an unrelentingly brutal battle that makes up a majority of the film. Wallace does a masterful job of filming the battle scenes, especially when it comes to clearly defining the action and geography of the battlefield, which is no small feat given the scope of this battle and the many fronts needing to be shown, both in the air and on ground. The slow motion battle scenes lack the elegance of a Sam Peckinpah film, but are more in line with the straightforward brutality of Samuel Fuller or Gibson's own depiction of war. The battle scenes here are not your typical war film depictions when it comes to now shying away from showing the horrors of war. Even compared to Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" this is an especially brutal war film that is best compared to Gibson's own ""Hacksaw Ridge."" As with Hacksaw, although the film does not shy away from a savage depiction of war, it's not at all an anti-war film and is instead a celebration of the US military and the men who serve. The film does not really go into the politics of the Vietnam war, which was probably for the best and would have undercut the film's celebration of these soldiers. After rewatching ""We Were Soldiers,"" and something I wonder about after watching most films directed by Gibson, is if it's more something about his own nature in wanting to show on-screen depiction of extreme violence. Even with his film about the Mayans, Gibson managed to steer the story into one that was wildly brutal and violent. Gibson may just be a disturbed individual, but he's a hell of a filmmaker. On the downside for this film, when it cuts away from the battlefield to the wives back home, it comes to a corny maudlin grinding halt. Gibson's wife in the film, Madeline Stowe, takes it upon herself to deliver the notification letters to the wives of men killed in action instead of the faceless military men delivering the grim news. This homefront story in itself, focusing on the impact of war on the families back home, would have been a worth story to tell in and of it's own, but this subplot is given short shrift and feels more just tacked on as some sort of way to illustrate the human impact of war, but it's not given enough time to be fully explored, especially when it's clear that the filmmakers were much more focused on the battle elements of the film. Overall, ""We Were Soldier"" is amongst the most powerful and frightening depictions of war ever committed to the screen, while at the same time celebrates and honors the military and the men who make up that fighting force, without any commentary on the war itself. Keri Russell, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, and John Hamm also appear in the film. INTERESTING FACT: One of the real-life officers who survived the battle was Lieutenant Rick Rescorla. He died in the 9/11 attacks, while employed as Head of Security for Morgan Stanley, while making sure all of the company's employees had gotten out of the World Trade Center, which they did, and is in keeping with the brothers in arms type of heroism depicted in ""We Were Soldiers.""",We Were Soldiers
50,Samiam3,A violent but well executed 'nam pic.,8,19 June 2017,"""I will be the first to set foot on the filed, and I will be the last to step off, and I will leave no man behind."" So declares Lt. Hal Moore played by Mel Gibson the day before he and his outfit set off across the Pacific for the front lines of Vietnam. Easily the highlight line of the movie, it would be easy enough to see this as the kind of cheesy bravado that romanticizes war heroes, but We Were Soldiers gets away with it by being everything but romantic. There are moments where the images of blood alone may be enough to summon misty eyes.The movie doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but it is a visually genuine and visceral depiction of battle and survival. The American invasion of Communist Vietnam is something that to this day, virtually nobody is proud of so. All the better it is that the film has no political bias or stance on the conflict. It even does something to the contrary. The Vietcong ""charlie"" are not bad guys, they are merely soldiers fighting for their homeland.The firefighting is quite exhausting but it is the individual moments in-between the bullets that lift We Were Soldiers out of the chaos. Director Randall Wallace adds a curious scoring touch laying ""Sgt. Mackenzie."" (a Scottish WWI ballad), over the first moments of the final assault.The irony is that this is a song about the will to die for country; not a compatible motif with 'nam,Regardless of its political correctness, the words end up being less important than the somber and haunting tone of the melody. Our characters are not fighting for country, they are fighting for each other, and to get home to their loved ones. Every now and then, Wallace cuts from the front lines back to America to focus on Moore's Wife and the wives of his comrades. Day to day they live in fear of receiving a certain letter from the government regarding their husbands. The impact of these scenes on the picture is rather minimal, but it serves to remind us of what is really at stake, while showcasing one of Madaline Stowe's better performances. She barely has to say a word, you can read the vulnerability in her eyes.True to his word, Hal Moore is the first to step off the field, and there is a good shot of his boot coming of the grass and into the chopper that will take him back to the home of the brave. The final sequences are heavy on unspoken melodrama, over emphasizing the loss of life. The film doesn't rely on our knowledge of the history to add to the tragedy. It is a story about brothers and comrades who fought together and died together.",We Were Soldiers
51,Spleen,"If you're watching this movie with someone, and his or her eyes start to mist over, edge away slowly",4,15 August 2002,"This is a Coca-Cola ad of a film.  It's about nothing, it affirms nothing, it denies nothing, it scarcely even hints at anything; the pointlessness of all the footage, considered as a whole, is as mystifying as the footage of a skydiver jumping out of a plane on a surfboard and then drinking Coca-Cola when he lands.  Yet one is somehow left with the distinct impression that an attempt has been made to persuade one of something.  Meaningless Coca-Cola ads are obviously - don't ask me what makes them so, or why it's obvious - ""for"" rather than against Coca-Cola; this apparently pointless film is clearly ""for"" rather than against the American armed forces.  Perhaps it's the air of leaden reverence.  Perhaps it's the rat-a-tat-a-tat drums.  Don't ask me what it is, and don't try to deny it, either.Here's what happens.  It's 1965.  The American forces land, are pointed towards a segment of the Vietnamese army and ordered to destroy it - i.e., kill as many of the people in it as possible.  The Vietnamese army seems (we're never told in detail) to have exactly the opposite goal: to avoid being killed, and to kill as many of the invaders as possible.  That's it. That's ALL the context we're given.  It's like watching the world's largest game of Skirmish, but without any rules.  To be sure, soldiers on both sides appear to be meeting with some success: a great many people die; the Vietnamese whose country is being invaded, cleanly and off-screen and with a minimum of fuss; the US soldiers, in all manner of creatively gory ways (the makeup and special effects artists seem to have had the time of their lives, finding new ways to show people dying).  By the end of the battle we've seen so much War Movie Stuff - trite platitudes, bone-headed ""inspirational"" speeches, gore, bullets, bombs, mawkish death scenes, Goddammits - that we could easily fail to notice that we're never told what happened overall, let alone why.Before and after and in between all this senseless battle we see women on the home front; in one memorably bad scene, everyone sits around in a big circle looking uncomfortable, as though nobody can remember which actress is supposed to be playing which character, and acutely aware that it doesn't matter.  These women have little to do with the rest of the movie.  They're there as if because of ""equal time"" legislation.  The same could be said of the cut-aways to the Vietnamese (who ought, by rights, to have been the centre-stage heroes), whom Wallace trots before the camera as though discharging a poorly understood duty that he'd like to get out of the way quickly.The ostensible hero, Colonel Moore, comes across as a grade-A prat; never in his entire screen career has Mel Gibson been so devoid of charm or discernible intelligence.  Perhaps his most buffoonish hour comes when he delivers the inspirational speech to the poor soldiers who are about to head off to a bloodbath on the other side of the world, where they'll kill and be killed in the service of... Well, he can't say what it's in the service of, so he says something unrelated which he imagines is stirring: ""Some of you will die.  I can't promise you that you'll make it back alive.  But I can promise this: I will leave no-one behind.  Dead or alive, we will all come back.""  This doesn't happen, of course, which is just as well.  (Imagine if Moore REALLY had to retrieve all the dead bodies, including those which fell into enemy-controlled ravines and those which nobody could locate.)  But the insult lies in offering this as something a condemned man would want to hear.  Surely some of the soldiers were standing there thinking: If I get killed in battle, BIG DEAL if my corpse has a seat reserved on the flight back.",We Were Soldiers
52,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Predictable but very impactful nonetheless,8,16 August 2020,"War is nothing like it used to be. The act of military aggression has transformed over the years, but the end result has usually remained the same. No matter what, innocent lives will be lost and casualties will be had on both sides of the combatants. The worst part, is that it's basically people being pitted against each other and being convinced their side is right vs the other. All this because the higher ups in their respective governments either cannot stay out of each other's business, or because they cannot come to an agreement on a specific issue. It's truly unfortunate when countries just can't get along. There's always someone stirring the pot and messing things up. For the Vietnam war, it was seen as a necessary intervention to prevent the spread of communism, while others felt it wasn't anyone's business to get involved.The plot about this film is specifically about the battle of Ia Drang, which took roughly three days. Writing and directing was handled by Randall Wallace, adapting this from a book based on the accounts of two soldiers in this film. The soldiers were Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper), one being a Lieutenant Colonel and other being a photographer. Together, they meet at which the setting takes place and they both take away things from it they never forgot. Randall Wallace was also the writer to Braveheart (1995), The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001). Probably what's the most unique about this feature is the story line and the way it is shown. Other war films tend to show characters as they progress through the war from beginning to end. Here though, it's only for three days. That's it.What's more interesting though is how much happens in three days So much happens in that short time span and viewers also get to see just how quickly a life can be lost. Predictability is probably the only downside to this film. Like any story, characters are introduced at beginning, For this movie, by actors Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliott, Chris Klein, Ryan Hurst, Jon Hamm, Clark Gregg, Josh Daugherty, Jsu Garcia and Brian Tee. However, since this is a war film, it should be known that not all the characters introduced will live to the end. Mind you this was just list of the actors from the US side. The same is also portrayed for those who fought on the opposing side. Each person had at least someone who was thinking about them. Madeleine Stowe, Keri Russell and Simbi Kali play those kinds of roles - the veteran's wife.The realism to this film is another huge positive. Much of the production looks like the effects were all practical which can be tough to pull off. Here though it looks good. Whether it be the explosions, gunfire or hand to hand combat, it is a very intense to watch. The sounds will really immerse the audience in the setting. Even when people are talking to each other on the battlefield, it's not the easiest to hear what's being said. It makes sense though because there would be a lot of noise and chaos happening all at once. There's also burns and blood squibs depicted on screen, some of which are not pleasant looking at all. If anything it just shows how serious war is, no matter how much it's fun to play on a video game. In real life, it is by no means a fun experience, there are no cheat codes.All around the camerawork is visually accurate looking too. Managed by Dean Semler, the footage shot captures the carnage and atmosphere of those fateful days. Semler also worked on Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), The Three Musketeers (1993), Eye See You (2002) and xXx (2002). Lastly the musical score composed by Nick Glennie-Smith was an interesting work. The score has a mix of thumping drums and music box like tunes that give the viewing an eerie and horror like sound that accompanies the bloody violence on screen. It's effectively left out though for certain scenes to maintain their realism too. Smith also composed for The Rock (1996), Home Alone 3 (1997), The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride (1998) and Highlander: Endgame (2000).Predictability is the only aspect to this picture experienced viewers will see coming a mile away. Despite that though, the acting, camerawork, realism, practical effects and narrative are a sobering reminder of the casualties of war, no matter how glorified it may seem.",We Were Soldiers
53,Luigi Di Pilla,"Harder than ""Windtalkers""",7,5 April 2003,"My wife had tears during this brutal movie. It is no doubt a very intense and realistic suicide war movie in Vietnam. The story tells us much about the soldiers family, the morality and the hope in god. But it shows also how fatal and silly the adventure for a battle like in Vietnam could be. Congratulations to all the stuff. Mel Gibson did a solid performance. The director created a masterpiece that overtakes perhaps ""Platoon"". The music was very fine and melancholy. Great special effects and top picture. Why ""We Were Soldiers"" didn´t won at least one Oscar, Hollywood?I can definitive recommend it to every war movie fan and to all them who can see to very violent scenes. Don´t miss the other true story ""WINDTALKERS"".

54,tomsview,Soldierly virtues,8,14 September 2013,"In an interview in ""Vietnam Magazine"" some years ago, Joe Galloway said that although there were changes, he felt the movie of ""We Were Soldiers"" was faithful to the book he co-wrote with Colonel Hal Moore, and also to the real events. Editorial comments in the same magazine indicated that many veterans appreciated this movie far more than ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Platoon"".""We Were Soldiers"" is a straight soldier's story without the weird baggage that accompanies so many Vietnam War movies. No Russian roulette, no terminations with extreme prejudice, no surfing colonels. It was also a battle fought without civilians caught in the crossfire, which so defined the Vietnam War.""We Were Soldiers"" is about the formation of a battalion of the US Air Mobile Division and its baptism of fire in South Vietnam's Ia Drang Valley in 1965. The story is told from the point of view of the unit's commander, Hal Moore, played by Mel Gibson. Moore's wife, played by Madeleine Stowe, also has a pivotal role in the story, which shows the impact of the battle on the soldier's families as they await news at home.Moore's battalion traces its heritage to Custer's ill-fated 7th Cavalry, and the Little Big Horn is always at the back of the modern commander's mind.Moore's men land by helicopter, and although greatly outnumbered, engage the enemy in a fierce battle. The real life Colonel Hal Moore felt the battle was a draw; US forces withdrew, but although their casualties were heavy, the North Vietnamese casualties were many times higher.Gibson's movie concentrates just on the actions of Moore's men. In his book, Moore relates how two other units were eventually drawn into the fighting. When they withdrew the following day, they were ambushed – the real events were not quite as tidy as in the movie.Gibson is fine as Colonel Hal Moore, no doubt a challenge with the real man, according to the film's publicity, a visitor to the set. Mel gives the role depth and his pain seems real when he has to order his men into situations that could cost them their lives.Sam Elliott's grizzled Sergeant Major Plumley, based on the real-life soldier, adds a role worthy to be mentioned with the great screen noncoms. Greg Kinnear as Major Bruce Crandall, who leads the helicopter pilots, also turns in a compelling performance.The film doesn't glorify war, but the sequences where the movie falls down tend to be where the filmmakers included some very standard ""Hollywood"" interpretations of war.Although the Vietnamese are portrayed with respect in some scenes, in others they are mowed down mercilessly. Towards the end, many North Vietnamese conveniently move mid-camera to die in a swirl of slow motion arterial spray accompanied by Nick Glennie-Smith's dirge-like score – a hackneyed technique even by the late 1960's.These scenes create a jarring note, along with those in the beginning where the French are wiped out in a perfunctory manner. Although defeated on RC4, the paratroopers of the French Foreign Legion in particular fought with desperate bravery and deserved a little more cinematic respect. The sequence looks fake, and leaves an unfair perception.With that said, the positives outweigh the negatives in ""We Were Soldiers"".The scenes where the families of the soldiers are informed about the deaths of loved ones are genuinely affecting, and must still touch raw emotions in the people involved.Volatile politics and events such as Mai Lai have overshadowed the fact that many Vietnam-era soldiers fought actions at the small unit level that were as bloody as some of the worst battles of WW2. Gibson's movie helps balance the ledger. It shows the disproportionate price some people pay – physically and spiritually – in the service of their country. Although Vietnam is an old war now, the essential message of ""We Were Soldiers"" is still timely, because some people are still paying that price.",We Were Soldiers
55,DJAkin,Worst Movie of the Year so far,1,4 March 2002,"I was hoping that this movie would deliver the goods.  All it delivered was corny and sappy.  I mean, was Mel Gibson drunk when he decided to take part in this pile of tripe?  Nobody has used the phrase ""Tell my Wife I loved her"" (like that Chinese Man) than Hollywood.  If I hear that dang line one more time, I will throw up!!  What's the deal with Sam Houson?  Everytime somebody said good morning to him, he'd just say ""What the hell do you know about good morning.""  THAT made me IRATE!  And what about how Mel Gibson too a CAB to his house!!  He couldn't just call his WIFE ahead of time and LET HER KNOW!?  She could have given him a RIDE!  That was way off base.  Mel Gibson prayed TOO MUCH!  What's worse, is that his prayers were supposedly from the top of his head, yet the sounded as if they WERE FROM A BOOK!!! This movie totally rips off THE GREEN BERETS with John Wayne.  There are too many sappy lines and the wife, family, meaning of war theme is overused.  If you want to see this, trust me, DON'T!!!  See The Green Berets or Hamburger Hill.  Those are REAL war movies!!",We Were Soldiers
56,dunmore_ego,We Were Soldiers In A Plot-less Movie,3,2 September 2003,"Like the Viet Nam war, We Were Soldiers has no plot. And also like the Viet Nam war, the movie drones on incessantly with half of America saluting it and the other half protesting that it should be ended.The number of isolated incidents Hollywood can potentially mine for movies about WWII or Viet Nam or the Gulf or, more recently, the war sloganed as 'Dumb President Dumb War', is limitless - but seriously, bozos, what's the point? After the hundredth explosion and twentieth empty promise of, 'We will leave no one behind!' and fiftieth guy who dies saving his friend's life, can I now claim my membership in the 'Inured To War Movies' Club and get on with my wretched life? In other words - I GET IT! Put the fake blood down and step away from the Huey. So it's a 'true' story - WHO CARES? There's some running and shouting and explosions - and then there's some running and shouting and explosions. But it's a True Story! - SO WHAT?! Rhubarb rhubarb harumph harumph. (I didn't get a harumph outa that guy!) Tagging any story as 'true' doesn't guarantee that it's worth telling. I bought fourteen rolls of toilet paper today and spoke to a CD replication plant in Santa Ana. True story. Where's my funding?Braveheart's descendant, writer/director Randall Wallace injects human involvement to the point where we shudder to imagine the loss of even one human life  on ANY side. But this has become a tenet of modern movie-making  the war film ironically decrying violence. 'Twould be a Profound Testament, were it not for ""All Quiet On The Western Front"", or ""Paths Of Glory"" or ""The Deer Hunter"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" or a hundred other previous films with deeper and larger hearts.And yet, unbelievably, some slick-tongued agent was able to finagle some studio executive into conning some corporate funder into coughing up money to beat out the same old story with different names. I'm not even saying that this was a 'bad' movie (in that Roger Corman/Ed Wood sense of the word), just that it was... 'unnecessary' (in that John Woo/Michael Bay sense of the word).Despite its overall pointlessness, there are many surprisingly good points to this movie. The film-makers actually bothered to TRANSLATE the Vietnamese, which humanized them considerably; most movies of this ilk callously regard ""the enemy"" as faceless, unintelligent guerillas who just deserve to die  but the choice to portray the Viet Cong making military decisions, giving pep talks to their boys in... uh, green? tope? (what WAS the color of their uniform?), allowing the Vietnamese protagonists to express feelings of horror, indecisiveness, heroism, *humanity*, almost evened out the insensitivity shown to that race in every previous war picture to date Too late the apology  if this movie were made in an age where war pictures were taken seriously, rather than mushed out in production-line fashion after September 11, 2001, maybe it would have made amends. Instead, it becomes indistinguishable amongst the bilious fad fodder like Black Hawk Down and Behind Enemy Lines. Another plus was the portrayal of the euphemistic 'friendly fire'; I'm sure that in the course of every major battle where no one knew which way was down, up or pan-dimensional, innumerable scores of troops must have been cut down by their own men, although, we realize that in showing this ONE scene, the movie-makers absolve themselves of the implication that this type of incident was commonplace. It is handled, as we would expect Hollywood to handle it, like a mistake that happens as rarely as Dennis Miller resorts to fart jokes for cheap laughs.Of course, all the maudlin attempts at heartstring-tugging were shoveled effusively down our throats, such as the birth of Chris Klein's baby and his subsequent hollow prayer, 'I don't know what god's plan is for me - I hope it's to protect orphans and not make any' - now let's qualify that statement with the word 'AMERICAN orphans', cos you sure as hell made a lot of Vietnamese orphans out on that field today, you mannequin-faced hypocrite.We're aware of his massive range of acting chops, but for this movie, Mel Gibson just cupped one hand and skimmed the surface froth of that deep, deep mug. And speaking of mugs, this movie may have salvaged a few reasonable moments were it not for Mel's egregious mugging at every foreseeable opportunity. His unabashed mugging was to this movie as Chuck Heston's was to Soylent Green. He delivered many monologues, all drenched in red-whaht-en-blue; he made a lot of empty promises (most of them concerned with 'leaving no one behind' blah blah) he oozed a lot of compassion and ultimately, should have quit the movie business after making Braveheart. (Can I get a witness?!? Examine his silly repertoire after that award-winning epic: Pocahontas, Ransom, Conspiracy Theory, The Patriot, What Women Want, Lethal Weapon 4 - to name a few.).So when's the next propaganda due?",We Were Soldiers

While this film has everything we've come to expect from the high-budget war genre in that it's well-made, well-acted and looks great, it does nothing to stand out from the crowd and is relatively weak in terms of plot and originality.Despite what should have been an engaging and moving storyline, the pedestrian pacing and over-the-top dialogue and violence makes it difficult to fully invest in what's happening.'We Were Soldiers' is a solid, watchable film, but it is surprisingly forgettable and difficult to connect with compared to other similar war films.",We Were Soldiers

There is better ways to set up this movie than going thru crap.

Simply put, you don't go into a major battle with one arm tied behind your back.  Which is why we pulled out.  Cause you can't win that way.This movie shows a little of this, but decides to go the patriotic rout. Which really isn't a bad thing for this movie.  Since this particular battle was won by someone who knew how to win.  But I though this was a little too much hollywood.  There are better vietnam movies than this.

59,mstomaso,Lives up to its reputation,9,24 December 2006,"We Were Soldiers is one of the better war films I have seen. This says a lot, since there have been many memorable films in this genre recently. The production team managed to unify around its central objective and more or less perfectly execute what they had intended - to bring a particular battle to the screen in as realistic a manner as possible. The film is told from the point of view of those who wrote the book upon which it is based - definitely from an American perspective - but more importantly from the perspective of a soldier. Soldiers in this film are depicted as duty and honor bound people trying to do a job, follow through with a commitment, and to keep themselves and each other alive.The film tells the story of the first major offensive of what would later become known as the Viet Nam war. The action takes place in the Ia Drang (later referred to as The Valley of Death), and is brutal and relentless. Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper lead a fine ensemble cast - nobody slips up whatsoever. The stars - and there are many recognizable faces here - disappear into their characters such that you will forget who they are. Clearly, all of the participants in this film believed whole-heartedly in what they were doing.Unlike many films of this genre, We Were Soldiers does not obsess upon heroism, on political commentary and/or on right or wrong. Since these issues are largely irrelevant in the 'on the ground' situation of the soldier at war, the perspective is appropriate and refreshing. The film borders on grotesque with its frequent and graphic violence. But its subject is one that should never be soft-pedaled. War is violent, grotesque and excessive by its very nature. Anything short of disgust would have sold the subject short.An important point, however, is that condemning war is in no way a condemnation of the brave persons who participate in it. Participation in war sacrifices not just time, energy, and at least a part of one's life, but also a piece of an individual's humanity. Regardless of the politics and all of the rest of the armchair ""participation"" many of us may indulge in, what touched me most about this film was knowing that itaccomplished its one simple and important goal - to truthfully tell the story of those who lived and died in Ia Drang without a lot of embellishment, romance, or panache. What a great and honorable purpose.",We Were Soldiers
60,mattymatt4ever,"Pretty well done, but could've been more powerful",5,3 March 2002,"This is a pretty well made film about the Vietnam War, but I just felt it was lacking something.  I just didn't feel the power and poignancy I did while watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" and certain other war epics.  But it does deliver a good message about patriotism.  There are a few genuinely touching scenes, including one where Madeline Stowe (who plays Gibson's wife) sees a cabbie approaching her doorstep with a telegram.  It turns out he's not there to report her husband's death, but to see if she can help locate a certain addressee.  She gets furious at him, for giving her such a scare.  As he heads back to the cab, he says ""I'm sorry, I don't like delivering these messages.""  That's when she takes the initiative, and offers to deliver the telegrams herself.  Mel Gibson is remarkable as the great Lt. Hal Moore.  I can tell he researched the role extensively.  He's so convincing that I sometimes forgot I was watching Mel Gibson on screen!  Greg Kinnear is miscast in a small role.  I know he got nominated for an Oscar, and he is moderately talented, but he's not convincing as a soldier.  Barry Pepper, who I've heard of but never seen before, is great as the reporter-turned-hero.  He's a new, up-and-coming actor and he's destined for success.  And Madeline Stowe gives a quietly powerful performance as Moore's wife.  ""We Were Soldiers"" is far from terrible and far from great.  I definitely disagree with my narrow-minded Dad when he called it a ""junk picture.""  He was simply disgusted by the extreme violence, and totally missed the point: the movie is not designed for entertainment!  But as I said, it lacked a certain something.  I walked out of the theater, crying, like I always do after watching a war movie.  But it was long and boring and dragging at points.  However, I'm sure if you were in the Vietnam War, you will be much more moved.  So if you were, please ignore my comments.

61,hall895,Into the heart of a movie battle like no other,8,29 August 2005,"It is hard to stand out and be a unique war film. They've been making war films pretty much since the invention of film it seems. So you would think by now that it's all been done before, and for the most part it has. Yet We Were Soldiers manages to separate itself from the pack and give us a unique take on one particular battle in one particular war. Depicted here is the first major battle involving American troops in the Vietnam War. The fact that this battle takes place in what is known as the Valley of Death tells you all you need to know about what awaits the men who head into combat.The central figure in the movie is Lt. Col Hal Moore, played by Mel Gibson. Moore, leading the 7th Cavalry, will train his men and lead them into whatever hell awaits them. The film begins back home as Moore assembles his new unit and begins to whip them into shape. Here we learn much about what makes Hal Moore tick and begin to see him for the true leader of men he is. These opening scenes are important as they show many of Moore's motivations and also the obstacles which are placed in his way. The time back home also allows us to see Moore the family man with his strong, stoic wife, played by Madeline Stowe, and their young children. We also meet other key characters. There is Moore's second-in-command, battle-tested Sgt. Maj. Plumley, played with wonderful gruffness and all the appropriate seriousness by Sam Elliott. There is helicopter pilot Bruce Crandall, played by Greg Kinnear, and young Lt. Jack Geoghegan, played, surprisingly well for someone who came to prominence in a silly farce like American Pie, by Chris Klein. But the key figure throughout is undeniably Moore and Gibson's strong, confident portrayal is a key to the movie's success.While important in establishing the key characters and the emotional ties that bind them to each other and those whom they are leaving behind, the opening scenes back home have a feeling of just biding time about them. The film really takes off when the 7th Cavalry is dropped into the Valley of Death and confronts the overwhelming enemy force which awaits them. The rest of the film deals with this one epic, unrelenting battle. It sounds clichéd but the battle scenes are so well choreographed and photographed that you do truly feel as if you are there. The intensity of the conflict jumps off the screen. The focus is on the valor and heroism of the American soldiers but unlike so many war films which present a nameless, faceless enemy we also get to see things from the Vietnamese perspective. We see the enemy leaders detailing their strategy and also are presented with reminders that the Americans are not the only ones with loving, concerned families back home. We see the toll on both sides, not just for the soldiers but perhaps most poignantly in scenes inter-cut from home where soldiers' wives wait to learn the fates of the men they love.We Were Soldiers is a brutally honest, unflinching look at the hell that is war. It is a story which begged to be told. Seeing as it is adapted from a book by two of the central figures in the conflict, Hal Moore and reporter Joe Galloway who found himself thrust into the middle of the conflict (and who is played wonderfully by Barry Pepper in the film) you can rest assured that unlike so many other war films this one would focus on ""getting it right."" The film tells it as it truly was. It is at times invigorating and inspiring and at other times truly heartbreaking. All in all it is a fitting tribute to, as the film states at the beginning, the men on both sides who died in that place.",We Were Soldiers
62,gftbiloxi,A Vietnam Veteran Contemplates WE WERE Soldiers,10,17 May 2005,"I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal. Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it. I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films. He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it. And about one and all he says: ""It wasn't like that.""He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought. He said, ""They finally got it. That's what it was like. All the details are right. The actors were just like the men I knew. They looked like that and they talked like that. And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew."" The he was silent for a long time. At last he said, ""You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off? Something like that happened to me once. It was at a helicopter crash. I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off. It looked just like that, too. I've never told any one about it."" In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground. And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful. Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film. It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds. Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield. The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue. The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a ""you are there"" quality that is very powerful.I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place. And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd. But these are nit-picky quibbles. WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie. I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: ""It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie. I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie. But they pretty much get everything right. That's how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen."" Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",We Were Soldiers
63,jhclues,A Sobering Meditation On War,9,12 March 2002,"The title of the memoir that inspired this film, `We Were Soldiers Once...And Young,' written by Lt. General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, says much about what this film ultimately conveys, as in a few words it addresses the state of being of the individuals, as well as the country, which so soon would be embroiled in one of the most controversial wars in the history of America.  `We Were Soldiers,' adapted for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, is an uncompromising look at war and the commitment of those who wage it.  It's a true story told realistically, and moreover, in terms that are humanistic rather than political, which succeeds in making it a riveting drama that is both absorbing and emotionally involving.	It's November, 1965; some 400 American troops-- the 7th Cavalry-- led by Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), take the field at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, where they are quickly surrounded by over 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers.    The ensuing battle will last for three days, and it marks the first major confrontation between America and North Vietnam, a battle from which many, on both sides, will not walk away; and on hand to record it as it happens, is reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper).  Going in, Moore knows what they are up against, and he promises his men two things: That he will be the first to set foot on the field and the last to leave it; and he will bring every man back home with him, alive or dead-- no one will be left behind.  And it's a promise he keeps.  	With this film, Wallace succeeds where two other, recent depictions of historic battles, `Pearl Harbor' and `Black Hawk Down'-- both good films in their own right-- failed; and it's because he managed to achieve just the right balance between the rendering of the battle itself and the human element involved.  Of the two, `Pearl Harbor' is a close runner-up; the love story leading up to the battle was perhaps a bit extended, though ultimately engaging, whereas `Black Hawk Down' put the viewer in the battle, but was emotionally uninvolving.  Here, Wallace not only gives you a battle that is brilliantly staged and presented, but before he takes you there he makes sure you know those who are about to die, and the loved ones they are leaving behind.  War has many casualties, and they are not all on the battlefield; and beyond the realism of the fight, this is where Wallace makes his strongest statement, as during the three days of the battle he makes you privy to what the soldiers wives and families are going through at home, as well, waiting for the dreaded Western Union telegrams being delivered by cab drivers because the army wasn't prepared to deal with it. 
	The film is effective because Wallace keeps the human element at the heart of the story while he presents a perspective to which the audience can relate on very personal terms.  In short, he gives you the `whole story,' that enables you to know the horror of the firefight, as well as the throat clenching terror of seeing a yellow cab drive up to the front of your house, knowing full well what it means.  This is a prime example of filmmaking and storytelling at it's best; and it's a commendable achievement by Wallace.	Gibson is perfectly cast and does an excellent job of bringing Hal Moore to life with a convincing portrayal of a man dedicated to both his family and his life as a soldier.  Moore is focused and determined, and Gibson makes us realize that he knows the seriousness of what he is about to undertake, as well as the possible dire consequences thereof.  The real strength of the character, however, is in the fact that he is not some kind of superhero out to win the war single-handedly, but a man who lives and loves and feels like anyone else, who bleeds when he is cut and hurts when he loses one of his men.  A man who feels guilty that he is still living when his men die.  And it's all captured in Gibson's strong and credible performance.	Besides Gibson, there are a number of exceptional supporting performances in this film, most notably, Madeleine Stowe, as Julie Moore, Hal's wife; Sam Elliott, as the gruff and seasoned veteran, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley; Greg Kinnear, as Major Bruce Crandall, the helicopter pilot with a memorable nickname; Chris Klein, as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, a new father to whom Moore gives a perspective on the war that enables him to face the job he must do; Keri Russell, as Barbara Geoghegan, the young wife and new mother who must watch her husband go off to fulfill his destiny; and Pepper, turning in an extremely affecting performance as Joe Galloway.	The supporting cast includes Ryan Hurst (Sergeant Savage), Mark McCracken (Ed `Too Tall' Freeman), Edwin Morrow (Willie), Jsu Garcia (Captain Nadal), Matt Mangum (Private Soprano), Brian Tee (Nakayama), Joseph Hieu (NVA Major), Don Duong (Ahn), Alan Dale (Westmoreland) and Simbi Khali (Alma).  A film like this goes far in demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the medium that created it; it will never, however, enable us to understand war, because war-- in all it's myriad manifestations-- is beyond human comprehension.  But it has always been with us and always will be, and a film that is well made and presented, a film like `We Were Soldiers,' is important because it lends a needed perspective that allows us to take a step back and consider the magnitude of our endeavors in these regards, and the price we must pay for freedom.  It leaves one with a sense of pride and patriotism, but tempered with a sobering concern for seeking altruistic alternatives.  It may be only a dream; but hopefully, it's one that someday all the people of the world will share.  9/10.",We Were Soldiers
64,CharltonBoy,It's been seen all before.,7,29 March 2003,"When i say It's been seen all before that is not a critisism of the movie because the film is not bad at all but you wont come away with any abiding memories . Mel Gibson is starting to become very predictable in his old age.He seems to pick lots of films that involve battle scenes and worrying for a practising athiest like me , there seem to be more and more religious overtones . Do we really need the church scenes? Whats the point?How does the film benefit from knowing he is a church man? Are we supposed to say "" Its ok that he sticks his bayonet in a Viet Congs throat because he believes in god""!!! Who can forget that sickly ending to Signs, when he decided to go back to being a priest! wheres the bucket?! If your a war film fan then you will love this and i urge you to look at the way Mel Gibson stand up througout the battle and does not get hit once!!!.There is one really good gory scene involving a burn victim's legs that will be the only memorable moment for me. Not bad but nothing special. 7 out of 10.",We Were Soldiers
65,gbheron,Grim War Movie - This Time 'Nam,8,11 December 2002,"Continuing a trend in war movies; that of using state-of-the-art special effects to recreate the carnage of battle, Hollywood has now provided us its first entry for the Vietnam War. This follows World War II (Saving Private Ryan) and the Somali conflict (Black Hawk Down). Like ""Black Hawk Down"", ""We Were Soldiers"" is based on fact, written by the American commander of the famous November 1965 battle that heralded the start of large-scale American combat participation in the war. Thankfully, the filmmakers spend more time developing the film's major characters than did Ridley Scott in ""Black Hawk Down"" (which was my only complaint of that excellent movie). The difficult lives of the soldier's spouses are dramatically (and theatrically) portrayed to excellent effect. Over half the movie is reserved for the actual battle, and it's a grim and gory affair. We care for the soldiers, their wives, and families, and when the battle starts and the blood begins to spill, we, the viewers, are emotionally pulled apart. This is a very straightforward film, the portrayal of a single large battle, and its effect on the combatants and their families. I highly recommend it, but if you are uncomfortable with on-screen carnage, you'll want to avoid it.",We Were Soldiers
66,TOMASBBloodhound,"Finally, somebody got it right about Vietnam!",8,7 June 2003,"Over the years, the movie going public has been subjected to film after film after film about the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, most of them are largely philosophical and don't paint the American soldier in a very positive light. The film makers usually take a leftist position towards the government and try to use the conflict on the ground as some sort of metaphor for the existential purpose of life. Thus, we get subjected to films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Casualties of War. Although those film makers are certainly free to show us these interpretations of Vietnam, it gets old seeing our military trashed and our brave soldiers painted as drugged up sadists who were fighting for an immoral cause.From the beginning, you could tell We Were Soldiers is something different. It clearly shows the American soldier as what he/she usually is: Professional, brave, intelligent, and resourceful. There are no higher moral questions draped over this film. We simply see war as what it truly is. It is a conflict built up in the minds of our governments and carried out on the battlefield by our soldiers. Nothing more. Nothing less. Ultimately it is just about the man next to you and the men you're fighting against. We Were Soldiers focuses on this and this alone. The Ia Drang battle scenes (which take up most of the screen time) are ferocious. Mel Gibson shines as Col. Moore. He is the ultimate personification of masculinity. He ignores repeated requests for him to leave the battlefield as his troops are cut off and outnumbered. He seems to take the loss of each man personally as each commander should do. The combat footage is very graphic. This is not a film for those with weak stomachs.
This film also gives us another thing other Vietnam War films are reluctant to even touch. It shows us behind the scenes footage of the North Vietnamese Army planning their assaults and evaluating American tactics. It's about time some movie showed the human side to the NVA. They are usually portrayed as heartless, soul-less savages. This is ridiculous. They were family men who took just as much pride in a job well done as our own troops.
We Were Soldiers is an experience you won't soon forget. It is the pinnacle of what a war film should be. Not much time wasted on politics or existential philosophy. It is simply a graphic a realistic portrayal of war. For the soldiers on the battlefield, it isn't a matter of politics or a question of should we be here or not. What it comes down to is this: you have to kill your enemy or he will kill you!4 1/2 of 5 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",We Were Soldiers
67,rzajac,yet another makeover of the corpse of US/Vietnam,1,22 August 2002,"Hmm.  Hard to know where to start.First of all, it needs to be said that it is absolutely impossible to ""spoil"" this movie; that is, give away something crucial in the plot or character development that a new viewer would want to be a surprise.  Do people agree with me that this movie can't be ""spoiled""?There's a chance this movie might/could be construed as a verite revelation of the depths of self-deception, abuse-of-power, and might-driven neocolonialism into which the US had sunk by that time.  I mean, think about it:  Imagine Mel and the gang really believing that the ""wheels"" would never, ever, ever abuse the sacred trust of the military contract--the contract in which they agree to exchange their lives for the defense of their country--by sending deadly power where it has absolutely no business being.That might have made for a good, even redemptive, motivating idea behind this movie.  Unfortunately, I can't grant this redemptive interpretation.I suspect the movie is trying to say something grand; dare I say ""new""; about heroism, and its highest expression.  To address this, I'm going to compare the climactic ""heroic"" moment from this movie to the climactic ""heroic"" moment from the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie.  Sad to say; they're comparable.Remember the Jurassic Park theme music?  John Williams wrote sundry variations on that theme for use in mood-setting in the movie.  At the end, when Our Heroes are about to get pounced upon by a raptor, the rex snatches the raptor in mid-pounce and shakes it about in apparent reptilian thrill-of-the-chase glee.  Listen to what happens in the sound track: That's the moment when they deploy the ""heroic"" orchestration of the Jurassic Park theme by Williams.  But:  Why are they playing a heroic theme? The rex isn't a hero!  She isn't ""Lassie""!  She didn't ""save"" our protagonists; she was hungry!  There's a nasty and insulting dissonance between the music and the depicted event that deprives the movie of any redeeming value it might have retained up to that point.  It's insulting because it blythely assumes you're not going to notice.The same thing happened at the ""big"" moment at the end of We Were Soldiers. It's the scene where Mel and the (surviving) gang walk over a ridge, into a line of VC.  At that moment, when it appears a VC gunner is about to plug Mel (oh my God!  Not *MEL*!), the day is saved by air support, and we're treated to an enchanting 5+ minute slo-mo hi-tech blood fest where massive air support absolutely riddles the VC lines with a cats-and-dogs hail of hot lead.  Bring up the ""triumphal"", ""heroic"" theme, the one that informs us that we can all relax in the sure knowledge that Mel will get his millions. The VC blood is flowing like champagne at a debutante ball.  It's party time!  But where's the heroism in this?  It's not heroic!  It's just as dissonant in this regard as the scene at the end of Jurassic Park!  When one bank robber blows away a cop about to nab his accomplice, he's not a hero.I'll tell you who the heros are.The real heros in this story are the people who spent vast resources over the last 25 years to save us from having to face the moral debacle of Vietnam.  They've spent billions of dollars and countless light-years of celluloid to remind us that a technologically advanced people who traveled thousands of miles to a primitive agrarian culture to maim and kill those who resisted our socioeconomic intrusions are, at heart, a well-meaning bunch of folks, really just wanting to bring the light of democracy and freedom to rice farmers.I've thought about the Vietnam movies.  Doesn't it seem like each one hopes to drive the last nail into the coffin of that legacy?  Do we need yet another nail?  Isn't this hapless coffin bristling with nails, looking by now like a porcupine?  Wouldn't that tell you something?  What it tells me is that these movies aren't nails.  They're countless cinematic makeup specialists trying to give the corpse the final ""makeover"" that will finally convince us of the lie we want so bad to believe, but never will, because there's a place deep down inside each of us that knows it will die once and for all if we believe a lie that big and that ugly.  And I'm talking about the lie that says our intentions in Vietnam were good, and we were there defending freedom and democracy.This movie is yet another corpse makeover masquerading as a nail in the coffin.  Reject it.  Get informed.  If you give a rat's a*s, read up on Vietnam, weep over our hubris, apologize to those wounded by that legacy, vow to do what you can to return our military heritage to that envisioned by the founders:  The defense of our territory from intrusion from outsiders; not a tool in the hands of global economic power junkies.  Scrape the countless layers of makeup off the corpse, grieve over it, bury it, and move on.",We Were Soldiers

69,Angry_Arguer,They Just Don't Get It,8,21 July 2003,"On my initial review of this movie, I thought it was spectacular.  I withdraw that comment now.  Randall Wallace fills this movie with so much politically-correct garbage (compared to Hamburger Hill and Platoon) that I wonder what Mel Gibson was thinking when he signed on to this.As far as imitating Saving Private Ryan, WWS fails gloriously because it doesn't understand the *horror* of war.  Violence in Private Ryan is meant to be unflinching and realistic; here Wallace (and Gibson) flinch a lot. This is obvious in the full-color fighting complete with typical Hollywood setup.  There is no sense of reality, only distance.  Not even John Woo and Ridley Scott understood the concept in their movies.  Thereby, as far as the next generation of war movies is concerned, I approve of Private Ryan far more than any other.  Especially this.  The use of slow-motion and drowning out the sound for the cliche, gung-ho music was not a bright move and reduced this to an action movie...not a war movie.  Coppola and Stone understood the VietNam scenario better than anyone else.  Hence, they made better products.  While that is in the eye of the watcher, my opinion trumps all since this is my review.Overall, stick with previous war efforts for a better understanding.  This is only for die-hard Gibson fans or those who failed high school American history.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",We Were Soldiers
70,RonellSowes,Isn't Felt Beyond Your Eyes Or Ears,4,11 May 2021,"We Were Soldiers is about the first American fought battle of the Vietnam War; a battle that was fought on a knoll. Due to the restraints placed by the actual events, the film is very constrained. Once it reaches the battle the film has nothing to do than stay there. In an attempt to air things out the first hour is comprised of training scenes and others meant to enhance the emotion of the film-though unsuccessfully.The picture doesn't manage to carry the weight or intensity that counterparts like Platoon and Apocalypse Now do. It does possess some impactful moments, but for the most part it's made up of hollow scenes that don't touch you beyond your eyes and ears.And whatever passion it does have, is generated in large part by the score.",We Were Soldiers
71,grahamsj3,Pretty decent,8,25 August 2002,"Why does everyone have to compare every Mel Gibson film to Braveheart?Based on a book by the same title, it is a decent film that deals truthfully with the first major battle between US Army soldiers and the North Vietnamese Army. The book was written by Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper). The film is balanced in it's approach in that it is related from both sides. The way it was written shows a great deal of respect for the commanders and troops on both sides. It is brutally bloody, with liberal use of blood spatters on the camera lens and definitely earns it's R rating. It is a story of leadership and brotherhood. Before going off to 'Nam, Col. Moore (Gibson) tells his men that they will eventually be fighting for each other. During the training of his officers, he keeps stressing teamwork, brotherhood and respect for the men. The film continues to pound that thread home and all of the men learn to appreciate that fact in battle. This film is set in 1965, when the first combat troops were sent over to protect the advisors. The military wasn't prepared for the losses incurred; there was no plan in place to notify the families of those killed in action. Instead, the Yellow Cab company was used. I felt sorry for the cabbie in this film who had to deliver the bad news all too often. The film starts with us meeting some of the characters, their wives and children, so when bad news arrives for some of the wives, it's more emotional for the viewer as well. An altogether decent Vietnam film (FINALLY!). The acting is, for the most part, pretty decent, especially by Barry Pepper and Sam Elliot among the men and Madeline Stowe and Keri Russell among the women. The combat sequences are huge, prolonged, bloody and quite brutal, and it shows the bravery of both the American troops and the North Vietnamese as well. Those of us who weren't there can't possibly comment on how accurate this story is. In the special features, the men who were there say it's pretty accurate and I believe them. It's a significant film that's well worth a watch.",We Were Soldiers
72,jdkraus,"Sad, brutal-yet a very well-made war picture...",10,22 September 2008,"I was reluctant to see ""We Were Soldiers"" at first because I thought it was just another bloody war picture about heroism like ""Saving Private Ryan."" More than six years after its release, for the heck of it, I lent a copy from my local library. This movie is much more than about heroism and patriotism. For the first time I saw in a war film, the story focuses not only on the battlefield, but also on the men's families and wives, as they face fear of the knock on the door from a cabbie, telling them that their husband died in combat. This added a great deal of emotion to the characters of the film. I don't feel just sorry for the soldiers receiving gruesome deaths, but for their wives and children that they'll never see again. In a sense, this makes the film an anti-war picture. There maybe courageous acts and bravery in war, but it always comes with a heavy price.The lead and supporting actors were all diligent in their roles. Mel Gibson is not the typical action hero that I had expected from ""The Patriot"" or the ""Lethal Weapons"". He's a man in a hellish war in which he focuses not just on his own survival, but also for his men. I rank his performance in this as one of his best. I'm disappointed that he didn't at least a golden globe nomination in 2002. Director Randall Wallace, who helped Mel with ""Braveheart"", is wonderful as a director. He captures some intense and brutal battle scenes that are amazing, yet at times hard to watch (particularly with the napalm sequence). Dean Semler's photography is sweeping, plastering beautiful surroundings that are swamped by war. Nick Glennie-Smith's score has a triumphant sound, but at the same time is haunting. This develops a grim mood for the film. And lastly, I was thoroughly impressed with the sound effects editors. From what I saw on a documentary, all the gunshots and explosions were recorded after filming. They did a hell of a job making the audio fit the video. Bravo! ""We Were Soldiers"" is a superb film that reminds everyone not only the horrors of war (both on the battlefield and at home), but also the courage men in the past and today are willing to take for our nation.",We Were Soldiers

But I have something against flag waving, gun tooting patriotic scripts and this movie sure as heck has one. In that sense you might guess, that I don't like that many war movies. I do, but only those, which wont stuff patriotic ideals in to your face. Well okay, Mel Gibson is this military superman, who does everything for his men. Yippiekayee. Then they go in Vietnam and they are surrounded by Vietcong's. And lot's of shooting, dying and crying housewife's are shown, when they get the message.

74,FlickJunkie-2,Among the best war films in recent memory,10,23 September 2002,"`Saving Private Ryan' redefined the war genre and opened the floodgates to a new generation of war movies.  It pushed the boundaries of acceptability by frankly showing war in all its grisly glory.  As such it gave us a better understanding of how terrible and frightening war is.  `Black Hawk Down' took the graphic violence to a new level, with an intensity that matched the beach landing of SPR, but of a duration that was almost unbearable.`We Were Soldiers' is the latest big budget war offering from Hollywood. In many ways, I consider this to be the most complete of the three. Writer/Director Randall Wallace (who wrote ""Braveheart"", ""Pearl Harbor"" and the screenplay for this film), takes the understanding of war to the next level, by offering more than one perspective to the events.  Of the three films, this film has the best workup, the best character development, and the most nuanced look at the battle.  He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore.Based on real events, this film shows war as being horrendous and heartless to both sides.  It expands outside the combat zone to visit the ramifications on the families as well.  The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield.  Wallace's treatment grabs us on an emotional level and shocks the senses.  Unlike BHD, which presented the characters in a very anonymous way, we come to know these characters and their families and identify with them.Of course, the film lacks the hard edge that would make it starkly believable.  It is after all a Hollywood production and not a documentary. However, Wallace pours enough realism into the depictions to assure that this doesn't turn into another sappy melodrama like `Pearl Harbor', which was really nothing more than a romance with a long battle scene in the middle.  Wallace finds the optimal balance between engaging storytelling and the brutality of combat.The acting is excellent.  Mel Gibson offers the right combination of hard nosed officer and father figure (both to his children and his men). Gibson is steadfast and courageous without being harsh.  His portrayal of Moore is so well played, so charismatic and heroic, that it is impossible to believe that such a person could actually exist.Sam Elliot follows an outstanding performance in `The Contender' with this gem as Sergeant Major Plumley, the tough as nails warhorse who serves as Moore's non commissioned adjutant.  Elliot plays the intransigent career soldier to the hilt, where nothing including life itself is more important than honor and discipline.  Barry Pepper also turns in a fine performance as Joe Galloway, the photo journalist who hops on a helicopter to take pictures in the center of the battle and finds himself with a rifle in his hands fighting for his life.This is among the best war films in recent memory and probably the best film on the Vietnam War film since `Full Metal Jacket'.  I rated it a 10/10. This film is not for everyone.  It contains graphic violence and disturbingly realistic battle scenes.  It is a gripping and distressing film that should be required viewing for statesmen and generals alike.",We Were Soldiers
75,LebowskiT1000,"Pretty good, but nothing terribly spectacular.",8,20 March 2002,"I don't think I went into the theater with too high of expectations, but I didn't think the movie was anything great.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but it's a Vietnam movie, nothing we haven't seen before.  Mel Gibson pulls off a good performance as well as the other cast members.  This is a bloody movie though, so this movie isn't for everyone.  In the first 5 minutes you see a lot of blood, shooting and what not, but I guess that is to be expected with a war movie.  Anyhow, there isn't a whole lot that I can say about this movie.  There really wasn't anything in the film that I didn't like, but there also wasn't any thing that really stuck out as great. It's a good movie and if you like war movies, then you'll probably like this one.  But if you are just a so-so war-movie fan (like myself) then you'll probably think it was just ""OK"".

76,Spanner-2,Excellent war movie,9,4 March 2002,"This war movie features Mel Gibson in a true story about the early days of the Vietnam war. This film works primarily because the story is compelling and Gibson as the commander of this group of soldiers is excellent, you truly feel that he is a leader. Some truly horrific warfare of course takes up most of the film, but the film does also let you spend some time with the wives back home (Madeline Stowe and ""Felicity"" vet Keri Russell are the only recognizable ones) so you can get some sense of what they go through as well.. the film also shows a few scenes of the Vietcong commanders and treats them as real people rather than the charactures that so often end up in American war movies.  Chris Klein, however,  is somewhat miscast as a young soldier, just as he was miscast as an action hero in ""Rollerball.."" he really should stick to comedies like the ""American Pie"" movies that made him famous.

It actually hurts to watch this movie in certain moments.This movie is all the way up there with Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter and Platoon, with one big plus point: it is not politically motivated! It is shameful that the academy didn't find this film worthy of even one Oscar Nomination (I could think of at least 6 categories where it should have won an Oscar)...

Writer/director Randall Wallace (who also supplied the screenplay for Mel Gibsons multiple award winning ""Braveheart"") adapted his screenplay from the book written by two of the battles survivors; the man who lead his troops into battle, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore  Mel Gibson, in the films leading role  and war photographer Joseph Gallway (played by Barry Pepper). A number one movie at the US box office, the film is undoubtedly at its best when it recreates the battle itself, and its to Wallaces credit that we can actually follow its progress tactically, as Moore constantly tries to outwit his North Vietnamese counterpart to ensure his troops survival. As weve come to expect in these post ""Saving Private Ryan"" days the portrayal of warfare itself is brutal and shocking, with the threat of sudden death and terrifying wounds almost constantly present, and a total reliance upon your fellow soldiers. While its impossible to have nothing but respect for the troops involved in the actual battle, what might prove a little too much for English audiences is the films ""God Bless America"" moral righteousness and flag waving jingoism, particularly in the scenes involving the soldiers in training, their families back home, and that final shot of the stars and stripes. Its also unfortunate that the film follows so closely on the heels of Ridley Scotts ""Black Hawk Down,"" which not only dealt with many of the same themes but also had the advantage of a visionary director at the helm; by comparison ""We Were Soldiers"" is somewhat leaden and  admittedly, perhaps because its a set almost forty years ago  distinctly old fashioned.",We Were Soldiers
81,bsinc,Decent,6,30 June 2003,"I didn't expect much from ""We Were Soldiers"" since it was made at a time when Hollywood was encouraged to promote the US army(post 11.9). American patriotism is noticeable but they don't push it too far. A nice surprise which is sadly not exploited enough since it brings balance to all that Americana is that we get to see the other side, the Vietnamese commanders, planning and thinking how to defeat the American invaders, so this is not one of those ""kill the f....ng useless yellowskins"" type of movies.It tries to be as partial as possible and for the most parts succeeds. The problem is the acting. It doesn't stand out, no particularly good performances, which is about the only big downside since the movie could really use a more personal and dramatic touch. There are maybe just one to many characters in here to fully explore them. But considering that most of the time everyone is fighting for their lives I can understand this.Instead the movie really comes through in the effects department, displaying some truly spectacular visual effects and makeup(the scene where Joe Galloway picks up the burnt soldier by the legs is one of the most disgusting and disturbing things I have ever seen).The end result is a solid war movie taking place in an abnormally unrealistic ""Vietnamese"" surrounding that simply doesn't have anything new to tell, quite the opposite, it becomes a victim of a recycled formula from which we, the viewers, know exactly what to expect and therefore ""We Were Soldiers"" never really stood a chance at anything, even the American box office. 7/10",We Were Soldiers
82,PyrolyticCarbon,"A harrowing, realistic war movie with intelligence, but peppered with bad edits",7,20 March 2005,"Much was talked about this movie when it first came out, with the obvious comparisons made to Mel Gibson's other historical epic Braveheart, and those made me steer clear of the movie for a good while, although now I find myself wondering why after seeing it this weekend.It rivals Saving Private Ryan for the realism and gore factor, bringing the devastation and personal pain involved in war right at you without flinching.Gibson is strong in this role, but plays it at quite a lower key than he did in Braveheart, and it works really well. He really is a great actor, sure you can question some of his decisions and roles, but he can really pull off an emotional scene at both ends of the spectrum, and he has to show them all.The film certainly shows how harrowing the first assault of the Vietnam war really was, and how utterly pointless it was. It was amazing to see the courage and strength of the young men involved, and then being shown the flip side with the cowardice and idiocy of the suits in charge and their disregard for the lives of the soldiers.Although the movie concentrates on the US Soldiers it does turn to the Vietnamese Commander and show the similarities between them and their belief and love for their soldiers.Something that strikes me about many of the US historical movies is their blatant disregard for history, and their total belief in the American way above all else. The US won World War II by themselves, they managed to break the hold of the German Submarines by finding and cracking their code machine and they leapt into action and poured destruction on the Japanese after Pearl Harbour.None of this is seen in this movie, yes there is a strong American belief, but in this movie it's much more real. The belief is there, but it's from the soldiers who really believe in their Country and what they are fighting for, a feeling that was present in the real world before this war, and has struggled through since.It is a great war movie, it's also a very moving and harrowing one, showing what the Soldiers went through for their country and how their officials, and indeed their people, failed them.However it's not all good. The movie seems to have many swift cuts which are suited to the battle scenes, but not in transitions, and it begins to have the feel that there are portions of the movie edited out. This is certainly backed in the continuity of the story and how some crucial background and key scenes just seem to be raced through giving you the barest of information before heading off to another battle.That really harms the movie for me, and it's a shame because there is so much of this movie which is really, really good.",We Were Soldiers
83,PudgyPandaMan,Very gripping and intense depiction of war,8,20 July 2008,"I was just born right before the Vietnam ""conflict"" started, so of course I have no personal recollection of events. But my mom's 1st cousin was a chopper pilot there, and my husband's Uncle also served in combat there. So I grew up hearing bits and pieces - although neither man would ever discuss it in detail.So I was very interested to see what I have heard to be a realistic account of one of the battles of Vietnam. Like Saving Private Ryan, and Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers left me with an awe and respect for all those men and women who have fought and died to give us all the freedoms we enjoy.I think what has always bothered me, is how I heard these Vietnam vets were treated that returned home. I heard my mother-in-law share how her brother was spat upon, called baby-killer and other horrible names. These were young men (boys, really) that had no choice but to go when they were drafted. It was ""kill or be killed"". At least since then, it appears the country has learned a lesson how to better treat returning soldiers from the Iraq war, irregardless of people's view of the war.What I like about this movie is that it appears they were purposely trying to avoid political commentary. Every film about Vietnam, from The Green Berets to Apocalypse Now, seems to have a political ax to grind. Lost in all the political rhetoric of these past films have been the men who actually fought and died. This film is a tribute to the courage of the men who fought and who died there. They were soldiers and they acted like it. One can argue all day long about whether we had any business in Vietnam. But I was pleased and moved to see a film honoring the too often forgotten or politicized soldiers. Those veterans deserve this honor. Thank you to all Vietnam veterans who have suffered greatly with so little thanks from our country.",We Were Soldiers
84,mOVIemAN56,Excellent,8,28 March 2005,"There have probably been more films concerning Vietnam then any other US war. We Were Soldiers is the re-accounting of the first major US battle of the Vietnam war. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is the commander of the US troops and is designated to fly into hostile territory with helicopters, not traditional ways of marching.Within Moore's army, various other characters are followed including: Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley (Sam Elliot), Maj. Snake Candall (Greg Kinnear), and Reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper). Along with the story of the soldiers we receive of the stories of the wives trying to deal with the loss of their husbands. Hal Moore's wife, Julie (Madeline Stowe) puts it upon herself to deliver the death letters to the soldiers wives. the scene in which Julie and Barbara are delivering the letters is one of the best scenes of the film. The film is 90% battle with breaks here and there. The death of some of the soldiers is very graphic and when the napalm accidentally hits the US soldiers, you almost need to turn away as soldiers skin is falling off. Gibson gives another solid job as a soldier, Greg Kinnear brings some humor but not enough to hide what is being shown. The film is visually stunning and the battles are well done and graphic. We Were Soldiers. Starring: Mel Gibson, Madeline Stowe, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper, and Chris Klien. 3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",We Were Soldiers
85,deanofrpps,Gary Owens Sir!,9,26 May 2007,"War is Icky ""War is icky!"" exclaimed a US super-patriot who flaunts a UNITED WE STAND T-Shirt and drives a car plastered with US emblems. He hasn't volunteered in the current emergency to do anything other than act as a billboard. Over twenty-five years later, that sums up the general US sentiment. Even in the conservative ex-urbs far removed from the effete centres of banality and liberal thought, the Vietnam War remains such a sore topic that it is hard to make a movie salable to general audiences. Despite the top line billing of Mel Gibson, WE WERE SOLDIERS sadly opened to empty movie theatres here in Eastern Long Island. The tough knot of veterans stayed home. Having seen the live staged action, they had enough. The newcomers to US patriotism, singing songs, spouting slogans and flying banners didn't come to the movie either. Too gory and violent, they said. The Vietnam War is a tough topic to handle for cinematography. Unlike other wars fought by soldiers who were required to see it through, the Vietnam War was fought by replacements thrown together. Most units lacked any cohesion. The Army refused to use its trained leadership; instead leadership fell to whoever was around and available, constantly changing. Even on a political level, the agenda and objectives remained ephemeral. The Man and the Moment WE WERE SOLDIERS does not try to tell the whole story. It focuses on one battle in a valley in Western South Vietnam fought by the GARY OWENS BRIGADE, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, against a purported North Vietnamese Division in the early part of the war 1965. The story does not begin in battle but in training of the Air Cavalry inside the US in a training programme designed to adjust Cavalry tactics to the age of the helicopter. The choice for command is LTC Hal Moore (Mel Gibson). Mel excels in the part assuming the persona of Hal Moore right down to the staccotic Army accent.The name for the new fighting force is the GARY OWENS Brigade, famed for having been wiped out in combat with the Sioux Indians. However as deployment is implemented the President decides against declaring an emergency which will freeze enlistments. Thus the battalion goes into action at about half strength without adequate intelligence as to enemy strengths and dispositions. Colonel Moore is a mountain of a man willing to make every sacrifice and endure every hardship. However the movie subtly details the obstacles the Colonel faces. No one speaks Vietnamese other than a South Vietnamese Ranger seen briefly interrogating a captive. No one knows enemy strengths. No one except seemingly Colonel Moore knows that the Viet Minh defeated the French in approximately the same location and under similar conditions. Everything about the proposed operation is thrown together. There aren't enough choppers to carry the whole attacking force in one swoop. The first wave will have to wait almost an hour for backup. A Moment To Reflect There is a moment to reflect as the troops board the steel mounts for combat. The breeze of the swishing rotors hides a Gaelic War Cry blending the furies into song. How is it that Gaelic melodies so easily lend themselves to War? The engagement itself breaches a canon of strategy: never plan an attack without securing your staging area. The landing zone (LZ) is quickly overrun by enemy forces compelling Colonel Moore to improvise another site. As battle is joined Higher Headquarters waffles. The brass even General Westmoreland want to recall Moore the trained tactician and to send in a brevetted replacement. Moore ignores the order and fights on with the men. Certainly the vignette explains the many brevetted commissions from that war. Were other real life commanders as faithful to the unit and to the men as the story makes claim for Colonel Moore? Who can be sure? Fighting is toe-to-toe and nose-to-nose. A napalm strike hits US forces. Ultimate success in a temporal sense is won for the Americans who by the touch of a feather put the Viet Cong to flight. The cost to the US is frightful. Nearly half the Gary Owens brigade and almost all of its officers except Colonel Moore have been killed. General DeGaulle, then President of France, remarked caustically, Americans have learned little from our mistakes. But with all the victories of Vietnam, though the field is won, it is quickly evacuated and left to the enemy. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore, the Colonel's wife, to whom the dirtiest task of the war has been left by the Army, that of informing nearly all other officers' wives of husbands' death in combat. If Veterans stayed away having first hand knowledge of the cost of war, this movie would be a good one for those whose patriotism is newly found in the politically correct response to current emergencies.",We Were Soldiers

89,mhasheider,Merciless and simply unforgiving.,10,14 October 2002,"A fine and acceptable account of the first major battle in Vietnam between the N.V.A. and the U.S. forces in the Ia Drang Valley, as known as ""The Valley of Death"". The movie is well-cast with Mel Gibson, Chris Klein, and Sam Elliott who portray the high-ranking members of the seventh Air Calvary division who lead the unit of four hundred men into the area, nearly walk into a major bushwhack (or ambush), and discover their counterpart have more troops (2,000 to be exact). Plus, it shows some scenes where the wives of the soldiers (Madeline Stowe and Keri Russell among them) who were or weren't prepared to deal with the fact that their loved ones might not come back alive. That's how war is - merciless and simply unforgiving.Writer/Director Randall Wallace, who in directing his second film here, has the tough task of handling the scenes, and he shows no problems in doing so. The movie has a small mix of Samuel Fuller, Sam Peckinpah, and Oliver Stone. And there's a couple of nice touches at the movie. The first one being Gibson character writing to a widow of a dead NV soldier and the second one decading this movie to those who died in the fight.",We Were Soldiers

Which is a shame, because beneath some of the commonness of the film, is a film that has some brilliantly poignant moments of triumph and sacrifice.This is no Black Hawk Down.  But where Black Hawk Down had breath-taking direction, and flawless execution -- We Were Soldiers has heart.  You feel for each and everyone of these soldiers; and their wives; and their children.  These are men who made the ultimate sacrifice, and We Were Soldiers honors them wonderfully.Not a WONDERFUL film -- but a film that deserves to be seen for the story -- and the strong acting by its stars.",We Were Soldiers
91,ReelCheese,Tall Order,6,25 March 2007,"It's not easy bringing a realistic war to the big screen. One must manage to weave a story around the severed limbs and crushed skulls of combat, a tall order that only a few films have brilliantly accomplished.WE WERE SOLDIERS accomplishes it, too, but not as well as predecessors like BLACK HAWK DOWN and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Director Randall Wallace gets full marks for realism (you'll cringe at the charred flesh and gushing extremities), but it all feels like a distraction from the story rather than an integral part of it. And although all ""real war"" films are out of necessity chaotic and confusing, Wallace doesn't give the audience enough chances to catch its breath.Like RYAN and BLACK HAWK, the biggest virtue of WE WERE SOLDIERS is its human side. The scenes with Madeleine Stowe and her friend touring the neighborhood back home to deliver death notices are touching and sobering. Mel Gibson's character, a lieutenant colonel of strong faith called on to participate in something so awful, is deep and intriguing. The bond between Gibson's comes across as sincere and pure.In fact, it's probably fair to say WE WERE SOLDIERS is strongest off the battlefield. It's a relatively good film, but it's a tad hollow as it falls short of greatness.",We Were Soldiers
92,anhedonia,"Daddy, what is a good movie? Not this one, honey.",1,4 March 2002,"This movie truly is a huge disappointment.The first 45 minutes or so are awful and riddled with dreadful dialogue. When the movie finally shifts to the battle, it really doesn't click either. The characters are all cardboard and clichéd. Pardon the pun, but you can start picking off the guys who are going to die in battle minutes after we are introduced to them.Who knew that the John Wayne-esquire protagonist would make a comeback? There he is, Mel Gibson, standing tall, ignoring bullets whizzing by, nonchalantly knocking off enemy soldiers as if they were mere nuisances.And there's even a ridiculous deus ex machina moment in this film that is laughable.The women in this movie are mere decorations and even in those scenes, you can predict what's going to happen. And Madeleine Stowe had to pick this film not to shed her clothes, which would have been a small bonus.I realize the need to make a film that honors those who fought and died valiantly in this battle. But this film is not the one to do that. I don't mind that the film never questions why we were in Vietnam or whether we should have been there.This film - like ""Black Hawk Down"" - wants to simply tell the story of the battle and those who participated in it. But surely not every soldier who fought was a cliché from almost every war picture that was ever made. The only character missing was that young, late teen-age soldier, nicknamed with the state he hails from, sitting in the trenches looking at the picture of his childhood sweetheart Betsy, telling his buddies that when he returns stateside, he's going to go back to the farm and raise a family with her and then...wham! - a sniper's bullet slams into his skull. And his buddies get really angry now because this time the bad guys killed Wisconsin.And in case you were wondering whether Randall Wallace has gotten over his penchant for slow-motion, fear not. This movie's got plenty of those shots, too, in case the audience was just too dumb to realize the significance of the moment.If you want to see a good movie about the early days of Vietnam, rent ""Go Tell the Spartans,"" starring Burt Lancaster.",We Were Soldiers

And since when have people keep calling people pussies in the war.  They make it sound like present-day language.  How come when grenades blow up a foot away from a person they just blow back instead of blowing to bits and pieces.  It was still good, though.

However, there are so many bad things about this movie, I feel I will forget something. Let us begin with Mel Gibson and his accent. What part of the country he is supposed to be from, I am not sure. Then there is the geography of Vietnam, which looks a lot like Central Texas. I swear I saw numerous Texas Live Oaks. I don't want to be too picky here, but Vietnam (any tropical country) does not resemble this terrain at all. Then you have the NVA troops that all like to run right up to our American boys without firing their weapons. Our boys shoot them as they run with their AK 47's in hand. Now that is just bad training. If the NVA had only known how to actually fire a weapon, they might have won this war. Hey, wait a minute, they did win this war. Other acting performance were shallow and undeveloped.Look, it is no shock why this film is accepted. It is told on about a 2nd grade level and is crammed full of patriotic and military pride.

The acting was fine with me I did not have a problem with that or anything about it for that matter. It was based on a book of the first account of U.S. troops fighting in Vietnam and I have to think it's pretty realistic. They were trained, schooled, properly equipped, and completely unprepared for what was about to happen to them. Lambs to the slaughter in every sense of the word.

With all the negative sentiment surrounding Vietnam it is admirable this movie can be objective enough to show the soldiers on both sides as people with family who care about them. Even though I served there and detested the terrorist, aggressive actions of the communist north I have always known the enemy were people. They were someones sons and daughters. This movie shows in some respects how war affects the many who do not serve. If all people of the world felt as I do now, there would be no more wars. Unfortunately such is not the case. Sam Elliot is excellent as the hard nosed old Sergeant who has seen too much war in his lifetime but is not about to give up fighting the good fight.

Just pure silliness to glorify the Vietnam War since, like our present war in iraq, we were lied into it by our leaders who fed us some hokum about fighting communism!!!! Like all wars of the last 1000 years, VN was about making money for the international bankers but that story is never told here.Movie starts slowly but then the troops go to Nam and are immediately in a days-long and gruesome battle which lasts most of the movie. SPOILER. Many lives are lost on both sides, but the implication at the end is that America won the battle. One thing that really irked me is that at the end of the movie, Gibson's wife hears the doorbell ring and she and the viewer automatically think it's bad news about her hub. Instead, it's Gibson himself who survived the horror and has returned to his family. So why did he ring the doorbell before entering his home?If you like war movies, you'll like this, but i suggest you skip it if you're the type who asks questions like ""Why did America kill millions of people in a country that never did anything to us?""",We Were Soldiers
98,fredericksmith1952,The Finest combat film ever.,10,23 January 2012,"Fair warning. If you are the least bit squeamish about combat scenes, pass on this film. This contains some of the most graphic and realistic scenes since the beach landing in Saving Private Ryan. Once the fighting starts, it is non-stop and horrific, and anyone who thinks combat is in any way glorious or heroic will walk away with an altered attitude. The portrayals are realistic and true, thanks to the technical advise of both the authors, and the performances are human and identifiable. Young men who are thrown into combat, young wives and families who are horrified to learn their husbands and fathers are gone. The ""illusion of the first time"" is perfect, and from the very beginning you are drawn into the story as if you are observing it unfold. Both Stowe and Gibson give Oscar worthy performances, as does Elliot and the rest of the cast. This is one for your collection, and definitely a film any young man with dreams of being a combat hero ought to see before heading to the enlistment office. It should be obvious this is not a film for the children in the family, but teens above the age of 14 ought to be able to watch without nightmares.",We Were Soldiers

101,extravaluejotter,An Old-Fashioned War Movie about a Modern War.,6,7 November 2006,"I had low expectations of ""We Were Soldiers"", thanks to the less-than-enthusiastic critical reviews on its release. However, I decided to watch it when it was on TV recently and I was genuinely impressed.The film recreates the mood and the attitudes of America in 1965. Yes, some scenes are dripping with cheese by modern standards but I believe that the film-makers did not set out to make another ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Platoon"".""We Were Soldiers"" is the sort of war movie that Hollywood made when a lot of the actors and film crew had WWII and Korean War combat experience. Like the fighting men it depicts, ""We Were Soldiers"" tells the story of a battle, plain and simple. Using the memoirs of an experienced professional soldier as a starting point, the crew and cast have put together a dramatised account of America's first military action in Vietnam, the battle at la Drang.la Drang paved the way for American involvement in the struggle for Vietnam's political future. Outnumbered 10-1, elements of the American 5th and 7th Cavalry Divisions fought 4,000 PAVN and Viet Cong soldiers to a standstill over 3 days. Both sides suffered heavy casualties and the battle was only decided by American air support and pin-point artillery strikes. The PAVN were forced to withdraw but were able to re-occupy the la Drang region as soon as the Americans had evacuated their casualties. As pointed out by a PAVN general towards the end of the film, the battle allowed the Vietnamese to analyse American air mobile tactics and work out a simple way to counteract them. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a tribute to the Americans who fought in Vietnam, pure and simple. The film makes a few telling digs at American foreign policy, military organisation and planning and how unprepared the US Army was when the casualty reports came flooding in. However, overall this movie works hard to capture the terrifying reality of close quarter battle with modern assault weapons. The battle scenes are graphic, chaotic and bloody and are in no way a glorification of violence. The movie has been criticised for depicting waves of PAVN and Viet Cong fighters being mown down while US soldiers are picked off piecemeal, but that was the truth of the battle. The Americans dug in and without artillery or air support, all the PAVN commanders could do was order their men on the ground to attack the American defenders en masse.Despite its cheesy ""Soldiers at Home"" and ""Slow-mo Death Scene"" moments, ""We Were Soldiers"" works as a war movie because it tells a story of men in combat with very little political bias and a reasonably healthy respect for historical fact. Yes, there are other films about Vietnam with a stronger ""Anti-War"" message, but condemning ""We Were Soldiers"" for not being like ""Platoon"" et al is like condemning an army for doing its duty.",We Were Soldiers

No, instead that, they provide us an half an hour of romance in a poor ""Pearl Harbor way"" and an hour and a half of fighting, with Mel Gibson as a ""Braveheart"". Fighting, suitable only for those who enjoyed Rambo type of a movies with a better injury effects. Since I nearly fell a sleep in this one, i couldn't rate it higher.

In case we didn't listen up during drill instruction, stoical Leader Of Men(TM) Mel Gibson repeats his ""I'll be the first on the battlefield and I'll be the last off it / All we have in war is one another"" speech, only this time in a smarter uniform. In fact, most of the dialogue thuds like so many UXBs.Thankfully, the cliches don't extend to the de rigeur rogues' gallery of platoon misfits - only the ever-grizzled Sam Elliott and wide-eyed father-to-be Chris Klein warrant more than cursory screen time. This is just as well, because once they touch down in the warzone, they're simply cannon fodder.Wallace deserves some credit for staging the carnage well and giving the Viet Cong a point of view (though their commander's bunker-room debrief with his weary troops was less inspiring than an unenthusiastic sports coach giving a half-time team-talk).Like Pearl Harbor, this is worth watching for the second hour alone.

Why did he not think about Diên Biên Phu where the French lost 10.000 men and the Vietnamese 25.000 soldiers in 1954, eleven years before?  While the Americans at that time had no intention entering Vietnam. There was a Catholic government in South-Vietnam and as long as the military did not intervene in South-Vietnamese affairs, the Americans had no reason to enter the country. The battle-scenes are realistic and are interrupted by showing the families of the military at home who receive the mail of the soldiers or the announcement of their death. It is shown with a sentimental reserve which is a good balance to the horror of this battle.  The Americans kept thinking that the Vietnamese would continue their kamikaze-attacks but soon after they changed tactics and tried to hide for the American marines until the American bombers spit them out.

Alas, no role for Neville Gorman this time.I rate 'We Were Soldiers' at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 5/10 on IMDb.",We Were Soldiers

110,widescreenguy,armchair experts not welcome here,8,27 May 2006,"in 1970 I had no job prospects and not enough grades to go to university. I toyed with the idea of taking a bus to the Detroit recruiting center and go to Viet Nam and try to kill some communists.but the place was a quagmire at that point and those in the know realized it was a lose-lose prospect. the north Vietnamese were willing to pay any price to win and far too many of the south Vietnamese saw the war as a great way to make money on the black market.the most telling thing for me about the movie wasn't even part of it, it was the commentary and interviews included in the DVD, 'they finally got it right'.this film should be required viewing for all the congressional hawks who have vested interests in outfits like halliburton and big oil. who refuse to enlist their *own* kids in the army and instead send the young people from disadvantaged neighborhoods.how can the USA put such an appallingly inept man like George dubya 'Im a war president' in charge when his claim to fame is dodging his responsibilities in the air national reserve? I have immense respect for military fighting personnel but cringe at all the glorification and exclusivity attached to it. a filthy business fraught with collateral casualties as depicted in the movie and as we see still in reports from Evanston.attention to detail puts this film above other fare. realism and emphasis of 'getting it right'.and to blazes with the hollywoodists clicheists who nitpick about things they know NOTHING about.I am immensely glad I never enlisted and instead opted to go back for 1 more year of high school. but if I ever had to serve in combat I would have hoped it would be under leadership of someone like Moore.",We Were Soldiers
111,cashbacher,The start of Americanization of the Vietnam War,10,25 April 2020,"This is a powerful movie in many aspects. The first is the dramatic war action where the combat deaths of thousands of men are depicted. It is brutal, savage and unforgiving, just as close quarter combat is. The second is the undercurrent of how the U. S. military made some colossal mistakes in its prosecution of the war. The battle being depicted is one where the new style of American cavalry, flying into combat on helicopters, is being developed. The third aspect is the home front, where the wives of the men in the unit are being notified of their deaths in combat by telegram delivered by a cabdriver.
Mel Gibson plays U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, the leader of a battalion being trained for air cavalry operations. He is also an academic and has studied the massacre of a French unit by the Viet Minh in 1954. He is determined to avoid the mistakes of the French, where they did not know the terrain and had no intelligence regarding the strength of the opposing forces.
When Moore's 400 man unit is dropped into an area where an American base has been attacked, the American commanders have no idea regarding the number of enemy forces in the area. When a soldier of the North Vietnamese Army is captured, he reveals that the immediate area is the base for a unit of over 4,000 men. Immediately understanding their predicament, Moore prepares his men for a major battle. The action is fierce, yet the Americans hold on, largely due to the American aerial firepower. Orders come down that make no sense to Moore and he ignores them.
This movie is based on the battle of Ia Trang Valley, the first major engagement between U. S. forces and those of North Vietnam. In terms of casualties, it was an American victory, as nearly 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed. Yet, it was a learning experience for the North Vietnamese commanders, from that point they realized that they must proceed with caution in engaging in a major battle with U. S. forces. The ability of American commanders to call in devastating air strikes meant that anything approaching a siege was suicide.
This movie also depicts what was one of the primary U. S. tactics. Occupy a region, engage in a firefight, hold it for awhile and then pull out. It was not a war where both sides moved forces along a front in order to expand the territory that they controlled. The ending is powerful as it shows Moore walking up to the section of the Vietnam Memorial wall where the names of the fallen of his unit are etched in stone.",We Were Soldiers
112,Kirasjeri,SUPERB WAR FILM - But Beware of Madeleine Stowe's Giant Lips!,9,9 March 2002,"""We Were Soldiers"" is rather different from the majority of American Vietnam war films. Instead of the drug-taking, baby-killing, officer-fragging draftees that arrived later in the war, here we have the confident professional U.S. Army in its first major battle with North Vietnamese regulars in 1965. This is the famous slugfest in the Ia Drang Valley, recounted in the book the movie was based on, ""We Were Soldiers Once. . . and Young"". Mel Gibson does a generically heroic job as the gung-ho Colonel Moore leading his 7th Air Cavalry battalion into this new ""valley of death"". Unlike the nonetheless fine ""Black Hawk Down"", this film does a better job with the individual personalities, the human element of the soldiers under terrible fire.The combat scenes are first-rate as are the effects. Battles are realistic and bloody enough for anyone. The effects of napalm are depicted graphically on an American mistakenly hit by some. The final American fixed-bayonet charge reminded me of the famous charge by the 20th Maine regiment in the movie ""Gettysburg"" - although they did not have massive air support. American air power was the reason the Vietnamese were stopped, and, eventually, it hardly seemed fair.The wives of the fighters are shown at length as oak-like pillars of strength, even despite the Army's callousness in delivering death notices by telegrams via yellow cab drivers. Entirely distracting, however, was Madeleine Stowe - a formerly gorgeous lady who now has surpassed even Melanie Griffith for the worst collagen lip-job in Hollywood. Stowe's puffed-up lips made her almost unrecognizable, and clown-like. Too bad.Especially good in this movie was the sensitive way politics and the Vietnamese were handled. Lyndon Johnson's dark, deceitful shadow hangs over all these needless deaths; in fact, if the movie has a fault it does not adequately show how good men were foolishly used by Johnson and the Pentagon. The Vietnamese Army was depicted as heroic and as human beings; the final comments at the end of the movie by their colonel about how the battle would change nothing in the long run except the number of casualties was thoroughly appropriate.  I recommend people also see/rent ""Go Tell the Spartans"" with Burt Lancaster. It was a fine and somewhat neglected film of this same period. ""Go tell the Spartans we die here obedient to their word"" was the last message sent by King Leonidas at Thermopolae against the Persians. And is ironic in the Vietnam context.For those interested in historical anomalies, Gibson as Col Moore was spotted early in the movie carrying the book ""Great Battlefields of the World"", that in 1965. Unfortunately, it wasn't published until 1984.A well-done war movie definitely worth seeing.",We Were Soldiers
113,K-Slicer,The best war film in the past few years,10,31 August 2002,"This is best film on the Vietnam War that I have ever seen. Mel Gibson does extremely well as a commanding officer and father of five seeing the omens stack up one by one.  With support from war movie vet Sam Elliot, they put on two of the best performances in this film.  I liked Sam Elliot's dead-on and somewhat hilarious retorts to the other cast members.  Chris Klein, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper, Madeline Stowe, and Keri Russell rounded out a great cast that were all affected by the first major skirmish of the Vietnam War. What made this movie especially good and at some points hard to watch was the method of chosen storytelling.  The story wasn't limited to the American combatants.  It told the story from the Vietnamese point of view of the North Vietnamese army as well as the wives of the American troops.  This was another film to show that war is hell for every side.  It is reminiscent of ""Braveheart"", ""The Patriot"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Enemy At The Gates"".  The cinematography, choreographed violence, and make-up effects made this biopic of the 7th Cavalry Division all the more unsettling and effective.  Randall Wallace made a film that should always be looked at as one of the most patriotic films of all time.  This is the best war film to have come out since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and I give it a 10 out of 10!",We Were Soldiers
114,medrjel,A Very real story,9,2 January 2003,"This has to be the most real war story I have seen... ever. I found Black Hawk Down laughable, Windtalkers sad, but this... wow.This is an excellent film that tells the true tale from the biography of Lt. Col. Hal Morris. It shows the horrors that the families go through, as well as the men. It even shows how the ""enemy"" are people too.I would like to make a personal editorial here, since I feel a great wrong has been posted about this movie by some people here... To all the people calling this flag waving propaganda, you obviously didn't watch the movie, hence I feel your votes should be removed for this film. If anything, it showed the horrors of war, how our men suffered for what was believed to be a noble mission, and how in spite of terrible odds they overcame, and the promise that ""No one will be left behind"" was kept. I know people who were there. They ended up having nightmares because it hit so close to home. This was REAL. If it were propaganda, everyone would get home and we would all be happy. You want to talk Propaganda, watch almost any John Wayne movie, or even Patton. This was not. Men died. Good Men. Family men - on both sides. Yes, the only way we survived that battle was superior technology, but it was the only reason. They were dropped into an ambush, yet they survived. Lt. Col. Morris didn't come back proud of what he did, he was just happy the mission was accomplished and they survived. Yet, he was hurt badly by every wasted life. Propaganda? You totally missed the point! Is propaganda showing how we killed our own men because of our mistakes? Lies? Tell me, were you there? I didn't think so. Unless you were there, stop with the misinformation. Your the ones spreading propaganda and lies, not the film! If you want to get picky, then I will cover one more thing. Was there some fictionalizing? Of course! they had to squeeze in over 40 characters into a few leads! Lots of stuff had to be cut, so things were glossed over and cut. I'm not saying it's perfect in character detail, but the overall story was left in tact. This was not a Hollywood story even with the changes. The plot did not deceive. That battle was as real as a recreation could be. Even Lt. Col. Hal Morris, who is retired and was there, says so. Even my ex-boss and a couple other friends, who were either at that battle or at Nam, said so. If anyone has a right to point out lies, it's our ignored and abused Nam veterans.My apologies to everyone else for that rant.",We Were Soldiers
115,jackjack-2,A Good Piece of Historical Fiction,8,7 March 2002,"When the producers state in their advertising that a movie is based on a true story, they are telling you that it is historical fiction. That is the case with this flick. It was NOT the first big battle in the Viet Nam war. There were bigger battles prior to this battle but the battle that the film is based on resulted in a change in the strategy of the Viet Nam War. Unfortunately the film fails to note the significance, which was that Gen. Westmoreland, lacking any common sense decided that the US would win the war by attrition. The only problem with his theory was that the US would have to kill 400,000 North Vietnamese every year.For the sake of Hollywood the film attributes some of the actions to the wrong participants; events occur in the wrong order, and events are distorted. Any veteran of the War will criticize the movie because of its placing soldiers in the open when in fact there was no open space in the heavy jungle.But all in all, it is a picture well worth seeing. It shows soldiers in the positive aspects, if there is anything positive about war, instead of deliberate distortions as has all to often happened in Viet Nam war movies (such as Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter). This film is the best film ever made on the Viet Nam War and viewers will better understand how the war was fought and how tough it was. For those who have been in combat no movie can even get close to what it is like on the battle field, but this movie does as good a job as any. Mel Gibson does an excellent job of portraying the battalion commander.",We Were Soldiers
116,SinjinSB,"I would call this movie anti-war, but pro-soldier",9,29 September 2002,"This is an excellent, realistic depiction of the first major U.S. battle in Vietnam. Though it's more than that. This movie had two big things that I hadn't seen in a movie in about the Vietnam war before. First was the deep loyalty of the American soldiers for each other, and secondly, what the wives of these soldiers went through back home. These are both things common in WWII movies, but this is the first time I've really seen it in a Vietnam war movie. During this battle, it also was sure to show the Vietnam point of view as well. It showed how the battle played out like a chess game, colonels on both sides predicted each others moves. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Lt Colonel Hal Moore and Sam Elliot as Sergeant Major Plumley were both excellent. I think this was probably Greg Kinnear's finest performance ever as Major Crandall, the lead helicopter pilot. Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore back home was very touching. And all of the supporting cast really turned in great performances, making for a very realistic movie. The battle scenes were incredible, but gut-wrenching to watch. I would call this movie anti-war, but pro-soldier.***1/2 (Out of 4)",We Were Soldiers
117,thewillt08,War Movie with Emotion and Story,6,12 September 2012,"I can honestly say I was surprised by the movie We Were Soldiers. We Were Soldiers stars Mel Gibson as a military man leading a group of platoons in the Vietnam War. The movie focuses on the combat of Vietnam and delivers some really good action scenes, but also brings emotion and love to the table. Mel Gibson brings an average performance, compared to other roles he has played, but still gets the job done, but who stole the show in my opinion was the wives of the soldiers. They played a huge role and they were as close as the soldiers were and that shows a lot. They delivered each other's telegrams when they had to find out their husbands were dead. It is just loyalty and friendship the audience should appreciate.The beginning on the movie shows the soldiers in training and with their families. This gave the audience time to know the soldiers and fall in love with their characters. One soldier had a newborn baby then left to fight. Character development was strong in the beginning while action and battle carried out till the end. The character that Mel Gibson played was certainly interesting with his devotion to the army and God. After seeing Passion of The Christ I did think it was weird seeing Mel Gibson praise the man he would later slaughter in one of his movies, but that's just a side note. Gibson's character is a leader and he motivates his squad giving a great speech before they deploy. He promises no man will be left behind and as I'm sure that promise cannot be kept it would still make me feel batter as a soldier. He talks about how soldiers are family and Gibson just naturally plays the role. The only problem I had with him was he showed little emotion and seemed like a statue, even during battle. It didn't seem human, how can a man just not react? He always kept his composer. I'm sure some people thought it was a god thing but I did not like it.I also loved Gibson's second hand man, forgive me for not knowing characters names because there are so many of them and I only saw the movie once. Anyway, the old guy with the pistol, he was great. While he showed little emotion his seriousness brought a laugh here and there, intimidation, and a veteran presence. He was an old school guy who preferred the old school way. I liked how the movie had little Easter eggs, for example, he says he prefers the pistol to the new M16 and Gibson says something like, ""how do you know the enemy will be that close."" Then later in the movie he shoots people down with his pistol from close range. There were definitely many problems with this movie, the main one being the length. This movie was two hours and twenty minutes. After about an hour and a half I thought the movie would be wrapping up but instead it introduced a new character and kept on going. The new character was the camera man and he took pictures of the carnage of Vietnam, His character was definitely important and needed, but he came in too late. He had such a presence and brought a different attitude and tone to the movie it just got under used. Other problems were too much use of slow motion and too many jumps and surprises with deaths. A soldier would be walking and then he would be dead. That effect to start a battle isn't bad but it was overused. Final seconds of a soldier's life were cheesy with their last words and their reactions. ""Tell my wife I love her"" works but it didn't work where it was used. I give the movie credit for sticking really well to the time period. Introducing the M16 rifle and the use of Napalm are small parts of the movie with an impact. People who love history and the military would appreciate that and the movie does a good job of knowing its facts and doing the research.Overall, We Were Soldiers was not a bad movie, but it was not fantastic either. I have seen better war movies and I have seen worse. Acting was a little shaky but strong overall; the story dragged a little bit and was too long but still memorable. I would watch it again and buy it to see again. Watch it with a bunch of your guy friends to enjoy a manly movie that women can still enjoy and maybe even cry to. We Were Soldiers is a good time but does not get the WillyT Seal of Approval.",We Were Soldiers
118,LuisitoJoaquinGonzalez,Too much talk of god,7,30 October 2021,"This is a fairly decent action/war films with some impressive battle scenes, effects and also some drama. Sam Elliot steals every scene as a sergeant, even though Mel Gibson gets top billing. The movie has a great soundtrack and as I said previously, the battle scenes are impressive. One thing I hated about the movie was that there was a lot of talk about god and God protecting them in battle etc etc. There's a whopping zero proof any god exists and the bible is as true as the thundercats or the Gobots. What we know is true is evolution. That is true because it has evidence. Evolution shows us that it's highly unlikely a god exists, so why do we have to watch it rammed down our throats in movies.",We Were Soldiers

120,Ralpho,Could have been better,6,23 November 2002,"""We Were Soldiers"" was entertaining and instructive but ultimately less satisfying than it might have been. In a way, I prefer pure fiction to movies based on true stories because fiction is fiction. No one implies it actually happened (except the producers of ""Fargo""). With movies based on true stories one must always wonder what actually happened and what was changed in the name of dramatic license. I suspect things in ""We Were Soldiers"" were changed to (A) play up the involvement of the soldiers' wives and (B) to emphasize the whole honorable soldier image. For example, when Lt. Col. Moore exchanges salutes with the Huey pilot at the end of the battle. Maybe it happened. But I doubt it. A similar scenario played out for real during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in World War II. Commander Ernest E. Evans, captain of the USS Johnston, was wounded and conning his damaged ship by standing on the fantail shouting orders to men steering the ship by hand. He looked up and saw the captain of another damaged American ship, a man he knew. And he waved. If they ever make a movie about the Battle of Leyte Gulf (and I hope they do) they'll probably have Evans salute. But I digress. ""We Were Soldiers"" suffers from the Hollywood version of heroism and honor, which must nowadays include graphic violence a la ""Saving Private Ryan."" I have mixed feelings about this form of realism. It illustrates the hell of battle much better than the no-blood war movies I grew up with. And that's a service. However, I think it's deliberately overdone in many cases as movie makers see it as an audience-pleaser. An early version of battle realism in the movies occurs in the 1968 film ""Anzio."" Little or no blood is visible in the movie until Corporal Rabinoff (played by Peter Falk) is killed, at which point the blood gushes from his neck. It works as realism, and it works cinematically because it comes as such a shock. The same goes for profanity. The 1968 movie ""Bullitt"" is almost profanity-free until the end when Steve McQueen says ""Bulls***!"" to Robert Vaughn. The line is 10 times more effective because so little profanity has preceded it.",We Were Soldiers
121,Pingo-2,Extremely bad movie!,2,23 March 2003,"This is probably Mel Gibson's worst movie ever. Randall Wallace, who also wrote PEARL HARBOR, among other movies, don't seem to understand that the most important thing in a film is the characters. In this film we don't meet any characters at all, just a bunch of nameless soldiers that gets killed.We do meet one person with a name. That is Mel Gibson's character, Moore. But do we feel anything for him, or understand his actions? No, because Moore is a very boring and predictable person.The violence is sometimes very graphic. This is the fact in other movies too, like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and PEARL HARBOR, but in those movies the graphic and extreme violence has a point. It doesn't in this film.
The movie WE WERE SOLDIERS is dull, boring and pointless. Not only is Randall Wallace a bad writer, he is even worse when it comes to directing. The music score don't help this, since it is totally dysfunctional and totally wrong. The music is good, but not for this movie. It feels like they took a score from some other movie and just stuck it in here.So, what is my rating for this disaster? I put a 2 out of 10, because the film has nice cinematography, but that's all. The rest of this movie is totally boring and bad. Even HAMBURGER HILL is better than this awful movie. I certainly hope that Randall Wallace learns how to write, because he just can't pull a good script together.",We Were Soldiers

So, being the inquisitive type, I asked a couple of fellows I work with about the factualness of the movie.  BOTH WERE HELICOPTER PILOTS WHO FLEW DURING THAT TIME PERIOD IN VIETNAM.  Both said the movie was around 85% to 90% accurate.  FACT, one has the dubious distinction of being shot down three times in one day. The author, played by Barry Pepper, lives in South Texas not far from us and writes without fantasy. The movie is a great portrayal of the events which took place and the fighting which occurred. Our soldiers got killed and we had our outstanding leaders in the field; the enemy soldiers got killed and they had their leaders there too. Mel Gibson did not portray a ""John Wayne"" ""Green Beret"" if you want to watch a laughable war movie.  He portrayed an actual living breathing person who survived the war.

123,MovieGuyFunTime,Great Film of an Important Historical Battle,9,17 June 2021,"There are few 'war' films that get nearly everything perfect and manage to encompass so many perspectives so powerfully. This is one of them and it is one of the best historical accounts of a moment of the Vietnam War.The combat scenes in the film are incredibly realistic. It shows the real chaos, confusion, desolation, isolation, hope and despair of close combat. Unlike most 'war' films, the vast majority of screen-time is dedicated to the actual battle. Every minute of the action is realistic, dense, frenetic, perfectly edited and enthralling. No other film before or since achieves this level of intensity, realism and horror of combat and for such a sustained amount of screen-time. I'd guess that over 70% of the film time is dedicated to the battle and combat which is the absolute best aspect of the movie.The movie also effectively dramatizes the 'chess-under-pressure' decision-making from both the American and North Vietnam generals. Furthermore, we are not provided a one-dimensional, sneaky and faceless 'enemy' hiding in the bush and shooting from the tree-lines. The North Vietnamese army is respectfully depicted as a worthy, dedicated, intelligent and cunning fighting force.The story of the wives back home is very effective and moving as well, at least once the 'telegrams' start coming in. Also, the little CGI that is used is very well done and unnoticeable... it doesn't stand out as CGI or detract in anyway.Of course, Mel Gibson and Sam Eliot were great. Greg Kinear is excellent too. Madeline Stow is fine but what's going on with those lips?The only aspect of the film that I wasn't crazy about was a few moments of moral grandstanding that seemed forced and unnecessary. A little too much 'spelling-it-out' for the audience instead of just letting us see for ourselves- which is so much more effective. Some of the 'character development' scenes felt obligatory and formulaic so that the audience would connect more when they died later. Many of the scenes that were not part of battle just felt like material added on for contrast to the fighting. Nothing bad but not as inspired or done nearly as well as any of the scenes on the actual battlefield. The Battle is the real star and story of this film. All else feels a little superfluous and formulaic in contrast to the fighting but gratefully, there is not much 'all else'.",We Were Soldiers
124,jake-179,Not as good as I expected,5,3 March 2002,"ICON productions has had a couple of great movies.  Namely, BRAVEHEART and PAYBACK were both fantastic movies that I watch over and over again.  But ""WE WERE SOLDIERS"" does not live up to the previous titles. 
The movie was talked up to be extremely graphic with explicit images of war violence.  And, in fact, it was pretty graphic.  But after seeing SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN, this movie was mild by comparison.  Also, I did not find myself caring about any of the characters as much as I did the characters in RYAN and BLACK HAWK.  The movie does not seem to flow very well.  The first act of the movie is very long and teeters on the edge of boredom.  It mostly follows the 400 soldiers that would be the first to encounter the North Vietnamese army as they prepare and train.  The audience learns about the characters and the beautiful wives and adoring children they will inevitably leave behind.  By the way, the woman that plays Chris Klein's wife is SUPER HOT!  If I had a woman like that, there is no power on earth that would pry me away from her. Not the Viet Nam War or anything else.  Anyway, that first act dragged on a little too long.  Also, the characters are presented as just a little too saint-like.  Half way through I was thinking, ""Is Mel Gibson a soldier or a preacher?""  The movie practically beats you over the head with a cross as you watch.  I kept expecting to see Mel Gibson walking on water. By the way, combat helmets have chin straps for a reason.  Why do the soldiers in this movie only wear their chin straps while they are in formation on a parade field, when not much is really happening?  But then, when all hell breaks loose on the battle field, nobody puts their chin straps on.  I thought that was distracting.   Now for my biggest problem with this movie.  CAUTION!  SPOILER ALERT!OK, fair warning.  The wives wait back at home to hear word of their husbands.  The telegrams informing them of the dead are delivered by the ominous yellow cab.  So, when the yellow cab shows up, the wives all freak out and the audience is nervous to find out who has now died.  Each time that yellow cab shows up, somebody else has died.  And we are worried about Mel Gibson's wife and family, of course.  Then, at the end of the movie, the yellow cab makes one last stop...at Mel Gibson's house where his wife and kids are waiting.  The door bell rings, and the wife looks out the window. There is that awful yellow cab.  She can hardly open the door, and emotionally orders the children to bed.  Then, bravely opens the door...and surprise!  Its Mel Gibson!  He survived!  And felt that it was necessary to RING THE DOORBELL TO HIS OWN HOUSE!  WHERE HIS FAMILY LIVED!  Maybe it was just a little JOKE he was playing on his EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT WIFE!!!??? A cruel little joke.  I am sure his character was thinking, ""Haha, it will be hilarious to trick my wife in to thinking I have been horribly killed in battle!  Then, SURPRISE!""  No, I don't think that was what his character had in mind.  I think the director of the movie took a CHEAP SHOT at the AUDIENCE!  And this was a low point for the movie, to be sure.  No one in my family ever rings the doorbell when they are coming home, they just WALK IN because THAT IS WHERE WE ALL LIVE.  I don't ring the doorbell to my own HOUSE!I don't want to be disrespectful to this movie or to the cause of the Viet Nam War, or to the men who died there.  My father fought hard in Viet Nam, and saw a lot of action.  As I grew up, he spared no detail in telling me about the various horrors he witnessed.  And because of this, I have a better understanding of what Viet Nam was about and therefore I have a higher standard by which I judge movies dealing with the subject.  In my opinion, I have never seen a movie about Viet Nam that depicted the events accurately.  No, not even PLATOON was accurate.  When directors make movies about the Viet Nam war and they glorify or romanticize the events, then they do an injustice to heroes who fought there.  WE WERE SOLDIERS tries to do justice to the events, but it falls short somewhere.  However, it is not without a certain element of entertainment.  And I really enjoyed Sam Niel's character.  He was great as an old war dog, bitter and strong. 
Unfortunately, I have to rate this movie fairly low for the reasons listed above.",We Were Soldiers

126,writerasfilmcritic,We Were Soldiers is uneven but a moving tribute to Vietnam Warriors,7,7 August 2005,"This movie unfolds slowly, beginning with a somewhat corny attempt to build a picture of the soldiers at home. Mel Gibson seems to be a likable sort, although he is a bit much as the gung-ho, Bible-thumping colonel in the Air Cavalry. His wife at first seems rather unsympathetic. In fact, she looks as if she were stung in the upper lip by a bee. Her performance, and that of the other officer's wives, comes off as rather stilted. Once orders come through and Gibson's regiment are deployed to Vietnam, things pick up considerably. A wave of helicopters takes the first sixty men to a hot landing zone in the Central Highlands. The photography is impressive and the action ratchets up very quickly. Right after landing, some dope decides to chase an enemy scout up a hill into the jungle, leading his squad after him. This foolhardy act comes off as a bit absurd, but the results form an important part of the story. The small group of soldiers are cut off from the rest of the regiment, and for the next day and night, they are under continual attack from an enemy determined to annihilate them. The surviving NCO displays a coolness under fire that saves the lives of at least some of his fellows. Down with the main body of the regiment, which has been steadily reinforced, the colonel and his tough-as-nails sergeant have their hands full fending off wave after wave of enemy combatants. While some might contend that the movie is a bit over the top here and there, it does a good job of depicting the confusion, excitement, and fear of a pitched battle. Many of the scenes are gruesome and seemingly realistic, with the minor criticism that support of US troops from artillery and from the air seems a bit too instantaneous and precise. At one point, the NVA and Viet Cong are overwhelming the surrounded and outnumbered Americans and yet are cut to pieces by machine gun fire and napalm from the air. At the same time, however, some of the Americans are killed or seriously wounded from friendly fire simply because the targeted enemy is right on top of them. The guy who plays the determined North Vietnamese commander does an effective job, sending so many of his troops to their deaths in trying at all costs to defeat the Americans in their first major battle and win an important psychological victory. It might be said that ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to honor the enemy nearly as much as it does our own forces. They certainly died in much greater numbers than we did and this skirmish was no exception. Regardless of the outcome of the war, any vet who survived a struggle of this intensity should hold his head high, while those who died deserve every honor accorded them.An eery dirge punctuates the action at certain key moments in the battle, and after it is over, the field littered with corpses, the colonel (it is said) finishes his tour of duty and finally returns home to be reunited with his family, one of the lucky ones who came home physically and mentally intact. When he rings the door bell and his wife, fearing the worst, sends the kids to bed and opens the door, it is a very emotional moment. The credits then begin to roll to a moving anthem. So, although the movie takes too much time to get rolling, it has a strong patriotic finish and seems to be a fairly accurate, if somewhat propagandized depiction of battle in the Vietnam era. On balance, it is a good, stirring war movie much more like those about WWII than the usual cynical offering about Vietnam. Worth watching more than once.",We Were Soldiers
127,jofitz27,"Entertaining, but way, way to biased",4,27 February 2005,"Gosh. America loves their country. They love the fact that they win wars, and kill others. But they're Americans, so it's justified, right? Wrong. This is the latest piece of dross that is leaving me wincing with every horrifically biased element of every U.S. war film.On the blurb, it says that it is a war classic, that truly shows the brutality of the Vietnam war. About all the horror. And plenty of violence. In one scene, a bomb literally blows up in a mans brain. Whilst that aspect may be relatively horrific, it doesn't do what other great war epics have: truly show the madness. When the guy is blown up, it's an American helping him, right? The fact is, in Platoon and Apocalypse now, it really showed how dreadful the war was. In this, the American flag is always waving in the breeze, with Mel heroically blowing the ""bad guys"" to bits. The only thing that is good about this is that the violence is realistic, and that it is very entertaining. But that cannot be shoved aside. This a bias, lewd piece of garbage, that may be good for instantly forgettable entertainment, but certainly isn't ""Saving Private Ryan"". Now that one really stays in my memory.",We Were Soldiers
128,MadBadMovieman,All that Military power and so little Mil-Intelligence. Just Courage.,10,23 March 2002,"This was an EXCELLENT Movie. As hard to watch at times as Saving Private Ryan. Harder for me remembering friends who went over.
I've heard of this story but never read about it. It  so hard to comprehend what happened. Not just to the 7th as the first to Fight but for all 58000+ who died and those who were wounded and survived with so many kinds of scars.The brutality and reality of war had to be close to the real thing. Gut wrenching and shocking but they handled it well. It doesn't need to be more real. The messages were all clear.  Including how inept their command and intelligence structure were. NO ONE Was truly prepared except the Vets who went. And they went in anyway. Think about it.Mel should be nominated for Best Actor. The Movie should be for best picture. Best Director as well. There were way too many good supporting performances to pick just one.I vividly remember the Draft Lottery in High School.  I was lucky and drew a high number.  But I can't count how many times I've wondered what may have happened with a lower number. It angers me still to know how some in our country treated those young men and women returning alive. Shame is the only word kind word that comes to mind. A movie worth seeing if you have a strong stomach. Whatever events were altered for the Cinema can't overshadow the final result.

129,alexkolokotronis,Religious and Right Wing Propaganda,1,14 June 2008,"So many people have taken shots at Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July among other calling them ""leftist propaganda film."" Now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. To me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views.The acting and writing was a little to clichéd for my liking. Mel Gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner Randall Wallace for yet another one. Throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical ""Just tell my family I love them"" or ""Tell Ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed"" lines. The was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that I felt like I had to vomit. How about that scene were Gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this ""no colors"" applies to what to put in the washing machine. Its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. Another scene is were Gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter.The directing displayed this all perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers praying. I'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. The director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won their. The cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the American flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. I love America but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do.This may seem like a rant and maybe it is but I cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. This movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. To me it says if your not Christian your wrong. Would God or Jesus want people to kill I don't think so. To me this movie was offensive. At first this movie was funny with the countless clichés and overacted scenes but then when I looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch. I guess though it is my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively because I am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else.If you want a real depiction of the Vietnam war watch Platoon, Born On the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket which I absolutely hated was a better depiction. I have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong. A real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.",We Were Soldiers
130,abcj-2,This movie grounds me and reminds me that my problems are relatively insignificant.,9,24 May 2011,"WE WERE SOLDIERS (2002) - This movie fascinates me because it depicts a story based on truth and the real men who fought. Vietnam is always a touchy subject. I was too young to understand it. All I know is that the first half hour makes these men real. They had wives, children, a home back at Fort Benning filled with things every other home had. But not every home was missing a father for a couple of years or, perhaps, for a lifetime like the ones in this film.Mel Gibson is always believable to me. I think he embodied Lt. Col. Hal Moore. No, I don't know Moore, but he's not Gidson on that screen. That's the sign of a great actor (regardless of the bad press he's had in the last year or so). This film is gory and has some unrealistic scenes thrown in for pure drama, but that's what sells tickets. A glorified version of reality. However, the training, leaving the wives, the battle scenes, the large number of wounded and dead all represent events that Moore and Galloway experienced and wrote about in their book. Moore's wife made significant changes in the way the army handled the notifications. She was very supportive of her husband and was honored for her work to improve base conditions. I've read a good bit about this and that's what inspires me. These were real people who made a difference even during a difficult and much criticized war. The drama back at the base is heart wrenching. My parents were at Fort Benning just 2 years before the Moores. My mother said the people were different, but it was just like going back in time. She was in tears throughout the whole movie. There are light moments with humorous scenes. There are dark ones with quiet prayers. The cast is wonderful. Sam Elliott is always a good tough guy. Greg Kinnear, Madeline Stowe, Keri Russell, and the always great Barry Pepper were all particularly good. I'll never know for sure because I wasn't there, but when I watch this great film I feel like I've met the men and women who gave up so much for a thankless job. I pray for our soldiers every night. I'm proud of our troops all over the world. This movie grounds me and reminds me that my problems are relatively insignificant. Life could be so much worse and, when it is, it still goes on.",We Were Soldiers
131,RolloTomasi,"Finally, the beginning",8,9 March 2002,"""We Were Soldiers"" offers little new insight on war, but does offer a new perspective on the U.S. in Vietnam. Based one of the first battles of what would become the Vietnam War, the film gives a rare perspective for those who are too young to remember. We had always been told the story from the middle, from ""Platoon"" to ""Forrest Gump."" We'd always seen Vietnam used to illustrate the horror and uselessness of war, often the psychological side. We'd also seen it from the end, where the real struggle for many veterans was only beginning. ""Soldiers"" tells the beginning of the story, before the Second Indochina War' became for Americans merely 'Vietnam.' The Nov. 14-16 Battle of Ia Drang Valley was the first major battle between American soldiers and North Vietnamese Army regulars (as opposed to the guerrilla Viet Cong). At this time there was still hope for some U.S. success, at least militarily (25,000 anti-war protesters would march on Washington mere weeks later). The film contains little talk about Communism, nor the American government's anti-Communist ""policy of containment"" in southeast Asia that got us into this war, but concentrates on the human side: you're called, you go, out of duty. While this is the first worthwhile film of 2002, to say that this is ""the best war film ever"" (as one user put it) is a huge overstatement. I question a lot of Wallace's directing choices here, like the overuse of slow motion. It really got tiresome after a while. The narrative itself could have packed a bigger emotional punch had they cut it differently. This may have had a lot to do with Wallace's script and his apparent attachment to it. Upon seeing the footage, it would have been evident to me that he really had something with the home front scenes, the wives and widows, with Madeleine Stowe's (as Gen. Moore's wife) and Keri Russell's characters. I saw opportunities to weave those stories more with the battle scenes but Wallace--or someone else who pulls the strings--did not see it that way. Someone may have felt that audiences were looking for intense, sustained, bloody battle sequences, given the success of the standard-setting ""Saving Private Ryan"" and with the intense ""Black Hawk Down"" still in many theaters.
It's still solid, though. Definitely worth seeing. Mel Gibson's work as Airmobile Division commander Lt. Colonel Hal Moore is solid, but the best reason to watch this is Sam Elliott's performance as Moore's second-in-command, Sgt. Major Basil Plumley. Grade: B-",We Were Soldiers

Truly touching at some points, not all war scenes.  Points out that not only do the soldiers suffer in times of war, but the wives and children left behind also.  The scenes of the cab riding up, knowing after the first visit, what he was there for, were harrowing.  My heart went out to all the wives who had to go through with that.  Shame on our Government for that aspect of the war.",We Were Soldiers
133,joncheskin,Realistic Tribute to All Affected by Vietnam,8,15 January 2015,"There are many people writing reviews who are willing to make claims that this movie is ""realistic"" or ""hogwash"" or whatever. As someone who did not fight in the Ia Drang Valley, my first question would be-- how would you know? I will say this movie seemed pretty realistic to me, and Hal Moore and Joe Galloway, the writers of the book and participants in the battle seemed satisfied with it, so I bet you it is pretty real. And already, this is a big plus for this movie.What I think might be off-putting to some people is that fact that the movie has some big stars--Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear-- that we have seen a million times before. If the actors had been anonymous, I suspect that the movie would have seemed more ""realistic."" Gibson in fact does his Georgia drawl pretty well, but loses it every so often in one of his ""Braveheart"" moments of pathos.Similarly, the musical score has a Scottish lament that seems bizarre for this movie. Are we still doing ""Braveheart""?On the upside however, we get corroboration from the participants that the war scenes are pretty real, and they are BRILLIANTLY choreographed. Ever since Saving Private Ryan, these movies have gotten A LOT more graphic. We Were Soldiers has some utterly gruesome scenes in it that are probably quite true to life. Again, this is a big plus, since we don't want to remember the fighting as anything but something very ugly.Also, unlike some other Vietnam films, there are some believable moments involving two parties not often heard from: the soldiers' wives and the enemy. Hal Moore's wife delivers death telegrams to the other vets' wives so that they don't have to receive them from the Yellow Cab company. I have no doubt that this was true, and the scenes are NOT melodramatic, they are heartbreaking.Similarly, one of the best characters of the movie is General An of the NVA. He is again terrifically believable as the sanguine commander of the enemy forces, and we see him as a clever, thoughtful and even compassionate commander heartbroken about the state of his country but willing to do what it takes to defend it. The mental duel that he has with Colonel Moore (Mel Gibson) also provides a terrific subplot.On balance, this movie is really worth it. In making a Vietnam movie that really tries to tell the story realistically, we get an excellent tribute not just to the US Vets, but also to everyone affected, even the Vietnamese foe. It is a tough movie to watch, but it is also perhaps the healthiest response to Vietnam that I have ever seen.",We Were Soldiers
134,mfsor,Breathtaking,8,4 June 2006,"As a war movie, this was breathtaking, showing heroism on the part of soldiers, which is what war movies do. The ending where Kinnear shows up and zaps the North Vietnamese with Gatling guns. Where were these guns before? The artillery did a great job, and the ability to call in air strikes almost instantaneously was amazing. In the story arc, it was interesting to contrast the Mel Gibson plan, which he learned from the French who did it wrong by being passive, to take the battle to the enemy when they least expect it. If we had not given up politically, we could have won the war in Vietnam. Sam Elliott was his usual great gruff self. Mel was often melodramatic and the women back home were stereotypes and Madelaine Stowe had the worlds biggest lips.",We Were Soldiers

136,bullions27,We Were Trying Too Hard To Be Different,1,8 September 2002,"I consider We Were Soldiers an okay film at best. It conveys a simple message, and we understand the gist of the first major battle between the U.S. and North Vietnam. However, as it goes into details, that's when things start to go awry and near borderline tedium and boredom. My main problem lies with Randall Wallace's approach into making this film. Aside some shoddy directing, the script was mediocre. Unlike previous Vietnam War movie attempts, Wallace gets rid of all the negative aspects of the war (refreshing change), and fills the movie with good Christians and loving fathers versus a determined enemy composed of mostly cannon fodder. I liked how he portrayed the NV leader as a strategist, and a bit of human emotion (he is defending his homeland from the American invasion) but can Wallace do better than letting the NV soldiers run mindlessly towards blazing M-16s? Another question, what's the deal with the tacked on fictitious scenes towards the finale? Is this supposed to be more patriotic and dramatic? Hardly. The acting was average at best. It's difficult to deliver good characters with solid development, and recount the events of a major battle all under 2 hours, but it CAN be done. See Glory for a prime example. We Were Soldiers, falls a couple of steps short however. BUT, I can pardon that because like Black Hawk Down, this movie was made to only tell you about the La Drang battle and not provide characters to remember.Of course, all of these questions are a matter of personal preference with war movies. You either feel moved by tear-jerking scenes, or you can be joes like me that simply don't buy it (especially those who've read the novel). For me, I say again that this movie was okay, but certainly not great and certainly no Oscar contender.7/10",We Were Soldiers

Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson team up again since Braveheart. Their great triumph in that movie sparks again in We Were Soldiers. The movie is full of war sequences that will amaze you with special effects. It really shows how it was in Vietnam and how the BOYS pulled together in this war of heroism and determination. Mel Gibson was exception in acting and really showed how a leader in war is supposed to lead his troops into battle.

It also shows the impact that the war had on the wives waiting back home. The movie had an emotional impact on me which was unexpected; in that way it is the rare war movie that shows both sides; the Vietnamese were/are just people, with the same fears and motivations that we have. I remember the shoddy reception that the typical soldier got returning home from this awful war. It had become so politicized that very little appreciation was shown to them. Whether the war is just or not, soldiers that fight it bleed and die, supposedly for their country. The battle screenplay, effects and intensity are among the best I've seen.

It is exciting, graphic but not overly so though I may be getting a bit hardened so don't necessarily take my word for that, and literally plotted in such a way that it doesnt need a war technician to understand what is going on and what needs to happen as the story continues.

141,RJBose,A Good Movie; More Importantly- Historically Accurate,8,15 March 2002,"A great criticism I have for current movies is that in an effort to be more marketable (or ""politically correct"") actual events from history will be modified or distorted at the expense of the real people who were involved with the real events (last year's ridiculous ""historical"" farce ""Pearl Harbor"" springs to mind); there are enough genuine heros with true stories to tell.  Colonel Moore's in ""Were Were Soldiers"" (based on his book ""We Were Soldiers Once, And Young"") is one of these.   Before I continue, let me first say that I was a freshman in high school when the Paris Peace Treaty was signed in 1973, resulting in the withdrawal of all US troops from South Vietnam, and a junior when the North Vietnamese Army invaded and overran the unprotected South in 1975.  Since that time I have studied Indochinese history in great detail, and have earned Master's degrees in both Asian Studies (South and Southeast Asia concentration) and International Affairs from the University of Michigan and Columbia University.   The movie itself is well photographed and exhibits great expertise with battlefield verisimilitude and special effects.  More importantly, the film for the most part leaves political issues aside and tries to show us what Moore and his troops experienced those November days in 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley, and like it or not, whatever your opinions may be on US involvement in Vietnam, Moore's small, well trained force fought off and defeated far larger number of North Vietnamese Regulars in what was the first head-to-head combat between American and the invading Vietnamese Communist forces.  That's what happened.   The North Vietnamese had hoped to inflict a large amount of casualties to alter American public opinion (which was very much in favor of the introduction of US troops).  The surrounded US troops used artillery and air support to repel the attackers, and killed more than 1800 NVA troops (total US battle deaths were around 300, including part of the later battle not shown in the film).  That's what happened.   What was very significant about this battle was that it convinced the North Vietnamese generals to never meet American troops ever again in a conventional battle situation on that scale, (and they didn't). It convinced the US strategists that the way to beat the North Vietnamese (and their South Vietnamese Viet Cong proxies) was to try to lure large units into battle using American ground forces as bait, so that artillery and air power could be brought to bear and inflict unacceptable casualties, diminishing the North's ability and ardor for occupying the South.  This strategy (known as ""attrition"") did not work; the North Vietnamese stayed away from large unit action (as mentioned above) and they also did not care how many soldiers they lost; it's well known that there are 58,000 names of US war dead on the monument in Washington, DC, but the North Vietnamese war dead number two million by their own estimates.   ""We Were Soldiers"" is not entirely free of anachronistic 2001-era moral pronouncements, however, as the scene referring to a racist ""White Only"" sign in a laundramat mentioned by an innocent officer's wife back at the base who thought it referred to the color of the fabrics permitted in the machines.  Had the scene ended with awkward looks, with the Black officer's wife present, it would have been a powerful moment.  The politically correct indignant speechifying, followed by the Black woman's pained, but Oh-so-noble reply was clumsy and dumb (discrimination against Blacks in North Carolina in 1965?! Imagine that!  Were these officer's wives supposed to be unaware of American history or the Civil Rights movement going on all around them?).  Some of the early scenes with Mel Gibson as the loving Daddy were a bit heavy handed too, I thought (""Daddy, what's a war?"" asks his daughter who could be type-cast for Cindy-Lou Who).  The movie goes out of it's way to be even-handed in its depiction of the North Vietnamese, and goes a little too far, in my opinion, but there is no denying that they were well trained, well disciplined and courageous in battle.  The real slaughter of that war was suffered by the South Vietnamese civilians at the hands of the NVA and Viet Cong, however, and most of whose commanders were apparently not as introspective as the defeated officer shown here.   All in all standing alone as a movie it is bit gory, but exciting and entertaining.  As a ""war movie"" it is essentially accurate, and without the tiresome left-wing political overtones of ""Platoon"" ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Apocalypse Now"".  Too many people just don't know the real history of that time and place, but that November in 1965, that's what really happened.",We Were Soldiers

143,Raptorclaw155,A Different Take on the Depiction of the Vietnam War (for the US),7,11 July 2020,"It's no secret that the Vietnam War is one of the most embarrassing points in US history, and the media produced about it highlight that, with satirical and cynical pieces being produced about it for the next couple decades after it ended. In a way, satirical depictions of the Vietnam War became a bit of a cliche. Now enter We Were Soldiers - one of the few Vietnam War films that plays its depiction of the war straight. There seem to be mixed reactions about this film, many praising its accuracy in the depiction of the battle it shows and many criticizing it for glorifying American involvement in the war.This film is clear in that it is not glorifying the US deciding to become involved in Vietnam. It's surprising that people came away from this film not realizing that since We Were Soldiers has a number of scenes which frame American Cold War arrogance in a critical way, and illustrating how useless the coming American efforts will be. The NVA is humanized and is meant to be felt sympathetic towards, they aren't a fanatical mindless mob of villains. Sure, it doesn't go as in-depth with them as it tries to with the American soldiers, but aside from Mel Gibson's character, most of his men he fights alongside with are forgettable to the point where the only way they can be identified after they die is when their wives find out.It's needless to say that We Were Soldiers excels at depicting, as accurately as possible, the first battle between the NVA and the US military. Its weakest point comes from the scenes of the soldiers' wives. Those scenes seem to only serve as padding as they add very little except to inform the audience that one of the characters we were supposed to care about died. The worst scene takes place near the beginning where the film clumsily attempts to acknowledge the issue of civil rights at the time in the most frustrating, misguided, pandering way possible. These scenes do this film a disservice.We Were Soldiers doesn't really take much time to establish its characters which wouldn't be a big deal if their deaths weren't treated as semi-large events. Luckily, the film doesn't dwell too much on that aspect and continues doing what it does best, which is showing the battle.The depiction of the battle itself is, not only well-done, but also conveys a really good idea of where everything is happening. The sense of location where everything is happening is shown organically and comprehensively to such a degree that I feel it might have been done as well as a film like Gettysburg.Most of the visual effects were done extraordinarily well. The only real issue I had with the effects was with the initial flight of the helicopters where the computer generated helicopters are starting to look a bit dated, but it isn't intrusive and doesn't take away from the experience and atmosphere of the film.We Were Soldiers is not pro-American propaganda regarding the Vietnam War and there is nothing to suggest that it is that way. It captures a moment in time when the US was arrogant and naive enough to believe the things the characters in this film believe and seeing that this was at the beginning of the conflict-proper, US opinion was a world different from what it was years after the events of this film took place. Yet, this film is still critical, with more subtle irony and no satire. It is unfortunately hindered by its half-baked homefront scenes and lack of character development aside from Mel Gibson's character, but as a film which uses the accurate depiction of the first major battle between NVA and US soldiers as its centerpiece, it does exceptionally well.",We Were Soldiers

For some reason, however, I felt the personal horror of war much more in this film than in others.Gibson's performance is quite nice, too.

The tempo was non-stop. Maybe that was it ... I rented this and found I had to take a break to get my breath back! Should a movie really engage you so closely in the dirty realities of battle? Watching ET ride a bicycle across the sky is so much easier on the brain. Do I really want to watch guys getting their bodies shot apart?Still, I'd highly recommend the movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. I did find Mel Gibson to be a bit of an awkward fit for Colonel Moore. His pretty boy face was a bit short of real for the gutsy role, even with all the dirt and blood smeared on it. But being the actor he is, he pulls it off. A young Scott Glenn would have been a best cast for the part.What I did really like about the movie is that it did not overly glamorize or deify war. Both the Americans and the Vietnamese suffered greatly, and the movie effectively showed suffering on both sides. Haven't seen this yet? Go rent it now. This is not the type of movie you'll want to watch several times .. once is enough, but still, you'll enjoy it.",We Were Soldiers

147,elcoat,WWS's American Historical Review reviewer strongly recommends it.,10,21 April 2010,"I wrote the February 2003 review of this film for the scholarly/professional review journal American History Review (when they were still reviewing films).While drafting my review, I interviewed by telephone both General Moore and Joe Galloway, and I called them back to ask them to read them my final draft and ask them to correct any factual errors. They did not attempt to change my opinions of the film, and I wouldn't have let them.(I should add that Joe Galloway has a very moving interview the Americans At War series put on YouTube, and he mentions Pvt. Jimmy Nakayama.)For copyright reasons, I can't reprint here the last paragraph of my AHR review, but I can say that I said and believe that EVERY ADULT American SHOULD SEE THIS FILM, before joining the military or ever sending our young people off to war.It should also be noted for historical accuracy that Mrs. (Julia) Moore did not actually deliver the death telegrams herself - a powerful dramatic device in the film, to be sure - but when she found out they had indeed been delivered by cab drivers, she personally visited and consoled every family she could locate. As Madeleine Stowe so well portrays her in the film, she is a great lady.Even though the film premiered at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, it is hardly a recruiting film as some here have claimed. It is traumatically honest about the horror of war and its human cost (especially to the military community).It should have received a bevy of Oscars - which would have been on the eve of our invasion of Iraq - and if it had, I think more Americans would have questioned that war and our leaders' determination to start it.The Army fully supported the filming, and there was a memorial service in the Ft. Benning chapel before filming during which the veterans - especially Ernie Savage, I've been told - expressed their desire to all the members of the film company that the film be truthful, that they ""get it right."" And they did.The Pentagon may have since questioned itself for supporting the film: it is as anti-war as it is pro-military.WWS is equal to the other great war films Battleground (about GIs in the Battle of the Bulge) and Attack! (starring Jack Palance and real-life war hero Eddie Albert playing his demoralized, cowardly commander), and it far surpasses the likes of Saving Private Ryan.Lou Coatney",We Were Soldiers

When I walked in and see this movie, I felt like watching a mixture of Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, Black Hawke Down all at the same time. I guess they can't do anything about that...it is about war, so it must be about killing and dying. This movie, (individually) is good. The only thing that is letting me down is that this 'type' of movie had been done; once too many times. If they wanted to make another war movie, why not make it alittle different; in terms of perspective, or ways of filming or character development. The only war movie I mentioned above is any worth watching again is Thin Red Line. At least that movie attempts to do something different.",We Were Soldiers

151,JohnLennon1985,We Were Excellent.,10,17 September 2002,"From the trailers, this looked like just another war movie starring Mel Gibson. At first glance, I thought it was just a generic war flick. How wrong I was. I'm glad I'm not one of those people who shuns movies just because of lack of interest. That is how I got to loving movies like the Matrix and Desperado. This movie caught my eye, because Mel Gibson is great in everything he's in, but again, this looked like another war movie that wasn't as deep as its older brothers. We Were Soldiers separates itself from Mel's other War flicks. While Braveheart and the Patriot focus on one soldier and his life (along with several battle scenes), We Were Soldiers focuses on the lives of many soldiers, their families, even one of the Viet Cong soldiers, as their lives are affected in a deadly battle.This film takes place in the Vietnam War, the only war we ever officially lost. The first half hour revolves around training the troops... basically, the exposition. Soon after, they fall into battle. This battle makes up most of the movie. This isn't necessarily bad. For people who like seeing blood and guts, you will love this movie. Those who want to see some story, you will also love this movie. In fact, the acting was done so well in We Were Soldiers, that I nearly burst into tears in the end in sympathy for a Viet Cong soldier. That's another reason why this movie is so great. While some movies portray the ""other side"" to be barbaric and want to spill our guts, We Were Soldiers actually gives the Viet Cong soldiers feelings. Even the leader, who was shouting out orders to kill us all... Our leader was doing the exact same thing. However, we only see the Viet Cong leader being barbaric because they are the ""antagonists"". That, I highly disagree with. If you should see this movie, keep in mind that the antagonists are NOT the Viet Cong, but the war itself. This movie, as generic and unoriginal as the trailers made it seem, was one-of-a-kind, and if you have not seen it yet, make it a point to. It pays tribute to all the fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons who died in 'Nam. Braveheart and the Patriot are better, but this one should not be looked down upon.

So I was expecting a realistic battle. That I got, and I was pleased to see the Vietcong side as well, which you never see. I also loved Barry Pepper's character, even though he's on film for maybe 20% of the movie. It felt right. But what didn't and ruined the movie for me is the shooting location. They shot this in California; I didn't know that before watching it. But immediately I thought ""I feel in a temperate climate somewhere in Europe or North America, not in South-East Asia"". The trees are wrong, the grasses are wrong, the dried creeks are wrong. They could have shot this in the Philippines, like Apocalypse Now, in Thailand, Malaysia... Even in central America like Panama or something. Why the hell go to California ? For all the things it got right, I really regret that location choice.",We Were Soldiers

However, I had to keep my blind eye turned most of the time.  The violence was interesting (the napalm injuries almost made me hurl), but the script...ye gods!  Actually, it read like Braveheart in so many ways in that you can almost utter the lines before the actor does because each situation which can provide a stock, boring and predictable piece of dialogue DOES.  Randall Wallace is a one-note screenwriter, and it's a very flat note at that.  I mean, ""Tell my wife I love her?"" and ""How can I forgive myself that my boys died and I didn't?""  Haven't we heard these lines scads of times before?  They're simplistic and truthful, but they have been done over and over and it's a cop out to hear actors say them anymore.The weepy scenes with Madeleine Stowe tried the patience as well because they were also so damn familiar that I knew what was coming up and could even predict the expressions on her face and the montages.  Speaking of montages, the one with the journalist snapping the pictures was out and out cheesy.  That's a word that sums up this movie: cheesy.I felt no attachment to the characters at all.  It was just bullets and blood and dead bodies.  Another movie that has this same receipe is Black Hawk Down, but BHD was an excellent movie with an amazing central peformance by Josh Hartnett and solid supporting performances that made the movie memorable in every respect.  This movie, because it was basically a Mel Gibson vehicle, gave him the only meat to work with and short-shrifted the others.  But since the script stunk to high heaven, it doesn't make a bit of difference.  I'd recommend BHD over this one anyday.",We Were Soldiers

Randall Wallace is so out of his depth in trying to convey dimension and depth to both the story and the characters that it's often painful to watch. The cliched and stereotypical scenes in the movie scream of amateurish direction. (Two scenes in particular: the wives' get-together with the ""Whites Only"" reference to the laundromat, and the ""Tell my wife I love her"" line so badly delivered that I laughed in spite of myself.)Keep in mind: I love war movies. I do not love them for their action. I don't even love them for the strategy and intelligence depicted in the arena of conflict. I love them because, when they're done correctly, these films show us the sacrifice and unreasonable commitment soldiers bring to the aforementioned arena. I genuinely feel for the soldiers when I see just what they are subjected to in combat. ""Black Hawk Down"" left me wanting to know more about the brave rangers. ""Patton"" left me wanting to learn more about the courage of General Patton's army. ""We Were Soldiers"" almost didn't do that because of inept directing. Randall Wallace needs to hone his craft before he takes on such projects.See WWS, but see BHD first.",We Were Soldiers
155,gus120970,Vietnam 'simulator',6,7 August 2006,"It's clear from many of the reviewers who were there, that they feel We Were Soldiers is authentic in many respects to the soldier's experience at that stage of the Vietnam War. As a mid-30s Brit living in London, whose biggest daily hardship is an overcrowded tube, I know I'd be on shaky ground tackling those aspects of this movie. But it's not a documentary - it's a movie and on some level it is intended to be both an artistic artefact and a piece of entertainment, and is not above criticism as either. What intrigues me is what it says about Gibson, because ostensibly although it is not about Gibson (it's about 'the men') Gibson's presence is a transcendent factor. Somewhere along the line this handsome, cheekboned 'Australian' matinée idol has become a chunky, stoic and troubled American who is increasingly marching to a different drum to mainstream Hollywood. 'Braveheart' could be said to be the turning point (another Wallace collaboration) where Gibson also wanted to showing the graphic slaughter of a 'real' battle, but which took on the entire historical context of the Scottish Wars of Independence in an a flagrantly unauthentic manner. With 'We Were Soldiers' the obsession with battle accuracy is maintained and the historical/political context almost entirely dispensed with. This might be unsettling, for those who think soldiers must always be thinking why they are being sent somewhere to do something, but the case Gibson makes (basically through 2 hours of cinematic attrition) is that soldiers are thinking of staying alive and/or through obeying orders. There is in some way an attempt to encapsulate the entire 'Vietnam experience' in two hours; reckless battle tactics, unprepared men, hostile terrain, a disciplined committed enemy, reliance on increasingly indiscriminate air support and of course, the role of 'the media' which is depicted with a conspicuous lack of sympathy near the end of the film. But the visual experience is of a maelstrom, once the battle begins, and after a while it is wearing. There is no character identification really outside the two leads and the graphic brutality is instructive without being revealing or, to be nakedly honest, that entertaining. It becomes more of a simulator than a film.",We Were Soldiers

Years from now these films (WWS and Blackhawk Down) will seem to everyone what they are to me...just stupid. The producers should have just told the real story and quit making it up. And when the enemy commander gives up, just like that, after being in the battle for days...it really showed that amateurs were in charge of this production. Hollywood, give us a break.

But If this is a tribute to those killed in that first battle, I am forever in rememberance.

The film stars Mel Gibson, Barry Pepper, and Greg Kinnear. First off, the greatest aspect of this film is the really strong lead performances from Mel Gibson - He really shines in this role. Another impressive performance in the film is Sam Elliott's portrayal of Sergeant Major Basil L. Plumley. His character has some of the most memorable lines of dialogue in the film which are often crass and caustic. Another very memorable aspect of the film is it's intensely realistic use of special effects. The film uses special effects to simulate what the actual Battle Of Ia Drang was like. Some of the special effects are really engaging and compelling while other special effects are grotesque and grisly, but either way it helps to ground this film in realism. While a lot of the performances in the film were noteworthy, there were some that were. . .not. I'm not going to say which ones fell flat, but there were some moments when actors delivered their lines in a really unsuitable way. These moments don't really take away from the film's overall appeal, but. . .their just bad.

161,hitchs,One of the best war films ever.,9,8 July 2004,"I find it hard to believe the incredible amount of hostility to this movie and the many criticisms of it, most of which are either absurdly nit-picking or just plain false.It is easy to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that America's whole involvement in Vietnam was a huge mistake, but the victory of the North caused a tremendous amount of suffering, unhappiness and loss of freedom, and still does. I'm not going to comment on the politics or history of the war, because obviously a lot of other people know much more about these issues than I do. But as a piece of cinema, and as a comment on war in general, the film is superb.Certainly the battle scenes were some of the most gruesome ever filmed. Perhaps they were over the top, but surely they are more true than the old movies where everybody died cleanly, with a minimum of pain, and frequently had time to speak their last will and testament before they signed out by closing their eyes.What I loved was the human dimension. Some critics have complained about the depiction of men having babies just before they go to war and get killed, but the fact is that it happened. After all, these were young men, many of them were married, and it was the time of the baby boom. I loved the intercutting between the battle field and the women back home. Sure it was excessively emotional, but if you can't get emotional about the waste of lives in war, then I think you have a serious problem. It was also great to see them humanise the enemy, particularly in the bit about the man who was killed after writing a letter to his wife or girlfriend. Is this racist? Don't be absurd.Is it propaganda? Well, it seems that if you disagree with the views expressed in a book or film, it is propaganda, while if you agree, it is honest, probing, important, etc. I certainly didn't agree with all the opinions expressed in We Were Soldiers. I think the policy of sending men to their deaths in order to bring back the bodies of those already dead is insanity, and I don't believe the use of napalm is ever justified. But this movie is not in any sense propaganda. It is possibly unrealistic in the sense that it is dramatised, not documentary, but it is a very honest portrayal of real men and women trying to cope with a real, ghastly situation.",We Were Soldiers

I loved how he treated his men and the faith he had in them.  If I ever go to war, I would want that kind of an officer commanding me.  This film reminded me of an Old John Wayne war film in a sense that it had a little bit of romance in it and Gibson's character reminded me of a little bit of John Wayne.  He stayed cool throughout danger and everybody respected him.  This movie tells it like it is.  Not a lot of foul language, nudity, and sex.  It was a straight story that shoots through the heart and tells the story of the many brave men who fought that day.  Some parts of the movie are extremely graphic however, so if any parents are going to take their underaged children to see it(not a good idea) they should take into consideration the R-rating.

That's because it includes a view of the social side back home, like seen in Deer Hunter and it shows the utter carnage of war, like in Black Hawk Down. This movie ties well together those two different sides, it shows the suffering at home and on the battlefield. It shows also at least a little bit the side of the enemy, which is something you don't really see often. This movie doesn't make war look cool, like sadly some other American Vietnam movies do, nor does it take away from the ""real"" feeling. While watching you'll see soldiers die left and right, getting hit by bullets, burnt by fire and it all seems very real and horrifying and you can feel the loss. To follow the structure and progress of the battle is not all too easy, but I believe that it isn't either when you are there, in fact if I'd been fighting in such a place I'd been surprised if I'd been able to make any much sense of it!A true war drama! 9/10",We Were Soldiers

I knew very little about the battles in Vietnam but this movie really opened my eyes to how unprepared our men were and how the politicians made them go into battle even with little training.
These soldiers bravely fought and gave it all they could with the limited resources they were given.
The actors do a great job of pulling you in. Even though you don't get to really know the characters in depth you feel for them as a whole.
There is a lot of fighting and a lot of blood shed, A LOT!!
It angers me to think how some people treated these boys when they came home.
When other critics say it's a gung ho, GO AMERICA war movie full of propaganda and that it shows America hitting targets and Vietnam not , they must have watched a different movie. In my opinion the movie presented both sides, but of course it's going to show the American side more, it's based on the events from an American who was in that first battle.
The ending was beautifully done, showing how both sides feel pain for their dead brothers and family members. How these men who came home, came back to no celebrations, no parades... just reminders of what they endured. So different from previous wars.
The only reason I took a star off is because the battle scenes can get chaotic, which is even more realistic but sometimes hard to follow.

It is true that high stress combat situations can and will bring out the best in some, and that the media will then portray those people as heros.  But that was never the point of this movie.This film clearly shows how moronic leaders like LBJ and Westmoreland spent the lives of American youth on nothing more than rock strewn fields and hills - gains quickly given up after apparent 'victory.'  It shows honor and loss on both sides of the lines as we were not the only ones to suffer.

170,Josef Tura-2,Best Vietnam movie,9,27 February 2002,"I was disposed to dislike this film because of the horrible trailers. I was pleasantly surprised however during the advance screening. This is a meaty film with plenty to admire, provoke and digest.  Sure there are about half a dozen lines that might make potential script writers squirm but Randall Wallace has succeeded brilliantly in the goal he set for himself (he spoke after the screening). And that was the goal of telling the soldiers stories... devoid of any extraneous political complications. These men fought for each other. Wallace also doesn't make the mistake of dehumanizing the enemy. The Vietnamese are given a great deal of sympathetic screen time. As Wallace said, the only enemy is war itself and he made a conscious effort to have no ""evil"" characters. This is a story about the men who have to fight the politicians' wars... and how they do it. The epic scope of Braveheart is here transposed to the modern day and for me... by the end of the movie it really worked. This is the best movie about Vietnam, that is actually about Vietnam. Other great films on the subject are about the filmmaker's psyche more than the war itself (Apocalypse Now, Deerhunter, even Platoon).

Moore.What it also shows is that politics are no replacement for tactics, and that soldiers should fight wars without political interference of the nature brought to bare in 1965.It has been a long time since I walked out of a theatre with tears openly rolling down my cheeks, but I am proud to say that this film was worth every tear.Well done to all concerned, and RIP all those brave young men who fell in The Valley of Death and beyond.",We Were Soldiers

173,kristoffe-brodeur,excellent in every way,10,20 October 2014,"I found this piece to really bring out the best in film making. The entire flow of the film made me think the editing was slow and yet full of detail. Little motions in everything, the prayer with his children and his daughter's toes wiggling as they didn't reach the ground were great. The lighting in each scene when artificial felt thought out quite convincingly and the outer scenes were scouted perfectly.The characters were scripted well and they felt entertaining, as this was not a documentary but a based on fact fictionary. Being in the military can be quite boring and then entirely too exciting in the worst ways, and this was very visceral and realistic.I thin each actor was ground out a good character and they were properly cast. The costumes were great, the vietcong were determined, and it was a pleasure to ride through the era in this film.I didn't mention the soundtrack and audio effects, maybe because they were on point, bird sounds added in, slight points here and there with great coverage in the gaps with the music.The end.

174,McHuevo,War movie with a simple plot,8,16 September 2002,"I have not too much to say about this movie because I felt the movie didn't have to much to say. It's the depiction of a combat held in Vietnam by Hal Moore's company. And that's about it.Yes, there's the whole brave-soldiers, american-honor message in it, but I just don't think the movie takes that message across. I stick to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" (in that order) as my favorite war movies. Now those are movies that say a lot.The thing that kept me from rating this movie with a 7 was the technical achievement of it. The sound is superb and the whole photography is amazing.As with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" the level of realism of ""We were soldiers"" is a little bit over the edge. Maybe film makers are trying new ways to describe the horror and madness that the soldiers are put through. I say we will never fully understand what, and why, these men experience on the battlefield, no matter how real the film looks.",We Were Soldiers
175,LG72387,"A riveting, compelling war drama",7,25 August 2002,"We Were Soldiers is an intense drama set during the vastness of the Vietnam War. The story does not only focus on the grave depiction of this war, but also focuses on the lives of the American soldiers. The audience is able to realize that lots of these men who fought bravely were fathers to their children and husbands to their wives. They were willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of their country and fight for a nation they could be proud of. Mel Gibson is one of those soldiers (Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore) who must also leave his life behind and lead these young soldiers into the heart of doom. Writer/director Randall Wallace does a wonderful job at bringing the devastation of war and the emotion of soldiers to an even match and turns the film into an amazing portrait of the American spirit. He doesn't just make us absorb the harshness of war in which there is a good and an evil. Wallace makes us feel sorry not just for the American soldiers, but also for the enemy soldiers who are also sacrificing their lives for the good of their country. We realize that it is not their choice to fight in this war and are made to believe that it is a matter of duty and honor. Earlier in the film, Moore describes the soldiers as ""young boys"" who are being shed into a hellacious mixture of death and agony. This line allows the audience to feel proud for these young soldiers who fought for their nation. Moore also makes a promise that he will bring every man under his command home (dead or alive) ""so help him God"". We learn from this line at the end of the movie that Moore was indeed a man of his word and would die to see that these young boys made it home. Randall Wallace tells of the story of 7th company with such effectiveness and power that the audience must shed a tear at the end. Indeed, Wallace has improved himself ever since he wrote the disastrous screenplay for Pearl Harbor. I would not be surprised if this film was not recognized at the end of the year as one of the best films of the year. Lenny's Grade: ***1/2",We Were Soldiers
176,Marthian80,Decent war movie but it doesn't do anything new,6,8 December 2017,"I was curious about this movie because it's one of the more ""recent"" Vietnam movies so I wanted to see if it brought anything new to the table that the classic movies did not. The movie opens with a French patrol in Vietnam in 1954, the final year of the First Indochina war. The French patrol is overrun by the Viet Minh forces and the commander order to ""kill all they send, and they will stop coming"". We fast forward 11 years when the United States is fighting the Vietnam War. Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) arrives with his family and is very dedicated to training his troops in preparation to be sent to battle. He will be leading a newly created air cavalry unit (flying troops and supplies in with helicopters) into the Ia Drang Valley. Moore only has 395 men at his disposal and soon learn that the enemy has much more men. Vastly outnumbered, will the astounding leadership qualities and stubborn determination of Moore be enough to survive the coming onslaught?Overall I enjoyed this movie, but not tremendously. The war action was very good, the acting and portrayal of the characters was decent and at times it gave me the feeling of being in the heat of the battle. But it started really slow, the first 40 minutes were not very interesting and although it did setup some story arcs, overall it could be much shorter or be made more exciting. In my opinion they tried to hard with focusing on the families of the soldiers. I understand that they wanted to show how the women left behind would react to the bad news but it didn't work for me, I think they should have stayed with the battle the whole movie. And where most classic Vietnam movies focus on the insanity of war and the dehumanization, this movie sometimes looks like a commercial to join the army. There were a bit to many ""I'm glad I died for my country"" moments and it lacked emotional torment of the characters. On the other hand they did a fine job showing the Vietnam troops as real people and not as nameless monsters. Overall it is a decent movie but it doesn't do anything new and doesn't hold a candle to the classic Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket.",We Were Soldiers
177,pc_dean,Choppering into the Little Big Horn,7,3 May 2002,"If LtCol Harold Moore did not actually exist, it would be necessary for Hollywood to invent him.  A tough-talking, straightforward leader of men, equal parts swagger and heart, he loves his troops like his own children, refuses to leave the combat zone while his boys are in the sharp end, and sheds tears for the fallen in between barking orders into a radio handset and shooting charging enemies through the head.  The crazy thing about Moore, and about ""We Were Soldiers"" in general, is not how much is Hollywood hokum, but how much seems to be but isn't.  Moore is a real person and he was by all accounts (including, but not limited to, his own) a tough soldier, a shrewd commander, and the kind of crazy SOB who would be the first to go in and the last to leave.""We Were Soldiers"" is the story of Moore and his 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (Custer's old unit) in the Ia Drang valley, the first major confrontation between American and Vietnamese troops.  This alternately brilliant and exasperating movie is based on a book by Moore and UPI reporter Joe Galloway, with the cumbersome but oddly poetic title ""We Were Soldiers Once...and Young"".  It begins with Moore's assignment to the Army's first dedicated air cavalry unit, which is among the first US combat troops sent to Vietnam.  What starts as a mission to destroy an enemy force that attacked an American base becomes a brutal siege as the Cav are surrounded and trapped, 395 men pitted against nearly two thousand of the enemy.Moore is played by Mel Gibson, who adeptly portrays both the paternal kindness of a decent man and the manic glint so common in good infantry officers.  Unfortunately, the movie focuses so much on him that it loses some of its big-picture scope.  After a while it begins to seem that Gibson is everywhere; no firefight can commence unless he fires the opening volley, no act of valor passes without a shot of Gibson's eyes welling up with pained pride at the sacrifice of his soldiers.  A little of this is good, too much of it is bad.  Moore probably was larger than life, but Gibson's Moore almost threatens to be larger than the movie.The supporting cast is led by Sam Elliott, whose Sergeant Major Plumley is destined to take his place among the greatest flinty NCO portrayals in film history.  Barry Pepper plays Galloway, and delivers the movie's intro and epilogue, though he doesn't appear until late in the movie.  The movie parallels the story of the battle with that of the officers' wives, led by Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore.  The wives' story is given some short shrift (and some very clumsy scenes), though it is in parts so wrenching it is almost a relief to return to the war zone.One memorable passage in Moore's book likens the sound of a bullet hitting flesh to that of a canoe paddle slapping wet mud, an image that is at once comical and horrifying.  We have come to expect graphic carnage from our war movies these days.  However, instead of the rapid-fire speed-lapse photography seen in ""Saving Private Ryan's"" unforgettable Normandy sequence, writer/director Randall Wallace offers more straightforward depictions of the businesslike horrors of close combat: he doesn't use a lot of camera tricks to communicate the concept of chaotic violence, he just fills the screen with chaotic violence and lets us watch it in its unflinching fury. And call me an air-show junkie, but he has some beautiful sequences of Hueys diving over hilltops, flying in through smoke, etc.Most latter-day war movies give a nod to the enemy, making him human, not a faceless monster.  For all this movie's flag-waving sentimentality, it's actually better in this regard than most.  The Vietnamese are not fearless stoics; we see a young NVA infantryman panting and wide-eyed with fear as he charges the equally afraid Americans (something even anti-American screeds like ""Platoon"" never showed).  It's also instructive to watch Moore and his opposite number (Don Duong) moving among their troops doing similar things: offering encouragement, making stirring speeches, and plotting the demise of the other.This is a battle picture, a movie that exhaustively analyzes a single big-picture event in a war.  While movies of this type have been made for years, this is one of the very few to come out of Vietnam.  The pantheon of great (and not-so-great) Vietnam movies all have one thing in common: they portray specific events that did not, strictly speaking, actually take place.  Those movies are more about Vietnam as a general phenomenon than about anything that quantifiably happened there.  In this way, ""We Were Soldiers"" represents something quite daring: Wallace has made an early-40s WWII movie about the Vietnam War.And that's part of the problem: the movie has far too many places where it goes for overblown sentiment and emotional manipulation, often hokey to the point of embarrassment.  The fact that many of the cliches are true and many of the corny Hollywood moments are based in fact does not excuse slathering them in high melodrama.  This is doubly a shame because these scenes overshadow some stunning moments that work better for being small: none of the shots of Moore's eyes misting at the loss of his men can match the power of a scene that shows him standing by himself, his back to the camera as his shoulders shake with his unseen sobs.  This is a good movie, but it misses its chance to be a great movie because it doesn't trust us in the folding seats to adequately grasp the point.When ""We Were Soldiers"" goes wrong, it makes you want to roll your eyes. But when it gets it right, it cuts straight through to you with a sound like a canoe paddle slapping wet mud.",We Were Soldiers
178,mxracer157,the glory and the horror of war all wrapped into one,8,18 March 2005,"Fantastic. The tail of the 1st major American battle in Vietnam. Extremely well written script. Perhaps the best Vietnam movie ever written. Most movies only tell things from one side. some show two sides if the script is decent. This movie shows this point of view of this time from three different perspectives. one part is the US soldiers point of view. Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in his acting in this film. Watching Mel question his own orders, then watching him give orders himself and then wonder if they were right shows a scene few movies have ever reached upon. Vietnam wasn't a well received time period in the US history. This movie shows soldiers dealing with each other, becoming more than just platoon buddies. The next point of view was the point of the wives of the US soldiers. When their men had left, they stayed strong. Madelaine Stowe plays a perfect wife in this film. You can actually see and feel her heartbreak as she lets her new found friends know their husbands had died. The final point of view from this movie was the VC point of view. the Colonel of the VC army,played by Don Duong is a wonderful job. This movie has other actors in it that most will recognize .Chris Klein does a wonderful job as a new father and husband off to war for the 1st time. Kerri Russel totally escapes her ""Felicity"" role as she portrays a young mother who loses her husband but remains a loyal friend. Sam Elliott plays a tough old SGT out to keep his Colonel alive. IN his older years now, Elliot often lands roles needing a mature strong man, and he does it well! The final actor in this movie most will know is Greg Kinnear. Escaping his comedy roots, Greg plays a wily helicopter pilot. Kinnear doesn't say much, but his acting is a nice job in this story. The finest acting in this film in my opinion though is Barry Pepper who plays the Newspaper man. He comes from a military family but wants to understand the war so he acts as a novelist. Seeing the anguish Pepper goes through as he figures out he either starts killing or ends up being killed is tough. Watching him wonder what is going to happen next almost makes you feel as if you are there with him yourself. a fantastic movie. lot of action and blood,so if your not into that, this movie isn't for you. But a very well directed, acted and written movie, the best I have seen in a long time!",We Were Soldiers
179,kcterrell-25046,2nd Best Vietnam Movie Ever,9,12 April 2019,"I don't know why I can't give this film a ""10"". There is simply nothing wrong with this film . It's loosely based on history of Lt. Col Hal Smith who was charged with establishing the 7th Air Cav in Vietnam. It is true that their first mission was to be dropped into the ""Valley of Death"", not knowing that 365 men were being sent straight into a full division of 4,000 North Vietnamese troops. It is a story so well written, that it captures sentimentality, heroisn, brutality, and survival in perfect order. Mel Gibson is stupendous as Col. Smith. And Sam Eliot is, well, Sam Eliot. Painstaking casting, with each supporting actor adding his own personality and enhancing the film. Brilliant direction and camera work.

The score of the film is often overlooked but in this case it provides plenty of emotion especially as the 7th Regiment assembles for the trip to South Vietnam beneath the radio towers late at night.Of a forgotten battle with unknown heroes for both forces this is a great war movie that should be a lesson for future productions.",We Were Soldiers
181,cathie454,Not What I Expected,9,28 May 2006,"I didn't see this movie when it was released. I felt, after seeing Braveheart, that what I was going to see was a pro-Vietnam War movie, like what John Wayne did in The Green Berets. I was wrong, and I wish I'd seen this in the movie theater. I saw it tonite on TV, Memorial Day Weekend, with so many other war movies on so many channels. I felt it gave an accurate, realistic portrayal of that war, both pro and con. The cinematography was very effective, showing the confusion and chaos of a battle scene, pulling the audience into the battle. Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot and Barry Pepper were very good, and Greg Kinnear was surprisingly good. The attention to detail was excellent, and graphic. I don't know what this movie is rated, and since I saw it on TV, I'm sure much of it was cut, but the violence is very effective. Just as an example, when they show the first American death, and the camera is focused on the soldier's eyes, as he dies you see his pupils dilate. I'm sure, as a nurse, I noticed a lot of this sort of detail that maybe gets missed, but it certainly adds to the reality of the movie. I intend to rent this so I can see it uncut, and I'm going to buy the book. I'm sure the movie couldn't include everything, but what was there is excellent.",We Were Soldiers
182,slimjack,An old-fashioned war movie with all the strengths and failings of the genre.,8,29 March 2002,"We Were Soldiers is based on the true story of the first major battle between American units and the North Vietnamese army. Mel Gibson plays Col. Hal Moore, the man tasked with leading the 7th Air Cavalry. This was the first battalion created to implement the new helicopter strategy that would become the signature of the war. These tactics are still in use today, as witness by Black Hawk Down for instance. The movie was written and directed by Randall Wallace. While not as stylish as some directors he tells his story simply and coherently. Wallace includes some unique touches.  We actually meet the North Vietnamese and while we don't really get to know him or his men, at least we get some sense of them as soldiers.Wallace does make some mistakes.  The soldier's wives somehow don't come across.  Part of the problem is their costuming.  Their hairstyles and clothing are too-too early sixties. They look like east village drag queens having a retro party rather than concerned army wives. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore. Stowe is a fine actress but something weird happens with her character. For some reason, just as the character should become more vivid she begins to fade. I don't think this is Stowe's fault. I tend to think Wallace was more interested in the battles than he was in the home front and the soldier's wives suffered for it.In the end, one's feelings about We Were Soldiers is defined by how one feels about Hollywood war movies.  Because it is a star driven film we have the pleasure of a great Gibson performance and Elliot's Sergeant Plumley. We pretty much know who's going to die and how.  The conventions help us make sense of a difficult battle that is presented very close to the way it actually happened. The downside to this is that, as close to the facts as the move is, it doesn't feel all that real. You experience it as a smart, thoughtful action movie instead of getting the sense of intense horrifying reality that you got from Black Hawk Down. If you're bothered by the idea of war as entertainment, you will have some trouble with We Were Soldiers. As for me, I enjoyed it and give it a hearty recommendation",We Were Soldiers

Let's face it so were the Native Americans in Wayne cowboy movies. All it lacked was the token Polack, Italian, African American etc spouting homilies about what they were defending. The Americans are pure and noble defenders of truth, justice etc etc. I shudder to think of what Gibson will do with Passion of Christ.

The main aim of the movie maker is simple to read: to win a war America already lost. The truth is that Vietnam was a disaster, but one should not consider it as a military disaster which has to be rewritten by such simple stories. It's better to understand that war itself is a disaster even if it is a war which seems to be necessary. But the film shows the opposite. The film depicts the war and especially the enemies like John Wayne did it in The Green Berets and it's a horrible image of the US army having leading soldiers like the figure of Moore. What's it like to be a father and a soldier Geoghegan asks (in a church!)and the only thing Moore has to answer is that God should help him to kill that other b...... . Is that reality? And is it authentic to show thousands of running and screaming Vietnamese soldiers like those guys we saw in the 50s and 60s? It maybe a realistic depiction according to some of the quoted veterans here in the user comments. I don't blame those, but please don't forget: It is nothing more than a single event, a single perspective, a film and a story. I prefer to understand a war movie as something mono-dimensional about a complex truth. Wallace and Gibson say nothing more but: Vietnam, Politics, doubts, sorrow, pain and grief? Ah, come on, f... it. They Were Soldiers and they were heroes, there's nothing more to say. I have only one word for that: propaganda. I really do hope that the whole American society doesn't think like Wallace and Gromit, sorry, Gibson. But there is still a spark of hope in the war film genre. Thank's, Clint.

188,dracopticon,This film s*cked bigtime,1,15 November 2002,"I just cannot believe this. A l-o-t of people have left their postings on this board, and actually liked this movie. It's truly amazing.First of all, I'm not a supporter of the US involvement in Vietnam, as it was totally uncalled for. And secondly, American soldiers have never been and will never be, the best soldiers in the world. Maybe one of the absolutely best equipped soldiery of the world, but again - not the best when it comes to fighting. And definitely not within the jungle landscape of the Vietcong homeland. And that's what annoys me so much about this film. Compare this disgrace of a movie with for example Full Metal Jacket by Kubrick, and you get a comparison like that of stale old moldy bread with a box of delicious chocolate.Hundreds of times in this film, you see the native forces of Vietnam getting bested by their american counterparts. And these are the same Vietnam people who;1. Know they're home ground like the back of their hands,
2. Is often entrenched and well prepared beforehand, way ahead of any US 'fresh-out-of-college-students-whooshed-over-the-ocean-and-dropped-smack-da b-in-the-middle-of-enemy-territory' personnel,
3. Don't walk around in the jungle, smoking cigs, chewing gum, having strong-smelling cologne on, using narcotics, talking loudly, having a portable radio turned on (not the troop-radio), and generally having a lot more clues as to what they're doing there than the US soldiers.And in spite of all this, the US grunts mysteriously gain the upper hand, even in hand-to-hand combat. It is as likely as if the Vietnamese would invade South Carolina and suddenly be the experts on everything essential in the area. The ONLY reason the US ever got the upper hand historically, in my opinion, is that they had superior aerial forces and could bombard strategic locations with things like napalm and agent orange.And the so called ""acting"" in this movie suck so much that it generates a backdraft. 'Stoneface Gibson' is more concerned these days that his looks and personal aura gets thru, than actually doing any real acting and is a real bore to watch. This personal cult-building around his persona began in the end of Braveheart and have just gotten worse by every movie since.Just don't watch this dung, especially if you rate films like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan high on your personal list.Dracopticon out.",We Were Soldiers
189,zaisjr,Finally a war movie that properly depicts a battle.,10,2 February 2010,"My father is a Vietnam vet. He rarely talks about Vietnam, and when he does, he talks about boot camp or his training. He won't ever talk about the battlefield. So I knew this film had to be decent because he loves it. He only likes three war films that I know of, this one, Saving Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers. Here's why this movie is amazing. 1. The movie is about an incredibly important part of history and shows how gruesome the first attack was in Vietnam. It also shows how, once again, France got us into a war that they couldn't handle. 2. It's incredibly realistic. My father thought that one scene might have been too influenced by Hollywood, until he found the actual footage of the battle. In one scene the Vietnamese soldiers just charge in aggressively and are being shot at close range by U.S. soldiers. It all looks more John Wayne then anything at first. But as the movie showed us, there was a reporter there filming the events that took place. His footage is available online. Sure enough, it shows Vietnamese soldiers doing an all out charge at the U.S. soldiers and looks just like the scene depicted in the movie. The movie showed how grueling war can be and how one quick decision can be fatal. 3. Sam Elliot. I was blown away by his take on Sgt. Plumley. Amazing. He played the part of the grumpy and pessimistic... but tough sargeant. It was almost as if they had hired a drill sargeant to do his part. 4. The movie depicts perfectly the sacrifice that the soldiers and families give up. It demonstrates that the war wasn't just in Vietnam, but it was also carried over here on the backs of soldiers and bared by the families and wives of these very soldiers. No soldier was cast as a major hero nor as some major action superstar. They were cast as soldiers, plain and simple. The movie asked for no glory, no praise, just for you to listen. As one Vietnam vet said, ""This is our story"". 5. The music to the movie was great, especially since it was performed by the military's own. I recommend seeing this film. It's not a ""feel-good"" movie or a movie made for pure pleasure. It's made to show the story of the soldiers. It isn't meant to push a political belief nor to protest anyone. It tells a story, an amazing and true one at that.",We Were Soldiers

191,misko14,What the hell were they thinking?,1,8 August 2002,"Actually, I don't even know where to start This is without any doubts one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.. I had great expectations, I was looking forward to see this movie, damn' I even checked the IMDB ratingThe movie starts with the ordinary `We are proud American soldiers ready to die for our country' crap. Every soldier is a hero, a perfect husband and a loving father with a great family living in a nice house. The first 45 minutes are a serious version of The Truman Show. And yes you'll see crying children asking daddie `What is war?'.. and yes you'll see the badass old veteran being harsh against the young soldiers.. and yes surprisingly you'll also see a young soldier that is deeply in love with his wife and wonders if ""the war is right or not""..Unfortunately the first 45 minutes are the best part of the movie. It seems that after the soldiers arrive in Vietnam, the director stopped using the manuscript and started to improvise the whole movie. The rest of the movie is a huge and brutal orgy in the exchange of fire between Americans and Vietcong. The problem is that the war part of the movie is so crappy made that sometimes I couldn't believe my eyes that none of the people involved in the movie, said `Guys, this is bad!'.The most annoying thing is probably how unrealistic the fire fights actually are. Most of the Vietcong soldiers have one mission  to run towards the Americans and start shooting only within 10 meter range. It's like playing a badly programmed computer game with non-existent enemy AI. Another annoying thing is that classical `Rambo-syndrome'. The `less important' American soldiers are dying all over the place. The bullets are hitting the ground just a few inches from the main characters but are they hiding and taking cover? Of course not They standing in the middle of the action and kill every bad guy they spot..Don't expect the unexpected in this film. Every time a soldier tries to go back and pick up a wounded team mate, he will die. Every time someone dies, he will always have enough time to say `Tell my wife I love her' before he closes his eyes. The list of complains could go on foreverAnd I probably shouldn't even mention the incident with the photographer's camera which first is shot out of his hands and later magically picked up hanging on a tree.

192,jryan-4,still flashing back,7,27 February 2002,"A Loud Seven For one startling second, Mel Gibson as Hal Moore seemingly transforms into John Wayne during the celluloid version of the battle of Ia Drang in Randall Wallace's new film We Were Soldiers. The transformation is physical as well as metaphysical. Gibson doesn't merely bring back memories of Wayne, for that second he looks and sounds like the Wayne of World War Two flicks. No problem with that. The problem lies with looking and sounding like the Wayne fighting man of Viet Nam rather than the Wayne warrior of Iwo Jima. That  Duke in Ia Drang imagery brings to mind Wayne's clumsy, wrong headed direction of his own Viet Nam film/fiasco, The Green Berets. Maybe Mel's helmet is the problem. Throughout the film Gibson/Moore barks indecipherable orders from underneath a General Patton, G.I Joe helmet that looks like a refugee from a Bill Mauldin cartoon. We Were Soldiers relentlessly seems like an uncomfortable synthesis of WW2 films and Viet Nam films. In the language of cinema, Soldiers more closely resembles Saving Private Ryan or Guadalcanal Diary than it resembles Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. Certainly the battle of Ia Drang portrayed in We Were Soldiers deserves commemoration.  Ia Drang, fought in November of 1965 is often described as the first `conventional' battle of the Viet Nam war. Conventional apparently means, the way John Wayne or John Ford of George Patton would fight it, man to man with charges, sieges, fistfights and bayonets. The battle was so `conventional' and `productive' that General Westmoreland came to the brilliant realization that kill ratio would be a great method to keep score during the war, after all we killed nine times as many `of dem as dey killed ah us'. Using this scorekeeping method, we kept winning the war until 58,000 American citizens died and we left town and built a Wall. Nam remains a bewildering, enigma of startling sound and fury significance. In that regard, portraying war as hell rather than heck, chaos rather than order, We Were Soldiers succeeds. Soldiers is the most violent, bloodsoaked, burn blistered movie that I have ever seen with one image after another that I want to remove from my working memory. Even after a week, they  still remain. When, if, you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. Anyone seeking an ultra-violent reminder of pre 66 American military arrogance mixed with the remains of World War Two gung ho heroism directed by the guy who gave us The Man in the Iron Mask should go see We Were Soldiers particularly those who value cinema as a source of both headache and heartache. For all others, find a metaphoric helmet and put it over your sensitivities before entering the theater or do whatever else you would do when confronting a movie that I would rate as a very loud 7.",We Were Soldiers
193,Evolvist,Not Black Hawk Down (thank God),8,25 August 2002,"The opposite of Black Hawk Down, it was nice to see a post-World War II movie that did not condone our actions there.  I am convinced that the American experience in Vietnam was not one that all of the soldiers who fought there shared, but more of a highly personal experience: that is, more than any other war in our history, each man viewed it radically different from the next, but they seem to always agree on the major points.  We Were Soldiers agrees on the major points, and shows another side of the war that we are not use to seeing in the movies.  All points are valid; but a few are just different. I am so glad this movie did not try to delude us into thinking that patriotism is watching your friends die for nothing.  I give it an 8.75",We Were Soldiers

195,Calios,The best War movie since I don't know when,10,3 March 2002,"Mel Gibson out does John Wayne. Will now admit Mel Gibson is better than most as he pulls off making you believe his character. Sam Elliot is great also as I can name at least two Sergeant-Majors like him in personality if not in physical stature. The scenes from Ft. Benning made it personal to me cause I know those streets, this movie has to be used in various Army training courses in the future along with ""Black Hawk Down"".This movie brings the realness of battle and a ill-prepared war to life. During the movie Gibson tries to explain what war is, and he comes close, but it's simply the struggle of one gang/nation/clan/group of people/tyrant or whoever you want to say struggling with a like force or party for the purpose of imposing one's will on a population or territory, whether for the good or for the bad and what's good to you may be bad to the other and vice-versa.The North Vietnamese are portrayed honorably as Wallace did the Japanese in ""Pearl Harbor"". To me the battle scenes are graphic though not as bad as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""BHD"". The story does show the horror of Willie Pete, and if the do-gooders of the world want something really bad banned from existence like land mines and napalm, then this is what should be banned as it's a terrible and disfiguring substance. The movie pays homage to those who took part in the Vietnam struggle and it's cause, it's too bad the leadership of that day did not understand how to do the business of war as was evident by Gibson's character being requested to go battle then taking men he had been training away from his unit and then when in the heat of battle requesting him to give a briefing back at the rear somewhere. Some men's name's should be spoken with shame and disgust. MacArthur, Patton, Marshall, Roosevelt, etc. surely rolled in their graves over how this war was conducted. Of course the same kind of leadership was present when ""BHD"" occurred too.Worth seeing just on the historical insight it provides.",We Were Soldiers
196,Clay-17,A bit preachy,8,2 March 2002,"I liked this movie, but it WAS a bit preachy.

But the action was good.Not as good as Black Hawk Down.  And it's in tribute to both the Americans AND North Vietnamese who died there.  What's up with that?  Let them make their own movie...",We Were Soldiers
197,pivko,"Not as bad as some people here say, not as good either",6,23 November 2002,"SPOILERS HEREIN!Well, this is not a serious and compelling war movie like the Platoon was. Rather than that it resembles Saving Private Ryan in many ways. We need to thank these movies for one major thing. They portray the war in the naturalistic way. I can imagine someone may walk out of the theater after seeing some scenes of this movie, but hey, the war is even hundred times more gross than any movie can be. But starting with Saving Private Ryan, the trend to unleash the evil spirit of war and bring it to the movie screen started and this movie continues in it, and does pretty well. Also I liked, that the movie did not try to bring up any philosophical aspects, just shown the plain war, nothing more but also nothing less. Also the music is well written and accompanies the movie nicely, particularly I liked the main song.But then there comes the bad stuff. And that is the plot - well, although I definitely must give some credit to the writer for leaving out the usual Vietnam controversy stuff, there are numerous other unnecessary scenes, such as American flag waving in the highest emotional scenes, it has been currently some kind of fashion in the movies of this type, but is it REALLY THAT necessary? Also the scene with the soldiers gathering at the airport in the middle of the night to leave for Vietnam - come on, give me a break! And final, and the worst - why the heck Moore first leaves two thirds of his men die in the hellish battle and then second day suddenly calls for the airstrike? Does that make ANY sense whatsoever?  And then, am I the only one who thinks the soldiers behaved like monks in the monastery? No f-words, no profanity. Would that really happen in the situation like that? A bit unrealistic, at least for me.So the conclusion - I have to praise this flick for the portrayal of the hell of war. But I also have to put it down for unnecessary scenes, unrealistic political correctness and some flaws in acting. Lets break it even then - 5/10",We Were Soldiers
198,John-423,I cant believe so many people can bash this movie...,10,9 November 2002,"If Spielberg had made it, its more than guaranteed to have been praised and heaped with adoration... but I digress. Its not Pretty. Its a nasty, painful and grotesque look at war and it DOES has an underlying moral lesson no matter how blind some may be to it. But isnt that what films like this are all about? Why cant people accept it for what it is, and not a overglorified Tom hanks vehicle or overhyped garbage like Platoon?  Gibson has starred in quite a few incredible films, and despite it not being on the same level as Braveheart I cant see how it can be compared to it. I do know however that it left a lasting impact on me, even more so since I viewed it with two Vets who could hardly speak after it was over...  a Very moving film indeed.",We Were Soldiers
199,imyjr,Perhaps a classic,10,7 March 2002,"Let us not forget that at some level, this is a great action flick: it promises action, delivers action, some of the most harrowing action ever captured on film. The action is clear, understandable, chaotic and unpredictable...... and magnificently filmed. The cinematography is aptly beautiful, without the (arguably) annoyingly self-conscious beauties of Thin Red Line, but still beautiful (e.g. whenever helicopters took to the sky).Over and beyond, this is a very moving, very sad film. The loyalty of the men to each other is deep and meaningful. They were mostly conscripts; Vietnam was not even a big war yet in the American consciousness (1965). One can already sense the ambiguities and pitfalls of the disgraceful policy and horrible tragedy Vietnam would eventually become. The only cause these soldiers truly understood was the personal need to fight so as to defend each other in extremely perilous circumstances which they neither comprehended nor had chosen. They were soldiers.  Magnificent film.Mel Gibson gives the performance of his life and more so than by just avoiding the Mel Gibson star turn and for once creating character. Greg Kinnear shows potential as a wonderful action hero. Chris Kline is quietly strong and touching. The music score is magnificent and ingeniously integrated with the actual sounds of the film narrative... yes it is calculated to pull at your heart-strings, and it does...... masterfully.
This is a must-see film, one that could become a classic.",We Were Soldiers
200,barbb1953,Excellent movie but the ending spoils it a bit,9,6 October 2009,"Be warned that the third paragraph will contain a very big spoiler as I discuss the ending. Meanwhile, there is a lot to praise in this movie. In particular, Sam Elliott's performance is superb, and he is given one of the most succinct summations of the reality of war I've ever seen, this in the ongoing business where the officer wishes him a good day and gets a foul chewing-out in return, and then later on Elliott explains to him on the battlefield what a real good day is for a soldier and the officer reacts. Also excellent is the realism of this movie; it makes you appreciate what all those pilots and grunts went through during that time. Also, the scenes from the Communist perspective are short but illuminating, and the drum soundtrack gives them additional power. There was no way the Americans could know who the enemy leader was at the time, but later on they did meet and talk with Nguyen Huu An. His role in all this is very well done. Please note: Vietnamese wearing a coolie hat and black pajamas are VC; those wearing a uniform--and this applies to the young soldier who charges Col. Moore, too--are member of the North Vietnamese Army. Finally, extra depth is given to the movie by showing the wives coping with it, too; I just marvel at Mrs. Moore and her friend: how could they do that? Love, of course; just like their men, they are taking care of their own.Overall, this is a very good movie. Now that somebody has portrayed the first contact between North Vietnamese and American foot soldiers, I hope somebody will come out with the first armor contact between the two armies, at Ben Het in 1969. That would be interesting, too. (Next paragraph contains the spoiler.) Now, the criticism. It's really too bad that Gibson gave in to his desire to ""hero"" it up with that fictitious bayonet charge at the end. What the cavalrymen actually did there was heroic enough, and there really wasn't any need, apart perhaps from ego, to add in anything extra. In fact, it's the one thing our war in Vietnam never had--there was all this WWII-style carnage, but then the survivors were just transferred out; there was rarely this soul-satisfying win (or loss). From what I've read of the November fight in the Ia Drang in 1965, it was about as close to a traditional win as we got during those year, but that happened without the charge. This ending definitely subtracted from the overall credibility found in the rest of the film.",We Were Soldiers
201,rod-ruger,"Slow start, then stumble, fumble",2,21 January 2013,"The first 40 or more minutes of this thing were space filler. Very unlike ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"". Gotta get the ""human aspect"" into things, I suppose. Wives, kids, pathos, blah, blah, blah. Why? Because that's part of the formula for most similar movies. Then, of course, the dramatic music and grim face routines. More from the cinematic chemistry book - how to make a movie. 46 minutes to the first bursts of gunfire and no sign of the enemy. Who are the GI's shooting at? As it turns out...no one. 1000 rounds wasted. Good for the defense industry. The first battle scene, an officer leads his men into an obvious ambush. Brilliant.

207,arson83,Didn't live up to the hype...,6,15 September 2003,"I was so excited to see this movie. The trailer looked awesome. The reviews that the studio put on the ads made it seem fantastic, like another ""Braveheart"" or at the very least a ""Saving Private Ryan."" After all, Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson were both involved, and ""Braveheart,"" which they also worked on, is the most fantastic movie ever.This movie let me down. The battle scenes were decent, but the movie was a lot of fluff. There was nothing of substance. Sure, families are upset when a soldier dies, I know that, I'm not stupid. There is no need to dedicate half an hour of this movie to the wives walking door-to-door delivering telegrams to families of soldiers that died.I'm not saying the movie was horrible. It was a little better than an average movie, but with the hype and anticipation for it, it was a let down. There were too many characters to keep track of and to care about all of them (just like in ""Black Hawk Down""), so when one dies (I won't say who) you don't feel much for them. It doesn't have as big of a dramatic impact as the makers intended.If you saw this movie, I hope you didn't shell out 9 bucks for it. Rent it from the library or something.6/10.",We Were Soldiers
208,crawfrordboon,Honest war drama not over-shadowed by Hollywood's greatest star,7,28 January 2005,"Despite the political commentary that has understandably accompanied discussion of Randall Wallace's We Were Soldiers, it should be remembered that the film is primarily based on a true story, with the actual protagonists having had considerable creative input. The movie sets itself up as following the American soldiers as they make their nation's first intervention into the most controversial conflict of the last century, and, with any group of close-knit people who find themselves outnumbered, surrounded, and at war, the instinct is to root for them in their heroic battle against a faceless enemy.Except that's not the full story of We Were Soldiers. Some understanding and insight into the enemy's strategy and mindset is attempted, if not always achieved, and although we rarely get to see how the North Vietnamese coped with and approached battle and death as we do the Americans, at least we have more of them than what could have been a merciless, villainous, thoroughly dislikeable conveyor belt of cannon fodder. It's made clear that everyone involved in this battle is not doing so because of their duty to their countries or their belief in ideologies or faith in religions. They are there because they are soldiers. Everything else is strictly secondary.If soldierhood defines the main protagonists, their roles as husbands and fathers is brought directly into play simultaneously, as the families on the home front receive shattering news in the case of each fatality, as the conflict develops. This is a new and interesting slant taken by a film that puts itself primarily into the battleground, and although the two separate sequences struggle to gel greatly together, it is nevertheless an intriguing attempt to show the solidarity between the families in a soldiering community, and the impact of soldiering and war on a small town.It's hard to fault the film in terms of realism, for we are taken right into the filth and depredation of battle to a degree fully comparable with PLATOON or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The use of helicopter pilot characters allows us to get an overview of the conflict is a welcome breath from the claustrophobic, tense, battleground sequences, which are energy sapping in their ferocity and intensity. Wallace's use of light and darkness is also a wonderfully innovative feature, both in the cases of the men on the ground, and the view from the helicopter. Special effects, such as the dropping of napalm and high explosives, are pulled off very effectively as well, but none more so than the authenticity of some of the wounds on the casualties, to such an extent the you often secretly wonder if the men will quietly slit the throats of their tragically maimed brothers in arms, to save them further indignity and suffering.WE WERE SOLDIERS should not be seen as a microcosm of America's involvement in the Vietnam War, but a degree of political exploration is unavoidable in such a sensitive subject. You cannot help wonder, as the men go into action on behalf of their country, what abstract platitude they went into battle for. The environment that Col. Moore and his men find themselves in is fully believable as hell on earth, even more so than as depicted in Oliver Stone's PLATOON, simply because were are able to see that a seemingly sane, normal, calm world is just on the other end of a radio receiver. The film's biggest strength, that of underlining how men's lives became dominated and identified by their occupation, is also its largest weakness. Because of the depiction of each man as a soldier first and a personality second, it is hard to empathise with any of them, except for scenes in which they encounter each other with soldierly obligations, such as when one platoon of men gets gut off from the main group, and the rest desperately feel the urgency to come to the aid of their embattled comrades.Despite its unbalanced feel, WE WERE SOLDIERS is effective at portraying the story of one individual unit in one specific confrontation. We need not worry that things seem too easy for the 'good guys,' as the horrors of war are inflicted onto them as much as they are for the enemy, who, despite having lost something like fifteen times killed the number of US soldiers, at the end watch the cavalry leave and wander out onto the battlefield with further re-enforcements. This moment, more than any other, brought home the reality that there are only wars because there are solders to fight them, and in the end, the ground the armies fight for is only as valuable as the blood that soaks into it from the bodies and hearts of the men who do the fighting.The film attests to be a tribute to the soldiers who fought in the 'Valley of Death,' and despite a feeling that it ignores the wider picture it does that very effectively. WE WERE SOLDIERS may not be everyone's cup of tea, for the reasons of lack of emphasis on the hollow and needless aspects of the waste and sacrifice in Vietnam, but for a film that shows what it is like to be down in the dirt, amidst the blood and mayhem of war, it cannot be faulted.",We Were Soldiers

Obviously a war film, Vietnam war. Just spent an engrossing 5 hours watching this. The film is only just over 2 hours, but i had to go out to do some shopping, in between the ironing and pause it whenever my daughter entered the room (not advisable for U18's). After the first 10 min, it had me hooked, and did not let go until the credits started rolling! Non biased, tried to tell it from both sides about the capture of a specific landmark. Absolutely not a bad accompaniment to the dreaded ironing chore. Now i am supposed to make up 10 lines to complete this review so here goes the filler.

210,forehead1,A view from across the pond [Could include spoilers],4,14 March 2002,"(A different perspective is needed for the non-Americans reading here.)I am bewildered by anyone claiming this film is ""moving"" in any form whatsoever.  It is plainly just another Saving Private Ryan clone, using a true story and occasional shots of families back home to detract from the fact that 75 per cent of what we see is simple gratuitous violence.Don't get me wrong, I loved Saving... and thoroughly enjoyed the gritty battle scenes depicted here.  I just take offence to the fact that this movie - and it appears many of its viewers - believe there is something deeper just because of an over-long opening half-hour and sporadic moments of gorping realisation from Gibson.  The brief sub-plot of the enemy trooper went almost unnoticed and was a feeble attempt to portray both sides 'equally'.    The battle scenes themselves were not immune from fault.  Some of the extras were going down like they'd just been tugged by a bungee rope, and 'invincible' Gibson managed to waltz around, head held high, like he owned the place for the entire three days without getting a scratch.  True story huh?  It reminded me of an old-fashioned war-movie at times, when you knew as soon as a soldier mentioned their home/wife/kids (delete as appropriate) they were going to be capped within the next five minutes. 
Some moments are incredibly cheesy and I found the typical Yankee-doodle-dah predictable and tiresome.  I would have had more respect for the film if it had kept to Gibson's character's claim that they were fighting for each other, not the country; yet what do we see at the end - the defeated enemy officer finding a 'stars n stripes' on the victorious battle field, the losers lying dead behind him.I was going to comment that Hollywood's blind patriotism must be boring even Americans by now, but looking at the views on this board it appears I am mistaken.  It was obvious this film was going to be a success after the September tragedy, but I just hope it doesn't help to stoke the fires of the 'war is good/revenge = justice' attitude President Bush seems to be emitting in the current state of affairs.Engrossing battle scenes, but the rest of the film tries to pretend it's something it's not.  4/10",We Were Soldiers
211,froboz,Interesting war movie,7,25 November 2002,"This movie tells the story of the 'first' major battle between US and Vietnamese troops in the Vietnam war. It's an interesting movie. The amount of cheese and hollywood cliché is so rich, they have to be kidding. It has an ironic feel to it, much like Starship Trooper. Scene after scene is so full of hilarious gems... The best bit with the movie is the large amount of fighting. Sometimes the story is not coherent, and the same scene - americans firing perfect shots at advancing vietnamese, who fall down en masse - is repeated over and over again. But at others times it's an excellent war movie. One especially perverse aspect I enjoyed is the almost pornographic exposure of wounded persons, complete with sentimental music. They even whisper some 'perfect' last words... Another funny thing is watching Mel Gibson whacking everyone loudly on the helmets, adding his fatherly touch as leader of the american soldiers. The real advantage of the movie is that it actually tells the story about a battle. It is a 'clean' battle. That's refreshing. The typical american Vietnam movie is usually about dope smoking soldiers performing atrocities. In movies like 'Platoon' and ""Full Metal Jacket' the directors could not care less about the overall military aspect of what's happening. The overall picture told in ""We Were Soldiers"" is that the american military goal was really void of strategy - ""kill the enemy"", what a laugh - and that the tactics involved an outrageous amount of risk taking, both with lives and with the possibility of disaster for the operation. In the end, the americans pull it off. They do indeed manage to make the Vietnamese body count high.

Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot are excellent, as is the whole cast, and the battle is intense, horrifying and appropriately unpleasant (war after all isn't fun).  I can not however give it a 10. The handling, or maybe mishandling of the women at home makes me hesitant.  There seems a falsness to their scenes for the most part.  Not all of it, but most of the women and their interactions with one another all seem forced. It is no fault of the actresses, who seem to take the material they have been given just about as far as it can go.  Like I said though, not all of the women's scenes feel strained (watch closely the second letter delivery which is nicely acted and remarkably touching).The movie does not let one view the action at too great a distance. This is no John Wayne war movie, all heroics and patriotism without much reflection on the conflict being portrayed.  This movie isn't about flagwaving, which is shocking considering Randall Wallace, the films writer and director, also wrote the worthless and pathetic Pearl Harbor. There is however alot to be said for good direction.  And Wallace here demonstrates some more discretion with cheesy manipulative tactics than the director of Pearl Harbor demonstrated. It is there, mostly in some questionable shot composition, but still present. Note to all future film-makers making war pictures, placing key actors in scenes with conspicuously placed U.S. flaggs almost always seems contrived. What is really interesting about this vietnam war film is that it almost completely sidesteps politics.  We see that politics are going to play a role in landing Lt. Col. Moore (the Gibson character)and his men in a really tight spot. Moore knows this is going to cost lives, maybe even his own but he is a soldier, he will do his best to achieve his objective and reduce the loss of life of his men.  Also in leaving the politics out of it and also showing both sides of fight we realize, as we watch, that both sides really aren't that different, that ultimately the men on either side are fighting for the same reason. The viewer also notices that all of the combatants, except for Gibson and Elliot, are young, barely one over thirty.  And I think for americans that is such a key difference from WWII and the Vietnam conflict.  Young, young men went to fight in Vietnam.  It is a fact that even the main character, Moore, finds hard to get over.  ""I look at the men and all I see are my boys."" The film can't dwell on the disillusionment that grew as the conflict lengthened, however it shows how the seeds were planted. The movie's thesis is that a soldier doesn't fight for country, for ideas, for abstracts, but that the soldier fights for the man next to them, for thier platoon, their family. It is the same message as that in Black Hawk Down, and I think the same message that you might find the film Platoon.  I don't know if that is completely true but movies like Black Hawk and We were soldiers certainly make one understand why that motivation is so integral to the soldier.",We Were Soldiers
218,ColonelFaulkner,Not bad but could have been a lot better.,6,28 June 2004,"I saw this film at the theatre when it came out and thought it was pretty good on the big screen.I have it on DVD and have watched it a couple more times. Unfortunately my opinion of this film has lessened with two repeat screenings.I'll still rate it a 6 out of 10 because the battle scenes are largely very good.It's not a bad film but could have been a lot better given the subject material, the historical background and the scale of the battle. I haven't read the book about the real event.I loved Sam Elliot as the Sgt Major and thought Barry Pepper was good.With subsequent viewings I have paid more attention to what I think are the overbearing clichés, patriotism and corniness (""I'm glad I could die for my country"", ""tell my wife I love her"", ""we'll give 'em hell sir"" etc).While there's nothing wrong with patriotism and I can't speak from experience, I suspect Hoot (Eric Bana)in Blackhawk Down was far more realistic about men under fire when he said ""Once that first bullet goes past your head politics goes right out the window"" and ""It's about the man next to you"". Colonel Moore (Gibson) seems too perfect. An officer, gentleman, historian, wonderful father, husband, religious man and leads from the front. He would be a shoe-in for President. He seemed a bit too gung-ho under fire. All that was missing was for him to be holding an M-60 (heavy machine gun) in one hand and firing it from the hip. Did he not have any weaknesses?Perhaps Gibson had too much influence over the director in regards to the character of Moore. They have worked together on Braveheart and I think Gibson's company made the movie (I may be mistaken).Not an Oscar winning performance from Gibson, but it appeared to be a Medal of Honour winning performance from Moore.Some other annoying bits:Director Wallace seems to love killing people off in mid-sentence. If I go to war I'm going to keep my mouth shut. I'm less likely to become a casualty.We are introduced to the Japanese American soldier who informs us that he is about to become a father, it's so blatant that we should endear ourselves to him a bit more just before he is horrifically (mortally?)wounded.I know that they can do wonders with special effects these days but do the directors judge the success of their project by seeing if they can outdo the last war film by illustrating even more horrific injuries then the last film (Saving Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldiers). I think we got the blood splatter on the camera lens at least 3 times in WWS.Remember Elias getting killed in Platoon. Not a limb missing or head exploding in sight (ok, the squibs didn't go off) but still dramatic and moving.Did the American soldiers carry entrenching tools? I would have thought that in a battle like that soldiers would have been digging in with spades, helmets or even their hands. A lot of them seemed to be relying on vegetation for cover. It's not paintballs being fired.Another thing that irks me are the next of kin notifications coming in while the battle rages. ""The army wasn't ready"" says Moore's wife. They seemed right up on ther play with forwarding the bad news home. How could they have had an accurate idea of casualties in the middle of the battle when most of ther KIA were still down in the field. I would have thought it may have been a couple of days or longer before next of kin could be notified.I realize what the director was trying to do here but he broke up the momentum of the film and the grieving widows after the battle and near the end of the film would have been a far more realistic and poignant ending to the film, especially contrasted with Moore being able to return home to his family.I seem to be being very negative about the film. However, as stated before, it's not a bad film but it's disappointing because it could have been a lot better.Worth seeing.",We Were Soldiers
219,jimpowellsf,Well worth seeing,8,24 January 2006,"I'm not a Mel Gibson fan, so that's probably why I didn't see this in the move theaters. Or, was it even in the theaters? Anyway, I stumbled across this movie just at it begun on TV. I almost turned it off, but I'm glad I didn't.I think there are some sappy moments at the beginning, but given that the film is based on a true story, I'm sure moments like them happened in the somewhat innocent 1960s. As a film that covers the first major battle of Vietnam, it seems to offer an unbiased view (after all, the sentiment against the Vietnam war didn't exist yet in the U.S.).The battle scenes are compelling to say the least. And, the combatants on both sides are depicted well. It's a testament to the spirit of a fighter (whether or not you agree with the fight itself).Madeleine Stowe does a great job as the wife. Mel does a good performance of what is clearly a smart man. I got goosebumps during some of her later scenes as well as some of the battle scenes. The ensemble is great, and I think the movie does a very good job of covering the confusion, heroics, sacrifices, and politics of war. If only we could live in a world without war.",We Were Soldiers
220,mjanky,"Intense and touching, with decent characters.",8,11 October 2002,"My biggest complaint about the film ""Blackhawk Down"" was that the characters were never really developed, so it was hard for me to get emotional about their struggle. Just the opposite is true in ""We Were Soldiers"". Usually, the infantrymen in Viet Nam films are nameless faceless extras, but here many of the 'grunts' get a decent back-story just like the 'leaders' do to build on, and it helps when viewing the movie. When you care about the characters, it's a much more enjoyable experience even when the scenes are as brutal and graphic as they are here. Mel Gibson as the leader Hal Moore, borderlines on over-the-top, but as the film went on I began to accept it as accurate because 1) the real Hal Moore was a consultant during filming and 2) I bet over-the-top was mandatory when dealing with the many intense situations these soldiers and their families were faced with. Sam Elliot as an old crusty sargent was great and should be recognized at award time. In the middle of battle he tells all the young soldiers ""Any of you call me grandfather and I'll kill ya."" Greg Kinear is also very good as an arrogant helicopter pilot, who backs up his boasts when it counts. Good, not great performances are put in by Chris Kline and Barry Peppar. Madeline Stowe is adequate as the wife of Hal Moore who takes on the role of leader of the wives left behind. As I mentioned earlier the battle scenes are extremely graphic and disturbing, but never gratuitous. Randall Wallace who had double duty as both writer and director, never glorifies the violence, whether it's Americans or the Vietnamese. The 'days-long' battle portrayed here was the first major one of the war for the U.S. and took place in 1965, so it was refreshing not too see a lot of the drug-use and anti-war rhetoric that took place as the war went on, as shown in Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket. I was born in 1962 so naturally I have no real recollection of Viet Nam, but looking at a lot of the comments from other IMDB users that were there; they have positive things to say about the movie, and that's probably the best compliment Mr. Gibson and Mr. Wallace could hope to receive. 9 of 10.",We Were Soldiers

Mel Gibson is a general guy and is in charge of the platoons in vietnam. I liked the uniqueness in the movie and how it showed more detail into the Vietnam War than I had ever seen. The other war movie I saw and liked a lot was ""Saving Private Ryan"" and if you liked this movie I recommend you see that one. We Were Soldiers had M-16 rifles. They also showed how the USA schooled the Vietcong for a while with that nepalm too. If you like war movies I recommend you see this.",We Were Soldiers
222,Stanjaudit,I'm a Vietnam Vet,8,24 April 2013,"I must agree with the reviewer from Texas. Vietnam was a misunderstood and very unpopular war. I'm also retired Air Force and I volunteered for Vietnam. I arrived in Vietnam 7 December 1965. One month after the events of the Is Drang Valley. Why this war was unpopular can be debated. Needles to say it was the first war fought from the Whit House and not the commanders in the field. It's only now with the declaration of Vietnam Recognition Day established this year we are beginning to earn the respect we should've received when we returned home from Vietnam. It was not our fault it was an unpopular war. Vietnam was the first war where reporters and the TV camera was right there to show the horror and the liberal side of the war, not actually what was happening. The truth of the matter war is hell--it's not pretty. It's ugly and people die. This movie We Were Soldiers portrays a very accurate look at warfare in all it's horror and ugliness.",We Were Soldiers
223,TiminPhoenix,Pity those that will never understand the courage of such men,9,22 January 2004,"This movie has a soul. It shows respect for the American Soldier.  It isn't politically correct among many, including some of the posters here to do that it seems.Pity those who can't grasp the concept of men who believe there are things bigger than themselves and who bet their very lives on that belief.  The film accomplishes this tribute to the soldier by also giving due to the NVA Regular who fought with bravery. Nothing shows the nobility of a fighting man than by showing the quality and courage of his opponent. Like Colonel Moore says in his prayer however, he understands their humanity to a degree but wants them to die in battle and not his men.  That's compassion laced with a real world understanding of how things are.Men who throw themselves on grenades, who charge into enemy fire, who while wounded themselves risk themselves again to save a comrade are not Hollywood cliches.  There are countless citations of such acts made from Breed's Hill to the Sunni Triangle.  With the Sunni Triangle, it's happening as I type these words.  Kinear did a fine job showing the humor that is so common among men in the military.  Sheppard caught the spirit of the professional Sgt. Major, Barry Pepper displays well a time when an American journalist saw that he was first an American and then a reporter.This movie captures the worth and nobility of the typical American soldier. 
By the way, the only reason we have a film industry that produce films from all perspectives is because the American soldier made it possible. And this holds true for every nation in the world where films are made that are not censored by their government.  Because if it wasn't for the United States and her soldiers, freedom wouldn't exist anywhere.Remember that when you eat your popcorn.",We Were Soldiers

This was the first great battle of the war, I suppose soldiers were really professionals and not just poor people forced to fight. This explains the lack of wrong characters as happens in the rest of the big Vietnam films.Nevertheless, it's like the Star Wars films, bad guys seem to be cross-eyed. Because a few scenes depicting the local forces the film pretends to be portraying both sides, but it´s not like that.",We Were Soldiers
225,brvhrt-4,Be warned...,6,22 February 2002,"WE WERE SOLDIERS is not the kind of movie I feel comfortable saying ""I enjoyed"" or ""I liked.""  But I'm not sure that's the reaction one is supposed to have upon seeing it.  GLORY and BRAVEHEART took us to the middle of the battlefield like never before.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN showed us the frenzied chaos of modern warfare with new and brutal realism. WE WERE SOLDIERS may end up being the film that some claim goes too far in portraying the unspeakable horror of war.  I attended a screening that consisted largely of Vietnam veterans and their wives.  Several attendees excused themselves suddenly during the battlefield scenes which make up more than half of the movie.  Many watched through covered faces and teary eyes. But when the credits began to roll, not a soul moved.  Not one.  It was only when the lights came up that the audience responded with brief applause before getting up to leave.  And I am sure I am not the only one who left the theatre with a sickening knot in my stomach.The story of WE WERE SOLDIERS is thin at best.  After an introduction to the major characters, all are thrown into the hell of battle, either the physical hell of Vietnam or the mental anguish of waiting on the homefront for news one hopes never comes.  For the rest of the movie, it becomes about one thing: which characters will stay alive?  Which, I realize, is part of the point in a movie like this, because that's what it became about for the soldiers: staying alive.  Not how they got there, not whether or not they should have been there, not how they felt about being there-- just staying alive.  And the battlefield scenes are the most horrific I have ever seen, previously cited examples included. They are gory, they are long, they are brutally relentless.  Again, I understand that is perhaps part of the point, part of the lesson about war.  But that is a hard thing to ask of a theatre full of people who have paid 8 dollars apiece to see a movie that doesn't look especially violent based on the trailer.In the end, I can't say I ""enjoyed"" WE WERE SOLDIERS.  I can't say I ""liked"" it.  What I can say is that, for the first time, I may have some tiny, infinitesimal, ultimately meaningless fraction of a notion of what my father-in-law went through in Vietnam, and why he's never spoken a word about it to anyone.  And that, perhaps, is a much more important thing to be able to say.",We Were Soldiers

230,igm,We Were Soldiers Once...and Maudlin,7,11 March 2002,"This movie opens with the words:  ""This is the true story...""  Were it not for these words, I would be ready to dismiss the sentimentality, brutality, and ultimately the victory of Lt Gen Hal Moore as a Hollywood contrivance. The fact is that Moore walks this earth, these events did happen, and men died horribly on a far-off battlefield at the behest of their misguided countrymen.The movie is based on journalist Joe Galloway's and Moore's account of their involvement in a 1965 battle in North Vietnam.  It was refreshing and enlightening to see how a battle actually plays out, with attention to terrain, timing, numbers, artillery and air support, communication, transport, and carnage.  The usual war film structure--character and plot development, firefight, more development, firefight, epiphany, firefight, resolution--is abandoned in favour of initial development, then a continuous firefight serving as the backdrop for several well-rounded characters: Moore (Mel Gibson), Galloway (Barry Pepper), Lt Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein), and Maj Bruce 'Snakeshit' Crandall (Greg Kinnear).We Were Soldiers is also tribute to the heroism, intellect, and compassion of Moore.  And if at times the movie's Moore is saccharin-sweet, as when he prays with his children, comforts a new father in his ranks, or pays his respects to the widow of an enemy soldier, I can forgive the movie because I suspect much of this rings true with the living, breathing, death-dealing Moore of real life.  While Gibson's portrayal lacks the charisma of Crowe's Maximus (Gladiator), Neeson's Schindler (Schindler's List), or even Gibson's Wallace (Braveheart), I was nevertheless moved.Seven out of ten.",We Were Soldiers
231,Artdoag2,the untold story of the early years of Vietnam,7,5 February 2005,"This is a solid war movie, and I enjoy watching it once a month. Well, given the fact that I am a Huey junkie, the chopper scenes certainly help. A friend of mine commented, ""Well, it's strange, the soundtrack to the movie is tribal in nature, and there's no memorable Sixties' tunes, like in other Nam movies."" I explained to him that WWS to place in 1965, about a year or two before the huge appearance of the anti-war movement, and certainly predating the hippie movement, so these elements weren't meant to appear.A lot of it is fictionalized, but then again, so were many aspects of Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan (some of the only worthwhile modern war movies in about the last twenty years). We Were Soldiers tells the rather un-hip story of the early Vietnam years, so, I must state again, that this is why you don't hear any tunes from the Rolling Stones, The Doors, or Zeppelin. That's 1968 onward... I guess... and WWS does a commendable job.The uniforms are right on target with the 1965-66 timeframe. The choppers used featured equipment and weapons that wouldn't appear until a year or two later, but that's OK. The combat scenes capture the essence of the fighting, and thankfully no retarded cuts or zooms were used. However, we don't see a single M14 rifle (the precursor to the M-16, which is seen all over the place in WWS), as most of the troops would have been using them as the M16 wasn't fully deployed to units at that time. But the best thing I can say is that the characters of 2LT Geoghan (or whoever), SGM Plumley, and SGT Savage look incredibly like their real-life counterparts, as far as i could tell in the photo section of the novel. That kind of accuracy is commendable. The true-to-life events, such as the airstrike, are well done.I do have some gripes though... having served in the Army (1996-2001), there are some shortcomings that I am able to spot. There is not enough development given to make enough of the supporting characters memorable. This worked in Black Hawk Down, but not here. Plenty of faces appear beyond the top and second-billed characters, but something was missing. I would have liked to see more of Too Tall (the other pilot), Godbolt (the black dude), Jimmy Nakawama (got burned bad) and CPT Nadal (""we have an American Platoon... OUT THERE!""). They're mentioned plenty of times, and they function to give what I call their ""partner character"" some depth, but they themselves either appear, disappear, or don't have enough lines. Also, the sound is not terribly well-mixed as some of the dialogue is muffled, and the editing is about average. Some key scenes take place in near darkness, so knowing who's who as well as the emotional impact is missed.One thing that really irks me is.... the lack... no, the absence of the portrayal of black soldiers. PFC Godbolt is Geoghan's partner character, but he doesn't get a single line. He looks like a nice guy, throws a grenade, gets shot, dies. Obviously, black soldiers made up quite a bit of the Army in 1965 (and even now.... almost pointless to say) but there's no representation of them (I Don't MEAN ""THEM"" IN A BAD WAY, OK??) except for Godbolt's wife back home. The Asian soldier, Jiimmy Naki-something, appears, for like a split second in the beginning, then runs into Joe Galloway (I cant remember the guys name) during the attack. The he gets wounded. He's about the only minority who gets a line. Both he and Godbolt were real people...hmmmm.... The voice-over narration is used very spottily, and this coulda been polished up. Finally, there is a mention of ""losing a boatload of draftees is a bad week"": the draft wasn't in effect until 1969.Nevertheless, WWS is a solid war movie that tells the lesser-known era of the Vietnam involvement. Yeah, everyone knows about the hippies, the peace signs on the soldier's helmets, the out of reg uniforms, the negative attitude, but these are staples of Nam movies that take place later in the war. I wouldn't mind seeing a movie made that deals with the later years of the war (say, 1972). Plus Madeline Stowe does a good job in as supporting role. Plus she looks real cute when she does that flinch/double take when the cab guy arrives at her door.On par with BHD or SPR? No. But it is on the level of Platoon, Glory, and Hamburger Hill. 7 of 10",We Were Soldiers
232,dugan49,In the Upper Level Of Modern War Movies,8,20 September 2011,"Not as good as Saving Private Ryan or Blackhawk Down, but better than most other war movies of the past 25 years, We Were Soldiers is a no nonsense retelling of the first large scale engagement in Viet Nam between American troops and North Vietnamese regulars, in 1965. Mel Gibson stars as Colonel Hal Moore, who leads the famed U.S. 7th Cavalry , now air mobile, into a 'test' battle in the central highlands of Nam to judge the effectiveness of new combat tactics derived through use of helicopter transport of troops directly into a hostile ( hot lz) landing zone. Immediately upon landing, Moore's battalion is attacked by hundreds of NVA, regular soldiers of North Viet Nam who are based in the nearby hills. The attacking force soon balloons to thousands, and the Americans are outnumbered and surrounded. The movie then very diligently and dutifully portrays the hectic and brutal three day battle.The best thing about this movie is it's point of view, which shows the regard a commander has for his troops and his dedication to his duty and mission. Gibson is outstanding in portraying a decent yet disciplined leader who must maintain control and cohesion in the midst of chaos and incredible violence. Sam Elliot also stands out as the unit's Sergeant major, an old timer made of guts and granite.It's not a perfect movie and the violence , while overwhelming at times, is not as well done as in the two films I mentioned at the top. Still it has it's moments. A lot of them as a matter of fact.

233,bk-87668,A war movie in the wrong way,4,2 December 2007,"How to make a good war movie? It's easy: get the facts right and and get the battle scenes right. This movie fails with the facts and then some.The battle scenes look great with some obvious Vietnam stuff like napalm and period details like white phosphorus and so on. Though, a very unrealistic cliché is that the higher ranked the character, the more upright he walks and fights even under heavy fire.The dialogue contains some hilarious gems that I think are only now put in a script. Before that, they existed only as clichés. Imagine hearing ""tell my wife I love her"" from the mouth of a dying soldier, just after you thought this movie could be more cliché only if they did that.I guess by now it is well-known this movie doesn't really make the facts right. The battle is something off Green Beret. While it's probably quite banal having a Vietnam movie in which US doesn't exactly prevail by now, it's another thing to claim the opposite. You can still have your altruism and the other few good aspects of the human nature in a war even if you don't win.I find it surprising people approve of movies like this out of the respect they have war veterans (of their own side).

The last was mention for how many times, but with an effort to break the cliche' one of this line is uttered by a Japanese American trooper, brilliant right? i can only stupidly assume that this is a redemptional act of Randall Wallace,who probably feels guilty since he dehumanizes the Nipponese so much in Pearl Habour(2001) and, since he is taking Karate lessons(no..seriously!), he decided to come up with the idea, and what brilliant idea; an Asian, the supposedly central race of the enemy, also exist in the Troopers,hath become the tear jerking navigator of the third act.Also,since the producers are busy spending their money on 25 million a-piece-Mel-Gibson and buying C4 to destroy every green area that appears on the screen, they can't be bothered to show authenticity of location, therefore they decided to use some embarrasingly fake location(I'm guessing its still inside North America) and plant some plastic mini palm trees, wow.. this, i have to say, is pathetic. My gardener could do a better job producing a the set in my golf field, only i don't have a gardener and i don't play golf.Mel Gibson have become the master of everyday man's leader, all he need to do is reposition his facial wrinkles and Voila!, Madeliene Stowe is criminally underused, looking very artifical here, she was at her best in Twelve Monkeys(1995), Chris Klein as the young pop, im glad that he didn't get more screen time than he needs to, this guy just doesn't worth the $ for me, that face would forever be remembered as the singing cherry popper in America pie series or the try hard in Rollerball(2002), official Soldier actor Barry Pepper takes the role of a war photographer, and remembering him as the sharp shooter from Saving Private Ryan (1998) i start my stop watch, counting when he is going chuck the Minolta away and pick up the colt to smoke some VC, it was roughly in the 29th minute i think.Simon the gay a.k.a Greg Kinnear plays Pilot Snakesh*t Crandall, why Snakesh*t? because he flies Lower than snakesh*t..(gee whiz) he got his moments, but thankfully he is not on screen long enough to keep singing.Lastly the good ole' Sam Elliot as Dirty Dozen-ish Lee-Marvin-on-acid sporting Plumley,an effortless yet effective role as the tough talking veteran who preffers the Handgun rather than the M-16, he also acts as the only person who never dodge bullets yet manage to survive unscatched, i can only assume that the Vc felt sorry for this gramps.Some good guilty-free Highlight does exist in the film, i wouldn't deny that; the Parallelic resonance mind connection between Col.Moore and the Vietnamese Colonel Nguyen, each reading the moves of each others strategies,or the inner tension that beats whenever Soldier damsels sees cabs arriving in front of their houses(it means they carry telegram of death news), although i'm not sure why didn't the Goverment show more respect and send an army Lackey instead.Ok, i still think this movie is bad in that ""propaganda-ish"" kind of way, can't help it though, its an American Movie, with american money, and made mostly for American audience,so its only normal to show a hint of patriotism in a right wing kinda way,an Usbekiztan movie about Usbekiztan troopers againts pygmies invasion will most probably also shows the patriotism brotherhood of Usbekiztanians helding hands whilst ak-47-ing them damn pygmites.I consider myself a westernized Asian, having been living in western countries most of my life,i do not use chopsticks on my bowl of noodle and i do not practice kung-fu (sometimes caucasians are so curiously friendly, when they learn that you are of Chinese origin, the first thing they will ask is ""hey do you know kong-fuu?""), alas not a native english speaker(that explains the dodgy english ppl.), however when i saw my fellow friends (who are Chinese) next to me cheering for the Harrier bombers pulping Vcs to ashes and Mel Gibson riddling holes effortlesly to 199 Vc soldiers rushing towards him(they cheer for Mel and the Bombers of course) i cannot help it but to feel this aching hunch on my shoulder, not because that i have problem with seeing Asian oriented extras being hole punched with CGI fire and squibs so that they can get their paychecks later on, but because i realize how in the long shot this kind of film could unhealthily manipulate the minds of people, leading them to believe whatever biased, dramatized act presented on screen , thus removing the audiences from a more complex truth, hell, talking about the power of media. Truth is indeed scary, i only hope, if theres another ""Anti-war"" flicks let it be ones which goes more along the line of Thin Red Line(1998), where affection and depth are showed from two opposing sides, and the study of inner humanity is richly embraced, not artificially sugar coated.ps: Windtalkers is just out on the cinema, after this chunk i doubt it that i want to see Nick Cage wielding two tommy guns, one on each hand, sliding in the air for 5 seconds while sending 99 running Japanese troops to the bowels of Hades, it has become an essential unwritten rule in hollywood films that all historical war villain troops have to run towards the good guys, holding firearms but by any means not using 'em, since screaming in villainish rage is life threatening enough.1.5 outta 5 stars.+1.5 for entertainment factor that glorifies the fact that war is not so horrible if shoulder to shoulder male bonding occurs..(sarcasm intended).-3.5 for all the factors in the film that forced me to write this review which ends up more like a personal contrived opinion.",We Were Soldiers
236,bsvends1,Very good!,8,21 October 2002,"I never been in combat, but I felt this movie showed how it really is.

237,reporterman2000,Great film,9,2 October 2002,"""We Were Soldiers"" is an excellent war movie and an excellent film, period. It is meticulously researched and based on a fine book of the same title. Read that book, and you will understand that A) the U.S. filming locations ARE realistic in portraying the Central Vietnam Highlands and that B) many of the ""corny"" or ""sentimental"" events of the film are straight from the actual battle and have been religiously incorporated into the movie. If WWS isn't clever and ironic enough for some viewers, well, Platoon wasn't very hip, clever or ironic, either, and this movie would serve as a good introduction to that film. Mel Gibson's performance here ranks with his passionate, zesty work in Braveheart. He is never anything less than convincing, and yet for a larger-than-life role, he never comes across as an invincible hero or a superstar. Frankly, I forgot that I was watching Mel Gibson and simply accepted him as Col. Hal Moore. One of the best movies of the year, if not the best movie of the year.",We Were Soldiers
238,Logan_5,Awesome movie about real men,10,27 March 2002,"As an American I was touched by this movie and the courage of the men portrayed. The real Colonel Moore was present for the filming of the movie and was adamant about the movie portraying events as true to life as possible.  His wife really did hand out the Western Union telegrams to the other wives because the US Army at the time had not foreseen the eventual escalation of U.S. dead.  For the non-americans this movie offended, I can only say proudly this was an American movie about American heroes in what most Americans feel like was a tragic war that we wanted no part of. This movie was needed to give insight into the realities of the Vietnam War. I have 4 Vietnam War veterans in my family. All four saw combat either in the Marines or Army. Only one ever saw any drug use and he worked side by side with with a group known then simply as ""The Company"".   This movie is excellent and should be a must-see for every American Teenager. Mel may be an Aussie, but I would like to proudly point out he was born in New York.",We Were Soldiers
239,panduh,A little too sappy/patriotic to be a great film.,7,11 March 2002,"This is not a horrible film by any means.  There are a lot of gripping, visceral battle scenes, and the film does make an effort to try and show the Viet Cong as humans, although, it achieves this only towards the end, (towards the beginning, the VC are portrayed as the same ol' stereotypical Yellow Menace -- commander barking out stilted, harsh commands, et al).The thing that makes the movie unsatisfactory for me is undue sappiness and an overly religious and patriotic tone.  Unlike ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Thin Red Line"", which both try and make attempts at showing the gritty, painful life and experience from the eyes of a soldier during a war without covering it with unnecessary sentimentality, ""We Were Soldiers"" has a more ""idealized"" view.  Even though the movie does an good job of displaying the futility of the Vietnam War, and shows some of the more graphic violence that accompanied it, the acting by the leads and much of the script has an ""over-the-top"" nationalism attached to it that made me squirm in my seat more than watching a artillery soldier getting burnt to a crisp by napalm. Scenes such as the ""prayer scene"" in the chapel that Gibson has with Chris Klein as they pray for Kleins new-born baby were relatively unnecessary, in my opinion. It only served to give an excuse for schmaltz later on in the film and pound us over the head with fact that Gibson's character is so great and kind-hearted and the ideal God-fearing soldier of the U-S-of-A. It was like a big, loud alarm for you to realize that ""Hey something is gonna happen to this kid that will make you sad and weepy. Take note!"" Also, Klein's character, who is supposed to be a tragic figure, for some reason did not feel tragic enough to me. I think the major reason is that Chris Klein simply is not the right actor for this part. He is completely unconvincing, and lets face it, he is not a very good actor. I am sad to say he resides in the same league as Keanu Reeves when it comes to acting skill. Barry Pepper would have been a much better choice in that role, seeing as how miniscule his actual part is and is pretty much wasted.
Mel Gibson does an adequate job, but his style and mannerisms don't necessarily translate well into this type of roll.  He does the crazy little ""look over to the side"" move he perfected in Lethal Weapon, while he speaks. This is a bit disconcerting, and is not befitting behavior for a battle-hardened veteran.  His emotional display at the end of the movie is also fairly hard to believe.  On the other hand, when Gibson is actually on the battlefield commanding the battle, he is thoroughly convincing, and that is where he shines!  He is at once valiant, courageous, strategic and compassionate.  The battle scenes display Mel's true talents as an actor. The non-battle segments of the film are better left forgotten. (For example, the above mentioned chapel scene, and the scene where Mel has to explain to his baby daughter what a war is made me cringe).Finally, I just wanted to add that I had a helluva time trying to understand what Sam Elliot was saying throughout the movie.  His drawl was so thick, that it sounded like he made the film with a mouthful of marbles.  It would have served the film well to provide subtitles just for Elliot's lines. Even though his role as the tough-as-nails drill sergeant was a tad stereotypical, he played it about as well as anybody could short of Clint Eastwood.  I just wish the director had tried to get more intelligible takes of his scenes!  I'd also like to give a big thumbs up once again to Barry Pepper, for his great, albeit small, performance in this film as a military reporter caught on the battlefield.  But the little overlay ""montage"" scene where he is taking various photos on the field was way cheesy and completely out of place. That was a real sore-spot for me.  I can't state enough how much that montage completely stunk, and is a clear sign of bad direction.",We Were Soldiers
240,jrhpax,For fascists only,1,19 July 2002,"You'd think that after ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" and ""Platoon,"" Hollywood had outgrown Vietnam War movies such as ""We Were Soldiers"" -- which resembles John Wayne's ""Green Berets"" and other simplistic, warmongering movies. ""We Were Soldiers"" shows a nearly all-white cast of soldiers who are the straightest group of patriots ever in a platoon; hardly anyone smokes, let along does drugs or questions authority.Mel Gibson's heroic performance is preposterous. That this movie is based on a true story doesn't make him or it seem realistic. The women are overly made-up Barbie dolls. What a waste of the talent of Madeleine Stowe, who was so wonderful in ""Short Cuts.""There's no hint that the war was one of greatest moral and political debacles in U.S. history. Instead, the mentality is ""Let's kill more of the enemy."" The war scenes are predictably stirring, but the movie is one cliche after another. The movie is morally reprehensible and ludicrous.

We Were Soldiers was one of my favorite war films growing up and still is one of my favorites. Director, Randall Wallace, takes you into this gritty, realist war film. What stands with the directing style of, We Were Soldiers, is the use of a steadicam affectively for action sequence. When you watch this film you get right into the middle of the action, seeing all the detail and emotions. I like the film grain; it adds to the grittiness of war. The performances in We Were Soldiers are great and succeeds with giving the characters life. It's always bad in films characters are so flat and lifeless because of the acting and character development. You get none of that in this film. Mel Gibson leads in We Were Soldiers and this by far one of his best performances of his career. The emotion you feel from beginning to end from Gibson is astounding. From the very beginning you see that he cares about being a parent, husband, & soldier. By the end of this film Mel Gibson has my eyes tearing up because of how much he loves his country and soldiers. The only tiny problem with this film is that it falls to little war movie clichés, but that didn't bother me. We Were Soldiers comes highly recommended for those who love war films.",We Were Soldiers

As one reviewer puts ""The battle scenes did not show us anything new"". Should Wallace had made up unrealistic battles scenes. I think too many of you are wanting the special effects to rule the movie. I will agree that some of the dialogue is ""hammed"" up but maybe some of you critics should include a better line in your review.

248,hughluver13,"A Work of Art, though not everyone has the same Taste **SPOILERS**",10,16 September 2003,"'We Were Soldiers' was a very touching movie as well a very, very sad book. If you did not like the movie, read the book, if you did not like the book, watch the movie. I watched it with my father, brother, and mother in a small and cramped movie theater. Many teenagers to catch the newest gory film, a few group of men, who knows why they were there. Then, there was the oh so few group of old seniors, veterans (I guessed) of the war. I didn't have much time to think for my brother called my attention upon the screen, then a tale of death and truth woved before my very eyes. I felt tears come out of the corner of my eyes when I had no clue I was crying, I, a person who loves war movies, actually had to turn away when they shot the poor French man in the beginning. A man booed when one man said to tell his wife how much he loved her, people yelled at him and one man chucked a very deserving drink. The theater was silent, I could hear a person breath in the front row when the Lt Colonel stepped onto the helicopter. It was over, it was all over was all that went through my mind.I have inputed my thought before on a message board titled, Bad Movie. I have realized that not everyone loves an American, 'No Guts, No Glory' movie. So if you can't handle blood, grown men crying or true hardcore patriotism, then stay clear of the movie and watch anything else.
My entire family isn't even from America, I am a first generation Korean American, and I felt much sorrow when I watched the flag wave. I found the movie a feeder of the soul, I cried, I laughed and I smiled. But maybe because I'm just a kid, maybe I really don't know but I must say, I loved this movie.10/10.",We Were Soldiers
249,Arthur21743,"Vietnam -- Its Legacy, Its Lessons for Us Today",10,5 June 2014,"This film touched my heart in the way it showed the valor, the commitment, the utter devotion and supreme dedication of those whose awful task it was to go to Vietnam and suffer and die, or suffer and live (in many cases a fate worse than death), all for nothing. Well, it wasn't exactly for nothing, was it?. Many made fortunes off that war, and it is the contrast of the dedication of these great patriots, misguided and downright misled though they were, with the behind-the-scenes corruption and greed that used Communism as an excuse to wage a no-win war at the expense of human life that I wish to address.I must say the movie did a good job in portraying just how awful it was to have to endure all that over there in Vietnam, and it gave me a new respect for those who went through it all.Frankly, I didn't make it past the first jungle scene or two before I had to switch off. I couldn't bear to watch all that suffering and dying... all in vain. I was looking at this story of the war in Vietnam with hindsight, since I knew how it was going to end, and my heart groaned over that waste of human life that was going to accomplish nothing good. We were never meant to win.Vietnam stank of Machiavellianism on an international scale.Niccolo Machiavelli was a sub-human parasite. He lived in the 1700's I believe. He was a master at profiting from wars and disputes between peoples. If there was no conflict going at the moment he would try to instigate one, and then pretend to befriend both sides behind both their backs. By controlling the purse strings he could keep each side from getting too dominant and annihilating the other, thereby destroying that side's ability to pay off the war debt and also keeping the conflict alive as long as possible. Can we see any resemblance to the Vietnam war here? People back here at home smelled a rat and hated the war. Maybe they couldn't put their finger on the problem, but they knew something was deeply wrong. There was some talk about America having lost her resolve to make the world safe for democracy. Why should the world's greatest power not be able to bring a two-bit country like North Vietnam to its knees, they wanted to know, and couldn't articulate why not.It wasn't about resolve, it was about money, and sacrificing human life to feed the economy and line the pockets of the ones who stood to gain at the expense of our fighting men's very lives. The problem is that some of those people who opposed the war also hated our own soldiers for participating in the war. It is in the honor of those valiant men that this review is dedicated. They were patriots and should never have been mistreated by their own, no matter how misguided or exploited they were. They didn't question, they just obeyed. They followed orders, as they were taught to do.I can't speak for the Army of today, but I can tell you about how it was back in the sixties. Independent thought was discouraged. You were taught to follow orders without question. Military life may always be so. It always has been, that's for sure. I remember one of the Dirty Dozen movies where there was a mission given the dozen to kill some general who planned to assassinate Hitler. The sharpshooter had the general in his sights but the problem was that Hitler was there too, and he thought Hitler made a better target. I remember Lee Marvin's character saying several times, ""Just the general"".He knew that the higher ups in America wanted Hitler alive so he could keep on making his strategic blunders and keep on losing the war for his country. But would Marvin's character confide that to his sniper underling? Not on your life. Just obey orders and do not ask questions was his approach to command.When I took an oath upon joining the Army I remember I had to sign a paper giving up my rights under the Constitution of the United States of America, especially that of free speech. We were ushered into another room after the swearing-in where it was explained to us that we were now property of the U.S. Army. ""GI"" stands for government issue. You became a part of the weapons arsenal, with your own serial number, even. The power and control that is exerted over you is deep and intense. It is hard to imagine what pressure these men who went to Vietnam were subjected to in order to get them to fight this awful war.All I can say for those poor, blind, and misguided souls who fought in Vietnam is may God bless them, both living and dead. I deeply appreciate their unselfish devotion to their country and to the oath they swore.And the opposite for all those who exploited them for financial gain.",We Were Soldiers

This was a topic that has been avoided for far too long and Vietnam should be brought up. We should not shed light on the corrupt politics that needlessly slaughtered 58,000 boys for no lasting gain, but on the bravery and courage of the men who fought.

252,Cactus-7,A tribute to the American soldier,10,17 September 2002,"This film reinforces a lesson that the current generation of Americans have forgotten. Specifically, war will always be with us and someone had better be good at it. Those who have never served believe that war is absurd and we can all be friends with a group hug; the truth couldn't be more different. The 1965 battle of the Ia Drang Valley was, by the standards of heroism, equal to the Alamo. Without ruining the film for you, suffice it to say a handful of American soldiers from the First Cavalry (Airmobile) are surrounded by thousands of North Vietnamese Regulars. Like all American soldiers, they are a disciplined lot, fight as they have been trained and they mean to win. The crucible of combat brings out the best in them. Thankfully, ""We Were Soldiers"" also illustrates the valor of the UH-1 helicopter pilots who were such an integral part of the Airmobile operations. The rest of us may be grateful that those who would attempt to put us to the sword will have to face men like these. There are a few errors, but not many. For instance, taxis didn't deliver death messages at Fort Benning. An Army chaplain and an officer came as a team to deliver the message. Likewise, reporters didn't just jump on a chopper and head for the front. There's a little more to it than that. But Hollywood has always played fast and loose with the facts and it's unlikely that anyone would take this seriously. Sooner or later, some knuckle head will refer to this as an anti-war movie. It's not. It's just a war movie. And a damned good one.",We Were Soldiers

So, why another conventional one?Maybe if that film would have had the bravery to tell that particular story from a more creative, a more daring perspective. But sadly, the director decided to follow old fashioned, beaten paths.

I don't argue that America should battle there, but the message has become boring after watching it over and over again. ""Platoon"" brings together everything I hate about Vietnam movies so it's the worst example for me, with ""Born on the 4th of July"" close behind it.But I know that Kubrick and De Palma used the same setting to produce masterpieces ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Casualties of War"".""We were soldiers"" does not excel like the two I mentioned above, but is definitely a good movie despite those negative criticism it got from the critics. First of all it is an anti-war movie, not anti-Vietnam. It has a humanitarian attitude. ""Thin Red Line"" has the same attitude but so much that it was a distraction. Randall Wallace, gives a good mixture of combat and humanity.Mel Gibson is his usual self and does not disappoint.

At no point did I feel any sympathy for any of the characters. That's not me being mean-hearted, it's just the film is so false, yet based on true events.At 2 hours plus, it is far too long. This movie was dragged out like there's no tomorrow. It all could have been packaged better in 1 hour 35 minutes.Yet still, it would be a ""B"" movie.

257,jbbarrett,good flick,7,3 March 2002,"this movie was incredibly graphic. I really thought it was well made. It grabbed your attention with it's intense surreal battle scenes. However, this film is not without it's flaws. Namely, the biggest flaw is when they interrupt the grim intense and surreal battle scenes to cut to the reactions of the wives getting their telegrams about their dead. Who cares? As if they could get these telegrams out so fast that it could happen at the same time. Basically every single scene with the wives of the soldiers in it, every single scene, was worthless and could have been cut from the movie as it only constituted about ten mintues of film. It was very distracting.On the other hand, the characters, basically all of them, were very one dimensional. I didn't find this so distracting as the wife thing, but it bears mentioning. Hal Moore (Gibson)is the model person, it is almost ridiculous, but fortunately for the movie his shallowness is only contained in the first few minutes of the film. Once the action moves to Ia Dang, Gibson brings remarkable depth to an unremarkable character.Aside from the lack of depth, the obligatory wife scenes, and anything that has to do with chris klein, this movie was great. I take a point of for each infraction, 7/10.",We Were Soldiers

259,dbacke1,One of the More Accurate Vietnam War Movies,8,17 February 2010,"Despite all of the complaining, and some it justified, you can't hide the fact that this is definitely one of the more accurate Vietnam war films based on a real-life battle. Yes, the climactic battle scene is pure Hollywood, and I myself was very disappointed by it, but overall the events as they are portrayed in the film follow the book quite nicely. As another reviewer pointed out, it could have been one of the all-time great war films, but it fell a bit short. I do disagree with reviewers who try to paint this film as pro-American propaganda and revisionist. It is simply a Vietnam war film about the bond between a commander and his men in the field, and it was very well done in that aspect. I don't remember a whole lot of dialogue in the script about who was right and who was wrong, or why we were there. It was all about survival in the face of a determined enemy. I also don't agree with the reviewer who stated that the LZ Albany ambush was avoided in order to paint a one-sided version of the battle, because that was a separate event that didn't involve Colonel Moore or his men. Involving other units would have meant a much bigger film in scope, even though I still think that it could have been handled well. The battle scenes were some of the best filmed. However, as I stated earlier, Hollywood inevitably stepped in right near the end, and that is why the film was flawed. A more realistic climax and ending would have been much better, and still satisfying. Hopefully, some day in the future a filmmaker will avoid Hollywood clichés and finally get it 100% right.",We Were Soldiers
260,SILV3R,Mel Gibson war movie.,8,19 September 2002,"The whole movie is based around the battle which apparently started the Vietnam war (so a worthy subject to dramatise). Its a war movie with the usual Gibson sentiment, but despite the occasional Americana its very good. The battle scenes are amazing, with some originality thrown in for a change, not just old hat war stuff. Brilliantly filmed as you would imagine, and the CGI effects are kept to an apparent minimum (clearly they are there otherwise there would be a massive drop in the extras available in Hollywood).There is at least an attempt to explain why the war happened, although it is far from satisfactory. There is even an attempt to show that the ""enemy"" really aren't any different from US. The script is not Oscar worthy, but at least its not the usual cliches we associate with war movies. The cliches are there, but they are few and far between. The story has no massive surprises as its not that kind of film. Its about the battle. People die, people survive. Its more about the sensation of war that is forced upon you.I confess to watching this with the intent of not liking it. I generally don't like Americans doing war movies. This surprised me however by being a good movie. Gibson's performance is very much Braveheart with a gun, but as a starting block, there are worst characters to imitate. The biggest problem is that you leave wondering just how much of the story is true. It is after all an American film about war, based on a novel (We Were Soldiers Once...And Young) by an American guy who was in the battle, released at a time when America is at a war of sorts and needs something positive to lift them.A good movie which would have been great accept for my own cynicism.",We Were Soldiers
261,silentium,"Mediocre, on level with signs.",7,18 November 2002,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Just not enough depth; as we saw with mel's latest. this movie is just brain-numbingly mediocre and the dialogue can be memorized in one sitting - as it rarely has any asides from the commands. Gun fire and death does not make a movie - a movie is made by its context and its social significance; a movie is good when it relates to one in the way it was intended to do so. i really dont know what this movie was supposed to do ... entertain us? didn't do that. I just kept waiting on something sad / dramatic to happen; never came. worth a one night rental but i wish i had my $19.99 back so i could buy the special edition of Se7en (which is farly superior to the movie in question here) Signs didn't really have a purpose... the movie pace was awkward and it really didn't do much for me. the only sentiment that revived the film was the man running over father grahms wife (spoiler?) that and her telling, in her dying moments, for phoenix to swing away; perhaps she knew of the on-coming invasion and what was to happen and it was used through fate that she die so he'd have what she said to compell him to tell phoenix to swing away. average movie, not ground-breaking; worthy of a dvd collection.Not horrible, but it sure as hell isnt groundbreaking.

263,isbabo,now we're glorifying Vietnam?,2,31 July 2005,"This movie just plain sickens me. It shows the Americans at their absolute worst. It's hard to even know where to begin.For starters, it has every cliché in the book. The one soldier who has a pregnant wife at home, the black soldier who can't do his laundry in a white only laundromat but who will still fight for his country, the one soldier who spent a year in Africa with his wife building orphanages because ""he wanted to help orphans, not create them"" (so naturally he joined the army). Then to the battlefield where one soldier actually says before he dies ""I'm glad I died for my country"". Gibson bravely says ""no man will be left behind"" and sure enough, all are saved by the glorious teamwork and bravery of the American soldiers (after all, the U.S won in Vietnam right?.... read VERY sarcastically). The constant prayer gets annoying too, we all know Mel is a born again, and that''s fine, but it really doesn't have to be in every scene of every film he makes. In fact, at one point he's praying (for about the 8th time) and he asks god not to listen to the enemies ""heathen prayer"". This isn't an anti-American rant, if Britain made a film glorifying the occupation of India or Germany the invasion of Poland I'd feel the same way. This film is little more then a recruiting poster for Iraq II. The only thing that gives it a 2 is the fact that they show the North Vietnamese commander in a human light, he does care for his men and wants to win. He also says at the end that now they'll have to fight the Americans, but that the outcome will be the same as it was for the French. I don't want to knock the men who did fight in Vietnam (whether American, French, Vietnamese, South Korean, Australian etc.) but this is unnecessary. Go rent Platoon. Randal Wallace says in the commentary that this film is ""getting Vietnam right"" while making his sole source a Lt. Col who is portrayed in a very flattering light in the film. Platoon was researched asking privates and corporals in the U.S army what it was like. Better film and more accurate, rent it instead.",We Were Soldiers
264,spurs-2,It's a very brutal and at the same time a sad story.,9,10 June 2002,This is a film that is based on a true story and that is way it's so brutal and so direct and it showes both the enemy and the us soldiers as humans. It portrays they enemy as humans and as whorthy adversarys and not only focuses on the americans. Of course it's patriotic on US behalf but it showes the family at home and it showes the NVA-soldiers aswell as human. So I do recommend you to see it on the big screen.,We Were Soldiers
265,carpet_seller,very bad film,1,3 April 2002,"I am not one for writing reviews, But I do when a film is particularly bad or good imho.This one was particularly bad, it is a ""gung ho"" ""america rules the world"" ""america saves the world"" type of film.  It does not address the true causes of the Vietnam war: The western world ignoring president Diem's brutal facshist dictatorship and most importantly the US support of the dictator. Leading to the South Viet Cong formation and fight for freedom against a brutal government. The US supplying forces to help the Dictator, Diem. Then the Coup of 1963, leading to the assassination of Diem.  By now the US government run by Kennedy began to sit up and take notice, Kennedy knew these people were oppressed and as a result of the coup he was going to pull all his troops out of Vietnam and let them get on with it.  But the US generals who wanted a war decided then to assassinate Kennedy on the day before Kennedy's announcement to the nation that he was going to withdraw from Vietnam.  He was replaced by Johnson who declared to the nation the exact opposite that he would be sending more troops to South Vietnam.It was as usual the USA who caused this war, the vietnamese were fighting for freedom in their own country.  So when I hear lines in this film like ""Lord forgive our enemies heathen prayers and let us blow them all to hell"" and ""the spread of communism must be wiped out""  I just get annoyed that people watching this film are not being told the truth about why this all happened in the first place.  And just exactly what is wrong with being Buddhist?Also on top of that the film is NOT entertaining (because it is a graphic/explicit film about a brutal battle).  It is NOT educational (because it based on a lie and deception).  It serves very little purpose (it does touch on the futility of war but not enough) It is very badly scripted, with some really corny lines.  It is very boring for a lot of the time.  The ""stepford wives"" of the soldiers are also so pathetic.This film is definately ""walk out"" material, but I don't walk out of films cos I want to see the whole tragic thing so I can offer other people my views on it.  If you go to see this one and you feel like walking out, trust me you will not miss anything important you will only miss more of the same.1/10",We Were Soldiers

267,eyalsun,We Were Liars.,4,23 November 2002,"An unfathomably bad movie. Endless successions of comic book realism (Mel needs no cover, now bow before him), cliches, distortions of the truth and historical revisionism (lies), poor or otherwise absent acting, and a shameful dose of American triumphalism. That's right! Not even a hint of apologism in the invasion of Vietnam. Not to mention to expected incompetence of 4000 well-trained NVAs in their own territory vs. the 395 ra-ra-ra U.S. soldiers. History re-written and the quality of each armed forces authentic qualities go down the drain with Gibsonite technolywood propaganda which appears to have come out straight out of the mouth of the U.S. Department of Defence 30 years ago (that's right, 30 years ago). The proaganda; the disjointedness of the story; the Mel Gibson overacting & his new identity as more-patriotic-than-GWB (and he's Australian, is he not); the dialogue lines -- 'Glad to die for my country' , I almost threw up. Glad to be involved & to die for in a meaningless war that would kill 2 million Vietnamese - but wait, Vietnamese lives are worth 1/1000000000 of an American one so it's okay. Anyway they shouldn't have been committing terrorist acts on U.S. soil and trying to invade... Just wait Holywood will rewrite the Indochina conflict in this manner in 10 years. Such a surprise though, that the Vietnameese, led by THEIR George Washington, Ho Chi Minh, were not prepared to be ruled by French colonialism, why would they want to live under an American one, they were fighting for their independence.Alas for the three-sentence history lesson, those who like this movie, those who made this movie, clearly do not have the slightest care about history, just triumphalism and money. The glroious 395 Americans virtually annhilate the 4000 NVAs in cqc, again, was unfathomably painful to watch as it was reminiscent of so many, so - so many similar Holywood Vietnam propaganda movie - there are no shortage of these. The true gems: Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Hamburger Hill, etc., tend to be less submissive to the Holywood revisionisms.

268,ChainsawDaveandMisterShoop,Patriotic nonsense,1,3 June 2003,"I wouldn't normally comment on a film I hated, but this film really offended me. I Honestly believe it was only made for ""gun-nuts"" and young teenagers with an unhealthy obsession for explosions and military activity. There is pretty much no plot, except for Mel gloriously defeating ""the enemy"" in slow motion. There is no attempt to deal with the politics of War let alone the Vietnam situation, just simple US soldiers = good guys, everyone else = bad guys. Honestly I think this film was made as a military advert to aid recruitment. The characters are hardly even introduced before we are expected to be caring about their battles. Mel has made some great films in Signs and Braveheart so why did he touch this script. It must have been some guilt trip or favor. Compared to Platoon , Thin Red Line, Paths to Glory or Full Metal Jacket this film looks like empty hollow trash.Once again The Vietnam War is being portrayed as an American tragedy, not a Vietnamese one.

Many people says: ""Hey, that's war, that really happens"", I know, I'm not saying it doesn't. And it has been shown in a hundred other movies, so, why make another one?I found this movie to be a fairly average american war-movie (with the exception of two or three scenes which were really AWFUL) with lots of blood and deaths to shock the audience and lead them to say: ""Gee, war is bad"". It amazes me the high rating it has achieved in IMDB.One comment made often is the one that says: ""It's an american movie, that's why it only shows americans"". Well, imagine that a movie comes out showing the vietnamese as heroes and the americans as a bunch of idiots whose deaths are given 1/10th of a second on-screen, would you be happy about it?

274,JT-Saint,We Were Not Entertained,3,8 September 2002,"Have we seen this type of movie before? Yes we have, but better. Overly sentimental dramatisation of real events that took place in Vietnam in 1965. From a military aspect, elements of the film are real, but what detracts from the realism is the lack of depth to the characters. Added to this are a number of disturbing factors:-1) The Seargent Major's (Sam Elliots) amazing ability to dodge bullets whilst standing perfectly still in the middle of the battlefield, as all his men around him are killed. 2) The film looks like it was shot in my back garden (really) and most certainly NOT the jungles of Vietnam.                                   3) The continual repetition of 'Tell my wife I love her' everytime a soldier was shot.Now granted, the gore was well handled and we got the standard thematic music played over the slo-mo battle shots (a la Braveheart), but unlike Braveheart, Vietnam has been well documented and dramatising it only serves to detatch us from that realism. Some have argued that this film shows us how futile war really is. To them I say, do you really need to watch this movie to realise that?
This film is cliche-ridden and brings absolutely nothing to the genre. It seems to point at Wallace's desire to pull on our heartstrings using the dramatisation of historical events, but it isn't Braveheart and nor is it Saving Private Ryan. This puts Wallace on par with Bruckheimer and company in regards to film-making in my book. Disappointing!",We Were Soldiers

We see the courage andfear also of the families left behind, and are reminded poignantlythat the Vietnamese were human, when we see the photograph ofthe brave bayonet charger's wife, and the respect the Vietnamesecommander showed for the ""enemy"" by leaving the small raggedAmerican flag behind. The image of the small dirty ragged flag ona tree stump foretells the doom and humiliation the Americans willeventually suffer, after years of meaningless slaughter. TheAmericans lost the war but killed 40 times men than they lost; thisis a tribute to the bravery and commitment of the Vietnamese. We see Moore standing tall and vulnerable because at that stagehe didn't care whether he lived or died, as he had lost so many ofhis men and felt severe guilt; like Alexander, pure luck kept himalive.

A few things I have read about this movie - Galloway and Moore would not sell the story to Hollywood for quite a while, they wanted to be sure the story was treated with the proper respect, not turned into an anti-war screed, so they only sold the rights to Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson when they were convinced the story would be told accurately.  The dialog is what was actually said, those who call it a cliche, what should they have done, change it to reflect someone elses idea of what would sound realistic?  The movie is really about the code of honor among the men, the sacrafice they made, it makes no judgement about the merits of the war, those that complain about that definitely miss the point.  And of course, its about the American side, yes it treats American deaths with more feeling than NV deaths.  But there is some view of the other side, presented in a balanced manner.

Yes, this movie is different from previous Vietnam war movies. The American soldiers aren't portrayed as violent grunts with no regard for life. They aren't protrayed as men who are scarred for life from the violence, the death, and the trauma of the war. This movie is really all about Mel Gibson and his ability to spout comically bad dialogue while maintaining a straight face and of course, the innocence of America... sort of like that last disaster he wrote, Pearl Harbor.Could this movie have done better? I thought so. If Wallace would put his ego aside, and tone down the overabundant melodramatic scenes, Soliders could've scored big for me. Too bad that's all wishful thinking.

This film does exactly that, it's full of characters who are more or less caricatures of what great examples of american men should be, with their wives and kids. And this is exactly why this film doesn't work well for non-americans, also, partly because of what was the real deal with Vietnam war. This is why it's nowhere close to Saving Private Ryan, because SPR wasn't about heroes but about regular americans who actually felt like human beings with their own characteristics and differences going to and suffering in war. SPR pulls you right in with them and even shows its characters' faults without trying to make them look superior, and so it's a universally liked film. We were soldiers does the opposite, it shows just enough violence and action with multiple slow mo shots and sentimental music and nicely acted drama with their families to boost up feelings for a very specific group of people in the whole world, or just the USA.",We Were Soldiers

The gore and non-stop violence are obviously appropriate to the story, so why the complaints? It was also unbelievably moving. When the telegrams came home I heard many sobs and saw men in tears.

289,kat.hayes,Yawn,5,5 November 2002,"I picked up this film as there was nothing else left at my rental store. Bad idea.  As others said Mel Gibson is playing himself again, it looks indeed like a remake of Braveheart or Patriot(s). And does he have to preach us with religion in all his movies now ? I understand it must be a relevant movie for people studying war techniques and so on or also for the Vietnams Veterans.  But as someone else wrote : it doesn't look like Vietnam at all, even if the making of shows they've planted Asian vegetation, it doesn't work one second.  At least Morocco was credible for the same location in Spy Game.  It also missed terribly the 60's beautiful music that is usually used for Vietnam's war films and helps you to put yourself back in time.  And how lucky those soldiers were to all have so beautiful wives, some dummer than others for not getting the ""whites only"" sign at the laundrette but at least it helps us remember how life was for African American at the time.  We watched 1/2 of it in fast forward and that's pretty rare.  You have to watch it as a documentary based on a true story.  The good thing on the DVD is that you get to see the ""real guys and the wives"". 5/10 with all the respect to all of you who took part to the battle, it's not your bravoury which is quoted but the picture only !",We Were Soldiers

In ""We were Soldiers"" they actualy let you see the war from both sides.  Rather than the NVA as a group of silhouettes relentlessly advancing with seamingly no agenda, you watch as the officers plan the attacks as their soldiers write in their journals and think of their families.  You see the other side of the battle where they were scared but still attacked for their country.I think that showing both sides of the battle makes you realize that they were not shooting faceless people but rather husbands, sons, fathers, and that they would rather be home and happy just like anyone else, but that circumstances placed them in a situation to where they had to fight or die like their counterparts.  Then watching the American soldier's wives after their husbands died makes you wonder if the NVA wives were told in a similar manor.",We Were Soldiers

It was cliched and ripped off MANY films, most obviously All Quiet on the Western Front, Braveheart, and Black Hawk Down. There was no characater development outside of Gibson, who was a good actor actually. The action was well directed, but it had flaws too. The dialogue was extremely laughable at times, and the old guy Plumely was a rip off of Lee Marvin from the Dirty Dozen.

I was just young enough to miss having to go to Vietnam, but not so young that I didn't oppose the war at that time. This film transcends the politics of the age and focuses on the sacrifices that were made for this country by our young fighting men.  I thought Mel Gibson was fantastic.  He has risen to be an actor that draws you in and keeps you into his performance.  His face alone speaks volumes in many scenes.  I wanted to see this movie so I could again experience, at least through a film (as in Saving Private Ryan), the horrors of war, so I could gain a grain of understanding of how horrible it must have been to be in situations as illustrated by this film.  An ordinary looking beautiful sunny day turns into a nightmare within just a few moments.  The movie is graphic, grizzly, and exhausting.  I had tears streaming down my face by the end of the movie, just for knowing that this type of horror went on then, and is still going on around the world.  I thought that the quote offered by the North Vietnamese commander at the end of the movie was quite profound and sadly, quite true.  This is not an ordinary movie, if you're looking simply to have a good time and be entertained, don't go.  This movie has a deeper message than simple entertainment, and some of the scenes are truly horrifying.  I give it a 9 out of 10.",We Were Soldiers

It made me see that war is Hell.I think it blew ""Full Metal Jacket"" out of the water.  Because it didn't blow me away in just the first half.  The whole movie blew me away.It's got ""Oscar"" all over it.  Mel should be up for Best Actor next year. As for Sam Elliot, as Best Supporting Actor.  And it should be up for Best Picture next year.  It's not just another ""War"" movie.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it's a great story about the first time the Air Cav went in to action.What I thought was very interesting, was the way the film shows both sides of the battle.  What was going on from both perspectives.  I don't remember any other ...Nam movies doing that.  Maybe I haven't seen them all, but the ones I have, never showed what was going on in the tunnels during the battles.It was a positive movie about the War.  It didn't come out with all the BS that happened during the late 60'S.  It showed how these guys fought alongside each other.  Not against each other.It always seems to be the goal of every ...Nam film that comes out. Hollywood gives us pictures of American Troops against each other.  There is a little pushing and shoving between American pilots, but I got the feeling from this movie that We still thought We were going to win the War.It wasn't the kind of Vietnam War movie that ends leaving you wondering, ""What the Hell was that?""  There's a real story here and not a bunch of the depressing Hollywood liberal crap that they insist on putting in all of the films about this war.  This one stands above that.I felt proud about what these men did in that portion of the war.  I was too young to know what was going on back in the mid 60'S and early 70'S, but I am not unaware of what went on during those times now.  I was in a theatre that had some 25 year olds or teenagers in it.  They laughed at some points of this film and don't have a clue about history.  This war is old to them and they won't see what we do, until movies about our current campaign against terrorism comes out in the next year or so.Sure it's a graphic film, but what war flick isn't?  Vaporising napalm scenes and a few bloody body parts flying through the air is just how it goes.Mel's Icon Productions has another winner here.  Can't wait for the DVD! Sure to be a big winner a the rental counter too.  Ciao",We Were Soldiers
295,jsoc42,mel gibson at his absolute best,10,2 January 2003,"Mel Gibson has had a fairly distinguished career in war films, Gallipoli, Braveheart, The Patriot, and recently, We Were Soldiers.  This film is right on so many levels.  I felt the men's emotions, which are often left out in the past Vietnam ""classics"".  These soldiers were portrayed as heroic, rather than stoned, cruel, and violent, as they are portrayed in many other movies in the past.  These men truly have something on their minds rather than who should be ""fragged"" next.  In my opinion, this may be Mel Gibson's best movie ever, and one of the best Vietnam movies of all time.  It was much better than Platoon, a movie whose characters I could have cared less about.  We Were Soldiers was not only one of the best Vietnam movies ever made, it is easily one of the top ten war movies since 1990.",We Were Soldiers

This movie displaces the French ""Captaine Conan"" as the once-best war movie ever made. Mel Gibson outdid himself here. Based on DOCUMENTED FACTS this movie is as close to the real truth, almost a Documentary feel to it's delivery. The washing out of the blood off the choppers, the cowards back at their ""safe"" haven barking at those who WERE facing enemy fire on a minute basis, the wives' constant torture worrying about their husbands WHO WERE SOLDIERS...There really IS a LTC Moore and he was instrumental for Mr's Gibson/Wallace to insert the intricate details, however minute, in this classic. A shame this movie was overlooked by many, and few, if any, substantial awards. Sometimes true class stands alone....",We Were Soldiers
298,Samtheshrikker,A very underrated war film...,8,11 August 2014,"We Were Soldiers often goes unmentioned next to the ""Vietnam giants"" such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now. And yet, it's a terrifically balanced and powerful film. Here's why...Mel Gibson is arguably the movie's heart and soul, portraying a stern yet very human US military officer who is charged with leading a new unit into the hell of Vietnam. The film's opening scenes present Gibson as just as much a family man as a soldier, which is credit to the screenplay in enabling us to relate to his character in an intimate way. The film's progress is rather leisurely at first, which adds to a sense of built up tension and suspense towards their fateful encounter with the Vietnamese. That said, once battle begins, the action is unrelenting and brutal. Some great filming grants the audience a real sense of being in the grass alongside the men, and the film's pyrotechnic effects are very commendable indeed. A nice touch is the perspective in Wallace's directing; he pays consistent attention to the women back home as well as the Vietnamese in sharing their experience of the conflict - this is a nice touch that broadens the film's scope and isn't present in other war films depicting Vietnam. The film's overriding sense seems to be that soldiers, despite being trained and expected to kill, are ultimately only human. This gives We Were Soldiers a lovely extra dimension to those that like to watch their cinema closely and appeals to more than just avid thrill seekers. We were Soldiers is a very thoughtful and honest war film. It poignantly suggests the hell and chaos of war, but also manages to balance this with moments of stark beauty and tear rendering emotion. For reasons unknown, it's a very underrated war film, and one I urge you to take the time out to see.",We Were Soldiers
299,dizzeness,Could have been good,4,14 January 2020,"So many good things that tried to bring the reality of war to the screen.

300,rshep20,Terrible film but nice to see that the IMDb can still be bought,1,7 April 2008,"Does anyone else ever wonder why the worst movies have all their 10 star comments at the beginning of the list? I wonder how much the film companies have to pay to the IMDb to keep it this way? Ever notice how many of the 10 star comments are usually the only comment by that person? The scenario: One guy watches one really terrible film, thinks its the greatest thing he has ever seen and then never writes another comment in their life. Sound fishy? Or how about the guy who only seems to give 10 stars to the worst movies? Never bothers to rate anything other than new bad films and never gives them anything less than 10?! Its pretty laughable. I am really glad I don't know any of those people. It is pretty sad that the IMDb can be bought in this way and does nothing to police itself. But I guess that's show biz.And as far as the Mel Gibson fascist film industry goes, I'd rather watch anything by Mel Brooks than the best of Mel Gibson.

The screenplay, direction and acting was superb, as expected. This is what Vietnam must've been like. This is not some strange ""artsy idea"" of war, it was real. Real people fighting for their own survival and that of their friends. And not just the American viewpoint. The North Vietnamese were given a realistic and respectful portrayal. Another excellent job of acting by Mel Gibson. Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper and Madeline Stowe shined as well in their roles. After not even being nominated for best actor for Braveheart (Which I will NEVER understand) and with 'We Were Soldiers' and 'Signs' both coming out this year, Mel Gibson has yet two more chances of being ignored by the Academy.

302,bmwboy,Just Another War Movie,3,16 March 2002,"Lots of movies have been made concerning the Vietnam War, most of them in recent memory were excellent (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Good Morning Vietnam).  All had their own little unique perspectives on the events during the war.  ""We Were Soldiers"" however, is just another war movie, and not a very good one.  The plot is slow very slow and predictable,  the acting is so-so, and character development is terrible.  As a member of the viewing audience, you feel no connection to the characters, therefore it's hard to conjure up any kind of emotions during the scenes which try to pry any emotions out of you.  Even the extra actors portraying Viet Cong soldiers didn't do a good job of playing dead.  I am serious...I could swear one of them was trying to hold back laughter while trying to play dead.But the hardest thing which I could not overcome while watching the movie, is the scenery.  Even though I have never been to Vietnam, some of the better movies made about the war made me feel as though I have been there. They all followed a basic formula for the scenery, some, even shot on location in Vietnam.  Now I have no idea where the war scenes were shot for ""We Were Soldiers"", but I could swear that they were shot in the mountains outside of Los Angeles, CA.  Since when were there oak trees in Vietnam? The war scenes looked like a bunch of guys from Los Angeles who drove to the Angeles Crest forest, got out of their BMW's, did a reenactment of a battle that occurred in Vietnam, then went home.  Overall, this movie is just plain boring and uninspirational.  It tries to use the premise of remembering those who died in a bloody battle in order to make a movie and a few extra bucks.  Well, I donated my $8.50 to watch this movie and I wish I had it back.  I wouldn't even recommend this movie as a rental.

I have to say that General Moore's vision for this movie has been accomplished.  This movie is a work of success in all aspects.As the son of a Viet Nam War hero who participated in the battle at Ia Drang Valley, the battle so eloquently depicted by this movie, I am excited to say that finally a movie is made that depicts our warriors for what they were: brave heroes who went out to do what their country asked them to do.As far as war is concerned, this movie makes no excuses.  War, in all of it's bloody and gory splendor, is clearly depicted so that we can at least minutely and ever so remotely feel what our brave troopers went through.

Pan to US Military Base where soldiers are being trained. Introduce diverse characters like Commanding Officer who is getting to middle age and not really sure he wants to be sent into battle again, but doesn't have a choice because he has to keep up appearances as well as think of his pension. Meanwhile, his wife of 20 years is having an affair with a young black lieutenant and neglects the kids. His Sergeant Major is a closet homosexual who vents his frustrations upon the new recruits he has to train. Several other soldiers wander round the perimeter, each with their own particular ghosts  drugs, debts, relationship issues, fears and doubts.Send this bunch to Vietnam (minus the cheating wife who in the absence of the men tries to become Top Lady by bullying the other women into submission) before anybody really knew what or where it was. Headquarters mount a botched operation deep into hostile territory, based on outmoded tactics, hopelessly bungled intelligence and endemic ignorance of the enemy.Soldiers land in the jungle where ANV is waiting for them to let fly with all they've got. The raw US troops follow the tactical handbook that was written for a different war, a different place and a different enemy, and end up totally confused and badly positioned. Try to do their best in the ensuing chaos by seeking cover and lying low. Commanding Officer recovers from shock, slowly realises that this is a major balls-up and phones base to get his troops extracted  permission denied. Fearsome AVN attacks follow one another during several days and nights, and by observing them the position of their base becomes clear. US artillery and air power is called in and coolly blasts the AVN headquarters to smithereens whilst the ground troops lick their wounds in their foxholes. AVN hurts badly, breaks off combat and retreats further into jungle. US choppers fly in and evacuate dead, wounded and survivors. Reporter who tries to take pictures of the bodies is beaten up out of sight.Back to base, later. Group of survivors from this ordeal get together and think about lost comrades. CO's wife weeps for dead black lover. One poor veteran OD's himself later that night. Commanding officer is mental wreck, drinks too much and hits wife who runs off with frightened kiddies.Cut to bright daylight scene where hundreds of dapper new US troops are waiting on airfield tarmac, embarking on planes to take them to Vietnam. Shards of patriotic speech by General are lost in the wind and noise. Commanding Officer watches from distance with bottle of whiskey in one hand and army revolver in other. Film ends with a gunshot.Of course this has nothing to do with 'We were soldiers'. And that is exactly the problem.fG",We Were Soldiers
306,haegint,Lousy movie,2,9 January 2005,"Like another viewer has said, it is indeed difficult to write 10 lines on this garbage.The story may be true or not, this movie was bad. Lame, despite all the fireworks. The music? So boring! Sentimental schmaltz stuff of the worst degree, creating NO atmosphere whatsoever, only seconding the sorry pictures.By judging from the battle scenes, I expected that at least say 250 out of the 396 or so have died. Instead there were only 71 dead as we learn at the end. Sorry, but I had to laugh, the battle pictures we've been shown by the director seem not correspond to this relatively low casualty count. And of course we never learn how many enemy men were mowed down. This battle has only one side...Another idiotic scene: One of the first guys (some Lieutenant) coming in with the first wave spots an enemy scout and immediately runs after him for into unknown enemy territory, but not only for a few meters but he keeps on chasing and chasing until finally the men draw fire. Worst of all, he drags all his men with him!! I mean how stupid a military leader can you possibly be?? Again, this may be a true incidence or not, but if a soldier behaves so stupidly, he doesn't deserve any better than getting whacked. I only felt pity for the poor fellows who had to follow their ""leader"" and got mostly killed in the process as well.What happened to Madeleine Stowe?? Did she see a plastic surgeon to get her lips siliconed? Not sure, but she looked terribly bad here, suddenly has grown old in her face. And I do not believe that this was due to the ""burdened"" role she had to perform here. Her character was to forget about anyway, like all the other cliché soldier babes who looked all so good and shiny of course... All BS for me. The only one credible character in this sorry flick was the UPI photographer (Pepper?), the sharpshooter from Private Ryan. I really like the guy, he has a good intensity on screen.I could go on ranting some more, but I could only repeat what other viewers have said already. I rate this crap a 2 out of 10. I give it 2 only because some (not all!) of the battle scenes seemed credible enough, especially the one night attack where the soldier says he can ""smell 'em"" and they light up the forest and indeed the enemy is right at them already.Hamburger Hill is the much, much more touching and engaging film.",We Were Soldiers
307,dale_durnell,Brings back a lot of memories,9,3 March 2002,"Mel Gibson is no John Wayne, and this is not ""The Green Berets."" And while the humanity of the leaders and the brutality of the war in Vietnam come through in both films, this film is so very different.Fierce in its intensity and as graphically accurate as a film can be, the movie is serious fare and not for the lighthearted. For those of us who were there, in country, this film is a savage reminder of the stupidity of politicians trying to legislate a war. From the early war scenes of the French in Indo-China, to the (in retrospect) prophetic statement of the Vietnamese commander at the end of the film, the story is cast in a very historical light.That this is a new kind of war, with new troops, new weapons, and new tactics does not escape Gibson's character. Thus, the film shows that not only in the field but back home, as Madeleine Stowe's character remarks, ""the Army wasn't prepared for this.""Early on, we meet Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) as a family man, but also as a professional soldier. And, we meet Sgt Major Plumley (Sam Elliot) as the grizzled old warrior. Together, they know that it will be a tough job to get these kids trained and to keep (in as much as it might be possible) these youngsters from getting killed. Barry Pepper is outstanding in his role as a news photographer who hops a ride to the battle.Even in ""Soldiers"" the life of those ""who sit and wait"" is not well developed -- which can be explained given that the story is primarily of the story of those who have gone off to fight. Thus, we never get to really know Madeleine Stowe's character (Julie Moore) very well. Still, we do get an insight into her life as a take charge of the situation military spouse in the mid 60's. Additionally, the gathering of the wives, the sharing of their stories, and lives, is an added dimension that so many war films overlook. The naivety of many of us who were not from the segregated South is tastefully revealed and well played out.The scene of a group of newspaper journalists and photographers arriving via helicopter after the fighting was typical of media of the day, and (in my humble opinion) not far removed from some of their antics today. After over three days of fighting, killing, and dying --the cleaned and pressed press corp comes in asking their usual repertoire of insensitive, if not stupid, questions. Sadly, this is one of the many accurate scenes in the film.",We Were Soldiers

This film will not assist us to greater understanding of the politics but you will not come away from watching it without a greater understanding of the men who fought it. When I first knew of its release I viewed Mel Gibson's employment as nothing but a ploy to rake in viewer's, fearing he would be a little john wayne-ish in the part of Hal Moore. I actually feel this is his finest performance to date. Films like platoon, hamburger hill and the boys from company c all have their own merits, whereas maybe green berets lacks any at all. We were soldiers stands head and shoulders above any of them in its representation of combat, its brutality, the comradeship it brings about and the effects upon those back home. I am not known for my moist eyes during films but I certainly felt myself weep for those wives left behind and what they had to endure. Hal Moore was a superb combat leader, of that there can be no doubt.

Boring? Absolutely not. Poorly acted? Well, aside from M. Stowe who bugged me for some reason,(did she remind anyone else like Cher?) the cast did a fine job. I would have liked to have seen more on some of the characters we were introduced to, such as ""too tall"". Sam Elliot did a marvelous job-definite nod for best supporting actor. For those of the reviewers thinking he was a cliché character, THAT'S THE WAY MASTER SEARGEANTS ARE! He's from WWII! He's regular army! I thought the filming location for the battle could've been better chosen. It looked like the hills of Virginia. I wished the Scottish hymn sung three to four times were not played as much. To me, it was a little overdone...ok a lot overdone.All in all, I'd definitely see it again- not like Titanic or Black Hawk Down, where I did enjoy those movies but I'll never ever have any desire to see them again.

This is such a sentimental movie, including all the cliches in the genre, even including the ""Tell my wife... I love her"" before someone dies. Jesus! Haven't we heard that enough by now? And since when is about every important person in a movie politically correct? Hal Moore Gibson couldn't have been any cheesier! He's not only intense religious, he's also the perfect father, the perfect husband, the perfect combat leader... and OH NO! Here comes a speech about how everybody is equal and stuff! If they wanted to make a hard combat movie (witch it claims to be, when you see the action scenes), they should have left all this crap out of it. The contrast between the action and the sentimental cheesy parts are really to big to make any sense. It's like they made 2 movies and than merged them together into one, so they could say: ""This movie has it all: great action and drama"".

It's hard to cite any individual thing that I didn't like about the movie, but it just doesn't seem to all come together quite right. There are numerous moments that feel desperately cliché. Some of the writing is downright horrible. We don't really get to know any of the characters very well. The battles rarely carry any real suspense, save for the scenes of the few soldiers trapped in behind enemy lines. The whole movie has this air of sentimentality to it that just doesn't work. The makers also opted to include numerous scenes of the North Vietnamese soldiers. Clearly the filmmakers were attempting to add some humanity to the enemy, but they weren't very effective. The scenes felt tacked on, and didn't really add anything to the experience other than serving the minor purpose of allowing the audience to formulate that Gibson's character was anticipating the enemy's actions so we know we are supposed to be in awe of his leadership. It's a lot of things like that which just made the movie feel like it was spoon-feeding every step of the way. All in all, it's not a horrible movie. But, it probably could have been great, and it falls well short of that mark. It is a relatively generic war movie, and fans of the genre will probably be satisfied.

There is valor in being a good soldier, but it unquestionably comes with nightmare that shadows the rest of your life.This is a masterpiece, a brilliant execution of production, casting, scoring, and writing. It does a fantastic job of showing the layers of war, the heroic nature of a good soldier, and the incredibly high price of war.",We Were Soldiers
314,dbrownridge,Close to the WORST war movie ever: can you say 'Jingoism',2,30 December 2016,"If you have watched a lot of war movies, you'll know America has pumped out more than any nation, hence you've already had a taste of U.S. war propaganda: ie. a classic example is seen in this movie where every U.S. soldier who sticks their head up an inch is shot, EXCEPT for the commander who can strut around upright or stand stock still without even a wound. This represents American bravery, more accurately 'guts' or 'balls'. Another classic example goes as far back as the old Westerns, but it is such a well-loved cliché they use it ad infinitum - it is the scene where the enemy hurl themselves headlong into a slaughter while the Yanks hunker down and mow them down like wheat before a rainstorm. Yes, I know sometimes you have to rush a position but usually you'll soften it up first with grenades or mortars. The VC in this movie have about 5 grenades and no mortars, apparently. I like how the 1st platoon is pinned down with like 5 guys left and the VC just keep rushing in again and again - NOT throwing in a single grenade which would have finished it right there. These are just two of many examples. Good grief. I've heard of suspension of disbelief but this movie invokes suspension of total brain function. The first time I saw it I couldn't finish it. It's been a decade and I tried again today - desperate for movies here in China. Again, I couldn't cut it. Two-thirds through I pulled the pin. RIP you piece of crap. Even an old John Wayne movie is more real.",We Were Soldiers
315,tgrosso,Don't Let Cliche's Get You Down,8,20 November 2002,"I know there has been a lot of talk about this film having too many cliches but this is based on a true story and if you read the book you realize that all of these so called ""cliches"" were actual things said by our veterans. This, to me, is the best Vietnam picture I have seen.  I am glad that there finally is a Vietnam War picture that paints our veterans in a positive light.  A lot of the other ones I've seen seems to focus on killing our own guys (Apocalypse Now, Platoon) but We Were Soldiers left me with that thankful feeling I had after viewing Saving Private Ryan the first time.",We Were Soldiers
316,bigbadbrian,Gripping and Gut wrenching,9,20 March 2002,"We were soldiers has got to be one of the best war films, I have ever seen. Though it is extremely full of cliche's it still gets a powerful lesson in history across. The Ia Drang valley battle was one of the worst that the US has ever been involved. I'm very surprised that anyone survived it, even with an outstanding officer like Hal Moore (gibson). The film also portrayed the Viet Namese in a better light than in most other films about that war. Like I said the only problem I could find with this film is the many cliche's that appeared in it. The one that showed up in the film and has been absolutely done to death is the dying soldier lying on the field saying in a raspy voice: ""Tell my wife, I love her"" Actually the most common thing a dying soldier says is ""Tell my mother I love her"". Anyway as many cliche's as there are in the film, they don't even come close to taking away the power that this film had on many others in the audiences. I've seen some great films on Viet Nam but this one has ranks right under Platoon. Platoon shows the sphycological hell that American soldiers in Viet Nam went through in that time period and We Were Soldiers shows the courage that fighting men showed throughout the war. There is one thing that about We Were Soldiers that for me sets it apart from other films about Viet Nam. We Were Soldiers shows that soldiers returning from Viet Nam were given no parade or friendly welcome of any kind like the ones who returned from World Wars I and II. Infact, people who passed them in the streets ignored them entirely most of the time. Now we get to the performances. I personally was impressed by all who acted in this film. Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, and Greg Kinnear all gave memorable performances. However, one actor who really outdid himself was Chris Klein. I've never much liked Chris Klein because I've always felt that he is just a 23 year old playing a teenager. This film he has really shown himself as a serious actor. Anyway great movie,",We Were Soldiers

Let's look at the critiques by the guys who actually fought the battle.  Quoting from the History Channel's 'History vs. Hollywood':  Maj. Bruce ""Snakeshit"" Crandall says ""'We Were Soldiers' is the best movie I've seen of this era"", Capt. Tony Nadal, ""essentially, everything depicted in the movie happened in some form"", Pvt.

The vote of the panel of guys who actually fought the battle was 80% History,20% Hollywood.Who are we to say they're wrong? Some things may sound cliche' but that's what was said.Most of the lines in the movie are not made up, they are QUOTES! Read the book!  Discuss the movie with a Nam-Vet, and while you're at it, thank him.  Don't watch this movie for entertainment value.

318,Douglas McTague,Not the best Vietnam Movie,7,13 April 2002,"I saw this with my friend on Opening night. I didn't wanna see this movie at first cuz it had Mel Gibson in it. He's a good actor and all but after seeing him as a war hero in Bravehart and The Patriot, i sorta go disgusted of him. He's no different than he was in the two prvious films. Which was an honest man that cared for his soldiers and was a good natured guy. The film takes place in Vietnam in some valley of death (i forget). American troops are dropped off into a valley to seek out Viet Cong Forces. This ends up being a disatrous decision where it was a set ambush by the Viet Cong.  It ends up being an hour and half of killing where the US ends up fighting to survive.
What i liked: I like how a movie attempted to show the Viet Congs point of view and thier feelings but fell short. Good acting and cinematography to along with. Showed how women were affected back home in the US.What i did not like: Didn't like how the Amercian lives seemed to be valued much more in the film. Example is that it would show an american soildier die so vailiantly with american patriotic style whereas it would just show a vietnamese soldier get shot, grap his chest, then fall down like he was a domino piece. Many of the sequences deemed too unbelieveable  for example *********SPOILER********* ......During the fighting, Mel Gibson stood up the whole time with a straight back abd giving orders. Guys were getting killed hiding in the ground and lying down. But Mel Gibson never got a scratch.***********END OF SPOILER******* The soldiers never really question why they were there and what they thought about the conflict. You gotta watch a movie the movie too see what i'm saying.Conclusion: If your a fan of the genre of War. Go see it. But if you arn't a particular fan, go see a vietnam movie such as Apocalypse Now, or Platoon. Those are the movies that shine based on the Vietnam War. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a movie that seems to dazzle you with action more than show you a simulation of what war really was in that era.-=FINALY VERDICT=-  6/10",We Were Soldiers
319,Aragorn22,"Great action, but too much Hollywood and patriotism!",6,16 May 2002,"""Finally, there´s a big vietnam movie again!"" That´s what I thought before I went to the cinema. But, to be honest, this title didn´t meet my expectations. It´s about one of the very first missions of the USA army in Vietnam, where they had pretty more difficulty fighting the vietcongs than they had expected..... The big problem with this movie is that there´s too much Hollywood and USA-patriotism in it. In that way, the picture you get by watching this isn´t the good picture. Everything is seen, as usual, from the American point of view. On top of that, I couldn´t see Mel Gibson as a Vietnam soldier. I just had too many associations witch characters like he plays in the Lethal Weapon series. Of course, he also played in the classic Braveheart as a real strider, but in We Were Soldiers, the picture of him as a leading figure in Vietnam just didn´t fit. There are some things I have to say in defense of this movie: it has great action and sounds. On top of that, they use new camera techniques I´ve never seen in a war movie, which is pretty great to watch. So, in sum, if you want to see a movie which is quite simple, has a lot of action and good camera shots, you should watch this movie. If you love a good script and want good actor performances, don´t go see it. No, I´m sorry, I can´t recommend this movie.",We Were Soldiers
320,williamllewellin-08548,Not as truthful as it makes out.,6,26 March 2021,"There are a couple of serious problems with this movie, the first being Sgt Major Plumley. Plumley didn't actually make any parachute combat jumps in WW2 as he was in the glider force during the whole war. I don't know why they would embellish this as going to war in a glider, especially an American one, was bravery enough. Plumley didn't even serve abroad in Korea as he was posted in the US for the duration. The other problem is the writing out of Rick Rescorla and his heroism and replacing him with an eastern European. Presumably this is another example of Gibson's hatred of the English as Rescorla was a Cornishman and again demonstrated his bravery at 9/11, saving many lives and being killed as a result.",We Were Soldiers
321,cmeeker,A Film Worth Watching,10,23 January 2008,"This film surprised me because I did not realize it was about the very beginning of our involvement in Vietnam, and it begins with the French being massacred in 1954. We move up in time to 1964 and 1965. Barry Pepper is particularly memorable as a non-combat soldier carrying a camera, taking photographs. It's beautiful to see the black & white shots he's taken in contrast to the fighting behind him in color. The scene with him at the end talking to Mel Gibson is moving and realistic. Gibson's eyes fill with tears because he feels he should have died having lost so many men, and he asks Pepper to write about what happened here in this valley, the la Drang Valley, The Valley of Death.Another lovely quality to this film is showing the Vietnamese side of the battle, and their Commander making decisions. We see a dead Vietnamese soldier's diary showing a photograph of his wife and pages written in Vietnamese. This is a thoughtful remembrance for all the men who died in Vietnam, not just French and Americans.This has star quality all over it. The music is uneven sometimes, and I feel it could have been a 10 star film had a stronger musical score been developed. However there's plenty of pathos, sad and terrible battle scenes, and the painful delivery of letters to the wives of dead soldiers back in the States. Definitely a film worth watching.",We Were Soldiers
322,cat-76,Good movie if taken at face value.,10,25 October 2002,"As a Canadian who has had many friends fight and some die in Vietnam, I am told that this movie was somewhat representative of what went on in Vietnam in the early months of fighting. This illustrates the American surprise at the caliber of fighting forces that the North Vietnamese possessed and it sent a message to the North Vietnamese that the Americans possessed some mechanical advantages they had not yet encountered when having to contend with helicopters and planes. The movie was not perfect and does not rate as high as Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down or even We Were Soldiers, but the message is sent clearly to the viewer and the graphic nature of hostilities is displayed throughout the battle. It is entertaining and worth the price of admission.",We Were Soldiers
323,F. Poole,We Were Country-Loving Fascists,1,3 March 2002,"Without getting into too many more details than necessary, it should be said that this movie was sexist, racist, badly cast, poorly photographed, and so terribly scored it hurts. To make matters worse, the dialogue was generally didactic, uncreative, and therefore unbelievable.**WARNING: Some spoilers ahead**The overbearing Catholicism didn't help either; particularly when referring to the enemy as ""heathens"" in one of Gibson's many moments of prayer in this feature.None of the women's roles in this film had any substance or character. This does not separate them from the men, but it is particularly important to note because the film never spends enough time with them to develop their characters in the first place. It is as if the film is only hopelessly seeking to reach a wider audience than its competitor, Scott's Black Hawk Down, by recognizing that good Christian soldiers have good Christian wives at home, who weep when they die. Furthermore, that one such wife would mistakenly assume that a sign for ""whites only"", at a local laundromat, was referring to the type of laundry allowed is simply embarrassing. (This may have been an attempt by Wallace to set his film in its specific time period as music from the early sixties was completely absent from the movie. Either way: embarrassing.)Racial issues, as with the women's roles, are so poorly dealt with in this film that it is unclear as to why the topic surfaces at all. Wallace's attempt to seem ""multi-cultural"" by having Gibson directly address the very mixed-racial nature of his unit (this is what I meant by didactic) is completely undermined by the lack of non-white actors in any of the leading roles. These other ethnicities only surface to be mutilated by typically exploitative Hollywood war violence, later in the picture.It is conceivable that Wallace and Gibson were simply unable to get any talented non-white actors interested in their project, particularly because the rest of their casting decisions are unlikely choices for a war movie. Both Chris Klein and Greg Kinnear appear out of their respective elements here. This, in all fairness, may have been the intention of the filmmakers as both roles present an over-exaggerated contrast to that of Sam Elliot's roll as a hard-nosed and frequently amusing rip-off of Lee Marvin. For Lee Marvin fans, unfortunately, Elliot's presence only serves as a reminder that the world of cinema has seen so many superior, though less graphic, war movies before this.In fact, possibly the film's greatest inferiority with respect to its most recent counterparts is its often uninspiringly composed and poorly lit cinematography. Two or three shots (I'm not sure which) that stand out as particularly amateur are one master shot of an evening dinner/dance (possibly the only scene in which the soldiers, other than Gibson and Klein, actually interact with their wives) that is just so poorly lit that even the American flag (center frame) looks weak and tired. The other shot (or shots) takes place as Gibson and the other soldiers are waiting for the bus. In one shot, unreasonably bright practicals light the soldiers and in (possibly) another they shed light on three very large radio antennas, for no apparent reason. That is, unless Wallace was trying, in an extremely amateur fashion, to emphasize the solid (and extremely phallic) nature of the US soldier that is prepared for war.As the skilled combination of sight and sound lie at the heart of great cinema, it can be said that the quality of the cinematography may have been bearable had the musical score not been so gut-wrenchingly awful. One moment they're building suspense by ripping off Hans Zimmer's virtuoso score from a better war film, Mallick's The Thin Red Line, the next moment (as well as three more times through out the picture)  they're using a completely inappropriate Scottish (?) ballad that is totally distracting from the scenes it accompanies. This ballad was probably meant to remind us that Wallace and Gibson once teamed up to make a film that was actually pretty good.As much as I was truly nauseated by this picture I must concede that the rest of the audience, as well as the majority of reviewers on IMDB, seems to have been sincerely touched by its efforts. I will probably never truly understand why. However, one positive thing that I can say with regard to this picture is that it seems now that Mel Gibson may be only one or two contrived epics away from topping Kevin Costner's brilliantly (and I do mean brilliantly) cliched epic, The Postman. If this be his goal, I wish Mr. Gibson the best of luck.",We Were Soldiers
324,kypioneer,Excellent Intensity and Balance,10,2 March 2002,"This is the story of the Battle of Ia Drang in Vietnam-- a 3-day battle at LZ (landing zone) X-Ray in which a little over 400 American soldiers faced 2000 of the men of the Army of North Vietnam and eked out a narrow victory. Terrible lessons were learned from this battle: the North Vietnamese learned that they could stand up to superior American firepower (helicopters, M-16s, artillery), and the Americans learned that one American with same could kill a significantly larger number of the enemy. This led to the ""meat-grinder"" theory of the war which caused so many American casualties, and an even greater number of Vietnamese deaths.Basing his movie very firmly on Gen. Hal Moore's and Joe Galloway's book ""We Were Soldiers Once and Young,"" Randall Wallace has produced what I think is the very finest movie on the Vietnam War ever.  In fact, I think it is even superior to the much ballyhooed Private Ryan.  The battle scenes are intense, relentless-- and these are balanced by looks back at the homefront where the wives left behind at Fort Benning are having to cope with the loss of their men.  There is a lot seen from the perspective of the North Vietnamese as well.  This is very unusual and quite refreshing in a war picture.  All the performances are good-- no exceptions.  Sam Elliot's Sgt. Major Plumley is a gruff delight as he plays the ultimate career soldier.  Barry Pepper turns in a strong performance as the journalist Joe Galloway. As for Mel Gibson-- well, this may be the best performance he has ever given. Subtly underplaying his role as (then) Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, he still embodies leadership and experience, devotion to home, duty and his men.  And at the end of the battle it is through his eyes that you experience all the pain the loss of so many of his men has brought him.",We Were Soldiers

326,DarkCherub,"We Were American Heros, We Were Winners",4,3 August 2002,I didn't like We Were Soldiers that much. The American patriotism shines through almost everywhere. Now patriotism isn't necessarily a bad thing but in this case it's very misplaced. The movie doesn't show the course of events in the proper way. As a matter of fact it appears as if America did indeed win the Vietnam War. Ok there are some small hints of failure at the end of We Were Soldiers but they are hidden between the lines and one could get the impression the purpose of the movie is to bring the so called heros of Vietnam War to late fame. C'mon guys...is that really necessary? If you want to praise your soldiers go ahead but a movie that's shown in theaters is hardly the right way to do so.Avoid if you're not American...this movie feels like a punch in the face of good taste.,We Were Soldiers
327,magicwalnuts,The dollar sign beats the bullet here,1,1 July 2008,"I have never seen source material butchered this badly and disrespectfully as it was in this movie. If you read the book which was written by Gen. Hal Moore himself and chronicles his first hand experience with this particular battle and other soldier's stories from another battle taking place almost immediately after this one. I would like to point out that about 80% of the events in the movie are completely historically false, and merely sought to ""Hollywoodize"" the movie. Scenes where Mel Gibson is charging across the battlefield are complete BS! If Hal Moore had really done that he would have either been 1) killed promptly or if he had somehow survived 2) courtmarshaled immediately after the battle for abandoning his duties as a general. A general's place is at his command post commanding his troops. Hal Moore rarely left his post, but I guess Mel Gibson doesn't really give a damn, he just wants to act all dramatic.There were some good things about this movie, while once again not keeping in the line with the book, the stories involving the army wives were somewhat intriguing, but since the fates of their husbands were for the large part completely ""fictional"" affairs, they fell flat for me. My suggestion is, if you want to get inside the head of a soldier, a commander, and a worried spouse at home during Vietnam, read the book ""We Were Soldiers Once and Young"", if you don't want that, and you just want to see Mel Gibson in another mindless action movie, see this film.",We Were Soldiers

329,mlbou,Inadequate film for its time,6,27 March 2002,"Had We Were Soldiers been made 10 years or even 5 years ago it would have really resonated with me. But after Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Enemy at the Gates, and Black Hawk Down this movie really does not reveal much about war or human reactions to it. Instead it is an amalgam of the bloodiest scenes current technology will allow and gratuituous family time scenes which add little to the drama.I will admit that in spite of this that watching the film did affect me, but I believe that it had more to do with sitting directly behind a Vietnam Vet who throughout the film would turn to his wife and remark about how he remembered this or that and next to a West Point cadet who was told early on that the average life span of a 2nd Lt. in Vietnam was 15 minutes and was now watching that statistic come to life. But the film did not affect me, the serviceman's reactions to the film did.If you like Gibson and want to see him in a war film see Gallipoli, he was younger, less arrogant and seemed to care more about the soldier's experience. I like Gibson, but his actions at the West Point showing of the film definitely hinted that he was more interested in the box office success of the war film and less about the soldiers' story. I hope I am wrong about him and his attitudes, but I fear that I'm not.Not a bad war movie, but there are so many better.",We Were Soldiers
330,kobus21,Makes The Thin red line looks like Dad's Army,10,28 June 2002,"I think the first thing I would like to point is that Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace is most definitely the best team since Don Simpson (R.I.P) and Jerry Bruckheimer.This is most likely the most emotionally driven movie that I have EVER seen in my life.

Okay, call me old fashioned but the tribute to the soldiers who died in that battle which is displayed during the beginning of the end credits was probably the best and most emotionally charged experience I have ever had.

332,Rmcfg,Like Home Movies ...,10,24 May 2002,"I grew up in the 1960s in the Fort Benning area where this movie was actually filmed.  As a former Army Brat and as a career Army officer, I must salute the director for the attention to detail in bringing Hal Moore's story to the silver screen.The uniforms of that era were exact ... right down to specific items of the soldier's uniforms such as camouflage covers and canvas field gear  which are now obsolete and getting harder to find.It was like home movies for me to see a film featuring base houses in a section known as ""Colonel's Row"" where I once knew people that actually lived there; in addition to other scenery from my childhhood in Georgia. Many of my childhood friends had Dads assigned to the 11th Air Assault which was renamed the 7th Cavalry.The one event that actually occurred and was omitted from the movie was the massive fly-over that took place prior to that unit's departure.  Many of the men assigned to that unit lived in houses just outside of Ft Benning. One afternoon prior to their departure, there was a massive fly-over where the skys over those suburban neighborhoods were black with army helicopters from Ft Benning.  For some of those soldiers it would be the last time that they would see their own homes from an aerial perspective.The emotion shown of having the news of a soldier's death being delivered to his widow by a taxi driver was deeply realistic.  My own father had been killed in Viet Nam in 1964, one year prior to Hal Moore and his outfit being sent forward.  I remember when a cab driver pulled into our driveway with a telegram and my mother going ballistic!  She called the base, asked to speak to the 2-star general and totally chewed him out for being so cold hearted.

A lot of other movies that try to achieve this always fall short and one of them would be my top favorite movie done by George C Scott in Patton. In Patton there use of none period equipment was horrible for such a high dollar film and is the only issue I found with that film, otherwise it still rates #1 on my list, this problem was not the case in we were solders.I would highly suggest everyone to see this film and that all the actors have done a top notch job in the making of this film.

The goodbye's to their wives wasn't over done and scenes where the women receive their telegrams is justifiably a tear jerker.Finally, I appreciate the films theme of being a thank you to vietnam vets, in that it didn't portray them as druggies and baby killers, but as true patriots that loved their fellow soldier.",We Were Soldiers
336,patches-4,We Were Soldiers is an early Viet Nam War film,9,20 March 2005,"I'm afraid I have to disagree with a few of the comments made by previous reviewers.One thing we should remember most importantly is that the story, as mentioned in the film, is about the first major engagement between the American military and the NVA. Someone made a comment about some of the 'cliched' lines, i.e. ""Tell my wife I love her"" ""We'll give them hell"" and ""I'm glad I died for my country"". What we should also remember is that in the early years and at the time the film is set the combat soldier honestly believed that what he was fighting was a war that America could win and that he was defending Viet Nam and the West from Communism and that they were doing the right thing. It was only really later that opinions changed about the war. As I'm ex-forces myself I can assure anyone who doubts the things people say when they are in danger that they are true. I think Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore and Sam Elliott as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley portray well the kind of leadership and inspiration that took those young combat soldiers into the hell of Ia Drang and it is a tribute to those men who experienced it for real.This film and a few others are based on fact and real incidents so we have the written accounts and the films military advisers to rely on to bring reality to the screen. With regards one reviewers comments about the wives, both American and NVA, in the story, I don't see any problem with this. At least we see the affect it has on those back home. The comparisons between the American wives looking after their own and the men looking out for each other is exactly how it is in real life, what's wrong with that?In this film we see the affect this one battle had on the men and women affected by it and that would sadly be repeated many, many times before the Viet Nam War ended and sadly is now being repeated in Iraq.One final thing I think we should read: smilovich from United States Reviewer: Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"" (Biloxi, MS USA) comments about this film to ascertain whether this is a good film or not.",We Were Soldiers
337,errorist,No more!,4,13 August 2002,"It's so obvious that this movie is in line with the 9/11 aftermath. All the ingredients are there; faith in god, important family values and ofcourse a honorable but tragic death in combat. Sometimes i had a feeling i was looking to G.W. Bush instead of a movie, like when Gibson explains his little girl the meaning of the word ""war"". This movie continuously carries out a message that war is terrible, but that evil has to be fought and that it's an honorable cause to die for your country. This first hour of emotions is followed by an hour of combat; It's all been done before. I've had enough of all these patriotic movies. It might work for americans, but it's too much for me. Had a hard time sitting it out. 4 out of 10.",We Were Soldiers
338,UCB Agent1,"Powerful, moving, important",9,2 March 2002,"""We Were Soldiers"" is a powerful and moving testament to the men who fought & died in the Ia Drang valley on 1965.  It succeeds by abandoning the politics of so many other Vietnam films and simply focusing on the experiences of the men in the moment.  This was the tack taken by ""Black Hawk Down"", but by putting a clearer face on the enemy and by making the film about the way the battle changed the men, this film is actually better. Mel Gibson gives a solid performance at Lt. Col. Moore and Sam Elliot is excellent as his second in command, a battle hardend Sargent Major who knows how to act in a fight.  The other performances are all blended together nicely, and the action is intense and horrifying.  War is not glorified in this picture, nor is America.  The stark scene at the end of the film of the Vietnam Memorial drives home the point that this film was about and for those wen in the Valley of Death.  Writer/Director Randall Wallace deserves credit for creating a moving picture of the first real battle of the Vietnam War, and in so doing earns a bit of forgiveness for writing ""Pearl Harbor"". All in all, an important movie that pulls no punches emotionally.",We Were Soldiers

This movie was excellent. Mel Gibson shows us that he can act in anyway on screen, his range is incredible, and truly be looked at as a war hero and not just the guy from Braveheart. The movie's score is PERFECT for the film, it handles the emotion very well, and the filming is very alternative.

A lot of money i hope, but too bad the devil doesn't take credit cards, 'cause Gibson will surely be going to hell after this and be joining Ben Affleck after Pearl Harbour! How can Gibson live with himself after making this piece of garbage ? This must be the work of the American government! They must have financed the whole thing. How can you actually believe, that the world would actually fall for these lies? But hey, many of the reviewers here seem to like it and can't see what so obviously is going on. How very very sad that many are so naive. Wake up from your slumber please! This is not how it was during the Vietnam war! Not at all! The exact opposite is much more likely to be the case! This is pure propaganda from the American government. What will be next ?

341,Chris Do,Hagiographic,6,4 March 2002,"We Were Soldiers has a few powerful moments and lots of sloppy cinematography.The way Moore was portrayed, many a time, I thought I was watching a hagiographic film. He may well be that saintly but the script went overboard in that respect. The fighting scenes were graphic but not very realistic.*** SPOILERS***Witness for example the last sequence when the Americans fixed bayonets and charged (I wonder if that actually occurred): exactly when they were running into a machine gun nest, suddenly, helicopter gun ships appeared out of nowhere to clean up the field (and somehow, the Vietnamese never heard them coming!) in a Rambo-like sequence. In another case that cannot be possibly historical, the bespectacled enemy soldier charged Moore and his entourage to be shot just when he was about to stab our bigger than life hero. Any sane soldier would just have stopped and shot everybody, or came on with gun blazing, but this one got a convenient brain cramp. ***END OF SPOILERS***So in short, very disappointing though sometimes emotionally brilliant movie. And by the way, it is totally misleading to state that the battle pitted 400 Americans against 4000 Vietnamese. The truth is, 400 supported by air power and heavy artillery on the defensive against an enemy with no heavy weaponry actually is a winning odd in any battle.",We Were Soldiers
342,AntiSpielbergForce,The worst war movie of all time,1,7 February 2007,"I don't know where to begin my defilement of this work, because it's really rotten to the core. One word best sums it up, and that is CONTRIVED. Every single scene is fabricated to be sentimental propaganda in step with current trends and political correctness. Even Spielberg couldn't reach these heights of not-so-subliminal American gung-ho, all supported by a vulgar soundtrack that tells you exactly what to feel and when to feel it.Also, I hear this movie is based on a book. I can't for my life believe that the book is as boastful and self-indulgent as this nonsense. Mel Gibson's character is nothing short of Jesus himself - he's a wonderful father and husband, and a god-fearing Christian who only fights to keep his Family safe from the Twin Evils of Communism (which indeed is a pestilence, but that's beyond the obvious) and Heathendom. On the battlefield, he'll know no fear, will always be the first in line for a bullet, and will gladly sacrifice himself for his imperial comrades. And on and on. Every other soldier is also a family man and Protector of Democracy, Baseball, and Jockstraps. Well, all except Sam Elliott's character, who is supposed to be a Tom Highway/Sergeant Hartman clone, only humourless.Let's just list some of the most deplorable scenes:Gibson praying in church with a fellow officer, telling him that God is on their side. Gibson praying with his children, and cuddling with his wife. Gibson explaining to his daughter what a war is, and how they are the good guys (In God We Trust). Gibson's speech about brotherhood in his unit, and how he will sacrifice himself (this scene is really too laughable for words, it has to be seen to be believed). Gibson, after the war, saying that his only regret is that some of the men under his command died, and he did not.The soldiers' wives are generously portrayed. They are in the movie for the sole purpose of receiving notes whenever their husbands have died. Again, to show that they have sacrificed themselves for their families. A tear spent is a dollar earned.The scene when Gibson returns from the war, and his wife only sees a cab stopping outside, fearing it is a death note for her. Pathetically predictable and melodramatic.And then we have the ""laundromat"" scene, which has probably the most forced PC dialogue I've ever seen. Are we supposed to believe that an American woman in the '60s (and I believe in the South?) had not heard the term ""Whites only"" before?As for the war scenes, have you ever noticed how German and Vietnamese soldiers always die instantly, but American soldiers always live on for 30 another seconds? Just enough for a violin piece, his comrades holding his hands as the lights in his eyes flicker and go out, and of course, a glorious parting line.And the death scenes here are truly fabricated beyond ridicule. Everyone accepts death with a smile, and no fear whatsoever. One dying soldier says ""I feel privileged to die for my country"", TWO say ""Tell my wife I love her"", one is dramatically shot dead just as he heroically lifts his wounded comrade onto a helicopter, and yet another has his newborn's name flaunting about - just so we are reminded that he's one of the good guys, and that we should be extra sad when he dies, because he ""died to protect them"" (another unwritten rule of Hollywood war movies is that whenever someone shows a picture, letter, or something to that effect, of a loved one - he will die).And propaganda aside, even strictly as a war movie, it falls flat. The movie knows full well that it is dishonest and preys on sentimentality, that is has no plot to speak of, that is has only the most rudimentary strategical and tactical elaborations, and that it is completely devoid of characterization (let alone character development!). So it goes for the graphic and macabre instead - faces burning with napalm, etc. This is what can be expected, because the movie was obviously made for the very easily impressed, the drooling mass that WANTS to be told what to feel and think, because it's easier than doing it themselves.Pathetic.",We Were Soldiers
343,rschubring,The Best Scene Fell to the Cutting Room Floor,10,29 January 2004,"I was shocked to view the DVD version of the film and see that the single most important event of the story had been cut from the film, but was presented to the DVD audience as an add-on.The scene, a Saigon debriefing of Col. Hal Moore by a senior Johnson Administration official, amply demonstrated the chasm of willful ignorance that set official Washington into a state of gridlock.The subject remains topical.  A review of today's headlines will reveal similarities in thinking. Take, for example, the following loaded question from a political fundraising letter I recently tossed in the trash: ""Should the U.S. have invaded Iraq alone or must we get U.N. permission to defend ourselves?"".  This question omits 1)did we need to invade Iraq to defend ourselves, 2)might someone who opposes war in general, oppose it regardless of whether the U.N. grants some nation a license to start a ""police action"", 3)would the invasion be justified to prevent a future attack upon us, 4)would the invasion be justified if it led to a free Iraq, without any threat against us, or 5)was the invasion justified to put one war criminal (Saddam) in custody, 12 years after his last war crime?  By my count, there are 7 sides to the question and not just 2. (Hopefully readers will think of a few more!).Vietnam was terribly polarizing to our country, precisely because the war demanded we choose one side or the other, shut down our brains, and ignore every possible subtopic that might alter the terms of the debate. This film abundantly demonstrates that the war's participants did not view any part of it as a 2-sided question...but then, official Washington wasn't there to participate, and had the luxury of simplicity.",We Were Soldiers
344,weezer76,A Subterfuge of Political Correctness,8,20 August 2002,"I enjoyed the resolve of Mel Gibson's character in this film and the fact that it celebrates one of the great U.S. victories in the field before the traitorous demonstrators ""back home"" took it upon themselves to put the handcuffs on our freedom fighters.  (They are squarely to blame for the fall of South Vietnam to the bloody Communists.)  Getting back to the film, I gave it 8 stars, but I was disappointed by the undercurrent of political correctness.  Three major instances stick out like a sore thumb, but remain unaddressed by others.  First, we have the united colors of Benetton represented in Moore's outfit, concerning which Moore gives a speech!  Was this historically accurate?  I doubt it.  Second, Barry Pepper's character plays a reporter who is disgusted by war.  I am a big fan of Barry's, but this character only succeeds in having us question the entire premise of this film.  His presence leaves us confused about who the real heroes are. Third, the NVA are presented with a human touch, as if they are morally equivalent to Joe Soldier.  This is ridiculous and sickening.  The North Vietnamese Army was the weapon of an evil Communist regime that would overrun South Vietnam, killing, raping, and torturing its kind inhabitants. Do we present Hitler's SS in a similar light?  Of course not, that would be anathema to the Hollywood Left.  Overall, this film is a good flag-waving epic marred by a few disturbing and utterly curious elements.",We Were Soldiers

Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) commands a battalion sent into the jungles of Vietnam in the first major battle of the Vietnam War. Before departing for Vietnam, he delivers a promise to his soldiers and thief families that "" I will leave no man behind... Dead or alive, we will all come home together."" I believe that this stands beside Platoon as one of the greatest if not the greatest Vietnam War movies of all time. This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest war movies of all time. Mel Gibson gives a very powerful performance and should have deserved an Oscar and same with the film. The ending to the movie is phenomenal and the battle scenes are well performed and superbly executed. This film also shows the battles not only on the battle front but also on the home front. Madeline Stowe and Keri Russel also give powerful performances and show how the war also affects the families. Overall, this movie is very moving and will keep you entertained from start to finish.

My dad read it and, he a vet of Vietnam, said it was very good. Now to the movie. Good movement, good emotion, good storyline. You really get to turn Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot, and even Kinnear into real heroes. That's what war movies used to do. People idolized John Wayne and others in war movies. They were made to look invincible, intelligent, and ballsy. Gibson's character was smart, effective, and sure of himself. Main characters in movies today are unsure of themselves, not smart, and goofy, when goofy shouldn't be there. Chris Klein's character was appropriate, as the scared, yet brave, soldier. For his character, it's appropriate to be unsure of yourself, and that worked. I didn't think, at first, that I'd like the flashes back to the states with the wives on the base, but their role was very emotional, and it added to the movie, didn't remove anything. During the drafted wars, plenty of wives/girlfriends/daughters were back home feeling exactly like these ladies. Scared shitless. Any Vietnam vet would like this movie, but they might not care about the Vietnamese-sided view of the movie. But that was justified later when Gibson was guessing their attack plans, and was accurate about it. Gibson was a hero in this movie, and it's refreshing to see that again.",We Were Soldiers

348,cooperaitaliano,A good movie and a realistic one,8,28 December 2006,"I do not particularly enjoy watching movies of this genre. I originally remember seeing We were Soldiers at the cinema and saw it last night again, this time on DVD. Firstly, the filmmakers endeavoured to be authentic in the details and the attention to detail reveals the seriousness to portray the events that occurred and reflect them with an honesty. The second is that an effort was made to show both the North Vietnamese and the US during the battle, not just from the American point of view. It did not glorify war but was sufficiently graphic to reveal that war is indeed horrifying and to dissuade those of us who may never find ourselves in such circumstances of having an illusions of it being otherwise.Like Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, it brings a gritty realism to film. I do not watch such films for 'entertainment'. They shock me sufficiently enough to recognise to a degree what the reality of war can be like. I say a degree, because unless any of us find ourselves physically living and experiencing such things, we will never comprehend what it is like, but in as much as is possible, I think that such films do accomplish this.Before I saw the movie I understand that it depicted real events and having seen the documentary on the DVD, I appreciate further the enormous effort made behind the scenes in the making of this film. I think that it dealt with the battle, the issues surrounding it, the men that fought and died in a respectful and realistic manner.Whether we agree on the larger issues of the Vietnam War, about Mel Gibson as an actor/director/person or the morality of war in general we should all be able to agree on one thing. This is that War is a horrifying fact of life in our world and that we should recognise the costs of it and respect those who sometimes find themselves fighting in it and dying in it.",We Were Soldiers

The first 30 minutes, you learn about the characters & their families. 
You learn the true emotional struggles they & their families faced both before, during and after. 
What I personally found hard was that you fall for some of the characters only to find many of them killed in battle. Obviously many babies were born to soldiers who never get to know them or watch them grow up.My favourite scene would have to be, (without a doubt) the final farewell party where two of the soldiers mimed along to two songs. Greg Kinnear mimed the first song.
 
The second song -
""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me"" Song by Mel Carter was the most beautiful, sexy but one of the saddest, because the soldiers & their wives were all lovingly kissing, caressing & saying goodbye to each other prior to the Soldiers leaving for the battle. All of them knowing that this could be the last night & time they ever see each other again. 
Sadly, for many it was... broke my heart! HELP PLEASE!!
If anyone can help identify a particular soldier/actor for me, I'd be very grateful.

Somehow we were supposed to really care about these characters when we barely even got to know them.  I mean, how many different stories are you going to try and lay on us at once?  At least in the case of say, The Thin Red Line, we weren't supposed to feel extra sorry when one person died as opposed to the hundred other guys just because we show one extra minute of them.  I felt that the movie was generally hollow compared to so many other war movies on a whole.  And the ""montage"" of Barry Pepper's photography.  I thought I was going to wet my self laughing it was so cheesy.  I almost felt more connected to his character in Battlefield Earth.

351,MsKristi,Good popcorn movie,6,11 March 2002,"There were a couple moments in this film that elicited claps and cheers from the audience.  That's a good popcorn movie.  Personally, I thought there was only one thing that stood out about this film when compared to other 'Nam flicks and that was its look at military tactics.  I was impressed by the way they showed us the strategies used by both sides.  What really suffered in this film, though, were the characters.  They were your typical, cliched group and the same old cliched things happened to them.  I mean, how many times in a war movie (especially a 'Nam flick) have you seen a soldier, in the heat of battle, pick up a wounded soldier and try to carry him to safety?  Especially one that is so wounded he can't walk, so his buddy throws him across his shoulders to carry him?  This happened at least twice in the film.  I guess this is a POSSIBLE SPOILER (especially if this is your first 'Nam flick), but too many times to count, new characters are introduced during the battle only to die moments later.  They are given enough dialogue to try and make us see that they are nice, patriotic guys with someone back home waiting for them.  Then they are gone.   Of course, one could argue that that's a reflection of how it probably was over there, guys speak for the first time, then the next thing they knew the guy they just spoke with was shot down, they were under such heavy fire. The performances were good, but I do question the casting of Mel Gibson.

Take out the special effects and you have a 1950's WWII John Wayne film starring Mel Gibson.  Every standard cliche is used.  Every tired story-line is once again pushed through the grinder--- from the suffering wives left at home to terrified wounded soldier in the midst of battle.  This is not to disparage the real horrors of war but this is a movie that has been done over and over.  But maybe we need to keep seeing these sorts of films to remind us civilians of the sacrifices that have been made by our military men and women.

A case study of great leadership.,10,7 March 2002,"The movie centers around the events that transpired at la Drang Valley (""The Valley of Death"") in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam in 1965. The battle at Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray was the first significant engagement between U.S. forces and North Vietnamese Regulars (NVA). Approximately 400 members of the 7th Regiment, 1st Calvary Division (Custer's Regiment) found themselves confronting 2000 highly motivated  NVA regulars who were battle hardened from the French-Indochina War. It was the early days of Air Cavalry when the helicopter assumed its troop carrying, combat role.Mel Gibson played the role of LTC Hal Moore and Sam Elliot the role of his Sergeant Major. Both were magnificient. Gibson turns in another sterling performance worthy of an oscar. As a veteran, I was particularly impressed by Elliot's performance as a Sergeant Major. He captured the attitude and demeanor of the senior NCO perfectly. All of the performances were an outstanding and inspiring portrayal of courage and dedication to duty. Like the movie ""Gettysburg"", ""We Were Soldiers"" is a case study in leadership.The film also focuses on the families of the men who fought there and the effects of war on those serving at the home front. Similarly, it focuses on the human side of the enemy and acknowledges their bravey and suffering as well.

Heck, the movie even surprised me a couple of times, using clever misdirection, and the under use of Chris Klein. (thank god, that line ""Don't worry sir..."" could be the worst preview line of all time it was so badly acted) However the movie tried to use the soldiers' wives as the conduit to our emotions. Talk about a terrible failure. Not only did this move drag the watcher out of the movie flow, it made the action on the field seem fake, and not quite as important. Not only that, the cut scenes were placed badly, trying to be full of suspense, but just ending up being aggravating.

If you're into John Wayne like heroism and macho militarism this is definitely your flick. Should you expect a critical and reflective war movie  be prepared.WWS is based on Moore's and Galloway's account of the Ia Drang battle, a book that is definitely worth a read. The movie is not true to the book, though. The script takes the main storyline, cannibalizes it by shuffling around some historical facts and anecdotes, pumps it up with clichés and macho gestures and adds some dramatic fiction for good measure including an ending, that manages to even depict the Americans as some sort of winners. This can hardly be called accurate. Then again, surely there even are people who regard Cecil B. DeMille's Ten Commandments as an authentic depiction of the Old Testament.The cinematography furthers the fictionalization of the battle by use of overly dramatized and effect loaded images. Still, the photography and the effects are good. Acting is mostly okay, apart from Gibsons rendition of Moore, which at times is almost hilariously grim and heroic.All in all a solid war-action flick with some but loose ties to a true story  there are better ones. 2/10 for failed effort.",We Were Soldiers

I like Mel Gibson and Chris Klein, but after the disastrous ""Pearl Harbor"" I really wondered if I would enjoy writer/director Randall Wallace's film. I am happy to say, despite the sketchy, at times cliche filled dialogue, ""Soldiers"" is an excellent film.The movie gains unique ground dramatically when we are shown the soldiers of the film as family men, complete with wives and children. This unique little precursor to the war area of the film gave each of the major characters ample personality, something recent war films (like ""Black Hawk Down"") did not give.In fact, I have never felt such an emotional connection to the characters in a war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"".""Soldiers"" is a very powerful film, although no as powerful as ""Ryan"".Gibson, Kinnear, Klein, as well as Stowe and Russell, give excellent performances and the direction is well done. the only fault in the film lies in the dialogue, which is noticeably awkward at times.Overall, this is an excellent war film that deserves a spot right next to ""Ryan"" on your shelve. **** (out of four)",We Were Soldiers
360,notcliched,Nothing special,6,20 March 2005,"Vietnam War films have always tried to capture the horrors of war, especially the personal horror of those involved.We Were Soldiers was somewhat of an enigma. On the one hand, it tried to be anti-war like most, if not all, Vietnam War films. However, at the same time, it was stupidly 'patriotic' to the point where it becomes just another pretentious American tripe. It was also extremely biased. Whereas films like Platoon showed the atrocities committed by both sides, We Were Soldiers has every American soldier with a halo above his head.Filled with cheesy lines and silly American gung-ho attitude, it's hard to take this film seriously and as a result, its message comes across very weakly (not that its message is very well developed or anything new). A highly predictable ending doesn't help things either.The scenes of Gibson's wife (played by Madeleine Stowe) back home, as an attempt to show the affects of the war on the families of the soldiers, were poor, underdeveloped and a bore.On the other hand, the fighting is strong and exhilarating.

Honestly, if this is your interpretation of a good film, there are two possible answers: 1) You have never seen a good film or 2) You are dumb. There's really no way around this, and I'm sorry if you happen to be dumb (and extra sorry if you've never seen a good film). No, I'm not saying every film must be a Fellini masterpiece - not at all. There are plenty of terrific popcorn flicks. However, this is not one of them. Aside from probably realistic action sequences (I can't say, I've never been in a war), this film fails on all levels. The script is embarrassingly lousy, the acting (with minor exceptions) amateurish, and the film seemingly goes out of its way to depict a true story inaccurately. If I'm wrong, please correct me, but I'm gonna take a stab at this and say... Opposed to what the film would have you believe, not every American, whom this story concerned, was a wholly good and moral person. I mean, for god's sake, all people have faults. If you're going to so painstakingly try to present this as a true story, at least attempt to portray these people as real human beings. But like I said, there can be wonderful popcorn flicks. However, nothing in this film comes off as sincere. It all comes off as forced and cheesy (but not in the enjoyable campy Star Wars manner). This makes the film wholly unenjoyable, even at a mindless level, unless ALL you want is to see lots of people get shot. And if that's all you really want out of a film, well, there's nothing I can really say to you except ""don't breed."" Skip this one. If you want a Vietnam War film, go with Platoon, Apocalypse Now, or Full Metal Jacket. If you want an action film with lots of violence, go with Battle Royale, The Matrix Reloaded, or virtually any anime.",We Were Soldiers

Hal Moore and his men in the first battle between Vietnamese and American soldiers.Based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once...And Young"" by Lt. Col. Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, the reporter who witnessed the battle from the beginning, this movie is more authentic than some people like. It shows the horror of war in detail, including the effect of napalm. Although it starts with the new training at Fort Benning, the viewer gets to know both sides involved in this conflict. And soon we see that these men were not only soldiers trained to kill, but fathers, husbands and human beings. Mel Gibson does a good job and characterizes Hal Moore as a brave and sensitive person. In fact he is so good at it that it is impossible to believe such a brave and heroic person exists.""We were soldiers"" is a shocking Vietnam movie and for a Hollywood production it is surprisingly unpatriotic.",We Were Soldiers

There are also some heartbreaking scenes here that I've never forgotten after nearly 2 decades. That said, war seems to only be shown as truly horrifying when Americans are impacted. Given Mel's history it's hard to ignore how much this comes off as standard propaganda. This makes it seem less like ""war sucks"" and more-so ""war sucks when it's Americans dying"" and that's pretty insulting.Everything serious tends to be sandwiched in with over-the-top 'Merican patriotism and hypocritical bible thumping in classic Mel fashion.

The whole affair has the gung-ho empty headedness of John Wayne's The Green Berets, and it's hard to think what is more offensive: reducing Vietnam to one America successs; the patronizing attempts to humanize the Vietnamese, the treacly scenes of the wives back home or Mel's chats with his daughter in which he explains what a war is.

370,easter.egg,"Something old, something new, something borrowed...",6,10 March 2002,"I've got mixed feelings about this one.I've never been in a war so I appreciate the efforts made here to help a relatively privileged population understand its horrors.I was torn while watching it, because I realize there's a money-making motive here.  The movie is big and bang-filled to pack people in seats. There's a duel going in this movie between the desire to reveal the fear and pain of war, and the studio push to turn a huge profit.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid this movie will be judged in the coming weeks based on its box-office earnings rather than its substance.  In other words, I think the message may be muted somewhat by a desire to develop the Hollywood themes in the story.
It's the first Vietnam movie I've seen (or rather, that I can remember)that makes an attempt to show the Vietnamese- North, South, or otherwise- as humans rather than 'yellow demons.'  It's been about 27 years since the 'war' 'ended', which I guess is far enough removed for this kind of movie to come out and be accepted by a larger audience.Unfortunately, there's a rampant resurgence of the ""I'm tough on 'em but I love 'em"" officer archetype.  I've not read the book the movie's based on, and I've never met Lt. Col. Moore or Sergeant Major Plumley, so I don't know.... maybe they are/were really like that.  Still, in this movie, its not novel; it's John Wayne.  Say yer prayers and then say yer prayers.In all, this movie is no classic as far as I can tell (only one day after seeing it) but it's not bad.  It tells the story well, and makes a superficial attempt at seeing both sides of the issue.  What I would really love to see is a film that takes that idea one or two steps further. Might be a couple of years off yet, though.  I don't know if Hollywood's understanding of America is ready for it.Oh!  Something old... done, Something new... covered, Something borrowed... done that too, Something blue:  Mel Gibson's eyes in the night scenes.  I swear they've been enhanced to make him look more heroic/boyish/pure. Those scenes don't have much else that's vibrantly colourful, except for his eyes. Hmmm.",We Were Soldiers

Let's see, we have the guy whose first line is his wife had a baby. He's gonna die, isn't he? Yup. And so's - in slo-mo - the guy carrying his wounded friend, right? Check. The cut aways to the women at home getting the news? The leader's ""it should have been me"" speech? The dying soldier whispering, ""Tell my daddy I love him""? The enemy leader, after the battle, predicting the course of the rest of the war? Check, check, check, check. The soldier dying by throwing himself on a grenade? Oh, no, wait. NOBODY could call that one up. It's too much. There are CAVE PAINTINGS with that cliche. It's too... my God, they did that, too.The biggest shame of ""We Were Soldiers"" is its waste of great performances. Mel Gibson doesn't turn in a career-best performance, but this is in his upper third. Greg Kinnear is almost unrecognizable in a complete departure from his earlier work. Sam Elliott and Barry Pepper are... well, Sam Elliott and Barry Pepper. It's just.... Man. When Pepper gives the ""I came here to make the people in America understand"" speech, Pepper's giving it his all, but I roll my eyes hard enough to sprain an optic muscle or two.What's lacking is talent behind the camera. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is just as cliched, but Spielberg uses those cliches better than anyone before - one might hope, to end the need ever to repeat them. Writer-director Randall Wallace (who also wrote ""Pearl Harbor"" - and if that's not a giant candy-apple red warning flag, I don't know what is) doesn't seem to think so. And his delivery is painful. There are moments - like Pepper's photographic montage, or the scene at the end with the press corps that doesn't ""get it,"" that are so cheesy as to almost become parody. The movie a comedy troupe might make if they wanted to send up horrible war movies. And it WOULD be funny, if it weren't so realistic. Just as World War II veterans spoke of ""Pearl Harbor""'s realism, some Vietnam veterans have talked about the realism of this film's action. But the realism and the performances make the whole mess WORSE. They add earnestness to the tripe, and nothing's worse than humorless camp.Somewhere between the brooding navel-gazing of ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" (both of which I loved, although I'd never consider them ""realistic"" portrayals of Vietnam or any war) and the jingoistic propaganda of ""The Green Berets"" and ""Rambo,"" (the latter of which I liked), there's a Vietnam movie to be made that shows soldiers of both sides as humans in an inhuman situation.

There is no location in the lower 48 United States that can accurately depict any location in the Central Highlands of (then) South Vietnam, or any location in Indo-China for that matter.  The location used bore very little resemblance foliage wise to the Southeast Asian tropics at the actual location of the battle.  it looked to much like the Southeastern United States.

This movie, drawn from the book ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young"", authored by by Lt. General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway, introduces the viewer to Battle of Ia Drang (Nov. 14, 1965). This battle was the first direct combat between the US and the North Vietnamese army. Director Randall Wallace hit a home run on this movie. This movie seemingly jumped straight from history onto the big screen. This movie did not avoid telling the direct story of the battle, not even sparing the ugliest parts. The viewer is shown the incredibly close proximity between combatants. You observe the fear of young troops. You see American troops facing terrifying odds, and the ugliness of war, to include a devastating and extremely graphic napalm misdrop. The movie alludes to the war doctrine of the Vietnam War, which was ""search and destroy"". This movie did not cast a vote on the politics of the war. I believe this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time.

376,tkohaut-1,Pathos and patriotism in annoying doses,1,6 September 2019,"Based on the IMDb rating, I just decided to give this movie a shot, already expecting to see some degree of pathos, cliche and patriotism to be included, but I didn't expect it to be in such unbearable doses. The first part of the movie is basically a blue-print of how not to do character development, as it basically is one long boring drag to show, that each and every American soldier is one good guy, who loves god, his wife, kids, country and most of all his platoon. Same as for all other messages, that the movie wants to get through later on, each and every single scene seems to scream, why deliver this message in a subtle way, if You can basically nail it with a sledgehammer into the forehead of even the most simple minded person. So if this message by end of part one of the movie through all those scenes of soldiers cuddling with their individual family members and bonding with their platoon mates has not gotten through yet, Mel Gibson's pep talk to his fellow soldiers before going to war should have ultimately made sure of it.So I was hoping for the movie to get better in part 2, but it just didn't . It just went further downhill. Every scene following the start of the actual fight reeks of one of the following messages, which are mercilessly unsubtle carved into the audience's forehead:1.) We want to be a little different than other war movies, by giving the enemy a glimpse of human character. So let's give them a few seconds to look at the same moon as the American soldiers and one of them, although he doesn't have a line to say, can even have a picture of a girlfriend, but that is as good as it gets, because ultimately the enemy is not much more than ...2.) ...cannonfodder , who doesn't seem to have many ideas, what to actually do with their guns, as in one scene after the other, they continue to either run or sneak towards the American soldiers, either not shooting or in the rare cases, when they do, failing to hit anything, resulting in most cases, that they look like trying to merely overrun the enemy and essentially even failing to finish off an outnumbered, cut off platoon without ammo, while....3.) ... at the same time the American Heroes are essentially impenetrable to bullets, culminating in the laughable scene, where Mel Gibson is standing in the middle of an open field, that is supposed to be overrun by the enemy, with bullets flying all around, just aiming to look manly and thoughtful at the same time for a minute or so....4.) ...while the comparably few gruesome deaths of American soldiers almost exclusively serve the purpose of reminding the audience of what was said in part 1, by giving them dramatic lines - tell XYZ I love him/her, I am so proud to die for my country etc. !!! - or having them gloriously killed, while trying to carry another wounded/killed comrade.And if this last message still has not been understood by each and everyone by the time, when the battle is won, Mel Gibson's last talk with Barry Pepper - I will never forgive myself, that I have lived and my boys have not or something of that kind - surely does the trick in its usual subtle manner.There are a lot of movies out there with less production value than this one, but this movie for me is so annoying in its simplistic and lopsided messages and even worse the way it delivers them by treating the audience like simpletons who need to be spoon fed those messages, that this warrants nothing more than one star.",We Were Soldiers

This movie will make you both laugh and cry in about equal doses. Mr.Gibson has done an outstanding job of portraying a horrific battle in an unpopular war. Seldom does a movie portray the camaraderie that develops between men in military units that transcends both family and friends as does this one. I don't care about how many war pictures you readers have seen, this one will get and hold your attention right from the ""get go"". I've never seen our (and their) soldiers portrayed more nobly.

The best played role in the film is that of the helicopter pilot (Greg Kinnear)...despite a screen time of roughly five minutes and a woefully underwritten part.Yes, it's reasonably entertaining; yes, it's action packed; yes, it's a decent enough night out at the pictures.

In this film he lifts the audience to understand the nobility of soldiers as expressed in their dedication to each other in the times of extremis. Clearly, as with all other wars, military leaders in Vietnam badly misjudged the quantity, quality and tactics of their opposition. Col Hal Moore received his orders and lead his men into the near disaster that they found themselves in. It is only through their dedication to each other (helicopter pilots included) that they were able to prevail in this most difficult engagement.This movie and its actors exquisitely capture the spirit of these men.

They have a really rough time, the main characters lose some friends who's characters are sufficiently developed during the movie to make the viewer mourn together with the main character, by fighting hard they manage to survive and in the end we see the grief and feelings of guilt of the survivors, in this case mainly Mel Gibson.I liked the fact that the story is about a battle that has really taken place, but other than that it didn't really rise above other war movies I've seen. It's an OK watch, but it's 'cliche' in the way the story goes and in the way it portrays its heroes. It misses the excellence I found in movies like Apocalypse Now or Platoon.

386,Jaycicle,A poignant and compelling film.,7,3 September 2008,"I sat down to see this expecting something similar to FMJ or Born on the Fourth of July. What I got was a compelling and truthful portrait of the opening stages of the US involvement in the Vietnam War.The film was a tour de force of what families go through while their men are away and what those men themselves experience during war. Something as an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, I can all too readily relate to.Perhaps it skirted, if not cliché, then sentimentalism at times and lacked the blacker than black humour that most soldiers possess. However the film remains an excellent portrayal at a keypoint in modern US history and a fitting testament to those who, if they weren't motivated by the patriotism Hollywood would have us believe, were certainly motivated to be there for their friends.If there is one major disappointment in the film, it's the total lack of mention of then Lt. Rick Rescorla, a legend in the 7th Cav, a hero who sadly gave his life on 9/11 and the soldier made famous by the Life magazine photo that adorns the cover of most published versions of We Were Soldiers Once and Young.He was, of course, one among many whose stories were not told, but it seems a shame that so iconic a figure from the battle of Ia Drang is totally absent and leaves Gibson and Wallace open once again to accusations of Anglophobia.",We Were Soldiers

I'm the child of a career marine who served two tours of duty in Viet Nam. As someone who grew up living on bases I can tell you it says something very important. It seems that too many war movies display just the horror of war but fail to understand the human toll, on the servicemen and their families. My own father was very much like the character that Mel Gibson played in the movie. He saw himself as more than just a professional but as someone who was honorably serving his country. My own experience was going to a high school where almost all the student's fathers were serving overseas in Vietnam. On average once a week the principal would come down and ask the teacher to step out. This was followed by the teacher asking one of my classmates to accompany the principal down to the office to be met by their mother to find out that dad had been killed in action. There was always a feeling of the the heart stopping when the principal came to the door. I can appreciate the scene in the movie where the cab driver comes to the door to deliver the sad news. Excuse me for digressing, but the point that I'm trying to make is this movie really does come close to what it's really like to be a serviceman and what the families of servicemen have to endure.

The only problem I see with this film is that it feels like a combination of good scenes and lines from other films. The apolitical analysis of war in this film does not stand out from many modern war movies. The characters in this movie seem to speak dialogue that they would only speak when coming home from a war (or analyzing it when they became older men), not in the middle of it.

I doubted that very much, SPR had realism unlike any other war film, in it's time, SPR was the best and only realistic war movie out there. It was revolutionary, and I just knew that We Were Soldiers could not live up to the same standards. WWS had little hype before it's release, especially when compared to SPR. How terribly wrong I was. WWS surpasses SPR in every department. In this movie, we get a feel for the REAL horrors of war. This film is not for the faint hearted, but if you want to see and learn about war, you need to watch this film. The film starts slowly, I admit that, and it takes a while for the Air Cavalry to get to Vietnam, but once the action starts, it never stops. The action scenes are VERY long. The action takes over three days and we see small scale and large scale skirmishes between the to forces. We are taken from one platoon to another, and there are no gung ho running about the place. The soldiers keep their heads down and stay down, firing in short controlled bursts as they should.However, at one point, there seems to be a hell of a lot of explosions, which I believe was only done for the camera and for action's sake.But one tactic that is used is to build up character profiles and personalities, which are then systematically destroyed as we see grisly depictions of their death. We think, because of their good nature, that they will make it through, when in fact they do not. The film would not be as moving if it was not for the musicians.

Go ahead and skip the first 40 minutes because I can summarize it in a few sentences: Mel Gibson can't act, nor can he pull off a southern accent. Mel's character has a doting wife and five children and he prays really hard so god can let him kill bad guys and military life is tough on the whole family. And there are other wives, too. One is a minority and one is retarded.Then Mel prays with his soldiers like a kid prays to Santa. Then they go to a golf course in Northern California and pretend they are in Viet Nam. The worst set/location I've ever seen in a war movie. They didn't even try - unless you think Viet Nam is mostly 6-inch tall grass and a few 15-foot birch trees planted by a landscaper a week before.The filmmakers were obviously aware that the golf course didn't look very real, which really blew the cinematography. They had to frame every shot so that it didn't reach beyond 20 feet and reveal the potted trees they drag around as the ""jungle.""

The United States is capable of making the very best movies the world has ever known, and very often does.  But this movie seems to be another example of recent Mel Gibson patriotic nonsense.  For reasons that escape me, Mel Gibson seems to have turned into a flag waver for American history (witness 'The Patriot').This from an actor that used to challenge the status quo, from 'The Year Of Living Dangerously' to 'The Light Horseman' to 'Gallipoli.'  Now, I am not > suggesting for a moment that this was not a significant battle, or an important part > of US history.  But it just seems so one sided, gung-ho and overtly patriotic (is this a new theme since 911?).The fact is that so many past US films regarding the Vietnam conflict seem so much more balanced (witness 'Platoon' or 'The Boys Of Company C' to name a few). The fact is that no country other than the US can really make a movie about the true experience that Americans went through during that awful period in US history.One of the few positive points about this film though, is that at least an attempt was made to show 'the other side.'  But I am still waiting for a Vietnam war  movie to come out to show what the Vietnamese were really thinking, and what drove them to the sacrifices so many made.I trust only one country to truly expose the feelings and drive of the Vietnamese side, and how the American soldiers truly felt being there, and that is the USA.  Americans can do it, and that would probably be the most fair, and truly patriotic film of all, on the serious US involvement in the Vietnam war from 1965 to 1975.",We Were Soldiers
395,Brownie-6,Brilliant Film,10,28 February 2002,"We Were Soldiers is the best war movie I have seen.  Realistic, honest, brutal.  This movies shows war as it really is.  It is one of the hardest films I have ever watched.  People do not get shot and keep walking.  They fall and scream and cry and pray.  No John Wayne here.  This film made me thank God that I never had to experience war.  It raised my feelings of utmost gratitude to those who have endured war to make this country the wonderful place that we live in.  Thank you veterans!",We Were Soldiers

Yes I know that this is a true telling of events in the vietnam war, but it was boring! Not being a fan of war movies in general, I had high expectations for this film. Good cast, good trailers, and good subject matter, but all in all I was very disappointed. The message at the end was the best part, but I suggest you just watch the first 20 minutes and the last half...the middle is just typical war movie violence and shocking images. Oh well, I suggest you skip this one and rent Forest Gump if you want to see something about the vietnam war.",We Were Soldiers
397,n3yfr341,We Were Soldiers Definitely,9,25 August 2002,"I have to definitely have to recommend this movie.  Having been an avid Vietnam War movie fanatic in the 1980's Vietnam War films such as Full Metal Jacket, Hanoi Hilton which portrayed the grittier side of the war, this was a change of pace.  Col. Hal Moore's WE WERE SOLDIERS shows the human side of the soldiers and their families and what they all went through during this time.  I also have note the performance of Sam Elliot, as Sgt.Major Plumley, this made it worth watching.  I should leave out Mel Gibson's role of Col. Hal Moore.  Academy shouldn't ignore this film come Academy Award nomination time",We Were Soldiers
398,daddy-o-7,It made be grateful,9,17 March 2002,"I went in with the bias of having read the book.  And I loved the book.  The film is remarkably faithful to the story, and I was impressed by Wallace's restraint.  While visually very powerful, it could easily have employed more of the technological tricks so many directors are unable to resist.  Instead, he relies on strong performances from his cast, and knew the story was truly extraordinary and did not need embellishments.  Gibson is no Olivier, and there are other actors who could have done better.  But Gibson gave it his all, and he did a fine job.  I do think the film will likely miss with many who aren't familiar with the book.  The bravery of the men and the ferocity of the battle, while all true, are truly unbelievable.  And for those who are suspicious of movies celebrating the nobility and courage of American soldiers, this will be uncomfortable to view.  It didn't make me squirm...it made me proud.  It made me grateful.",We Were Soldiers

Over-sentimental and laboured are the two words I'd use to describe this film.  There's no doubt that what the 7th Cavalry did in the Ia Drang Valley was amazing and that this film was (maybe) historically acurate (you never know after the abomination of Braveheart)but as a piece of cinema they deserved better than this. Madeline Stowe's performance seemed wooden at best (shame they don't give an Oscar for 'best use of collogen in a film') Chris Klein proved to be a one-trick pony, even I wanted to shoot him early in film. His slow, thoughtful, meaningful, serious, diction just infuriated me. The only actor who came out well was Sam Eliot as the grizzled vet.  He had the only four good lines in the film, and these lines only just outnumbered the amount of long boring prayers given to God throughout this film Be advised, if you want an engaging, well acted, accurate and heart rendering war story, stay home and watch an episode of Band of Brothers.",We Were Soldiers
400,suephx,Riveting - with a lot of heart,10,13 February 2002,I have seen WE WERE SOLDIERS and I wholeheartedly recommend this film. Randy Wallace enables us to know these men from the get go and the last half of the movie takes us so deep into the action that I had to turn away from the screen on more than one occasion. You cannot help but shed tears when you realize the sacrifices and commitment of these soldiers and their families. Gibson's performance is as intense as in Braveheart. I sincerely hope moviegoers will see this picture and understand that Vietnam's soldiers are entitled to be remembered as heroes which I feel is incredibly overdue.,We Were Soldiers
401,briansage,"Sadly Underrated. Best Vietnam Film Since the War, Itself",9,12 June 2007,"As I write this, the weighted score for this movie is 6.9, and I find that unbelievable.Every other Vietnam film I've seen (Full Metal Jacket, Good Morning Vietnam, Platoon, etc.) has painted the Vietnam war to be a messy, failed ""police operation,"" the US government to be a bunch of overstretched bureaucrats, and of course, war itself to be hell. Yeah, we get it. Thanks. How about something that actually honors those that fought and gave their lives for the ideals of our great country? Besides this movie, no other film I've seen has done so. This is the story the world missed when we heard about Vietnam, and it's time the stories of our veterans were respected. We Were Soldiers is the story of the first US troops that landed in Vietnam and of their leader. The film is an amazingly close and personal account of our first encounter on Vietnam soil, and it's beautifully and methodically executed. It makes the viewer feel the strategic tension of the first hours of operation from a commander's viewpoint, and from the soldiers' viewpoints.Looking over the demographic spread of voters, I'm glad to see 45+ years voting this so highly. I'm glad that the generation that remembers our country during the war, itself, considers this film so highly. The rest of us should too.",We Were Soldiers

Nothing new here.What sticks with me is the overly sappy tone of the beginning of the film, such as where Colonel Moore's (Mel Gibson's) baby daughter asks him ""Daddy, what's war?""  C'mon.At the film's climax, Moore orders his men to fix bayonettes and charge the enemy.  Only that never happened.  In other words, the climax of this supposedly true film was invented.  Why did the filmmakers do that?  It undercuts the integrity of the whole film.I gave the movie a 5.  It's okay, but it's just another war film.",We Were Soldiers

We Were soldiers is a great depiction of how life and battle was during Vietnam. Randall Wallace unlike our friend Oliver Stone depicted American soldiers as what and who they are patriots not rapists and murderers. The battle in this film is so graphic that when i saw it in theaters i without lying can say i almost felt i was there. The acting was spectacular and portrayed the real life characters perfectly. The stunts and fire sequences combined with the knowledge of over 50 live veterans coordinating the actual events makes this one of the most accurate war films in cinematic history.",We Were Soldiers

Nearly everyone is shown so there is a lot of pain and suffering to go with your pizza. Frankly this is a remake of the infamous THE GREEN BERET with all the repulsive patriotism and religious fervor. It seems that the Americans never learn. Maybe they should go back and finish the job.If this is meant to be a Vietnam movie for the younger generation, there is not even one clue about why the Americans were fighting. And did they won?

We've seen it all before.The VC outnumber the american troops by 100 to 1 (at least), while the american troops, led into battle by a bible-thumping colonel (played over-dramatically by an unimpressive Mel Gibson), mows them down in endless MTV-style clips.This isn't a very good film, even by war film standards. ""The Platoon"" is much better, ""Pearl Harbor"" is better, even the Rambo-style films are better. Although the film surely had a large budget (Gotta pay Gibson, right?), most of clips feels rudimentary or downright cheap (but the exploding heads and whatnot is nice -- if you like that sort of thing).The films main problem is however not the editing, but the characters. They're bleak, and either traditionally one-sided ""all american heroes"", or plain cannon fodder. There simply aren't any interesting characters around for the viewer to focus on. The colonel is bland, his roughneck master sergeant is a typical stereotype, the reporter that drops his M16 for a camera is a given.If we were to remove the characters and just had the explosions, I'm sure the film wouldn't suffer much. This just isn't worth seeing.",We Were Soldiers
407,freedom1122,So?,4,5 November 2002,We know lots of people died in Vietnam. This movie tells us nothing more. It shows us the horror. It shows us the suffering. It gives us nothing to take back. Where's the moral? One needs more than just the sight of suffering to be engaged.,We Were Soldiers
408,TheBigPulsatingBrain,An eye-opener...,8,4 April 2002,"As I am only 23 and from England, the Vietnam War passed me by with me learning very little knowledge about the events that took place there and the huge amount of human loss that was endured. I was only just informed about the events of 'The Valley of Death' by friend in the car on the way to the cinema who happens to be interested in war history. As he was filling me in on what I needed to know, I became more convinced that I would not enjoy this film as I find war films difficult to stomach at the best of times. But I am glad I did. If the courage and valour of the American soldiers is even 10% of what was portrayed on the screen then I am truly amazed and inspired. Mel Gibson was outstanding as Col. Moore, a man who understood the futility of his orders but would prepare his men and take care of them the best he could. Chris Klein was also excellent, showing he has more acting ability in him than just what we see in American Pie. Madeleine Stowe was also perfect as the devoted wife to Col. Moore and to all the other soldiers and their wives. In terms of historical accuracy(often where cinematic re-enactments fall on their faces)I am not sure if it was correct, as I am not entirely sure as I mentioned earlier that I do not have a huge knowledge of this particular conflict, but my friend told me it was pretty accurate and also that Col. Moore was an advisor on how the combat took place during shooting but if it was then this was a brilliant piece of film making and has encouraged me to watch more films of the same genre.",We Were Soldiers
409,Kumar-6,This is a horrible film,1,25 June 2002,"We Were Soldiers drags out every cliche' in the book. Randall Wallace, the cinematic genius who wrote Pearl Harbor Braveheart and directed Leonardo DiCaprio as two characters in The Man in the Iron Mask, brings us his masterpiece. This is worse than Pearl Harbor even. Bad acting, the combat scenes were really not all that well done compared to both Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down. The movie tries to be different by showing the soldiers at home before they leave for combat. Woo hoo, and for character development, we see that they have kids, cute kids who ask them questions about war. When Mel's daughter asks him what war is, he explains ""sometimes bad guys do bad things and America has to stop them."" Yes, I know that is not verbaitim, but it exemplifies the film's simplistic attitude. I was waiting for Mel to pick up an American flag and kill the general with it, Patriot style. Speaking of which, this film makes the Patriot look like the most subtle film ever made about warfare. Another thing that Wallace pretends to do is show both sides of the war by cutting in a couple scenes of the Vietnamese and showing that one of their killed soldiers has a girlfriend! Whaoh, that is groundbreaking cinema! Wallace shows his real attitude about showing both sides in a scene with Gibson and Chris Klein in a church. They kneel and pray, and Gibson prays for both sides. But at the end he throws in ""and god, what I said about both sides...disregard that, help us kick their asses."" Or something like that. I mean, what the hell? This is a movie that claims to honor the memory of the men who died in Vietnam. How exactly does it do that? By showing them get ripped apart and shot, but not by making them into flesh and blood human beings. one guy actually dies saying ""at least I died for my country."" How so? This is Nam, you died in a war we lost and that we should never have been involved in. And at least twice, a dying character tells a fellow soldier ""tell my wife...I loved her."" More ludicrous still is the scene when the photographer picks up a gun. Oh wait, it gets more ludicrous when he starts taking pictures...one of the cheesiest montages ever is supposed to display the devestation of the battle. This is a cliched, lame, poorly written and directed film that wants you to believe it is important.",We Were Soldiers

After all the wars and subsequent films, I can only say, ""We Were Soldiers,"" is the most brilliant, graphic, ghastly, realistic, ugliest piece of carnage ever put on film.

The men will love all the blood and guts and the women will be brought to tears from all the emotional scenes of husbands going off to war, babies being born and raised that you know are about to become fatherless. I had to leave the theater at one point when the Col's wife was going to all the widow's houses. Every teen ager (and young adult too, for that matter) needs to see this film to realize what it was really like in Vietnam. Most of them do not have a clue. Mel Gibson was first-rate in his portrayal of Lt. Col. Moore, who is sent, under-manned, in to what he is sure is a suicide mission. I went in to this not expecting much but was surprised, despite the wrenching emotion dragged out of me, that it was a very well-made film. I am NOT a fan of Chris Klein and thought, oh, no, not him again, he can't act, but his character is appropriately understated, not flagged out as - HEY EVERYBODY - HERE IS A BIG STAR - PAY ATTENTION TO THIS CHARACTER as most filmmakers do. Sam Elliott did an excellent job playing Mel Gibson's right hand man, Greg Kinnear also turned in a solid performance as the unfailing helicopter pilot.

416,conorg,"worth watching, but not particularly meaningful.",7,11 March 2002,"When I first heard about this movie my first thought was that Mel Gibson had made a big mistake here. Why star in yet another Vietnam war movie when so many had been done before? Not only that but, add to a genre already littered with great, great movies.Many people will totally disagree with me on this point but I feel that enough movies have been made about this war. I don't disagree with the overriding themes and lessons contained within movies which continue to be made about it - I just feel that most of the good films made already cover the various aspects of that war and that by continuing to make more movies about it in some way dilutes the effect they can potentially have.That aside I did enjoy this movie. It was visually impressive, certainly bringing the horror of the war and violence directly to the audience, and the action scenes (of which thankfully there were plenty) were all executed expertly.Mel Gibson's performance was fine, as was Sam Elliot's - even though his character is downgraded to little more than a ""tough as nails sergeant"" stereotype - and the look of the movie seemed to work well overall.It was the glossy parts of the movie (more akin to early Bruckheimer efforts) I found most dissatisfying.  Especially the Barry Pepper ""photography"" scene which I thought didn't fit in at all with the rest of the movie and, whilst well intended, ended up coming across tacky.The difficulty Randall Wallace faces here is that it is an action movie first and foremost and, as I've already said, when he concentrates on that the result is above average however when he tries to delve into moments of moral and human examination They just come off looking trite.  Especially when the onscreen ratio is overwhelming action 99% - moral message 1%Overall, whilst not as good as Black Hawk Down, well worth watching, but not particularly meaningful. 7/10.",We Were Soldiers

It is not what he says that gets to you, it's how he says it. He is completely honest, he holds nothing back.  And he keeps his word. The movie would make anyone associated with the military proud.  You feel like you have a connection to all of the characters in this movie.  You feel the pain of the wives when they get the news of their husband's deaths, and the fear of the stranded soldiers when they learn that they are surrounded by Vietnamese troops.

This movie is not for everyone, because the battle scenes are never ending.  Besides the battle scenes, there are other scenes which involve the wives of the men whom are involved in the war. For this reason, you may get away with calling it a partial Chic Flix in order to persuade your wife or girlfriend to watch it.My suggestion is to shove this movie into you DVD or video player, raise the volume, and just sit back and enjoy (if you can) all of the explosions, scenery, and carnage this fine movie has to offer (that sounds weird). This an extremely exciting, well acted film and should have been noticed at Oscar time.

420,southernryan,how can I say awesome,10,1 October 2002,"I have read some of the comments on this movie and some people got it right by saying how good of a movie this was. Everyone who talked junk about it needs to realize that this movie is a tribute to all who fought in the Ia Drang Valley. Some say that Lt. Col. Moore was put up to high, I say he was not put up high enough. I wish that they would show that movie in every Army ROTC class in every school in the country. That is what a true leader does in battle. The movie was by far the best war movie I have ever seen. As a member of the military myself I appreciate the lengths that Wallace as well as all the others guys went through to make this as real as possible. Some just look at it as another 'movie', it shows the sacrifice that men make for this country. I don't think that any of the soldiers actually wanted to go to the Ia Drang Valley, but they had to.

But the movie is pretty damn sorry.  The lines are really old and cliche, like ""...i die for my country.."" stuffs like that.  While the effects are real the battle looks fake.  They fail at trying to show the perspective from the enemy.  They just charge into the Armerican soldiers with bayonet.  And then get mowed down.

It humanized all characters and you felt as though the unexpected was out to grab you. The movie took you to all kinds of perspectives, the Vietnamese, the war at home, and off course the front from the American soldiers. It was a movie which covered it all and everything you had to see was shown, the brutality, the horrors, the bonds of friends, and the loss of life. It leaves you with a really new image of the war and you actually sit there and ask yourself how could men have possibly survived with such scenes running through their minds. I would say the film is the closest thing to perfectly depicting those scenes but we all acknowledge that true images of war cannot possibly be shown on the big screen. However if I can choose any movie which is close to it, I'd have to say We Were Soldiers is that movie. 10/10",We Were Soldiers

424,erinnpayne,Erinnpayne,10,4 May 2013,"I loved this movie. Some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. It's a sad movie with an insight into war that is not often offered to viewers of war/epic movies. The cast is excellent with legends such as Mel Gibson. This very heart wrenching and emotional movie has a slight comical element provided by Sam Elliot. I, being a fan of epic and war movies, had huge expectations for this movie and they were exceeded. Being based on the true story of when a group of around 400 American soldiers go into battle against almost 4000 Vietnamese soldiers in the valley of death in 1965, it truly shows viewers what war is really like, something many of us will never have to experience. It's non stop action with amazing effects but there is always the overwhelming sadness and awareness of the circumstances. We never forget about the wives back home or the children who will now grow up without fathers and this awareness is just emphasized by the fact that part of the movie is of the families receiving news of death and their reactions, often making viewers cry themselves. The viewers are in fact, so involved that the loss of a character feels like a loss to the viewer. Every single character is developed, even the Vietnamese. There are no heroes in this movie, although shown from American perspective the viewer is made aware of the fact that the Vietnamese may not be there by choice and also have families back home that will go on living without a husband or father. I was impressed by the fact that the film was made with the input and advice of the real Lt. Col. Hal Moore and widows of the deceased soldiers, making it just that little bit more real. With an overwhelmingly emotional yet exciting story and a bittersweet ending what more can you ask for? I, myself, did not cry as the only movie I've ever cried in is Braveheart(I'm not very emotional) but my entire family and friends were sobbing throughout. This movie is one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen and has left a lasting effect and impression on me. This movie just shows that with a duo like the incredible Mel Gibson and the amazing Randall Wallace, there are no mistakes. 10/10 I highly recommend it to anyone.",We Were Soldiers

Never been to war myself but I have company for mountain rescue services and we call ourselves ""mountain rangers"". And for me I feel the army rangers like brothers-in-arm too.

Hal Moore and was directed by Randall Wallace; A great American War film, filled with action, adventure, love and war. In this film Mel Gibson leads the very first group of some 400 American men into a hot zone where 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers are waiting. During this battle excessive gun fights, devotion of friendship, and love was shown. This movie is different from other Vietnam War films. It shows the emotional battle of war not only in battle, but for the loved ones waiting in anticipation back at home; praying and longing to see there loved ones once more. Madeleine Stowe (Julie Moore), as Gibson's (Lt. Col. Hal Moore) wife played a crucial part in this film; waiting everyday for that yellow cab, and that one letter, that one letter that says; ""were sorry, for the loss of your loved one."" Instead of letting the wives of the honored men see that yellow cab pull up in front of their house, Gibson's wife and friend decide to deliver the messages themselves.

My criticism is aimed at the directing and cinematography, which stunk. This film was just a couple of clicks above a high-school play. Scenes which should have had tremendous impact on the viewer were just ... scenes. It's telling that many of the positive reviews here were written by veterans, or contained comments from veterans.

The makers should have spent more time editing the film to at least make it passable as a war/action movie, instead of rushing to release this piece of trash. Nevertheless, the writing was so poor that it never really had a chance to become a memorable work.My biggest problem with this film is that none of the characters are worth caring about. The quick jumps from scene to scene and the cliche-ridden dialog preclude the viewer from ever getting a deeper look into the hearts and minds of the players. Mel Gibson's Hal Moore was portrayed as a mythic warrior who somehow had the omniscience to predict all of the NVA's moves, and yet his notes on the French massacre looked like they were written by a ten year old. Furthermore, his religious drivel was really overdone.And just because a soldier is wearing a bracelet emblazoned with his newborn's name, that doesn't mean I'm going to care if he lives or dies in battle. It's sad when a wafer-thin flick like American Pie gives Chris Klein's character more depth than a supposedly ""serious"" film like We Were Soldiers.Additionally, the soldiers' wives were given a fair amount of screen time but little to do other than receive telegrams and cry. Madeleine Stowe was decent as Moore's wife (but incidentally, her collagen-injected lips were a bit distracting). And one particularly offensive scene involved these women - the scene in which they were discussing the laundromat. I thought it was in poor taste to make a joke out of racial discrimination.Another incredibly offensive thing about the movie was the half-hearted attempt to present the Vietnamese as human beings. As someone else wrote here, it was very patronizing. The NVA soldiers facelessly marched up and down hills and were subsequently mowed down by gunfire like Bruce Lee disposed of hordes of ninjas. And yet the director wants us to care when the wife of a fallen soldier looks at his photo. Which is it?In terms of action, the battle scenes were average. The blood and gore was on par with recent war movies. But the Americans were painted as kids who were afraid to advance unless copious amounts of bombs were dropped on the Vietnamese first. Perhaps that's how it was, but if you're going to try to tap into nationalistic fervor by picking one battle that the US won and by exaggerating the deeds of a Lt. Colonel, you may as well go all the way and invent some compelling and dramatic events on the field of battle. I might have enjoyed this film on a superficial level if there were at least some in-depth tactical maneuvers involved. Greg Kinnear flying in to the save the day isn't good enough.Ultimately, We Were Soldiers is a weak war movie. It has no heart, no drama, and little action. I strongly suggest that you skip this one, as it doesn't come close to comparing to great films like Apocalypse Now and to a lesser extent, Platoon.",We Were Soldiers

He gathered a lot of testimony from others who were there, and collated it all in the book ""We Were Soldiers Once... And Young.""  After reading this book, I should have known that the film would let me down.  Gen. Moore is proud that the movie is more accurate than almost any other previously released.  While that may be true, I feel that it has been butchered by the editing process.  The movie runs long already, but it needs to be a lot longer to really get the feel for it.  The deleted scenes that make it to the 'Special Features' section of the DVD add much to the film, and should be watched.  Even with these scenes, only a few characters are developed, and there is very little impact made to the viewer.  After experiencing both the book and the movie, I keep wondering if the benefits of awareness generated by Hollywood marketing outweigh the blood money made from creating an inadequate historical representation.  I guess if the movie helps people to understand the soldiers' position in war, then the benefits do outweigh the negatives.Bless all of our soldiers who have fought and died for us!",We Were Soldiers
436,dandagon,The Best Vietnam Movie,10,6 June 2006,"Movies about the Vietnam War were all the rage in the late '70s and '80s, however, there have been very few movies about the war made since then. The Vietnam movies of the 1980's were almost all anti-war and played on many of the misconceptions, lies, and half-truths about the American soldier in Vietnam. We Were Soldiers is not your common Vietnam movie. Instead of depicting the American soldier as a savage, ruthless killer of women and children, it does a good job of focusing on the valor and bravery of the American soldier in Vietnam. If you like action-packed war movies, this is just the movie for you. The movie takes place in the battle of the Ia Drang Valley in November of 1965, where a small company of American soldiers clashed with nearly 2000 NVA regulars in the first major battle of American involvement in Vietnam. The film is based on the book ""We Were Soldier once and Young"" and follows the characters of Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Joe Galloway, the author of the book. Without giving too much away, the entire 80% of the movie is bitter fighting in the valley, and 20% depicts the wives and loved ones of the men fighting in the battle and how they deal with the stress and strain of losing their loved ones. Like I said before, this is THE BEST Vietnam movie out there, and after you watch it go thank every Vietnam vet that you know.",We Were Soldiers

The fact that most of the major characters helped work on this movie was one reason.  The main one is that Hal Moore did a great job on his book.I admired his leadership.  As a Vietnam Vet myself I can tell you that while there were a lot of jerks in command, the majority of commanders were decent men trying to do the best they could in a bad situation.My wife really like the depiction of the wives and how they handled the worst part of war, they death of their husbands.Finally, I was impressed with the depiction of the enemy.

It's a good story that is presented horribly. The formula for this move is as follows: Patriotism --> War Movie cliché --> vigorous and obvious tug at heart strings in overly dramatic dialog --> rinse, repeat.This movie just wouldn't stop trying to evoke feelings from me. It's like I could see a hand reach from the screen and try to manipulate me through it's cheesy script.I am a soldier (Marine actually) myself, and I don't want to take anything away from the soldiers who fought in Vietnam.

No true criticism of the military seems to be allowed these days.One reason is probably because the army is so forthcoming in lending equipment to filmmakers but this of course makes prostitutes out of directors and producers, who are no longer free to make a judgment and draw the right conclusions. I fully understand that the US public is hungry for patriotic material to satisfy the feelings of national pride that are so strong these days. However, this can never be a reason for not viewing one`s own shortcomings in a critical light! To me, ""The Deer Hunter"" with Robert De Niro was what I would consider a really great (anti)war movie.The final scenes where the hunter decides to NOT shoot the deer, conveys the message ""live and let live"" instead of unloading all this b******t pathos when soldiers are saluting each other in the end..(this has almost become standard in most recent war movies).

For that I can only thank God.The details of the movie were even worse in the book. It's a heartbreaking story but it needed to be told.

442,frankreborn,"Unoriginal, badly written and directed wannabe star vehicle",6,10 March 2002,"Randall Wallace should stay away from Hollywood. Having written the not-too-bad screenplay for Gibson's ""Braveheart"", he felt the need to assault our senses of good taste by giving us ""The Man In The Iron Mask"", the script for ""Pearl Harbor"" and now, this piece of unmemorable if time-passing, overly-stylised pap. The opening half-hour is appallingly mishandled, with Gibson looking uncomfortable and saggy, and the dialogue becoming increasingly corny. Shephard growls his way into Vietnam, and the 'training camp' looks, literally, like a walk in the park compared to Joel Schumacher's gritty ""Tigerland"". Once we enter the war, things do pick up, mainly because there is hardly any dialogue, and that which we do hear is thankfully drowned out by the fantastic sound effects. A hearty attempt is made at showing some sort of Vietnamese perspective, but we still have a long way to go before we can safely say that we are being un-biased in our depiction of war in cinema. There are some cringeworthy moments in terms of the direction (including two appalling montage-attempts that look like commercial spoofs), but these are countered by some stunning visuals, notably the silhouetted Vietnamese soldiers closing in on two Yankee heroes. A special mention must go to the lack of anything new happening in the performances. Gibson gives perhaps his worst judged performance of his career, Shephard is an entertaining cliche, Kinnear does his smarmy thing and Pepper does not attempt to break any new ground either. Stowe, however, does her best with a poor role, lending it dignity and passion when it doesn't really deserve it. It seems as if ""based on a true story"" is now an excuse to go overboard on overly-patriotic, melodramatic glorified history, and ""We Were Soldiers"" proves to be another case of that very annoying Hollywood symptom (although the superior ""Black Hawk Down"" did not suffer as badly)",We Were Soldiers

This film depicts the very real idealism of some who served during the tumultuous Vietnam War, and their commitment to their oneness as a unit, as a cadre, and as brothers under fire. Not merely content to demonstrate this strength of being amongst combatants, this film shows with clarity and heart wrenching dignity, the steadfast love of the wives for their men who fought and for many, did not return.

It confronted the emotions and fears that soldiers and their families have regardless of where the war is and where they are living.  Some tremendous acting.  I am usually very critical of movies, and I am not afraid to really tear up a movie I didn't like.  I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie.

447,ibmelchior,A great book/story... an average movie.,5,26 February 2002,"Just saw this movie in a sneak preview and wasn't expecting much as I sat in the theater.  Randall Wallace is an average screenwriter/filmmaker at best. The ""Pearl Harbor"" screenplay bordered on silly and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" was a dull Muskateer popcorn flick.""We Were Soldiers,"" based on the excellent book by Col. Hal Moore, etc. about the first major battle of the Vietnam War (Nov. 1965), is another average war movie that rests on cliche, tin-ear dialog and ham-fisted, patriotism.  The movie tries so hard to be ""great"" and ""powerful"" that instead of presenting this amazing story and earning your respect and admiration -- as all truly great films do; the filmmaker demands and tries to force that respect -- he fails.The battle scenes are graphic, but not realistic.  In nearly every shot of battle the viewer can ""see-the-man-behind-the-curtain"" and spot the hollywood-ism of it all.  Where Spielberg/Hanks suceeded with ""SPR"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" Wallace just gets by.  The blood effects in the film look obviously fake, it's too purple/orange and flows like Karo syrup, pulling the viewer out of the movie.  The pacing is uneven and emotional moments wasted when they are followed by confusing editing/pacing.  Scenes of the ""commanders"" in Saigon fall from the sky it seems and add nothing but on-the-nose exposition.""We Were Soldiers"" Is a missed opportunity from start to finish and it's a shame Wallace didn't have the chops to give the story the film treatment it deserves.

This is the only war movie I can think of that really involves the families of every man on the battlefield.  Unless you count the great Saving Private Ryan.  Anyway, this film's extraordinary aerial camera shots of the battle scenes and Gibson's ability to take a leadership role once again surely earn this movie some Academy Award nominations.This film can be disturbing to some, I understand that.  But even if you don't care for it, you have to admit that it puts you inside the battle, like you are standing there with the soldiers as they fight for us.  This film's picture is clear and understandable.  The movie also does not pull out of the fighting for too long.  This is a very emotional movie, with some really good performances.  I think Sam Elliot should get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor due to his grandpa-like humor towards the men.If you have not seen this movie, take it from me, you WILL be entertained and educated by it.

449,sssdiaz,Delivers everything a war flick should contain,10,18 June 2007,"I was really disappointed when I heard of the negative reviews this movie received because I did not find a single thing wrong with this movie, it has the perfect balance of combat, training, the soldiers getting to know each other and build their relationship's as comrades willing to take a bullet for each other, and the perfect balance of the characters personal lives and families. This movie has the best balance I have ever seen, the combat is unmatched in realism, but if you are not lucky enough to see this movie in 5.1 surround, than you are missing out on a lot, because this movie audio blasts from all directions, from the screams of the wounded, to the main characters giving out orders, to the napalm bombs blowing up and giving off that distinctive sound of fire like a whip, to the bullets brushing off the leaves of the trees, to the explosion of artillery, the sound amazingly surpasses the visuals. Another strength of this movie, is its accuracy, in this movie you don't see people smoking weed and constantly drinking alcohol, like many Vietnam war flicks like to make out how our troops were in Vietnam, to try to de rank them as human beens, like they were a bunch of animals, well no, this movie is accurate to the tee, except for some minimal unimportant stuff. Some of the best scenes of this movie were when it came to be night time, there were 2 nigh time scenes, number 1 was the platoon cutoff scene where bugum tells the sarge to request illumination, and the sarge agrees and right in front of theme no farther than 15 yards were the ARVN, in another, they wake up to see the ARVN walk by theme, they pretend to be dead, and then the sarge messes up and makes too much noise putting his gun on Semi-auto, because his safety was on, it was a close nerve-racking experience, for movie viewers, overall see the movie, its like 10 bucks and its worth a lot more than that, if the Vietnam war means a lot to you not for the history of the country, but for the history of the 58,000 who died for stupidness, and for the MIA who are still out there, and the remains that still lie out there in the uninhabited jungles, RIP brave souls, you will not be forgotten.",We Were Soldiers

461,rukusjr,We Were Cliched and Written Poorly,1,17 September 2002,"This movie reeks of cliches and historical fantasy. Mel Gibson hams it up as the good Christian colonel who loves his men like his own sons, and apparently is untouchable by bullets or scratches despite wandering into heavy firefights. We also have several other characters like a young father, a grumpy stern CO, the outcast soldier, and so on. You know, typical cliched characters you'd have seen in previous war movies (the absolute worst has to come from Wallace's poor portrayal of Blacks). As a result of this, I felt no pity for them. They weren't believable so how I can show emotion, I ask you?The basic plot behind the movie is this... American soldiers are sent mindlessly into a valley for no explainable reason so they can fight X-number of NVA. They are indeed outnumbered and so the contest of wits between Mel Gibson's blue eyes versus the NV leader begins. I'm pretty sure Wallace was trying to get this whole setup out of the way as quickly as possible so he can really bring WAR onto the big screen. Now when I say he brings it, he really brings war. His production crew must have had a field day trying to drum up every possible way a soldier can die in that battle. The firefights themselves were pretty decent and accurate portrayals although some of the scenes in the movie were questionable and downright obscene (the search for the missing platoon was fictitious and how the Americans drove the NVA from the hills was also fictitious).
No only was the movie cliched, and poorly written, but I should also add We Were Boring. Check the History Channel and see the interviews of the REAL soldiers (they didn't like the Hollywood-ized version either) from that battle to get the REAL events of the battle, or read the book.Thumbs down.",We Were Soldiers
462,wm28,A good step towards depicting the reality of war but not far enough,6,6 August 2008,"This movie delivers the message ""not even the winner wins any battle"" very effectively. In addition, it is more realistic and showing more of the psychology of war, bereavement and fear than most American war movies do, creating a multi-dimensional picture of a sequence of events at wartime. Still, if psychology of war is the main issue (instead of the plot which is very simple in this case) it could have been a lot better if the movie had shown much more of the Vietnamese soldiers' psychology and understanding of the war. The way the Vietnamese commander is depicted is very shallow and stereotypical. In addition, there are some unrealistic happenings in the movie. First of all, a trained soldier, especially a commander of an infantry unit (Lt. Co. Hal Moore) would NEVER face enemy machine gun fire attack standing upright (with a handgun in his hand). Everyone MUST lie down in that situation to minimize risk of injury; if you join the army you learn that on the first week. I know it looks a lot more heroic and brave on the screen standing that way but doing that is plain stupid and irresponsible, an equivalent of playing Russian roulette. Second, if an infantry unit expects enemy attack waiting in a ditch, soldiers should not stand at whispering distance to each other. The defendants must keep at least 4-5 meters distance between themselves on the defense line, otherwise a single hand grenade may kill several of them at once. Again, that is probably a compromise movie makers made to create a more appealing outcome. To sum up, reality of war is a lot less romantic than most war movies, and still less romantic than this more realistic war movie; but I suppose people do not want to see reality of war in the raw because they are more inclined to enjoy a movie that reinforces their beliefs and stereotypes and which satisfies their romantic hero images and illusions. After all, movie makers want to make money, and I must admit they made an OK compromise on this one. One must keep in mind that this is still not a documentary, though.",We Were Soldiers

This is the same guy who directed Man in the Iron Mask (also wrote it as well) and gave us historical monstrosities like Pearl Harbor and Braveheart.We Were Soldiers is a sorry film filled to the brim with cliches and inept directing. None of the characters we feel empathy or pity for (thanks to some horrible dialogue and poor acting) and their utter reliance on the fact they are supposed to be based on real characters makes it look cheap. They could have done a lot better. One of the most annoying habits in the movie has to be Wallace's handling of ""dramatic"" scenes. Why for the love of Mike, he loves to extrude so much cheese from them is beyond me.""Daddy, what's a war?""I mean, come on! Can they do better than this? Of course they can.

This movie is utter crap!!!It is the most overdone piece of rubbish about the vietnam war, or any war for that matter, i have ever seen. It focuses on heroism like black hawk down yet someow fails to do so in a positive way, by having the blatant glorification very overdone.It lacks realism to the point were it seems like a science fiction movie.The combat was so terribly staged, completely lacking in realism. There is a part where a vietcong soldier somehow appears out of nowhere and bayonet charges at Colonel Hal Moore, the leader of the operation and get to within a meter of him where the Colonel(?),played by Mel Gibson ,spins around in time to shoot him in head. As you can may be able to gather events like this are all too common in this absolute disgrace of a  film. Furthmore although the emphasis of this movie is placed on heroism, glory and sacrifice the film fails to capture any believable emotion unlike war flicks like the Thin Red Line(excellent film, must see)Watch Rambo instead as both Rambo and We Were Soldiers are of the same substance but at least Rambo does not attempt to be something it isnt.",We Were Soldiers

It places the viewer right in the middle of the Vietnam War, grabs their emotions and sets them free. This movie commemorates the memories and makes heroes of each and every husband, brother, and son involved in a forgotten war- a war that was dismissed and frowned upon by the American nation as a whole. The film also takes the viewer into the home of the soldier. It invades the private life of the loved ones at home. We feel as though we are a part of the family in one scene, and the buddy of a fallen soldier in the next. A wife, child, friend of a soldier gone to war to fight for an ungrateful nation one minute, and the next the brave and loyal soldier.

Great attention to detail and adherance to what generally happened, with input from the very people who were there and wrote the book upon which served as the basis for the movie paid off.  There was none of the standard Hollywood venom that characterizes the vast majority of Hollywood films set in Vietnam.  There were some things that were pretty ridiculous, like an NVA soldier walking up to Mel Gibson without firing his weapon, like a dieing soldier saying something like he was glad to give his life for his country, like the setting looking little like Vietnam.  But overall, the film was right on target.  I served in this unit later in the war and was really shaken by the film.  It was too close to reality that I had long ago buried.

This is an excellent film however the ending differs greatly from the book which was written by the American journalist Joe Galloway who was there on the ground throughout the battle. In true movie-world tradition the ending was changed to show the Americans winning when in fact they were bailed out by other American troops who were also then attacked and took seriously heavy casualties. Why can't films based on the truth keep to the truth?As to the film itself it covers the historical changing of the American army from World War 2 equipment and tactics to the new M16 and helicopter based infantry. Covering the first major battle of the American involvement in the Vietnam war it shows the guts and horror of close quarter battle in overwhelming circumstances. To the films credit it also covers the difficulty of the wives left at home being notified of the deaths of friends and loved ones by telegram.,We Were Soldiers

Even if that had not been the case, I would hope that I could have watched We Were Soldiers and been objective as to it's premise. I emphatically contend that this is the ultimate, most compelling looking glass into what went on during that terrible time. The naiveté of the men who left was all too real. By the end of the movie, as with the war, our innocence was lost. As other reviewers have stated, the violence was indeed graphic but I do not believe it was gratuitous.

479,Mike-575,"Powerful and moving, not a film for everyone however",10,24 February 2002,"I was privileged to see a preview of Mel Gibson's new film ""We Were Soldiers"" based upon the book written by his real life character, Lt. Col. Harold Moore, along with Joe Galloway. I attended a showing along with numerous other Viet Nam vets and it would seem that there were as many opinions about the movie as there were viewers.  Like the war itself, each person in attendance probably had some personal experiences that the movie brought back from that deep, and sometimes distant, place we have put them.The movie was almost overwhelmingly graphical, but afterwards I realized this was instrumental in the telling of the story.  For the movie is truly about the leadership that Col. Moore brought to his men of the 1st of the 7th, and his determination that they would not suffer the fate of the French in Viet Nam, nor his own unit's most infamous battle, that of Custer's Stand at Little Big Horn.It was his determination and commitment that his men be as highly trained, as strongly molded as a unit, and most importantly as well lead as possible that stands out. This determination is obviously rooted in his deeply abiding belief that military leaders shall never forget that when they lead men into war, many of those men will never come back alive, but that those who lead shall never abandon them, even in their shared darkest hours.And while the movie highly succeeds in conveying the horror and tragedy that war is....has been...and always shall be, it was more difficult for me to realize that our War Department and Army could have been so callous as to have delegated the responsibility of notifying next-of-kin of the death of their loved ones to the local Yellow Cab company. Then I realized that in late 1965 it was all so new and no one knew that this war was going to grow and consume so many young American lives over the next nine years.The two most significant scenes in the movie for me were firstly, the scene when the course of the battle teeters on the brink of either disaster or success and the most important communication that Col. Moore's superiors have to convey is that General Westmoreland would like for him to leave the battlefield and fly to Saigon so the general can have a briefing. This more than anything pointed out how tragically we were doomed to failure in Viet Nam due to the political will, not the military will, being in control. The second most significant scene was in the airport where one soldier is pushing his buddy through the concourse and the voice over says...""They did not fight for God.....country.....right. They fought for each other"", a fact that every Viet Nam vet would attest to.This a movie worth seeing. It is another testament, with a worthy cinematographic effort, to the futility and absurdity of war, and how that among madness can be greatness. It is a movie that will unlikely leave the viewer devoid of emotion.  What those emotions may be are as likely to be as highly personal, as the strength of their feeling.",We Were Soldiers
480,ddinnerv,"Powerful, Stirring Movie",10,4 February 2002,"I just saw a preview of ""We Were Soldiers"" and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to recommend it.  Aside from an amazingly realistic and often graphic telling of America's first bloody battle in Vietnam, Randall Wallace delivers a well-balanced perspective on the people and emotions involved in what would become one of the most trying periods in America's history.This movie is definitely not for the squeamish as it contains some extremely powerful battle scenes, but shining through many of those are beautiful illustrations of self sacrifice and the ever-present sentiment of leaving no one behind (see also `Black Hawk Down').Mel Gibson gives an outstanding performance as Lt. Colonel Harold Moore. I know that the passion that this officer had for his family, his country, and his men is not unique amongst those who serve our country, but it is so refreshing to see honor and virtue exalted.  Harold Moore IV was apparently at the screening I saw, and I only hope that his generation grows up in the image of his great-grandfather.There's not enough space to give the entire cast the credit they are due, but definitely worth mentioning are Madeleine Stowe as Moore's wife, Sam Elliott as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley, Chris Klein as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, and Barry Pepper as Joe Galloway.

484,x22213,Very Powerful,10,12 February 2002,"I have just finished one of the most powerful emotional experiences of my life.  I had the opportunity to watch a preview of this movie with approximately 1500 other cadets.  Also seated with us were three of the stars of the movie (Mel Gibson, Madeline Stowe, and Chris Klein), approximately forty generals representing some of the highest ranking officers in the Army, and several retired Army officers and soldiers, who were present for the events depicted in the film.The movie itself is an incredibly realistic depiction of warfare.  It is not only bloody, but it conveys the terror that a soldier would feel fighting outnumbered, surrounded, far-from safety, against an enemy that moves in swarms by day and by stealth at night.  At no time is the destruction glorified in any way.  In fact, its true impact is shown both on the other soldiers in the battle as well as the families left at home.Watching this movie, I could empathize with the characters in a way that was stronger than any other movie that I have ever seen.  Throughout the movie, I could only think about how I could be in the same situation as these soldiers.  In about a year, I will have graduated, gotten married, nearly completed the standard infantry schooling, and be getting ready to take command of my first platoon.  Though the events depicted in the movie took place in a war that ended about thirty years ago, it is not hard to imagine me being in a similar situation in a very short time.  Technology has changed, but the basics remain the same.As sat there, trying to imagine how I would react if thrust into such a chaotic situation, how my fiance would react if something happened to me, I was awe-struck by the courage and determination demonstrated by the soldiers that were there.  When the movie was over and the lights had come back on, I turned around and looked people that lived through the events just depicted on the screen.  Standing less than five feet from me were some true heroes. People that did what their country asked selflessly.  I have to say that by the end of the movie, I was as close to tears as I have ever come by any movie, a feeling shared by many of my fellow cadets.",We Were Soldiers

As did Saving Private Ryan (1998), Soldiers shows the atrocity in war early on yet unlike many other films, the key to bringing Soldiers to life is the fact that the atrocities of war do not fade and we as an audience are plunged into an era of horror as well as honor.While Gibson's performance is not his best, it is the stunning cinematography and dialogue that makes the film a worthwhile one. Barry Pepper and Chris Klein have stirring performances and powerful dialogue.

This movie also shows - more clearly than other war stories - why wars become so important and tragic, not only from a nationalistic but, perhaps more importantly, from an individual's or a family's viewpoint.The only thing that disturbs me is that this movie has a biased political tone in it, which maybe was not intentional, but that nevertheless is there, seen with European eyes anyway.

490,KSoze00,One of the worst movies of the year,1,4 March 2002,"That is a lofty title, and I plan on backing it up point by point.1:  The performances were weak at best:  Mel Gibson was decidedly wooden as he portrayed Lt. Col. Moore.  I understand that this role is hard to play, the character itself is rife with cliches, but a performance based exclusively on cliches is below Gibson (I blame the writer/direcotr, more on that later.)  Madeline Stowe was terrible.  Did she receive a copy of this script before the day they shot it?  She flubbed lines, made unnatural facial movements (these really got me,) and all and all stunk up the joint. You know when Felicity is acting circles around you something is terribly wrong.  As for the younger actors, Barry Pepper was good as a journalist, and Marc Blucas was fine, but he and Chris Kline ended up being inconsequential.  Also, the Amy Tan inspired all-women sit ins were dreadfully acted.2:  The script was a series of unnecessary monologues:  Mel Gibson's character is ridiculously saintly.  He gives a very special speech to his men, his kid, his wife, his men again, another one of his kids, his wife again, a journalist, his men again... it goes on.  It felt totally unnatural, and the unnecessary speeches took momentum away from the more interesting scenes.3:  The cinematography was lazy:  Blood on the camera on half a dozen occasions.  If this was on purpose this camera man needs to be shot.  if not... well... perhaps film school is the answer.  Also, shots were oddly out of focus, mislit, and just poorly done.  Greg Toland where are you, deep focus would have been nice, hell, any focus would have been nice.4:  There was no consistant tone:  The film jumped around, cut out of scenes at emotional moments, and had no consistancy at all.  The tone fo the film towards the start felt almost comic, and then suddenly it tried to be Saving private Ryan, then it flashed back to America for 15 minutes, and then didn't return.  We had battle scenes that felt out of place, and no consistant style shown at all.  This felt like a high school production in that sense.5:  The music was ridiculous:  Ugh, I know the 7th batallion theme is an Irish war song, but could they have found a less legubrious version. Honestly, I was laughing every time they played it.  Plus, the cliche ridden score felt disjointed as it jumped from 1950's war music, to sweeping emotional faire.  It was just poorly done.6:  The montages:  There were almost a dozen random montages that killed any momentum the movie had (often very little.)  my favorite was the Barry Pepper camera one, it really cracked me up.  It looked like something me and my friends would put together on my computer.  Layer 1, actor jumping up and down in front of a blue screen with a camera.  Layer 2, black and white photos.  Layer 3, stock footage of fire.  I AM NOT KIDDING!  THEY CUED STOCK FOOTAGE!!!  The production values were low all around, but that was pathetic.7:  Blatant and unnecessary deviations from the text:  For a movie that tauted itself as based on true events, perhaps they should have stuck to true events.  Moore was not on the front lines leading his troops over a hill.  He, like any officer following protocol, was behind his troops as he led them into battle (a battle that hardly resembled the finale.)  That was just one of a number of instances where the filmmakers ignored the truth for no apparent reason, as the dramatic tension was not increased their way.I think i covered most of my complaints, although I have more.  This was a poor film, and I cannot recommend it.  See Blackhawk Down, a far superior film, hell, see Rollerball, it at least doesn't pretend to be good.  This is Spike Friedman signing out.

The country duo, Big & Rich, wrote and performed a wonderful song relating to this film, which appears on their album, Comin' To Your City. The title is, ""THE 8TH OF November.""-- The songwriters stated, ""This is a true story about a man we are honored to know. His name is Niles Harris of Deadwood, SD. He is one of just four of the thirty men from his 2nd Platoon of Charlie Company who survived when over 1200 Vietcong ambushed the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Every word of that song had to say so much. This song is one of the biggest things we've been a part of and one of the most enlightening.""The lyrics go like this: Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota to fight for the red, white and blue. He was 19 and green, with a new M-16, just doing what he had to do. He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble with the smell of napalm in the air. And the sergeant said...look up ahead, like a dark evil cloud, 1200 came down on him, and 29 more. They fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne.Chorus:On the 8th of November the angels were crying as they carried his brothers away. With the fire raining down, and the hell all around, there were few men left standing that day. Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky, 1965, the 8th of November.Now he's 58, and his pony tail's gray, but the battle still plays in his head. He limps when he walks, but he's strong when he talks, about the shrapnel they left in his leg. He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo, and he ties it on one time a year. And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one, and swallows it down with his tears.Chorus:Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky, 1965. On the 8th of November, the angels were crying as they carried his brothers away. With the fire raining down, and the hell all around, there were few men left standing that day.Chorus:Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota to fight for the red, white and blue.

The first conflict in the Vietnam debacle is modern history at its most intense. That being said...The movie is a menagerie of complete awful. It fails on every level of filmmaking. The dialogue is farmed from the worst of John Wayne's WWII clichés. (Every word from Sam Elliot's mouth.) The directing is the worst example of film student pushiness. (The Barry Pepper photo montage.) The acting is so over the top that Al Pacino would be jealous. (Mel Gibson hamming it up in the role of Lt. Col. Hal Moore.)

Bruce 'Snake' Crandall, the helicopter pilot in charge of coordinating flights in and out of the ""hot zone"". His hubris and humanity make up for more than a few of the more exploitative and under-developed characters. There is more good and bad here. Needless flashbacks to home life. A bizarre tour inside the mind of the VC's Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An. Tantalizing moments of sheer horror in the midst of war. Hero stories.In the end, I wanted this movie to be good. I wanted this important story to be told well but due to the incompetent directing and writing of Randall Wallace I was left feeling unsatisfied and cheated. If you want to see a remake of anything, it should probably be this movie.",We Were Soldiers
496,whozat,One of the best,10,24 March 2002,"I was a young helicopter pilot in Vietnam, and this movie is the first Vietnam movie I've seen that's not leftist anti-vet propaganda, with an overdose of whining soldiers and crazed officers. Instead, it turned out to be the best war movie I've seen, for at least two reasons: (1) it's a rare factual account (like Patton) - the events and people are real, and therefore are far more compelling than any imaginary story could ever be, and (2) the movie's realism - it accurately depicts what it was like to be a soldier and a helicopter pilot in battle in Vietnam, complete with having to put up with some of the cowards in the rear who never got their uniforms dirty.  I can't find the words to respond to those who obviously never flew over or fought in Vietnam who claim to know the vegetation and scenery well enough to be critical of the movie in that regard.No movie can ever possibly recreate in a viewer the true intensity of the fear of taking fire and how to function in battle over extended periods of time spite of it, but that's all it lacked. The movie also helps explain why men don't normally talk of such battles, because the movie makes it so easy to see why words would fail them.Since the film is about the ultimate sacrifice each man depicted in the movie knew he may have to make, it also rightfully and poignantly shows what it was like for his also very real family waiting and hoping he would come home.  And what it was like to arrive home and open the door and look at your wife again, a day you weren't sure would ever happen.  Those who trivialize those scenes as Hollywood sappiness just don't understand, and have never been there.  If anything, the movie is not dramatic enough.At a fundamental level the movie is really about what it's like to fight for your country on any of history's fearsome battlefields, and how important it is to have smart and courageous battlefield leadership, and the difference one man can make.  No movie I've seen has done that better.  Indeed, that is no doubt why the movie took the time to show the human face of the North Vietnamese soldiers, and to show that they too had courage and families who missed them.Those who have written to bash the US and this movie have apparently failed to appreciate that the movie is really about the heroism of their own nation's soldiers who have with similar bravery and sacrifice fought for their country, as the movie made no claim that the valor depicted was unique to the American military of the 1960's.   I think few battlefield veterans of any nation would think this a poor movie.   A 10 out of 10.",We Were Soldiers

I am quite familiar with the actual events forming the base of this picture, and I feel confident in stating that this entire production should be processed in a form where it could be an integral part of each and every scholastic treatment of the ""Vietnam era"". In fact, the portrayal of not only the armed conflict, but the in-combat and at-home tension and emotional excursions, was so well done and life emulating, this rendition of the battle history should be required!! material from middle schools through graduate study!

498,midgett0987,Hollywood ending...,5,29 September 2007,"This was a decent account of the first of two major battles that took place over the course of four(?) days in the Ia Drang Valley. The only problem I have with it is the end- where Hollywood takes over and adds it's own, dramatized ending that, in real life, never took place. Instead of valiantly charging the enemy with bayonets fixed, while accompanied by a Huey gunship- which Snake Sh*t mysteriously flies in only one scene, Col. Moore's unit simply withdrew from the field as the other units relieved them. Watching the closing scenes, I thought maybe it was a dream of Col. Moore's- where he dreams of how to resolve the battle, but then the movie ends.

500,selic,This movie is both inspirational and emotionally devastating.,9,4 March 2002,"I recently went and saw this movie with my father, who lost his own father in Vietnam.  While I never knew my grandfather, I could only watch with stunned amazement as one of the best retellings of the early conflict in Vietnam was projected before me.Intense and evocative of the chaos and madness which must be a part of any battle, I could at the same time feel a closeness to my grandfather (in the part of Lt. Col. Hal Moore) that I have never held before.  The power and intensity of the emotions which this movie brought to bear on me I can still feel days after viewing, and I am left with a lingering sadness and feeling of loss for all of the Vietnam Veterans who gave their lives, their bodies, and their families in the name of duty and friendship.My mouth still has a bitter taste after seeing the method in which the initial deaths were reported to their families.  Having once served in the USN (and having seen my father retire out of the US Army), I could not believe the callousness displayed on the part of the US Government in bringing word to these soldiers loved ones.  When the call to serve is answered, it is only fitting that the government take responsibility for its actions and give notice to the families befitting the sacrifice of their son, father or husband.If Lt. Col. Moore was even 1/10th the man he was made out to be on the screen, I would have been proud to serve under him at any time, and I can only imagine his men held him in the same regard.  While Sgt. Major Plumley gave much needed levity to the action, the stoic endurance and ability of his character is seen throughout the senior NCO's of our military and I cannot thank them enough for their inspired and unflagging leadership as well.The terrible losses, the poignant list of faults that the French Army suffered from (and the Americans found to be true for themselves as well), left me feeling unbelievably saddened for our soldiers.  And then the inspiration and uplifting prayers which held our soldiers together and in the end led them to a victory which to me seemed near 'miraculous.'The way the movie shows the political and military viewpoints, and even more in that it shows the Vietnamese soldier as a competent and ably led foe, were telling points, and ones that make this movie strike me as more factual than many others.  Based on my own research into the Vietnam Conflict and by what I have read of Joe Galloway's and Gen. Moore's research and desires on their novel, I think this is one of the best retellings of the actual events one could hope for.Although the impact that the 2nd of the 7th had is not discussed in the movie (most likely due to constraints), I cannot help but sit here and think how tough that Lt. Col. Moore's battles must have been, knowing what he did and how badly it was likely to go (based on his own observations of poor intelligence, fighting in an enemy's home terrain, fighting half a world away from his own family, and all of the other instances which showed the Americans having the same difficulties that the French had had previously).I can only suggest that anyone interested in the Vietnam War, or in the trials and tribulations which soldiers of any nationality go through take the time to see this movie.  It is one of the best I have ever seen and although it left both myself and my father emotionally drained at it's end, I plan on adding it to my video collection when it becomes available.",We Were Soldiers
501,jandkholding,Ten out of Ten,10,10 November 2006,"I stumbled upon this movie one evening by accident and I am glad I did. I am puzzled as to why I didn't hear more about it at the time. Maybe the fine film Saving Private Ryan was further back in the American consciousness to make it more 'popular' but this should have been a more 'successful' movie.At least with the D-Day landings one could understand the reason for the fight - what on earth were these soldiers being flown in here for? A graphically realistic series of battle scenes that maybe we have all become hardened to on screen nowadays and, lets face it, unless one has actually been there it is never going to be recreated just how it was but this was pretty close I am sure.Congratulations to those involved with the film, what a waste of life it was and a good portrayal of the senselessness, the horrors and the people left at home.",We Were Soldiers

I will definitely see it again, but I can say after one viewing that this is as real as it gets, and it shows the horrors of battle (and the toll it takes on families) from both sides. The cameras definitely put you in the middle of it, and it was interesting to see what may be becoming a trend for Randall Wallace, something that carried over from Braveheart - camera shots so close to the action that blood splatters on the lens.Still not on par with Saving Private Ryan (which would get a 15 out of 10 from me), but still a 10.

505,houstonhouston-43158,So funny to me,3,4 June 2021,It is a good example of films about Vietnam war. This film should be watched with a thought what for and the same family story could happen with each of the enemy soldiers. The battle of Ia Drang showed the war became unwinnable. The wrong information between the book and the movie could prove the fact that war brings with it a lot of liars who traded their own political benefit and business profit of the war industries.,We Were Soldiers
506,marine-21,The Real 1st. Battle of Vietnam,10,15 December 2006,"Excellent Movie!!! Vietnam and combat as it really was. I only have one problem with the story line as it is presented to the public. With all due respect to Lt. General Hal Moore and the brave soldiers of the 1st Air Cave that fought this battle; The Battle of the Ia Drang Valley was not the first battle of the Vietnam War. The first battle took place almost exactly 3 months earlier in I Corps on the Van Tuong peninsula... Throughout July 1965 evidence had accumulated showing a VC buildup in southern I Corps, especially south of Chu Lai. A deserter confirmed to interrogators that the 1st VC Regiment, consisting of the 60th and 80th Battalions, the 52nd VC Co., and a Co. of the 45th Weapons Battalion, had established a base in the Van Tuong village complex.Operation Starlite was the first offensive military action conducted by a purely U.S. military unit during the Vietnam War. Originally code named ""Satellite"", due to a loss of electricity, a clerk made a typing error when the plan was being typed up and Operation ""Starlite"" was born. D-Day was to be 18 August, 1965. Lt.Col. Bull Fisher's 2nd Bn., 4th Marines, were to be heli-lifted into pre-designated LZ's inland, Lt.Col. Muir's 3rdBn, 3rd Marines, minus ""Mike"" Company, were to make an amphibious Landing and LtCol. Bodley's, 3rd Bn, 7th Marines, designated the SLF, and were to remain in reserve. These ground units were to participate in the operation with support from numerous other Marine units. Operation Starlite came to an end on 24 August 1965.",We Were Soldiers
507,holderby5,"Brave yes, but why were they fighting there in the first place?",4,11 March 2002,"This would be a decent war movie if they had only tried to give some explanation as to why we were sending the brave soldiers to fight in Vietnam in the first place. After listening to Gibson go on and on about why we fight wars (to defend the innocent from the bad etc), I expected at least SOME attempt to establish why we were fighting that war, that battle. As it is, with no explanation and using Gibson's logic in the movie, I couldnt help think to myself that we were the invaders, the bad guys. I love a good war movie, but you cant leave loopholes like this in it. Im a conservative, but you cant just send troops to fight somewhere without a compelling reason, and this movie presents NO reason, let alone a compelling reason.",We Were Soldiers
508,mburrows1,Just Horrible,1,10 October 2010,"As the son of a decorated Vietnam combat veteran I feel comfortable giving this film a rating of ""stinks on ice"". Mel Gibson's southern accent is absurd. Way too many super, incredible, ridiculously good looking actors... no offense Jon Hamm, I'm a big fan. The entire film reminded me of the Civil War musical that Ryan O'neil's character makes in Irreconcilable Differences. I think it was called ""Atlanta"" and it ruined him. I can't believe it took several highly publicized psychotic meltdowns to end Mel's career. This film should have ended it on the night of the premier. M. Stowe used to be a very attractive woman. Who told her that stretching the skin over her skull like a drum would look good?",We Were Soldiers
509,wfzelle,"Ok, but nothing special",6,15 October 2002,"--SPOILERS--The movie has an excellent start in which we see both the dangers of Vietnam and the misguided feelings of superiority exhibited by the politicians and military top brass. Unfortunately the movie quickly degenerates after that. The soldiers and their families who are presented to us are mostly cardboard hero's. We see their heroic wives and adorable children. These are all things that we already know. We know that the soldiers have family and might get killed, we know that their wives are lonely. The awful cliches don't add any more sympathy. Why don't we get to see the men as real people and learn more about their motivations. Why did they decide to join the army? Patriotism? Did they think the job was easy? What did the wives of these soldiers really feel about the dangers the men decided to face?The battle itself is a mixed bag. When the camera zooms close to the soldiers in the dark, the movie is very eerie and I could strongly feel their anxiety. On the other hand, the spell was regularly broken by the one-sided portrayal of the events. The Vietnamese let themselves be gunned down a bit too easily, I'd expect them to use a bit more caution. But what really got to me was the close combat which only showed Americans stabbing and hitting Vietnamese. I don't understand why they didn't show the reverse as well. In fact, we rarely see a Vietnamese soldier killing someone (the camera is usually trained only on the American soldier who gets shot), while the camera usually shows both the American soldier and his target. Perhaps this was an attempt to prevent us from hating the Vietnamese. It seems that we are only suppose to have feelings for two Vietnamese characters, an educated soldier and the Vietnamese commander. The first is some cardboard character caught in a situation he shouldn't be in (or something like that). The diary he is carrying is only used to show us a picture of his wife, even though we hear after the battle that part of the diary is translated. I thought it was a perfect set-up for something deep and profound, a statement that could tell us more about the Vietnamese soldiers and their motivations, hopes and fears. Alas, we get no such thing and forget the soldier immediately. The other character is far more memorable. Although a movie is hardly the place to expound tactical issues, we get the impression of a chivalric fight between the two commanders. The decisions we can comprehend seem sound and we certainly don't lose respect for the Vietnamese commander, even though he loses. His acting is very restrained and powerful, he shows his love for his men in just a few moments. A huge contrast to Mel Gibson who overacts his bravery, his sadness and his feelings for his men.The special effects are excellent. Weapons, explosions and aircraft look very realistic. We get to see a lot of gore, which seems realistic most of the time (sometimes a body is thrown back by a gunshot, that doesn't really happen). I do think that the movie would be better off if more was left to the imagination. The slow-motions we see when some main characters are hit are especially overdone. Now and then the attempts to get us emotionally involved seem extremely contrived. The Japanese-American soldier tells the reporter that his wife will have a baby that day, after which he dutifully gets a mortal wound. He dies, but not before he asks the reporter to tell his wife he loves her. Right.There are some side stories during the battle. We see the telegrams being delivered to recent widows. The director shows the uncertainty and the comradery on the home front in a fresh way which is very effective. We also get to see a strange brawl between the helicopter pilot and some other guy about landing in a hot LZ. It doesn't fit in the story at all.At the end the movie loses itself to cliches again. We see two soldiers coming home with nobody waiting at the terminal. A few widows (including the wife of the Vietnamese soldier) get messages from the survivors. Mel gets to hug his wife and children. The reporter writes the true story of the battle. Yawn. Why don't we learn a bit more about the feelings of the soldiers and widows? The movie only shows change in a few characters, the reporter becomes a warrior for a while when pressed until he decides that he his real calling is to inform, not to be part of this awful war. A cocksure soldier finds out why the sergeant doesn't take him seriously. Still, the stories are far to superficial. They only hint at what could have been, but don't manage to tell us anything truly interesting. Mel seems to have changed. Because the soldiers remind him of his children, he becomes very attached to his men, to the point of becoming irrational and feeling ashamed because he didn't die as well. Unfortunately this is glossed over as he returns home. Can he ever lead men into battle again? I doubt it, but the movie never tells us what happens next. Does he resign from the army? Does he manage to detach himself sufficiently to send men into situations where many will die again?I think that your appreciation of this movie will mostly depend on what kind of person you are. If you can stand the shallowness and the cliches, you will probably like the movie very much. On the other hand, if you prefer to analyse a movie, the many flaws will certainly not escape your attention. I could still value the fairly accurate battle scenes and the occasional flash of brilliance, but it wasn't enough to rate this movie higher than 6/10.",We Were Soldiers
510,ollesson,Nicely done but nothing we haven't seen before.,4,26 July 2002,It feels like this film has been made before. We have seen MANY Vietnam-movies. This one does not add anything new to the ones already made. This one should be added to the Good special effects and bad movie-section. This movie drowns in music exactly as many other Hollywood-productions does. It feels like military propaganda from the USA. Mel Gibson could play this role in his sleep and in fact he does in some scenes. The moral of this movie is that you have to give up everything for your country.

To me it was another war movie like the others and it was getting kinda annoying. So when it was release on DVD, I decided to pick it up. That had to be the best decision I have made. This movie is powerful and moving from the beginning to the end. Mel Gibson once again proves to me to be one of the greatest actors. Sam Elliot is great and had me laughing at times as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley. "" Sergeant Savage: Beautiful day, Sergeant Major! Sergeant Major Basil Plumley: What are you, the f**king weatherman now?""Randall Wallace has also proving that he is dedicated with telling the horror and heroic stories of war. Not to spoil it for anyone but two sequences had me either on the edge of my seat or gave me chills. When Mel Gibson says goodbye to his family and go off to war had me speechless. Esp. when he stands waiting for the bus and some of the soldiers meet up with him. One of these guys is Sam Elliot. You knew they didn't want to get on the bus and didnt want to go over to Vietnam. Such scenes like this gets one choked up and gave me chills. I have seen many Vietnam movies, ""Full Metal Jacket"" was one of my favorites, well ""We Were Soldiers has taken that place now.

I've seen comments here complaining about cliche`s, missing character development, and inaccurate terrain. Read the book is the first thing I'll say. Second, if you haven't been in the military and haven't seen combat then characterize your comments that way if you think something doesn't look real or is a cliche. I was blown away by how much they got right.But was the movie entertaining? Yes, it was nonstop action and one situation after another where you are thinking ""no way, people actually lived through that"".Lack of character development - how in the world can you say that? The beginning was your character development to get you interested in the characters. The scene where Snake#### pulls his revolver on the medivac pilot was character development (during the scene that caused his reaction I thought to myself ""man I would deck that medivac pilot next time I saw him""). Did they do it they way you liked? Maybe not, but not liking their character development isn't the same as none at all...I'm curious what cliche`s people are complaining about? The only one I might agree to is the image of the senior leaders standing tall as bullets whiz by. Did it happen that way? I don't know but if it did they were lucky eh? Otherwise, what else?

515,theeleventhhour,The Most Vivid and Accurate Vietnam Film Ever!,10,16 April 2002,"I have read the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young and for Randall Wallace (Braveheart and The Patriot) to make this movie so close to the details of the book was remarkable. I recently heard an interview with Hal Moore (Mel Gibson's character), and he said that the movie made him remember that war so vividly because of its accuracy. He also said that Mel Gibson reminded him of himself so much in the movie. Hal Moore actually took Mel Gibson around to all the grave sites of his men and introduced Mel to every single one of the men that came home in a body bag. This movie disspells all the myths about Vietnam being a war for insane villainous soldiers, instead it looked at the true soldier of this war and showed the spirit and brotherhood that binded them together. Not to forget an incredible cast of newcomers and experienced actors. This film pays tribute to all the men that risked their lives for a war that was not fought for our flag or for our country. This war turned out to be a war for each other. Now the tagline on Black Hawk Down, ""Leave No Man Behind"", was emphasized much more in We Were Soldiers, because Hal Moore and Basil Plumley did not leave any man behind. In Black Hawk Down, they left several men behind. So if you want to see only one war movie this year, use your 5 bucks for this compelling film.",We Were Soldiers

But I must say this is a very good effort by Randall Wallace at portraying the brutalities and uselessness of war. Unlike most Vietnam movies, neither does this one try to prove who/what was right/wrong nor does it try glorifying the American army's endeavour in Vietnam. This is a 'real' story about soldiers who are plunged into a war they are not quite sure why they are fighting.If you are the sort who likes 'real' war movies (not the Rambo kind), then this one is a 'must-see'. The best part I liked about this movie is the balance it maintains by showing the happenings on the battlefield as well as in the lives of their families back home(showing lesser known facts like the strange method of informing families about the death of their kin).Brilliant performances from Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper and good performances in general from the rest of the cast.",We Were Soldiers

As it is, the film is slow, littered with clichés and cheap, outdated special effects. A pathetic attempt at an average idea which leaves you feeling frustrated and insulted.Americans seem to think that the outcome (for better or worse) of every war that has been fought in the last 300 years has been due solely to their own involvement, however minimal. It is for this reason that every recent ""Hollywood blockbuster' war film has a linear, predictable plot, gratuitous self-pity, inane heroic sacrifice and a moral of the story at the end. Not to mention that `aren't we great, lets pat ourselves on the back again' feeling that leaves every half intelligent protozoa amused at their arrogance and ignorance. That's the real reason why they need to be pitied.

Mel gibson does a great job in this one as well. However there where a few scenes that i thought could be better. One scene is where the very first letter is sent home to inform of there deaths. The lady that is crying sounds like she is laughing. After words theres a scene I think with mel and two other people in it. They are walking to a post and the artillery goes off it looks like they tried to hard to copy from Saving Private ryan. One more thing I noticed was when the first plane took off it looked like an f-18 hornet not the f-4 that was used in Vietnam... However after words all the plans where F-4's.

I know there were plenty of 40-50 yr old men with tears in their eyes when the lights came up at my showing.I think the poor reviews are based more on this country's continued animosity toward the Vietnam War than on any cinematic shortfallings.",We Were Soldiers
522,thom_stricklin,"Relevant, necessary, and well-done among war movies",10,3 March 2002,"Oh boy, where do I begin?I guess the place to start is to talk war. War movies have been quite a ""fad"" lately, though I hope the reason for them is deeper than the word ""fad"" suggests. Still, the movies have for the most part been about World War II, a war in which there was at least a good sense of duty and of good versus evil. (The one major exception in recent war movies is Black Hawk Down, but even in Desert Storm, there was a fair sense of purpose.)Vietnam, however, was a whole different ballgame. The war was poorly justified, patriotism was all but extinct, and the only thing possibly more horrid than the bloody massacres of battle was the treatment of soldiers upon their return. In terms of cultural effect, Vietnam was quite the antithesis of those other wars.""We Were Soldiers"" does justice in describing this war, particularly in its earlier stages, better than any other film I've seen. It makes no bones about the fact that the entire situation was ill-advised, yet instead of pointing fingers in blame, it points out the heroes, the few whose characters shone through despite the situations, and it remembers the fallen. Though it takes place early in the war, before the counterculture and its so-called ""peace movements"" had been well-established, it still touches on the societal mistreatments that America was soon to bestow upon the very men it called to duty.I really don't feel I can describe the film in enough detail. Perhaps its ambiguity in areas are what make it such a strong testimony of our most ambiguous war. Still, I think I can safely say that the film contains many of the best points of other recent war movies. It tells a true story with as much reverence as Black Hawk Down. It relates the men at war to the people they left at home as well... rather, far better than Pearl Harbor (and without any Michael-Bay Camp, either). Perhaps most significantly, it prods at the questions of war itself as good as Saving Private Ryan.As for the cast... Mel continues to amaze with the same vein of acting as in Braveheart and The Patriot. He plays a man of many parts, and does so well... There's not a moment at home that you forget he's a soldier, nor a moment in the field you forget he's a husband and father. C'mon, it's Mel at his best, need I say more?Greg Kinnear again proves what an underrated actor he is. (I'm still mad that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his role in As Good As It Gets, though he was better IMO than Helen Hunt and ol' Jack, both of whom won trophies for their parts.) The guy could be an actor with body language alone. He can give a million lines of speech by a single stare, and when he does speak, he makes it count. I only wish he'd had more screen time.Chris Klein is never the greatest of actor, but one that can hold his own, and this is probably his best role yet.Sam Elliot played the tough guy, the man of few words who only takes orders from men who give good ones. It was a bit too much of the stereotypical old, grizzled soldier IMO, but he pulls it off great. Reminded me so much of Lee Marvin (a la Dirty Dozen) in this flick. (BTW, Hulk fans, I am now looking quite forward to his portrayal as Thunderbolt Ross.)The rest of the cast, Barry Pepper, the wives, the other soldiers, were also well cast. There were no holes in the performances. Really, the film was seamless as a whole. If there are any major points for complaint, I didn't catch them. A warning, though: Bring kleenex if you're often brought to tears by a film, and be quick to turn your head in some parts if you've got a soft stomach.Thumbs up. An eleven on a scale of ten. Go see it.",We Were Soldiers
523,starlight2071,"Excellent, Must See",10,13 March 2002,"This is easily the best motion picture I've seen in a long time. To anyone who has never truly understood the phrase `War is Hell', this movie will explain it to you. In Saving Private Ryan, Hollywood used a lot of gore in the opening scenes, more for shock value than for plot. The blood in this movie is obviously a fire engine red paint. This movie doesn't need or want shock value. Several scenes are like watching friends run through a hailstorm of high velocity razor blades, and in the end you truly understand the price of freedom. As you read this, understand that our country is once again at war. Freedom only accepts one coin as payment, and the price is indeed high. I won't tell you who lives and who doesn't, but I will tell you that the movie ends with the names of the men who died defending us. The movie is a fitting tribute not only to them, but to the families they left behind. To all the men and women who have fought for my freedom, to those who fight even now, and to everyone who will be called to fight in the future, Thank You.",We Were Soldiers
524,Zack Randolph,Puts a very human face on Vietnam...,10,4 March 2002,"I was surprised when I viewed We Were Soldiers.  I went in expecting a flag-waving, purely American epic like Randall Wallace's previous film, Pearl Harbor.  This was not the case.  Wallace's screenplay and direction show the emotion and determination of both the American troops and the Vietnamese.  These men on both sides believed in what they were fighting for.  I also liked the character development in the first third of the film. By getting to know these characters in their personal lives we as the audience feel for them on the battlefield.  This movie, unlike other recent war films such as Black Hawk Down, gives the audience characters that they actually care about.  Although the action was not as horrific and fast-paced as other recent films in this genre, We Were Soldiers compensates by giving us a real story with real characters.  This film is the best Vietnam war movie since Platoon, the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, and the best movie so far in 2002.",We Were Soldiers
525,lisa barela,the most touching movie I've seen since 1995,10,5 March 2002,"WWS is the best movie I've seen since 1995. That was the year of 'Braveheart', 'Apollo 13', 'Seven', 'Murder in the First', 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Il Postino'. This is the first movie I've seen about Vietnam that honors our soldiers. After 'Coming Home', 'Born on the 4th of July', 'Platoon', 'Tigerland' and 'Apocolypse Now', it was very refreshing to see a movie that recognizes their sacrifices. We had no vested interest in Vietnam. That's why it was so tragic to lose American lives. That's why we lost the war, it wasn't ours to fight in the first place. They were soldiers, just like in WWI, WWII, Korea, the Gulf War, Somalia. I was touched and moved. I didn't get lost in the technological rhetoric, the scenery, the score. I got lost in the movie - which is why I go. I loved it. No need to analyze just to appreciate. Best $5.25 I've spent in years.",We Were Soldiers

So the actors and makers of this film had to make sure they did a great job  in how they did their perspective parts  in the film and I feel they did a great job.The movie is so well done I believe it could have a chance for  best picture in the next academy awards,and Mel Gibson should have a pretty good shot for best actor, and Sam Elliot should have a good shot for best supporting actor.Anyways you want be wasting your time of money if you go see this great movie  a great story  with  great actors and actoress , a must see. I believe that anyone watching should  be able to enjoy it and also maybe even feel a little  more proud to be an AMERICAN after seeing this film.

527,edd_c,Moving Tribute To Vietnam Vets.,10,9 March 2002,"I found this film to be a very moving tribute to those who laid their lives on the line for the USA and, infact, the overall fight against communism in the 1960's and 1970's in Vietnam. Many, many, aspects can be put into the equation of trying to understand the Vietnam war. I thought the film dealt with several of these very well. I was impressed with how it focused not just on the men, but also their families at home. The comradeship in such a situation, but also the death, injury and destruction, brings home the horror of the Vietnam conflict. I hope this film inspires the American population today to give thanks to those who fought for them during that dark time. I strongly recommend you see this film, especially if you are interested in the conflict - or even if you know little about it. A word of warning though - the violence is very graphic (more so than Saving Private Ryan, for example).",We Were Soldiers
528,marteengreene,A Very Powerful Movie!,10,10 March 2002,"I have to admit, I was a little reluctant to see this movie at first. I kept thinking NOT ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT VIETNAM!!!! I think this war has been the one war Hollywood has severely overplayed. It was nice to see a break with films like The Patriot, Saving Private Ryan or even Black Hawk Down but still do we have to discuss the Viet Kong yet again.Well, I have to admit after I went and watched this movie it is probably one of the best war movies I have ever seen. You can very easily drop this battle at any time other than Vietnam. I think it would be just as powerful if it took place during the Korean war, WWI, WWII, or even during Desert Storm. It's more about the people involved in the war and how they strategically plan their moves than most of the other recent films dare to be. It also does a really nice job on the way it touches on the real life moments when the wives receive notice that their loved ones have been lost. Watching it reminded me more of a film like Bridge on the River Kwai then Platoon. I won't deny that some of the graphic scenes are rather gruesome (especially the burned soldier) but then war is a gruesome tragedy. All in all, the movie does a great way to display the human side of war.(SPOILER ALERT) I also really seemed to enjoy the ending when Moore had not only taken the time to write a letter of condolence to Mrs. Geoghegan but one to the wife of the fallen NVA soldier as well. This sequence was probably one of the greatest highlights I have seen in a recent war drama. That would be (in my humble opinion) one of the hardest things in the world to do and really seems to capture the essence of what type of man Moore really was. (END SPOILER)So, if you can think past the idea that this takes place during Vietnam long enough to buy a ticket, then I urge you to see it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",We Were Soldiers
529,lucky-157,On the line!,10,19 August 2007,"It has taken me some time to watch this movie, let alone any other of this event, the Vietnam War.I sat through the video of this, and watched each and every micro second. The only other time I watched a similar movie was ""Good Morning Vietnam"". I figured with Robin Williams in it, that it would be more a comedy sort of, but my wife turned it off during the part of the young troops in the truck headed for the front.This movie, ""We Were Soldiers...And Young"" fits in with what I know, what I experienced, and my feelings since. People have to remember, it was a movie, not a full blown documentary. You want a documentary, turn to PBS, you want a movie, turn to Hollywood. But as a movie, it should be seen today, by all. The men who were there, who lived and suffered, and those who died in the real place, must not be forgotten. And that goes for all us Vets. Guess that I am now ready to see some of the other videos I collected about this event. My son bought and packed those that he learned to be amongst the best. He gave it to me as a Veterans Day gift a few years ago. I finally opened it the other day. He also served in the military, saw a bit of action in the ME.As the credits rolled, so did my emotions. They say that grown men don't cry, yes they do. Only an unconnected fool wouldn't. A lot of times you hear someone putting down the ""enemy"" for whatever, but don't you believe it. They are human, they had families, and they fought, no matter their cause, they fought like soldiers for their nation. See this movie. Understand it. Read the book, remember it. And on each Memorial Day, on each Veteran's Day, follow me as I toast several buddies who did not come home, then those who did, and finally, those serving today. I hope and pray that we never again have to make our soldiers wait years to be formally recognized by our own government for the sacrifices they were ordered into by that government. Public opinion is expected to be divided, expect it, cherish that. Because that is part of what we in America need to defend, the right to ones opinion, yea or nay, it is our right of freedom.",We Were Soldiers

This movie should be shown to history classes in schools and colleges--minus a few curse words. It shows how real, rough and deadly war is. Gibson has really outdone himself in this one. I can't imagine this not getting an academy award. But even if they elites do decide to blackball or ignore this one--which I don't think they be able to do--considering it's already done over 40.8 million in only it's first 10 days. And the word will spread about what a great movie this is. I have yet to speak to anyone whose seen the movie who didn't like it. It's a shame Hollywood can't make more great and accurate movies about History like this one. Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, and even down to the who played the coward were great in their roles. Kinnear was so good as Crandell and deserves an Oscar for best supporting actor. The women who played the wives were great in their roles as well. Rarely does a movie take the time to show the women in this way: where you can see the pain they have to go through in dealing with the deaths of their husbands.",We Were Soldiers
531,imhal2001,"Could have been a truly great movie, but sadly it wasn't.",6,13 March 2002,"I went to the bookstore to look through the book this movie was based on. In the prologue, the author criticized Hollywood for screwing up all movies about Vietnam and for not telling how war really is.  Hollywood did not do justice once again ironically this time to this very book.
After watching the movie, all I could say to myself is, ""Come on, that didn't happen...""  This is sad because there are many Americans and viewers around the world who also demand not to be insulted by how Hollywood often likes to.  Even sadder is that there are others who are prone to believe that the film really depicts reality... that American soldiers do shoot like Rambo... that the enemy just packs up and leaves seeing defeat... that the Americans clearly won this battle.It always felt all throughout the film wanted to stay truer to the book and thus to the events that transpired.  But after all it is a product of Hollywood which we all know is motivated by profit.  That means, the script has to be padded with action, explosions, and moments of patriotism.  The fudged-up story confuses fact and fiction and denies all of us the valuable lessons that the brief, brutal, tragic events in the small patch of land in Vietnam could have offered.  The decisions to compromise integrity made the difference between a truly great film and a mediocre Vietnam flick.However, I felt ""We Were Soldiers"" shined in the opening sequence.  I always thought that the beachhead opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" could never be topped.  True, it was filled with action, scale, and immediacy. In ""We Were Soldiers"" though, the opening sequence in less than two minutes strikes right in your face the savageness and absurdity of war.  Highly effective, absolutely brilliant.",We Were Soldiers
532,jamieson_456,A VERY GOOD MOVIE. A GREAT FILM.,10,2 April 2002,"The movie was very powerful.Ok, where do I start.I finally saw a movie to motivate me to write a movie review on IMDB. I took a loooong flight just to watch the movie and it did not disappoint! Mel is as impressive as always and the rest of the cast did a great job as well, particularly Sam Elliott. Well so many great things have been said about the movie, and I can't think of anything negative to mention so I can't relate to those who did (if you have seen the movie, you'll know that most of the negative reviews here are bullsh*t).Anyway, I want to point out the scene where Mel was leaving his home. That entire scene was eerily effective, I could really feel the impending danger he will face every hair on my body was rising! I liked the way the camera panned very quickly when he turned to face the road, as if Mel said ""this is really sad but I have work to do"". I think that entire scene was very very well set up. And when the action started, the tension never stopped! I now really have to read the book because I find the tactical warfare very interesting.Anyway, I saw something interesting while watching the movie. There's this teenager sitting beside me, and I was really sorry for him, because he probably didn't know what he came in for. When the war action started, his eyes were really popped out! I swear to god I could have picked them with ease! His arms were gripping the armrest so hard and half his body slightly leaning forward. He was difficult not to notice even by the side of your eyesight because he looked shocked as hell. When I tried to quickly look at him (just to see if he's still breathing), he got embarrassed and leaned back to his chair. Five mins. later he was back in the same position. He was probably around 16 or 17 yrs. old so I realize that age might not be the right age to see it.What really amazes me is how the movie was able to convey the chaos and horror of the war when it actually they didn't seem to use too many CGI-effects. I look so much like the REAL THING!Definitely now on top of my list of war movies.And I have seen A LOT.",We Were Soldiers
533,snuffles-owner,the worst Vietnam movie ever,1,26 August 2002,"I've seen every Vietnam movie ever made, I think, and this one was the worst.  I was actually quite looking forward to seeing it, too, which made it all the more disappointing.  The script is boring and unimaginitive, as are all of the characters in the movie.  None of the characters are either interesting or likeable enough to care about, and I didn't mind when any of them died.  There was very little good character development, even though the first part of the movie (before the actual battle) seemed to drag on endlessly.  The presence of Mel Gibson further ruined the movie, although I think it was unsalvagable anyway.  How can I get caught up in the character of Colonel Moore when Mel Gibson plays himself in every movie? (The Julia Roberts phenomenon). The final bad thing was the music- it was by turns obnoxious motivational shmaltz and some bizarre Irish song played at least three times throughout the movie.If you are looking for a movie about soldiers in Vietnam, see ""Platoon."" It is far and away the best Vietnam movie. If you are looking for a movie depicting the utter horror of Vietnam, rent ""Apocalypse Now"" or "" The Deer Hunter."" Basically, ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to be moving and inspiring like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and ends up failing miserably.

This movie not only told the real story about war but it also displayed what a real hero is. Every soldier on that battle field was a real hero. They didn't go there seeking fame or even recognition, but to just do their jobs as soldiers. The soldier going into battle knowing full well that he may not come out displays the kind of bravery that you won't see on a baseball or football field.

Saving Private Ryan is not what I would call a classical war movie (except for the end). This is a great example of what battle looks like and the directors did a great job in portraying a BATTLE not a political agenda. This has to be among one of the top 5 war movies I've ever seen. It isn't about 1.5 hours of training and 45 minutes of war (such as Full Metal Jacket) or a platoon running around looking for something to do (Platoon) or a Ranger Squad looking for one guy (Saving Private Ryan). This is a GREAT film about the grotesque consequences of war with the inept intervention of politicians and congressmen. Great film, with round characters and great story line. Then again, why does the storyline matter, it really happened this way, why change the events that man had to go through for a ""better"" film.

544,jacques_otten,Not realistic,5,26 January 2008,"I'd like to comment briefly on this film, in reply to a comment made by Cory Branton-Speak. I would be very surprised if this film gives a realistic picture of the events in Vietnam between '65 and '75. Sure, it has gory battle scenes and as you pointed out, ""real last words"", but the film gave me a very artificial impression, more than once. Notice how, in every single battle scene, the Americans seem to act rather intelligently, running towards covered areas, ducking, lying down and focus firing (as they should be). The Vietcong, however, show far less rational behaviour. They get up and run into the American's reinforcements or camps, all by themselves, with no covering fire, even when five of their buddies have already done the same thing two minutes earlier. These crash-test dummies are used as background entertainment, while the camera focuses yet again on an enormously interesting conversation of a few Americans. In reality, however, the American troops did not even SEE the Vietcong as often as they seem to in this movie. In the major battles, they often won, but they simply didn't know the territory and the enemy as good as they should have. Add to that the one-year tour of duty that was being employed, and you might get a grasp of the figures: 58,000 casualties. The Americans were losing men and the enemy was invisible. I bid you, think about those things. Mel Gibson has - again - failed miserably as a director. This is NOT a realistic war movie. Period.",We Were Soldiers

We were soldiers is a truly patriotic piece, not like the patriotism that soccer moms have when they fly their flags out of a mini-van window, but the kind of patriotism that war-battered soldiers know. I am a young Air Force nerd and will probably never see a single battle, but I salute those who have fought for this country and died, even if the rest of this nation might disagree with the politics of a particular war. This picture is truly sincere and embraces the fact that men of war are in fact men, with families, friends and lives.

558,innkeeper22,The Definitive Vietnam Combat Story,10,7 October 2002,"Unfortunately, ""We Were Soldiers"" followed ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Blackhawk Down.""  Otherwise, it would have enjoyed more than its mostly-ignored 5-6 month theater run before being released in video. Apparently the public had overdosed on realistic depictions of combat and war stories based on real events and people. This is the only reason I can imagine for the ""so-what?"" public reaction to this fine film.  First of all, Nam vets -- especially helicopter vets -- unanimously consider this to be the truest rendering of their war. Second, it's Mel Gibson's finest work; his delivery of Col. Moore's words, and the anguish reflected in his face following this watershed battle, move many of us to tears.  There are numerous other notable performances.  The inclusion of war's impact on wives and children made the women's roles significant, rather than cameos.  Furthermore, the depiction of the NVA as (1) highly motivated and well led and (2) as human beings with families presents a more balanced view of war.  Finally, the political messages are subtly delivered and do not detract from the main purpose of the movie, which is to tell the story of war.

Several of these sites have only recently been revealed, including: (1) a rugged mountain location near Kwangju where reportedly a biological (mycotoxin T-2?) or chemical (gas or herbicide?) warfare agent (a ""whitish powder"" or mist sprayed from light planes) was used causing a dark skin discoloration prior to killing several hundred villagers in the fall of 1951, suggesting death from a type of hemorrhagic fever; (2) a newly discovered second Japanese mine near Kyongsang that served as a depository for hundreds of bodies; (3) the Jin Chi Ryung railroad tunnel near Chinju; and (4) the Wonbuk railroad tunnel near Masan."" (Revelations of US War Crimes in Korea, 2001).It is hard to empathize with Gibson's character from the start, as he appears to be blinded with nationalist sentiment. He fails to mature, in terms of his nationalist views, throughout the movie. However, I don't want to say the entire movie ""We Were Soldiers"" was meaningless propaganda. At the end, the movie offers a humane and insightful comment:""Such a tragedy... So this will become an American War.

Its easy for those with no blood in the game to not understand but this film at least attempts give those who don't live in a military family the anxiety and loss they live with everyday.

569,the-bloodless-conspiracy,-insert positive review title-,8,9 January 2010,"To all the people who gave this movie negative reviews, I ask you- did you even watch this movie? If the answer to that is yes, I have to wonder exactly what rock you've been living under, that you have no idea how human beings work.Let's take a look at some of the criticism we've seen here:1- 'It's cliché!' Some of the clichés cited- Hal Moore is too perfect, the Americans are all heroes, the housewives are all good little housewives.On Hal Moore being 'too perfect', don't be stupid. People like that actually exist. I know a few who come very close. I myself come pretty damn close, except I'm not married. The kids I devote my time to, pray with, and try to teach real-world concepts to are someone else's. If a real four-to-six-year-old child asked you what war was, what exactly would you tell her? If it's anything more specific and gruesome than what the movie said, I'd have to wonder about your judgment and rethink ever leaving a child that young in your care.Next, the Americans are all heroes. Yes, because charging off against orders, getting your platoon cut off from the main body of soldiers, and getting most of your men killed by running after obvious bait into an obvious trap is very heroic. And of course, we all look up to and idolize pilots who accidentally bomb their own lines and get their own soldiers killed or severely wounded.And yes, the above paragraph should be read with the heaviest infliction of sarcasm you can manage.And oh, my God, a movie that takes place in the 60s actually has housewives acting like they would in the 60s. How dare Hollywood. How dare they.2- 'Nobody says stupid things like 'tell my wife I love her' when they're dying!'Anyone saying this has obviously never thought they were going to die. As someone who has come close to dying - five times - I can tell you without embarrassment or shame that the only thought on my mind all five times was the fear that I didn't tell and show the dearest person to me (my little sister) how much I loved her. I wasn't thinking of how much it hurt, how scared I was, why I was in those situations. All I could think was 'Did I do enough to show Diana how much I love her? Does she know how much I owe her, how much I care about her, how grateful I am for all she's done for me?' And if what is nearest and dearest to a person is their country, I have no trouble believing that their sacrifice in said country's name would be uppermost in their mind. When we as human beings think we're about to die, our minds turn to the things that are most important to us. To a husband and father, that's likely his family. For me, it's my sister, who's the only person I actually think of as family. For a true dyed-in-the-wool patriot, that would most definitely be his country.3- 'It's pro-Vietnam!'No, it's not. It even comes right out and says, through the mouth of a Vietnamese soldier, that America going into Vietnam didn't change anything- it only made the body count higher. How is a movie that flat-out says a war did nothing but get a lot of people needlessly killed support said war?4- 'It pushes religion!'Religious people pray. Get over it.And please, take note of who leaves what kind of review here. I couldn't help but notice that not a single Vietnam vet who left a review for this movie had anything bad to say about it. Think- the people who fought in the war this movie depicts can only praise it. That tells you something.",We Were Soldiers
570,Keith_99,We Were Soldiers,8,16 March 2011,"We Were Soldiers is an action pack movie that is a little different from most war movies. Instead of focusing on just the battles surrounding two ermines of different countries, We Were Soldiers focus on all aspect of the war. The main theme concentrates on the toll that war takes on not only the solders of both sides, but also the families the solders are attached to. The movie describes the first major battle of the Vietnam War and how it affected the soldiers and their families.Lt. Col. Hal Moore is call up to take charge of a new plan developed by the United States. This new plan will allow troops to be flown in and out of battle quickly by helicopters. Lt. Moore embraces this challenge and trains his men hard so they will be prepared for battle. Once training was finished, the men headed to a battle zone that was called The Valley of Death. This battle became the first major battle in a war known as the Vietnam War. The movie concentrates not on just the battle itself, but how the soldiers and their families were affected by war. The fighting scenes focus on how the solders on both side felts as fierce fighting was going on with each other. At times they were brave and other time they became scared to death. While this intense battle is going on, the wife's back on the home front are also taking a beating by hearing about the death of their husbands. At this time Julie Moore (Lt. Moore wife) takes charge in contacting the other wife's once their husbands have been killed. Julie Moore stays strong throughout the whole time and kept the other wife's together and helps them with their problems.Lt. Moore and his men are out number five to one by the Vietnam solders, so they are hanging on to their lines by a thread. Maj. Bruce Crandall is one of the helicopter pilots who put his own life at risk in order to help the solders on the ground survive. Maj. Crandall provides courage for the other pilots as they continue to bring in supply and more solders. Without the support of these pilots, the ground troops would not have survived.The movie special sound affect and lighting enhances the overall quality of this film. The fighting scenes produce bullets flying by and explosions in the back ground that gives you a feeling as being part of the movie. Scenes where the solders are laying in pitch darkness give you a feeling of uncertainty just as the solders would feel.Over all I believe We Were Solders is an excellent movie that just does not detail the issues of war, but it demonstrates all effect of war and the people it hurts. Other movies such as Rambo mainly isolates on the action packed fighting scenes and does not give much detail on anything else. We Were Solders show how much courage the solders of both side gave in order to make their countries proud. At the end of this historic battle, both sides realize the death and destruction this war is going to cause.",We Were Soldiers
571,burtonsquare17,The events that transgress in what became known as The Valley of Death were of a nature that brought chills to my very core.,10,17 March 2011,"WARNING: May contain minor spoiler(s)!In the film We Were Soldiers (2002), the true story of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and his battalion of 7th Cavalry troops is told in a way that truly touched my deepest emotion, especially with regard to my tenure in the military. The events that transgress in what became known as The Valley of Death were of a nature that brought chills to my very core. Alongside his men, Lt. Col. Moore (Gibson), Major Bruce ""Snake"" Crandall (Greg Kinnear), and Sergeant Major Basil Plumley (Sam Elliot) lead the companies of the 7th Calvary, who stood at a mere 400 or so men, against over 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Throughout the film, a recurring theme stands most prominent, and is showcased as the foundation to Lt. Col. Moore's purpose in leading a battalion; No man gets left behind. The unbelievable bravery displayed by the men of 7th Cavalry speaks to this very idea, as their selfless service to one another, as well as their lieutenant colonel left no question in my mind; Each soldier knew the task to be completed.Throughout the carnage that takes place in The Valley of Death, a story is narrated by a non-combative photographer, Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper), who ultimately takes part in the battle due to sheer necessity with regard to survival. Ultimately, Galloway turns back to his camera to ensure his experiences, and that of the soldiers of the 7th Calvary is told free of error. Such experiences Galloway seeks to capture include the honorable actions of Lt. Col. Moore's men, as well as Lt. Col. Moore himself. Lt. Col. Moore truly defines himself as an unmatched leader, as he holds true his promise made before leaving for North Vietnam; ""I will be the first one to step on the field of battle, and the last to step off.""The theme present within We Were Soldiers (2002) shares similarity to another film, that of Black Hawk Down (2001). In each film, soldiers of an elite military unit showcase endless acts of heroism and bravery, sometimes leading to their ultimate fate in effort to save that of a fellow brother-in-arms. Each film also conveys a secondary theme, being that of the effects war has on those who participate. Survivor's guilt is very common among the soldiers involved in war, and such emotional reaction is seen in Major Crandall after the first day of battle in The Valley of Death. Upon returning to base camp after a full day of transporting troops in his Huey helicopter, Maj. Crandall is overwhelmed by the sight of so many wounded and dead soldiers, and is actually driven to pulling out his sidearm on a fellow soldier and pilot after a brief argument. During the previously mentioned scene, such emotion and intensity is captured perfectly by director Randall Wallace, and through use of red color tones and lighting Maj. Crandall's instability is well understood by the viewer. Wallace also takes advantage of the lighting effects created by explosions and gunfire to illuminate the poised, yet fear-filled faces of 7th Cavalry soldiers that stand guard during the night. During such scenes, Wallace creates a setting that proves very authentic, as the only constant source of light for the men in The Valley of Death is provided by moonlight, with bursts of brightness brought on by gunfire and exploding ordinance. Wallace also employs symbolism during the visual telling of this story, as seen in the Western Union Telegrams delivered to the unknowing widows of fallen soldiers. There is raw and overwhelming emotion of sadness and fear seen as it falls upon the faces of military wives when they see the yellow envelope in the hand of Julie Moore (Madeleine Stowe), wife of Lt. Col. Moore, followed by submission to the reality of what has happened. Julie Moore becomes weak and unstable at the sight of the yellow envelope, only to learn the cab driver is simply lost, which ultimately leads to her volunteering to deliver the letters of disappointment herself. The loss that is felt by these military wives is expressed almost perfectly in a single shot, that being a still frame close-up of the yellow envelope being held by a newly-widowed woman and the wedding band that rests on her finger. Ultimately, We Were Soldiers (2002) is, in my opinion, one of, if not the most well done war films of my time (my time referring to the short, 26 years I have spent in this world). Furthermore, in watching the film I have come to appreciate even more the sacrifices I made during my tenure in the military, while also feeling humbled, knowing quite well I was able to do so only because of the sacrifices made by men like those in the 7th Calvary led by Lt. Col. Moore. Even those who have not served their country can take away from this film an understanding of the sacrifices made by men in order to ensure freedoms and rights, as well as the bond that is born and which carries on even after service. In short, any person, soldier or not, that takes the time to view We Were Soldiers (2002) will understand how important, how vital it is that, ""No man be left behind.""",We Were Soldiers
572,Closso01,we were soldiers,10,18 March 2011,"Film Review:This film Starring Mel Gibson as Lt Col. Moore, Madeleine Stowe as his wife Julie, and Sam Elliot as Sgt. MaJ. Plumley, is set in 1964. The Plot and theme of this film are both about War; however, the plot is about the survival of a combat unit in one of the first battles in the conflict of Vietnam. The theme centers on the brother hood and unity of the soldiers of this conflict, as they fight for victory and survival against over whelming odds. This film shows much more than a traditional film in the war genre. It depicts the soldiers as individuals with everyday struggles and that of the families they leave behind while fighting. (Wallace, 2002)This film is unique in my opinion, because it is the first war film that I have seen that tells the story of soldier's on both sides of the conflict, as men, details the fear, anger and frustration felt on both sides, while providing the audience with a realistic view from the objective point of view. The closes up shots on the faces depict the feelings of the actor's without need for voice over narration or explanation. The lighting and special effects of the film add a sense of realism, where the action and the effects flow together well. This is not a typical war film where the simple objective is to blow up as many things as possible. When Lt Col Moore and Sgt Plumley are talking about the possibility of defeat, the hard-nosed sgt. Tells the Col. That he will win when he says the col is no comparison to General Custer, This sets the tone for a shift in the action, where the US soldiers start to overcome the odds of defeat. (Wallace, 2002) In the end scenes where, Col. Nguyen Huu An is speaking to one of his Vietnamese soldiers' while they are collecting bodies it is apparent to me that this is a message that regardless of what side your on in a conflict, it is sometimes forgotten that before they were solders, they were simply men with families. (Wallace, 2002)This film also does an excellent job of telling the story of the families the men leave behind, as well as addressing the issue of racism, as it existed in 1964. One of the most memorable characters of this film besides Col Moore, is that of reporter Joe Galloway, who put himself in harm's way to document the heroism of the men that fought, the use of still photography in the film, to represent the pictures he took, sends a very silent yet powerful message to the viewer. (Wallace, 2002) This film may have some resemblances to Apocalypse now, as it is also a war film set in the same period. However, it definitely does not tell the powerful story of men and the brother hood of soldiers as this film does.ReferencesWallace, R. (Director). (2002).

He expected them to do no more than he was capable of and lead them by example.  His spirit and beliefs held them together during a crucial battle that tested all he was and showed what men are capable of with a firm belief in their leader and God.  It is brutal, but that is what war is.  It also gives a good view of the other side and how, inspite of politics, each had their beliefs and values to their country and their men.  Mel Gibson's character stated he would be first on the field and the last off - that no man be left behind.  He lived up to that, and for that, deserves the deepest respect of us all.  I did not look for flaws or ""mistakes"" as I was interested in the characters and how they interacted. I even felt a sense of pride in the enemy leader, who knew this battle would be a test of wills. This was a spectacular film and I had no pre-conceived notions of a Braveheart or Patriot theme.

My question is: how could it be so easy for American troops to kill VCs in the film? If it really were like the way the movie depicted, the US would haven't needed Search&Destroy operations for years. I still remember in the series ""Vietnam in HD"", real American vets usually said ""NVA troops are smart as hell"" and I don't think they would agree with this film.

There are two very good speeches in the film: No one gets left behind, and second, Using Helicopters in War. Moore's leadership in battle is also captivating as he exhorts his men to keep their composure under fire in numerous scenes.

When Vietnamese soldiers get shot they scream 'AAAIIIEEE!' and throw themselves three feet in the air.The Americans are heroes to a man. At the first sign of a setback the cowardly Vietnamese hurriedly gather their gear together and run for it.The last we see of the Vietnamese is one of their officers placing a tattered American flag back in its place as though to foreshadow America winning the Vietnam War, the director perhaps forgetting for a moment that America actually lost the Vietnam War.The Americans take prisoners. The Vietnamese don't.Every time an American helicopter swings into view or an American soldier fires his gun we go into slow motion and sentimental music plays.An American soldier announces that his wife is due to give birth that day absolutely out of the blue for no reason whatsoever just to heighten the emotion when he inevitably dies later on. In fact, soldiers in this film whose wives give birth are the equivalent of a red shirted extra in Star Trek.In summary, this film is entirely made up of cliches and misplaced patriotism. God bless America.",We Were Soldiers

There are a lot of stories my father will not tell me about his tour in Vietnam, and due to this film I now understand why. I will not try to justify this war, not will I try to say it is a war that is above any other war, but what I will say is the men who fought in this war deserve to me remembered.I love my father, and I love movies also. Movies tend to get the facts incorrect, but seem to convey the emotion correctly. This film may not be completely historically correct, but it does one thing for us, it places is directly in the shoes of the men who had to be there.God bless America, god bless human beings, and god bless life, it's a gift.",We Were Soldiers
583,BuckyBoy,most sentimental movie i ever seen!.. horrible :(,1,12 September 2004,"its hard to write more than 10 lines about this movie, but i will try: the first hour of the movie is just simply boring and sentimental. It's about the soldiers families and training for the big moment, but you don't get to see a whole lot. The characters always stay superficial, they never come to life. pure stereotypes. You can't blame the actors really.. its the script.. it's just appalling. The film music is extremely sentimental too and blown up in a wrong way. The second part is more interesting when they (finally) go to Vietnam. The special effects are great! That's about the only reason why you would want to see this movie. If you liked Pearl Harbor this one is for you, if not.. you will hate this one even more. Some people argue that is a good documentary type of movie.. well then they should have given some more facts, instead of all the sentimental BS.",We Were Soldiers

It depicts truly what our soldiers experienced in Vietnam. Every actor does a superb job of bringing home the reality of what the Vietnam War was really about, and how every one of these men is deserving of our respect and gratitude. I suspect the making of this film is part of the process which brought Mel Gibson back to his faith in God. This movie is not for children, but every young adult in America should see it to understand more about what their fathers went through in Vietnam. There is graphic violence which is necessary to understand the horrid violence which is war. At the end of the film you may not have dry eyes but you will have a new or renewed respect for the courageous men who served in Vietnam.",We Were Soldiers

The effort spent on authenticity was amazing. I would certainly have liked to have seen more of the Vietnamese in the movie, but at least they made the attempt. One interesting thing to note is that if you get this film on DVD, definitely watch the deleted scenes, in particular the debriefing of Col. Moore by Gen. Westmoreland and Secretary McNamara, where they are trying to use the victory he and his men gained at Ia Drang to justify their policies in Vietnam. Very interesting, particularly Col. Moore's reaction to them.",We Were Soldiers

Vietnam so damaged America and the American military that it took over a decade to erase the cancer. This movie portrays the 'best' part of the war for American troops who initially brought high ideals and expectations to battle. Reality however over a 3 day span, changed that forever. If you are looking for a movie that will allow you to experience emotions that very few movies can bring out, watch this movie, it has similar impact to Saving Private Ryan, or Black Hawk Down. I you have ever questioned the moral existence of soldiers, watch this movie. You will support them wholeheartedly, and pray we never send them out again.Usual steller portrayals by Mel and Sam.

That actors play exactly those who fought in that war, and carry the same names in the movie too you don't see much. At the beginning you see how it came to be that way. At the end you see how much influence it has at those soldiers who fought in that war and saw there friends die. The beginning and the end are important aspects in a movie. Also you see how the wives of those soldiers get on with their lives and after they heard that their husband has died. All with all it is a very extraordinary but interesting movie.

Mel Gibson should be ashamed of himself- it is trite. And the battle scenes are appalling. Everyone is firing automatic weapons- yet everyone is able to stand up and take pot shots at each other from 50 metres. The Vietnamese (Red Indians) aren't as good as the Americans (Cowboys) at standing stock still and avoiding the bullets, so they invariably fall down dead... oh, I could rant all night.

This is quite possibly the greatest film I will ever see. Only a soldier can know what it's like to willfully remove himself from the warmth,love and comfort of his family to a sinful, deadly world of war. Colonel Moore dressed himself that night in his battle fatigues, kissed his children goodbye, and walked away from his family, not knowing if he would ever return again. If this doesn't make a grown man's heart buckle, I don't know what would. How many of us would do that exact same thing and not have tears flowing down our cheek? Then, if that wasn't enough, how many of us would take up a leadership position knowing full well that many of your men would not be returning to their families? Could any of us in that position live with ourselves ever again? Well, I'm sure General Moore today re-lives these very same feelings over and over. I salute you General Moore. I hope to one day meet you and shake your hand and tell you ""Thank You for what you sacrificed for this Country"". I wish to also thank Mel Gibson, who brought the General's actions and feelings to us in the way he always does - perfectly. I wish to thank Randall Wallace for making it all possible by directing this wonderful film and helping me learn more about life and the sacrifices we must all face one day. I never served in combat. I guess it wasn't meant to be. But having served in Panama prior to the invasion in 1988, I realize now just how close I came to that ultimate sacrifice.

Now the men of the 7th Calvary are fighting in what will be known as The Valley of Death. Three days and two nights of none stop fighting over this valley costs both sides dearly. During the battle, Hal Moore makes some incredible things happen. He is able to keep many of his own troops alive while suffering major loses. The Americans after three days and two nights of not sleeping, make a desperate charge on the Vietnamese base. The Vietnamese are prepared for this and they are ready to kill every last one of Hal Moore's troops.""We Were Soldiers"" is based on a book called ""We Were SoldiersOnce"" written by Hal Moore. The battle in The Valley of Death is one of the major battles fought by the Americans in the Vietnam War. One of the great things about Hal Moore is when he is delivering a speech to his men before they are shipped off to Vietnam; he says that he will bring everyone home dead or alive. This film shows the hardship and objectives of each fighting force. The Vietnamese are fighting for land and freedom from the French while the Americans are fighting to help keep Vietnam under French rule.I believe that We Were Soldiers is a great movie depicting what happened at a battle that many people do not know about. I am really impressed on how Mel Gibson got the military rank right along with the corresponding symbols. Viewing the battle from both sides gives you a perspective of how each side is thinking for the battle. Some of the fight I did not like because it would show a Vietnamese officer telling his troops what to do, then a second later it show Hal Moore telling his troops to defend that position.",We Were Soldiers

This movie lets you see what we were too afraid to show in others, the horror, blood, and pain both sides went through at that first major battle. It gave me a much greater appreciation of what our soldiers are going through in Iraq and a greater appreciation for soldiers in general... I owe my freedom and life to those who have the courage to fight for this country.We Were Soldiers does a small justice to what can never be fully understood and paid tribute to.

One Reviewer cites deviations from the actual story line that does not really detract from the authenticity of the whole endeavor. The effects of the Armys inability to properly inform next of kin was dramatically displayed. The emphasis was placed on the courage of the American soldier and the outstanding leadership displayed by all the officers involved in the units directly involved in the battle. Combat scenes very realistically portrayed the near hopelessness of the American situation, and how Army higher commands main concern was avoiding possible embarrassment. The only negative was the failure to demonstrate how the forces sent to relieve the surrounded Forces were decimated upon their return march back to the main base. The hubris of the subsequent command was discussed in the book, needlessly causing the death of hundreds of American soldiers.

594,callum_e_scott,Another example of over patriotic producing,5,21 March 2005,"There's nothing wrong with patriotism, but We Were Soldiers takes it to a whole new level.All in all its a very good action war film, even if its a but formalistic (guess what happens to the guy that just had a baby born), but as said all in all a pretty good film.Gibson is great as the caring but firm commanding officer, Hal Moore, and teamed up with Sam Elliot have some of the most amusing parts in the film playing the battle hardened veterans (""You can't shoot a gun lyin on yer belly son kneel up and kill those b******s"") Unfortunaly it is riddled with ridiculous patriotism (border line propaganda America is great look at Americans stick together blah blah) Heres the spoiler bit but it is not really essential to the plot: There is a scene where the cab driver that delivers the condolence for you lost husband letter arrives at Moore's (gibson) house in the US, as it turns out hes just lost she goes crazy cause she thought is for her he says he doesn't like the job (big breath) she says drop all of them here and ill deliver them. Pretty good scene and very powerful that shows war doesn't just affect families of soldiers. Mrs Moore now goes to deliver the telegram accompanied by the pregnant wife of a soldier. We now have the weeping wife's refusal to accept the letter. Highly charged an emotional again excellently acted. Retur to Moores house and there's about 20 telegrams sitting at the door step the 2 women agree to to them both together one at a time without peaking.And thats where it should have cut to the next act. A very powerful and moving scene.But its not its ruined by a silly montage of many weeping wife's and even a shot of the American flag . At one point i was waiting for a section with all the women that have got their telegrams marching up to the next house and that wife joining the procession. That didn't happen but might have well have as the whole montage devalues the powerful scenes before hand and demeans the meaning of the film.This should have been a factual film based on the horrors that the families suffered at the hands of the government at the time not a tool used to show how Americans are great and can perceiver.The event itself could be compared to the battle of rokes drift (Zulu starring Michael Cane) in that the soldiers are grossly outnumbered.

War is hell. That is a well known fact that many movies try to hide. During the Vietnam War however, the media didn't try to hide it at all, and this movie captures much of this statement in the opening statements, and does nothing to downplay it throughout the rest of the movie. Its a well made movie, showing all aspects of the battle in the Ia Drang Valley from the training of the US soldiers to the actual battle, to the commanders behind the lines, and to the wives left behind at home. It does a good job of showing that wars not only touch the lives of the soldiers fighting it but those they leave at home. Overall this movie was well written, and very well made.

It captures the hearts and minds of the viewer, and really gives the audience a sense of what war/jungle fighting would really be like. It shows not just the war, but the struggle of the families at home in the States, who after all , were just as emotionally involved. It shows patriotism, love, loyalty, courage and spirit through a lot of the main characters, and the battle scenes are truly terrific.

602,xnoybis1,ho hum dorky Vietnam blech,4,24 September 2005,"Randall Wallace made one fun movie that was blown out of proportion and pushed him into an ego happy land on par with Leonardo DiCaprio. Braveheart was popcorn munching heaven. Everything since then has been a steady drivel of nothinglike coffee grounds forced, FORCED from the bottom of the pot to make an unwilling cuppa. This movie is bland on so many levels it's a shame. I think it was about 20 minutes into it when the helicopters that look like knock off plastic hueys on a blue screen do little aerials that I realized money here would have been better spent on advancing technology for turning ducks into toaster ovens. From there it just sort of goes down hill. Lessee... we've got the obligatory 5 seconds of screen time for the token black guy who just looks confused (seriously, do any of you know how MANY black people really fought in the Vietnam war? Jeepers), the obligatory shaky, gritty camera shots when the battle gets wicky wild; the reverb echo effects just before the big big oh no mortars fall; friendly fire; blood blood everywhere; grim face shots of our lead actor; young faces going into battle; battle screamsdang, we have a veritable A-list A-team hereand yet... this movie just kills itself. It's like Disney doing a pornoevery shot in between is crystal clear and filled with'we know not the evil we do' sentimentality. It's saccharine, it's silly, it's not worth your while. If you want a good war moviego for broke with Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line, or Dr. Strangelove. However, if you're in the market for lackluster string sections sound-tracking slow-motion montages of sucky images with poor poor poor poor adobe premiere flame effects... why, your cattle car stops here! Watch as Mel Gibson takes another lofty glance at that mountain over th'ar; see minority groups squabble and then make ends meet; witness Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson reconcile their bigotry in Braveheart (if you don't know what I'm talking about, then perhaps you should read more) by attempting rationalizations from the enemy perspective (gee, they're almost human!); C-class emotional drama... the list of daunting accomplishments goes on. 4 / 10 for this sludge fest. It gets 4 for actually accomplishing what I think it set out to do: show lot's of people being killed, make shallow stabs at moral messages, parade around with American imperialism, and make some money.As an addendum (and quoting another post I made) Just because a film is about human tragedy (american and/or otherwise) doesn't mean we should exempt it from criticism on its (lack of) artistic merit as a film. Furthermore, why bother making a film that relies so heavily on its source material that it has fans raving, ""well you can't understand unless you've read the book, otherwise you'll never understand."" This is as idiotic as the faith defense. I shouldn't have to read the book! It's a movie! If I wanted to read the book, then I would have read the book! People make films because they're a fundamentally different medium from the written word. It takes guts (though often with very poor results) to turn a book into a screenplay.

605,kstuard-1,critique of We Were Soldiers,8,27 November 2006,"The true events depicted in We Were Soldiers make the movie just as much about emotion as the brutality of war. Based on the book We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young by Lt Col Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway about the first major battle in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, the film accurately depicts the bloody engagement of four hundred American troops against two thousand North Vietnamese soldiers. The movie was was written and directed by Randall Wallace. There were three producers of the movie; Bruce Davey, Stephen McEveety, and Randall Wallace. We Were Soldiers takes a unique approach to the war story as told by cinema. This movie addresses the emotional toll the war has on the soldiers during the fighting, and the same toll as felt by the families they left behind to serve this country. The beginning of the movie revolves around the establishment of relationships between the soldiers and their families, as well as the connectedness of all the families portrayed in the movie. In no time at all, however, the viewer is introduced to the gruesome reality of war. Almost upon landing at LZ X-Ray, the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (led by Lt. Col. Hal Moore) are surrounded by enemy forces. Some of those soldiers whom the viewer is led to believe to be the main ""characters"" are quickly faced with the bitterness of mortality, as they are not immune to incoming enemy fire. Despite the large number of ""characters"" introduced, it was pretty easy to follow each individual story. There were no inconsistencies in character portrayal throughout the movie, lest you count Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley telling Sgt. Ernie Savage, ""That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage"" after Savage is rescued. This is inconsistent with Plumley because at the beginning of the movie, Plumley regularly dismisses Savage's attempts at describing the beautiful mornings at base camp. Other than the said example, the rest of the movie flowed smoothly in its character portrayal.Nick Glennie-Smith composed the music of We Were Soldiers. He delivered a highly passionate score filled with heroism and sadness. Every scene of heroism was filled with music set to inspire the viewer. Each scene of sadness was magically paired with a haunting piece of music. This can really be seen in the scenes in which Lt. Col. Hal Moore's wife Julie Moore delivers the telegrams to her friends and fellow wives. Or when 2nd Lt. Jack Geoghegan sacrifices his life to bring back a fallen soldier. The music is a perfect match to the movie. In We Were Soldiers, there are many instances of slow motion. This adds to the dramatic affect the director is looking to get from his audience. For instance, when Sp4 Galen Bungum and Sgt. Ernie Savage each kill a North Vietnamese soldier in hand-to-hand combat. The speed is slowed so that the viewer might really understand the soldiers' fight for survival in Vietnam, and realize the emotional impact that would be felt by the two American soldiers. Another scene was when Joe Galloway ran through the battlefield taking pictures of the dead, the wounded, and those in combat. Once again, this was done to allow the viewer to appreciate the full scope and magnitude of the fighting and sacrifice that happened in the Valley of Death. It was because of scenes such as these that really opened my eyes for the human need and want to survive. The will of these soldiers as portrayed by the actors was simply amazing. Such determination to keep the man standing beside them alive was truly inspirational. I think Lt. General Hal Moore had it right when he said, ""American soldiers in battle don't fight for what some president says on T.V., they don't fight for mom, apple pie, the American flag...they fight for one another."" We Were Soldiers could be argued to be a propaganda movie that tries to glorify the Vietnam War. However, I believe that purpose for the movie was to bring to light the sacrifices of the American soldier and his family during this time period. In the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, the authors write about Hollywood movies of Vietnam, and how they got it wrong every time. Randall Wallace (director, writer, and producer of the movie) only sought to get it right. Though I wasn't even alive during the Vietnam War, I believe Wallace and his crew got it right, for once. The movie We Were Soldiers is a very probable movie. For one, it is based on actual events that occurred at the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Also, the movie is based on the nonfiction, documentary book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young. The special effects, the raw emotion, and the outstanding acting made this movie very believable. On a scale of one to four, four being the highest, I would rate the movie a four, for reasons found throughout this critique.",We Were Soldiers
