0,MartinHafer,The lack of originality and occasional stupidity of some of the characters hinder your overall enjoyment of the film--though it IS entertaining,5,21 June 2015,"No matter what anyone tells you, ""Chappie"" is basically a South African re-working of the RoboCop franchise. So, when you see it, while you might enjoy it, you cannot help but compare the film to the others. Because of this, the film certainly is not original. But, despite this, it is modestly entertaining. There are tons of explosions and shooting and the way that the new police android, Chappie, learns and grows is interesting to watch. But, the film also has a serious problem--the writing. While there are some really interesting parts to the movie, it also occasionally has HUGE lapses of intelligence. For instance, Chappie is stolen by criminals--really, really bad criminals. They also kidnap Chappie's maker and force him to activate the droid. And then, they just let the guy go!!! Later, this devoted programmer returns to see and work on his creation AFTER the baddies threatened to kill him if they ever saw him again...but they don't!! Late in the film, one of these same super-evil villains even tries to save some lives by trying to sacrifice his own!!! Where is the consistency and believability?! There are other examples of these unevenness...but frankly it's a film you best watch by just turning off your brain and enjoying it if you can. If you can't, it's going to be a long, long viewing experience.By the way, although I love South Africa and would love to visit it again, Johannesburg really IS this scary in real life and setting the film there is appropriate. Visit this lovely country-- especially Cape Town or the countryside. Just be careful when entering Johannesburg.",Chappie
1,Leofwine_draca,Blomkamp dropped the ball on this one,4,13 April 2016,"South African director Neill Blomkamp's debut movie, DISTRICT 9, remains a masterpiece, and his follow-up ELYSIUM is a very good piece of action spectacle. Sadly, the magic isn't repeated for this, his third film, an odd concoction of rehashes of old material and disappointing new elements.The first thing you notice about CHAPPIE is its familiarity. The whole robot cop thing is heavily derived from ROBOCOP and the presence of an ED-209 style robot makes it even more obvious. Secondly, the idea of a sentient, learning robot brings to mind the glory days of the SHORT CIRCUIT film in the 1980s; they were childhood favourites of mine. Plus the social milieu and gangster type stuff is familiar from the director's previous films.Sadly, CHAPPIE makes the crucial error of failing to have the protagonist be sympathetic at all. The reliable Sharlto Copley does his best with the voice and mo-cap work, but Chappie is just a mildly annoying robot, nothing more. Attempts to turn him into a gangster take up much of the running time, but the non-actors who play the gangsters overact for the most part and are very annoying.It's a pity that this film feels so directionless, because there's good stuff here. The CGI effects are exemplary, as you'd expect from a Blomkamp movie. There's not much action, but the big set-piece climax is very well staged. A supporting turn from Hugh Jackman is one of the best performances in the whole thing, although Sigourney Weaver is wasted in an extraneous part. When you sit down and watch CHAPPIE, you see the framework of a part-decent movie buried beneath a lumbering and uneven execution, and I think that's a real shame. Let's hope Blomkamp can pick it up again for his forthcoming ALIENS movie...",Chappie
2,SnoopyStyle,annoying gang,3,30 December 2015,"Crime in Johannesburg is out of control. The government uses robots from the Tetravaal Company run by Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver). The Scouts are designed by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel). Ex-military Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) has his design called Moose but nobody wants it with the Scouts being so successful. Deon develops a revolutionary AI and has secretly programmed it into a damaged Scout. Meanwhile, criminals Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika need to make one big score to pay back crime lord Hippo. They come with an idea to kidnap Deon to get a remote for the robots. Instead they also get learning robot Chappie.The criminals are really off-putting. They are more like Mad Max wannabes than anyone scary. Ninja is way too silly and Yo-Landi is way too maternal. The first problem comes when they let Deon come and go as he wishes. I don't understand Ninja's logic. He's a horrible kidnapper. Also the company has horrendous security. Neill Blomkamp has something compelling to say but it becomes a mess. Chappie is like a gangster Johnny Five with less charm. I never hated Vincent as much as the movie wants because I never liked Deon and Chappie that much.",Chappie
3,claudio_carvalho,"Flawed, but Entertaining",7,19 September 2015,"In Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of criminality using robots from the Tetravaal Company, designed by the engineer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel). The former military Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) is envious of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja (Ninja), Yo-Landi (¥o-Landi Vi$$er) and Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot. ""Chappie"" is a flawed but entertaining film with ""robocops"" fighting against crime. However, Tetravaal is totally unbelievable as a security company with the easy access of employees to the facility and software. Considering that all Johannesburg is dependable of the robots, it is ridiculous the lack of protection of the company and how easy Deon Wilson and Vincent Moore go there during the night and access the systems using only a key. The concern of Chappie with mortality and the discussion with his creator is taken from ""Blade Runner"". The corny decision of Deon, running after Chappie instead of activating the robots in the chaotic city is also silly. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Chappie""",Chappie
4,nogodnomasters,starsNO SIGNAL,5,20 November 2018,"In the year 2016 South Africa uses an army of ""Robocops"". Deon (Dev Patel) works for the company and has developed an artificial intelligence he wants to test out on one of the units so this killing machine can learn to paint and write poetry. Vincent (Hugh Jackman) has created a huge ""Starwars"" looking machine with ominous ""Omen"" swagger music, that the police don't want because it is overkill...unless crime picks up.It isn't hard to figure out the basic plot from this point. Deon makes an AI robot that gave me cheesy ""Short Circuit"" flashbacks.Is there another film out named ""Chappie?"" I am having trouble with the rave reviews for a film that was as idiotic and as long as ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" and brings me to this question, ""Why Hugh why? Say it ain't so!"" Every now and then our heroes get suckered into doing bad movies because the script looks good...just ask Cypher Raige.This is clearly another bad teen film that the kids will love and I will pass on ownership. It's another kid's film with a lot of swearing.Guide: F-bombs, some obscure background nudity.",Chappie
5,kosmasp,Comparing,8,3 July 2015,"If a movie has a robot in it, that is part cop, the comparisons with Robocop won't be hard to find. But this is a different beast altogether. Trying to get into a discussion about machines, souls and after-life. Not everything gels in perfectly and nicely. But the director does a good job with a lot of elements. Something that might have spun out of control, but it didn't.While the name Chappie might remind some of dog (food) and I can only guess that was intended, there is more to Chappie than just being a ""pet"". Chappie is getting and learning things fast as you'd expect and the lines between good and evil blur at times, if not through the whole movie. That might be tough to handle or accept for some, but if you do roll with it, you'll see a very entertaining movie, that can give you food for thought ...",Chappie
6,lee_eisenberg,"""RoboCop"" meets ""Short Circuit""",7,26 December 2015,"Concerns over the use of drones to kill people and the use of military equipment by police make Neill Blomkamp's ""Chappie"" more relevant. The use of an all-robot police force recalls ""RoboCop"", while the concept of a droid who has human qualities brings to mind ""Short Circuit"" and ""AI: Artificial Intelligence""*. Although some scenes in the movie come across as silly, I interpreted it as a warning about over-reliance on technology for law enforcement. The South African setting makes sense: four decades of institutionalized racism gave way to one of the highest crime rates in the developed world.In the end, I recommend the movie. It's understood that Chappie simply wants to be able to live like everyone else. The plot holes don't drag the movie down at all. Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel (of ""Slumdog Millionaire""), Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman put on fine performances.*Another movie focusing on a robot with human qualities is ""Robot & Frank"", starring Frank Langella and Susan Sarandon.",Chappie
7,jboothmillard,Chappie,6,14 August 2015,"I saw many clips and trailers for this film, and it was commented on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, it certainly looked like a worthwhile watch, directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9). Basically in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, in the near future, crime is at a record high, to combat this the government has the streets patrolled by state-of-the-art, armour-plated A.I. attack robots, manufactured by American weapons company Tetravaal, developed by British engineer Deon Wilson (Slumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel). The robots are an instant success, wiping out most of the city's most powerful drug and organised crime gangs in a matter of months, this overshadows the competing project developed by Australian soldier-turned-engineer Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman), a remotely controlled larger robotic machine called MOOSE. Deon has a new project in mind, he has created a prototype artificial intelligence that mimics a human mind, feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) refuses to test this on a robot, but he ignores this and steals a recently damaged robot to put together himself. On the way home however, the van Deon is driving is hijacked and he is kidnapped by a group of gangsters: Ninja (Ninja), Yo-Landi (Yo-Landi Visser), and Yankie - or Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo), they threaten to kill Deon if he does not build and reprogram a robot to fight for them to carry out a robbery to pay a 20 million rand debt to powerful gangster Hippo (Brandon Auret). Deon builds the robot and installs the new software, he explains that the robot will react and have the mind of an infant child, so when it is activated it is scared, but slowly responds to Deon and Yo-Landi's calm approach, the robot learns and imitates new words, and from Yo-Landi using the phrase ""happy chappie"", they name the robot ""Chappie"" (District 9's Sharlto Copley). Ninja's gang have only a few days to pay the debt, but if Chappie is going to help them they need to give him time to develop, Ninja forces Deon to stay out of their hideout until he is needed, he is keen to teach Chappie many more things, and allow him to express himself, including painting, but Ninja instead teaches him swear words, defence and gun use. Ninja decides one day to put Chappie on the streets to make use of his taught skills to fend for himself against other gang members, but he ends up damaged with an arm taken off, he gets a replacement, and when Deon visits he teaches Chappie things that are right and wrong, specifically he makes him promise not to commit crimes. Meanwhile Moore is using the locater at Tetravaal to find the software stolen by Deon, he is able to find the reactivated robot that was due to destruction, he is shocked to witness a robot with a conscience, Chappie does in fact carry out the robbery of cars to be sold, but he believes it is to get the money needed to replace his dying battery. Moore uploads a virus that deactivates all police robots, including Chappie, this only allows hundreds of criminals to riot on the streets, Deon is determined to help Chappie and takes him to Tetravaal, there Chappie notices the helmet used to control MOOSE, back at the hideout Chappie re-engineers it to enable his consciousness to be transfered into a computer, and change bodies. Bradley has ordered Chappie to be destroyed, and Moore is allowed to activate MOOSE to assassinate, a battle ensues, Amerika and Hippo are killed and Deon is mortally wounded, Yo-Landi sacrifices herself to save Ninja, enraged by her death Chappie drives Deon to the factory and fiercely beats Moore close to death. Chappie is successful in transferring Deon's consciousness with the modified MOOSE helmet to the body of a spare robot, and Chappie's battery dies, but new robot Deon is able to wirelessly transfer his consciousness into another nearby police robot body. In the end robots are discontinued and the police end the contract with Tetravaal, grieving Ninja finds a flash drive marked ""Mommy's Consciousness Test Backup"", which contains Yo- Landi's consciousness which was copied when the helmet was tested, and Chappie and Deon go into hiding, and Chappie is able to hack Tetravaal's manufacturing facility to build a new robot resembling Yo-Landi. Also starring Johnny K. Selema as Pitbull and Anderson Cooper. Copley as voice and physical mannerisms of the title robot is really likable as the child-like, expressive and intelligence growing machine with a soul, Jackman is a little forgettable, and Weaver gets her moments as the corporate boss, this is essentially a cross between RoboCop and WALL-E, with perhaps a hint of Pinocchio, the robot torn between right and wrong has mixed results, but it is paced well enough, and it has brilliant special effects for the simple machine movements and the explosive action sequences, overall it is a science-fiction thriller worth watching. Good!",Chappie

An advanced humanoid with Artificial Intelligence is stolen quickly after his creation.

9,Theo Robertson,Is Blomkamp A One Hit Wonder,6,29 March 2015,"Like so many people I really enjoyed Neill Blomkamp's DISTRICT 9 one of the very best science-fiction films in recent years that fused cerebral social comment with exciting fast paced action sequences . I missed his follow up ELYSIUM but couldn't help noticing from the trailers that it had the same visual look as the director's prior film , an opinion that seemed reinforced by the rather lukewarm reviews ELYSIUM received . With CHAPPIE my spidey senses were tingling that we'd be getting more of the same along with a pastiche of similar films such as ROBOCOP and SHORT CIRCUIT . Add to this a rather poor marketing campaign that saw parents taking their children to the film only to lead them out again when they realised there was violence and very bad language . Even the title CHAPPIE gives the impression the audience are going to be watching a twee Disney type film and you might just be expecting a massive own goal where marketing is concerned To be fair CHAPPIE isn't a massive disaster but is ill thought out on so many levels . First of all Blomkamp seems unable to leave whatever comfort zone he had in DISTRICT 9 . The film starts with talking head interviews and news reports that we had in D9 and it's only when the characters mention droid cops that I was reminded I wasn't watching D9 . We then get a high octane shoot out in a Jo-Burg slum and again I was left with the impression I could have been watching out-takes from the action scenes from D9 with the droid cops superimposed over the action . To its mild credit the film then does start taking on an identity of its own but here it starts to hit serious problems that have been mentioned - the tone . I can't emphasise how schizophrenic the film starts becoming . The titular droid and its developer Deon get kidnapped by some nasty foul mouthed criminals from the slums and these criminals are often incapable of opening their mouths without a string of expletives coming out . Later on we get a female crim reading Chappie a story like she would a child and it's like watching a mawkish family film complete with incidental music to go with it . I'm unable to emphasise how often this jarring shifts in tone happen or indeed why they happen . I think the angry parents who dragged their little ones out the cinema have only themselves to blame for not researching a film beforehand - this is an era where something can easily be researched via the internet - but by the same token this is by no means a family film yet someone bizarre segments suggest it might be CHAPPIE isn't a complete dead loss and I did like it in parts . Much of the film is helped by the casting of Dev Patel as Deon and he's always been good at playing sympathetic characters who have no problem getting the audience on their side and he continues in this type of role . Also as in the past director Blomkamp knows how to make great action scenes but at the end of the day CHAPPIE isn't a rip roaring action thriller anymore than it is a family film and one wonders what sort of film the production team were trying to market ?",Chappie
10,LeonLouisRicci,Plenty of Heart but Could Use Some Insight and Intelligence,7,28 August 2015,"An Uneven Screenplay that Waivers All Over the Place Making it Hard to Know How to Relate to Certain Characters, Especially ""Daddy"", This Third Film from Director Blomkamp is Still a Touching and Action Filled Affair that is Somewhat Underrated.It is Ambitious but its Ambiguity is Apparent at Every Turn. It Doesn't Follow its Own Logic Most of the Time and Leaps About with a Frenzied Pace that Does it No Good.Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman Barely Register, but the Rest of the Cast Make Their Mark Albeit in Somewhat of a Blur. The Titular Robot Character is Charming and Engaging and has the Audience Rooting for Him.There is a Rush to End Things with the Transfer of Consciousness Thing and the Movie Ends Up Feeling a Bit Unfulfilling or At Least Unwilling to Contemplate its Own Conceits About God (The Maker) and His Creation.Overall, it is Worth a Watch Because of ""Chappie"" and Some Excellent Action Scenes, but One Comes Away Wishing the Movie Would Have as Much Insight and Intelligence as it has Heart.",Chappie
11,CinemaSerf,"""Short Circuit"" meets ""IRobot""",6,23 July 2020,"Dev Patel (""Deon"") is the computer programmer/designer of some state of the art police robots in crime-ridden Johannesburg. His heavily arnoured ""scouts"" manage to drastically reduce the crime rate but he want to develop them further - a plan not supported by his boss Sigourney Weaver so he decides to take things into is own hands. When one of his creations gets hit and damaged by an RPG, he pinches it intent on giving it some humanity. Snag is, he gets kidnapped by a bunch of low-lives who want him to turn the rogue robot ""Chappie"" into a criminal to help them carry out a heist to raise the money they need to repay a local crime lord. Meantime, Hugh Jackman has also developed a super robot that is sitting idle because of the effectiveness of the more benign scouts. When ""Chappie"" starts stealing things, he gets to release his monster robot and, well you can guess the rest. It's one of those films that trades very much on the quality of the cast, but is let down by really mediocre writing and directing and again, Weaver, turns up in a charm-free role that doesn't allow her character to make much impact; indeed Jackman doesn't really either leaving us with Dev and a rather unintimidating gang of hoodlums and an ending that is certainly borrowed from quite a few others from the genre. No great shakes this one, sorry.",Chappie
12,utgard14,"""You gave me a retarded robot.""",7,1 June 2015,"I really liked this one. There's some obvious '80s influences here, from the criminals looking like something out of a Mad Max movie to the Short Circuit and Robocop elements. There's even a bit of a He-Man cartoon shown at one point. It's an intriguing and certainly entertaining movie, if not an overly original one. I think some critics are unhappy with the lack of pretentiousness that was present in Neill Blomkamp's previous work. Here the ""messages"" are more universal and less political. Some people only like their sci-fi if it carries with it an obvious metaphor for a topical social injustice. You can even find such metaphors here if you try but subtlety is not a zealot's cup of tea. Overall, I thought the script was good and I really liked the upbeat ending. Another nitpick I have about the modern critic is that they think the only good sci-fi story is one with a downer ending. The special effects are pretty amazing. The acting is solid all around. Dev Patel, Yo-Landi Vissir, Ninja, Jose Pablo Cantillo, and Sharlto Copley (voice & motion capture for Chappie) are all great. Hugh Jackman has a rare turn as the villain here and does a terrific job, even if I do hate the obligatory clichés his character is saddled with. That haircut, though...Maybe it's not for everybody. I have friends that haven't seen it yet that I'm fairly certain will bitch about it and pick it apart, like I see from many reviews on here. But that's their loss. I'm happy that Blomkamp tried to make a movie that's not dumb by any stretch but also isn't just aimed at the elitist film snob crowd or soapbox bloggers.",Chappie
13,grantss,Basic but fun,6,7 October 2017,"Johannesburg, South Africa. In order to curb the high crime rate the police use robots to fight crime. This is an immediate success and the police order several more robots from the developer, Tetravaal. After falling foul of these robots, two criminals, Ninja and Yolandi, kidnap Tetravaal's chief engineer, and genius behind the robots, Deon Wilson, with the aim of getting him to deactivate them. To their surprise he is transporting one of the robots, Scout 22, as he is working on a personal project to give robots consciousness. Ninja and Yolandi see the opportunity to have a robot on their side and immediately set about attempting to train the robot to help them in their criminal activities. They also give him a name - Chappie.Okay, fun movie from writer-director Neil Blomkamp. Not anywhere up to the standard of Blomkamp's brilliant debut movie, District 9, but it'll do (and it is heaps better than Blomkamp's second movie, the weak, irritating Elysium). Pretty basic plot with low production values and a hammy clumsiness to it all, yet it is fairly entertaining. Maybe it is the crudeness of it all that makes it likable, as it is difficult to take too seriously. Add in two of the most colourful criminals of all time - Ninja and Yolandi, played by the members of South African rap band Die Antwoord, and it is a rollicking ride.Does get a bit silly towards the end as the capers get to be like a common-or-garden action movie. Also loses its lightness as Blomkamp tries to be serious and inject some philosophy and emotion into the movie, and this is out of place and half-baked.Overall, hardly Citizen Kane but reasonably entertaining.",Chappie

15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Mixed,7,6 March 2015,"As may really happen soon(and this is set in the not too distant future, somewhere in time), and yet goes completely unexamined(and it's not the only compelling concept it fails to do much with), humanoid robots, Scouts(or, y'know, Homeland), largely replace regular police. One falls into the hands of a rather unlikable and one-note trio of criminals whose protagonist status is trying our patience, because of the former, not the latter. Chappie(Copley, sweet and charming, doing both well-integrated motion-capture and voice-work) is granted consciousness, and this innocent, childlike(yet rather powerful, able to kick through brick walls like it's nothing) being deals with different influences and goes through the range of human emotions with us finding ourselves touched, cheering him on, or scared for or of him.Blomkamp delivers on both his good and bad tropes, and we end up with something in some ways better than Elysium, and it is thankfully less simplistic, mainstream and ridiculously one-sided, left-leaning(and I say that as a major Liberal). There are major problems with the characters. Moore(Jackman's mullet being as badass a presence as usual – yet here, we're afraid of who he'll hurt and how, instead of hoping he'll get there soon and get one of the really bad people that way), a former soldier who's Christian? Or is that a joke? Anyway, he's built a remote-controlled mech suit which is completely overkill for crime fighting(which may be satire of the recent militarization of such) which has been turned down. He has fun, and we vicariously enjoy the taste of the scenery. The other names are wasted, Weaver in particular. And that leaves us with earlier-mentioned obnoxious ones.The action, whilst largely free of cool guns(don't get me wrong, the various bullet delivery systems on display, especially with how tricked out they are, are badass) is great. The ending and the opening are from different movies – to each other and to this one. Unpredictable and fast-paced to the point where it forgets its own plot threads the entire climax feels tailored and sacrifices scope in the name of focus, when a few rewrites could have addressed that much better. I do get a bad feeling that Neill is running out of ideas. With all the similarities between his three films, he almost should have pulled a Sin City and placed them all within the same universe.There is a lot of brutal, violent and disturbing content, as well as a little sexuality and full frontal female nudity(because it can) in this. I recommend this to fans of the subgenre. 7/10",Chappie

17,view_and_review,An Emotional Look at A.I.,8,8 March 2015,"In the not-too-distant future, in South Africa, the police are aided by the use of robots. Crime is down significantly and the company can't produce the robots fast enough. Even with this success, Deon, the main engineer behind these machines, feverishly works to develop an artificial intelligence program.Two movies immediately come to mind when watching Chappie: Robocop and Short Circuit. Robocop because of the use of robots in law enforcement (there is even an ED 209 looking robot) and Short Circuit for more characteristic reasons. There have been plenty of A.I. movies but Chappie and Johnny 5 of Short Circuit were robots of a simple and child-like nature.Chappie was a risky movie that took guts and ingenuity. Tons of A.I. movies have been done, so how would Chappie distinguish itself from the dozens of A.I. predecessors? I can say that it did distinguish itself in a brilliant way. Yes, the movie had to rely a bit upon CGI, which was masterfully done, but the interest and intrigue was in the story. It was amazing that I was watching, what I knew to be a machine, yet I found an emotional attachment to it like a person would to any sentient life that is simple and innocent. Much like you would grow an emotional attachment to a puppy or a kitten.Chappie really went for a complex and gray approach as opposed to the black and white approach. Yes, there were protagonists and antagonists but you got the feeling that the only purely good character was Chappie. I don't know where I would rank this among my favorite robot/A.I. movies but I'm sure that it would be in my top five.",Chappie

This childlike – but learning - being ends up kidnapped by a group of petty gangsters who plan to use it for criminal purposes. Meanwhile, back at Tetravaal, ex-military man Vincent Moore is championing an enormous and viciously militaristic robot as the next step in robotic law enforcement.Chappie is like Robocop crossed with Pinocchio, with a touch of Terminator and Pygmalion thrown in, and all run through a pronounced Saath Efrikan filter. Much is very good – lots goes on, performances are very good, effects are great (I suspect Chappie himself is a mixture of CGI, costume, animatronic and puppetry, but they are all mixed together so well that you simply accept his physical reality throughout. It is often very funny, sometimes very touching, and has an ending – several endings – which I didn't see coming, and which I very much liked.Less positively, the strongly South African setting is both understandable and reasonable, but I found it somewhat distracting, the Vodacom tower product placement was annoying, the physical appearance affected by Yolandi (which, I understand, is part of her schtick) was profoundly irritating, and Moore's descent into psychotic body-shredding scenery-chewing mode was somewhere between improbable and unbelievable.On the whole, though, this was an enjoyable romp.",Chappie

And there is no doubt at all that Chappie is way better then Insurgent. A story easy to follow with a couple of well known actors and a couple of newbies. The story being in Johannesburg it doesn't surprise me they took the two most famous citizens of that city, being Yo-Landi and Ninja from the band Die Antwoord. I liked their music, and the soundtrack is also from them, but I didn't knew they could act. At least I thought they did a good job. You gotta love that accent from Joburg. The story itself makes you think if we really need Artificial Intelligence in our lives? I honestly think we should leave it like that. We don't need any robots doing all the rest for us.

I don't know what happened then, but Chappie presents an artistic vision of the same caliber as D9.Watching the trailer, you think that this is a sort of Short Circuit clone (and let's face it, it is a little bit) but it is so much more. The ending is something that makes you think and shocks a little bit, probably the reason why so many viewers decided to rate it down.Of course, not everything is perfect. The technical details are complete bogus, for example. The things is, I am sure Blomkamp meant it to be that way. This is a modern Pinocchio, it has a message that goes to your humanity, not your computer programming prowess. It is a fairy tale. If you accept that, if you expect most of the stuff in the film to be metaphorical, I guarantee the film will please you.Bottom line: I expected a lot, then a little less with all the negative comments online, then got a huge lot more than I had thought I would get the first time. Loved it!",Chappie

I loved the concept & also some of its strikingly done graphics, but, the Writing leaves something to be desired. Better Writing was needed, to enhance the overall impact!'Chappie' Synopsis: In the near future, crime is patrolled by a mechanized police force. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself.'Chappie' takes a look at a future, that's bleak but also interesting. Blomkamp & Terri Tatchell's Screenplay is superbly innovative & offers some terrific moments. The bonding/rivalry of its human characters with the A.I robots is interesting to watch. I also loved Chappie's characterization. But, the Writing slips at times. The second-hour, in particular, loses steam & the climax needed to be sharper. The Writing isn't as sharp as its concept & that too an extend, disappoints. Blomkamp's Direction is impressive. He's handled some of the most intense sequences, aptly. Cinematography is perpetually focused. Editing is slightly loose, especially in the second-hour. The Graphics & The Action-Sequences are mind-blowing. Art & Costume Design are detailed. Hans Zimmer's Score is brilliant.Performance-Wise: Sharlto Copley as Chappie, is stupendous, delivering a strong voice & motion capture performance. Dev Patel is in terrific form. He's done very well. Ninja, Yolandi Visser & Jose Pablo Cantillo are adequate. Hugh Jackman hams. Sigourney Weaver is wasted. On the whole, 'Chappie' has its share of highs of lows. Not Perfect, but Not Bad either!",Chappie
22,StevePulaski,More science-fiction that inserts the necessary emotions to make a terrific outcome,9,7 March 2015,"""Chappie"" transports us into the near future, where the high crime rate in Johannesburg, South Africa calls for the acquisition of a series of armor-plated, artificially intelligent, humanoid robots that serve as the town's indestructible police force. The robots cannot be hacked and are trained to shoot, arrest, and detain law-breaking citizens. The robot's designer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), a young and successful engineer, is detested by another engineer by the name of Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman), who's own plan for a robotic police force under the name of ""MOOSE"" failed when Deon's robots were brought into the market, due to the enormous size and scope of his own creation. Deon is now working on creating a robot that has a consciousness and can think and feel like a real human being.One day, Deon is kidnapped by a group of gangsters, Ninja (Ninja), Yolandi (Yolandi Visser), and Yankie (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who want the fictional ""remote"" for Deon's robots in order to shut down the robotic police force. When Deon informs them no such device exists, he gives them the prototype of the robot he's working on, equipped with a sound consciousness and human feelings. The gangsters agree to have Deon make infrequent trips back to their lair so he can train the robot, but the ultimate goal for the thieves is to use the robot to assist in heists and petty crime. The robot is named ""Chappie,"" and due to it actually having the ability to think and feel, it needs to be taught like a child the very basics of life. The film shows the four attempting to train the robot and the constant game of tug of war Deon plays with the three goons, which keeps pulling Chappie back and forth between a life of good and morality and a life of violence and destruction.Now with three films under his belt not only establishing his affinity for science-fiction but his love for dystopian worlds that, he claims, take place only ""ten minutes in the future,"" director Neill Blomkamp has affirmed with ""District 9"" and now with ""Chappie"" (""Elysium,"" to this day, is unseen by me) that he can make a science-fiction film with commentary, humor, entertainment, and, most surprisingly of all, a soul. ""Chappie"" may be a hot mess of a film, throwing together silly comedy with grotesque violence, action, suspense, and futuristic drama, but it's a hot mess that shows other disastrous cinematic hot messes how it's done. Being that the film revolves around training a robot how to live, survive, and learn the basics of existence, it's only logical that a film about the sorts be filled with so many different genres, and writer/director Blomkamp (along with co-writer Terri Tatchell) handle almost everything effectively.In addition to having an intriguing paradigm of humanity and technology coexisting when one is surpassing the other in terms of efficiency, Blomkamp also offers a real emotional core to the film's characters and character relationships, particularly that of Deon and Chappie. The two form such a strong, sensitive relationship with one another, despite being burdened by such a colossal danger with gang involvement, that the two carry out one of the most tender portrayals of a human's friendship with a humanoid that I have yet to see. While a devoted team of visual effects workers definitely have ""Chappie"" covered in a sense that it can be a visual spectacle, with the action scenes remaining clear and vibrant rather than muddled and incoherent most of the time, it's Blomkamp who surprises with his ability to evoke human sensibilities into a story I feared would lose it all in the shuffle of slambang action.To digress just a bit, ""Chappie""'s marketing was something of a spectacle in itself. When trailers first surfaced, they didn't portray the film's ideas adequately, rushing to show glimpses of the more suspenseful moments in the film to hopefully gain the widest possible audience. The first poster, showing Chappie decked out in bling and surrounded by children's building blocks, looked almost as if this were a silly kids film. When the second trailer of ""Chappie"" premiered, which I had the pleasure of seeing at least a dozen times since the beginning of this year, seemed to hit the nail on the head, portraying the man vs. machine conflict in a much greater manner. Finally, ""Chappie"" was awarded a much-deserved R-rating from the MPAA, which helped finally solidify some good spirits about the film from me, seeing as it took its idea all the way and exercised its full ability to be creative and gritty.The film is a winning blend of several genres, and should be look onto by those who wouldn't venture out to see such films of the like. Science-fiction fans will likely appreciate it, but, being someone who doesn't normally embrace these kinds of films with open arms and glowing praise, I feel the market who has long felt themselves rundown by the ubiquity of these kinds of films will see the merit and value in a film like this (the kind ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" will most likely bring to someone who has grown weary and fatigued by the onslaught of superhero films). Not only does ""Chappie"" provide some hope for original science-fiction in the near future, it also provides for diversity in multiplexes and a more attractiveness to those who feel outside of the loop on the majority of the particular releases of this genre.",Chappie
23,DKosty123,Active And Brute Picture Of Future Law Enforcement,6,28 February 2016,"I could feel the District 9 thing right away when I started watching this one. Using CNN's Anderson Cooper to start it though told me it was not realistic as Cooper is not a reporter such as he is presented here. The start of District 9 is more serious and goes longer.This plot gets rid of the aliens in District 9 and replaces them with robots and real fools for humans. The serious racial message of District 9 is not in this one at all. In fact, this one has much more light comedy. Chappie the robot does have a lot of Number 5 type humor like the robot hit by lightening many years back in another movie. This time, number 22 is hit by a crooks missile and his advanced brain actually has to be programmed in order to become human like. The creator of police robots fishes number 22 out of the scrap pile and reprograms him with experimental artificial intelligence he has developed which acts just like the human brain. Chappie even has to start out like a little child in order to progress with the experiment.While the action and pace are as good as any movie, there is a big hole in one sequence where Chappie is abandoned and beat up for no really good reason. There are way too many card board characters for this one to be a really great film. Sigoreney Weaver's CEO of the robot company is so stupid that she really could not exist in any real world. At least this film has some imagination. Think the writer of this just did too many things in this one the same as in District 9. This really is just a spin from that one and I think there are plot directions that would be better to follow than this one. It tries to get profound about life and your soul late in the movie but even that message can not really be taken too seriously.The humans presented in this one are more inept than the robot cops who just do not come off well either. It could have been better if the robot cops had been too efficient and distributed too many human faults as that would take a 2 dimensional plot and made it more real to the audience. Instead, like Cooper and CNN, it is just a little too flat.",Chappie
24,KineticSeoul,Not very original,4,28 May 2015,"Despite this movie involving a robot with a consciousness. I found this movie to be quite boring and lacked the depth and humanity it needed to make it work. ""Chappie"" is a very simple story about a robot that is one of a kind that has his own consciousness. And how he gets brought up from a group of hoodlum gang (they aren't really that bad or sadistic or anything like that just a little messed up in the head). Anyways majority of the movie is Chappie the robot with a consciousness stealing and going on robberies, because it just doesn't know any better because of what he learned from the group of people that taught him. I thought this was going to be a movie that dove into the philosophy of robotics a bit and that it would do a good job of putting the audience through the mindset of a robot. With ideals of robotics and morals being tested and such. With Chappie being caught in the middle and playing a big part in the clash. Even though it goes in a direction where it's about a robot with a consciousness learning from his environment and the people around him. It just seemed like it could have been done better with more heart and creativity to it. But it just didn't have any real elements that even tugged on the heartstrings. The main reason that got my interest when it came to the trailer was that it has Hugh Jackman in it. And I absolutely loved the movie ""Real Steel"" which he was in. This movie is just nowhere as good. I think the director Neill Blomkamp is very resourceful seeing what he was able to accomplish with the budget for ""District 9"". And so I guess I am mostly impressed with the what this movie accomplished with it's budget, especially when it comes to the special effects applied to Chappie. However overall this is a forgettable movie, which is only somewhat saved by it having Hugh Jackman in it, but even he didn't really seem to care all that much. It just isn't all that original of a film when it comes to the design to the story which is sort of like a robot version of ""Oliver Twist"" with the design being similar to ""Appleseed"" the manga/anime.4.8/10",Chappie
25,Hellmant,It's cool to see such an excessively violent (R rated) kid's movie!,9,12 March 2015,"'CHAPPIE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new science fiction action/drama flick from Neil Blomkamp; about a police droid, in the near future, that gains consciousness. Blomkamp directed and co-wrote the movie, with his wife Terri Thatchell (who also co-wrote 'DISTRICT 9', with her husband). It's based on Blomkamp's 2004 two minute short film 'TETRA VAAL', and it also features a similar robot design to his 2006 short 'TEMPBOT'. The movie stars Blomkamp's usual partner in crime Sharlto Copley, as the voice of the robot, and it also costars Dev Patel, Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Brandon Auret, Yolandi Visser and Ninja (Ninja and Visser are first time actors, from the South African hip-hop group 'Die Antwoord'). I love the film and think it's a near masterpiece.The movie is set in Johannesburg, in the near future, at a time when violent crime is near obsolete; due to a new robotic police force. When a small gang (played by Ninja, Visser and Cantillo) find themselves in a huge amount of debt, to a local crime lord (Auret), they decide to kidnap the designer of the police droids, Deon Wilson (Patel). They want to force Deon to shut down all the robots; so they can commit a big heist, to raise the money they need. What they don't realize is that Wilson has stolen one of his droids himself, from his employers, in a plan to give it actual consciousness. When the robot comes alive, the criminals then steal the droid, from his maker, and kick Deon out of their hide out. They name it Chappie and devise a plan to have the living droid help them with their big crime. At the same time a rival engineer, named Vincent Moore (Jackman), wants to sabotage the gang's plans; in an effort to capitalize on them and gain funding for his own mechanized killing machines.The movie borrows a lot from other popular sci-fi movies; most notably 'SHORT CIRCUIT' and of course 'ROBOCOP' (more so the 2014 remake). Still it has it's own unique feel and, like all of Blomkamp's movies, it's full of great social commentary and intriguing, well developed, characters. I love Chappie, as a classic robot character, and I think Ninja and Visser make great acting debuts as well; in this movie. Patel is always likable (and very relatable), Weaver once again does what she does best (playing a domineering woman, in yet another sci-fi movie) and it's awesome to see Jackman as an obsessive 'religious nut' bad guy! Blomkamp's directing is once again very stylized and always beautiful to look at. It's also cool to see such an excessively violent (R rated) kid's movie; that's what it feels like to me! I don't think it's quite as classic as 'DISTRICT 9', but it is a slight improvement over 'ELYSIUM'. It's definitely a little ways from a sci-fi masterpiece, of it's own, but I still absolutely love it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o",Chappie
26,Buddy-51,Its eclecticism ultimately becomes its downfall,5,16 July 2016,"The second collaborative effort for writers Neill Blomkamp (who also directed the film) and his wife, Terri Tatchell, ""Chappie"" draws heavily for its inspiration from such previous works as ""E.T"" and ""Short Circuit,"" though it is far less playful and hopeful than either of those two films (though it also channels ""RoboCop,"" which is a little closer in tone). The setting is South Africa in the not-too-distant future where crime has reached epidemic proportions. The cops are currently being assisted by a fleet of mindless robots and androids in an effort to maintain law and order in the country. Deon (Dev Patel) is an inventor working for a major weapons-developer who's come up with what he thinks is the prototype of a droid with an actual consciousness, one that, for the first time in human and scientific history, can be classified as genuine ""artificial intelligence."" The trouble is that, before Deon can inculcate him with a strong moral code and, thus, make a model citizen of him, Chappie (voiced by Sharito Cooley) is kidnapped by a trio of street thugs who want to train him to fight against the droids the government is using against them. Soon, a struggle develops between Deon and the bad guys over what kind of moral being Chappie will turn out to be. ""Chappie"" is filled with moments of dark humor, but those in search of a sophisticated, timely comedy should be forewarned that the humor in the film consists almost entirely of the naive, innocent Chappie talking and dressing like a streetwise ""gangsta'.""Because it's pulling from so many disparate sources, the screenplay never establishes anything close to a consistent tone. Part kid-oriented fantasy, part urban jungle melodrama, part technology-run-amok cautionary tale, and part moral fable about what it means to be human, the film is too childish for adults and too dark and violent for children to leave it with much of an audience. But if you feel you can somehow bridge that gap between conventions and styles, then ""Chappie"" just might be the movie for you.",Chappie

28,Robert_duder,Under-appreciated already but truly a brilliant sci-fi flick,9,10 March 2015,"Neill Blomkamp is a brilliant director period. Granted he doesn't have a ton of experience under his belt yet but his vision, style and mind is unmatched in the science fiction genre. District 9 is easily one of the best films I have ever seen because of one factor. Substance. He takes a mainstream genre like science fiction and he gives it depth, substance, an extreme message, and so much to truly think about. Elysium wasn't quite as good as District 9 but Chappie brings him full circle back to sheer brilliance. Chappie is mesmerizing, heart wrenching, gritty and just really important. This is a film that any good student could debate and discuss and really explore the underlying messages. It is certainly entertaining as well but the intelligence level of this film supersedes it just being a plain old popcorn flick. The marketing of the film was very poor. I'm not sure I even saw a trailer for the film but after District 9 I will watch Blomkamp's films no matter what and he hasn't let me down yet. The social message behind this film is fascinating. Nature vs Nurture, how influences around someone affects their personality and so much more. Its really really terrific.Sharlto Copley was terrific in District 9 and he does a great job playing Chappie the robot. My only question is if the part is great because of him or could another actor have done just as well? I think the script makes Chappie such an amazing character and I'm not sure the performance is all that great. Regardless, its well done. Dev Patel does a great job playing Chappie's maker Deon. He shows a lot of intensity and you see him change throughout the film as he fights for his creation. Hugh Jackman is sort of an odd choice for the ""villain"" of the film. I'm certainly not a fan of his mullet but that has nothing to do with it. Jackman is still good and he brings a certain charisma to the cast. He comes across just a tad campy towards the end but nothing too terrible. The amazing Sigourney Weaver appears in a disgustingly small and underwritten role that could have been so much more. She is great of course but just very underused. The South African rap group Die Antwoord play the low lifes that end up ""raising"" Chappie. Ninja and YoLandi Visser are perfect in their perspective roles. Apparently Ninja was terrible to deal with on set but he adds a distinct very real feel to his role. He is infuriating and yet you almost begin to understand him and feel for him in the same way Chappie does. Jose Pablo Cantillo is also fantastic in his role as their partner. I almost wish his part was bigger too.Blomkamp's style is unmistakable. I felt like some of the scenes were lifted right from District 9 but he definitely uses the slums of South Africa as a template for his films and that's okay. He immerses you in this world and makes you feel like you are right there regardless of the time and age and what's happening. You not only feel like you're watching the story of Chappie but Deon and the others as well. It takes a lot of intelligence to bury messages like this in a terrific story and still make it nearly perfectly entertaining and Blomkamp does that by directing and co-writing the screenplay too. I am quite certain that regardless of how the film does financially due to terrible marketing, that many will see this for what it is. If you're a sci fi fan and you want something truly brilliant then you need to see this right now. You won't be disappointed. Easily one of the best films I've seen so far this year. 9/10",Chappie
29,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Not the most original thing you'll ever see, but done with enough care and depth to wash over this",7,4 April 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In a futuristic South Africa, crime has spiralled out of control, and robotic police-droids have been dispatched to the streets to keep things under control. But a scientist named Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) has developed a droid seemingly capable of human emotion and feeling, who comes to be called Chappie. When Wilson finds himself and his project kidnapped by a gang of renegades with their own agenda, they come to see Chappie as a means to their own ends, while he further develops his own thoughts and feelings. But things all come to a head when embittered soldier Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) tries to use his own monstrous super-droid to eliminate Chappie when he's set up for crimes he did not do.The concept of a machine developing feelings has been a theme explored many times before, but one which never loses it's ability to have an impact on the audience, and to make them care about the story and the characters more than they might have. With this, his latest project, South African director Neill Blomkamp re-ignites the formula again, giving it a more modern edge in more unstable times. In an unseen role, Sharlito Copley manages to elicit this effect from the android in this film, stirring the emotions and giving the film it's more dynamic, driving edge, despite being pretty average in most other ways.As adequate as the film was, I still felt a little short changed by judging a book by it's cover, as the poster to this seemed to promise something absolutely breath-taking, a throw-back to some of the great monster mash up robot films from years ago, and while it's not without it's fair share of exciting action scenes, it still came off as a little under-whelming compared to what could have been. Some other flaws include lead star Patel, who looks a little too young for the role, not to mention some logic/implausibility flaws present.Yes, it's a mish mash of other films that have gone before it, Short Circuit and Robocop springing to mind, but it's all done with just enough flair and heart, despite the flaws, to pass muster. ***",Chappie
30,bowmanblue,A reasonable 'mish-mash' of other films,7,9 March 2015,"Take 'Short Circuit' and mix it with 'Robocop.' Then season the brew with elements from Terminator and a few other sci-fi offerings and you're left with 'Chappie.' However, just because it isn't totally original, doesn't mean it's that bad.It's actually an okay watch. A city is plagued by crime, so they turn to droids to deal with the criminal. One becomes sentient. And we have our movie. It's basically a reworking of 'Short Circuit' as a robot struggles to understand the human world around him, all the time being considered 'less' of a person, simply because most humans can't believe that any droid could ever be as 'alive' as the rest of us. The 'Robocop element' comes in as another branch of the police force is trying to get their own robots out there on the market. Think a (pretty blatantly copied!) ED-209, but one with slightly more weapons and a jet pack.Perhaps it totally wouldn't have worked, had it not been for the decent cast and crew it had behind it. At the helm is Neill (District 9) Blomkamp. Therefore expect good special effects and a real 'gritty' feel to the film. Plus you have his long-standing friend and collaborator, Sharlto Copley, as the robot's voice. Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman are thrown in there for added weight, but their screen time only adds up to a few minutes out of the whole movie. For the most part we're treated to Chappie himself and his 'adopted' family. Now, whereas Johnny 5 (from Short Circuit) was schooled to be nice, Chappie is held (sort of hostage) by a gang of criminals. Therefore, he's schooled in crime – albeit in the most innocent way possible! I found that a little hard to get my head round. The 'hero' of the film was sort of being forced against his will to be bad. And the humans he was surrounded by were villains, therefore they were hardly the sort of people you would want to root for (or even associate with!).Yes, there's some 'character development' and the final – pretty explosive – act was pretty spectacular. Plus there are some moments in there that you probably won't see coming.The major trouble is District 9. Basically, everyone loved it and will rate Chappie against it. No, Chappie is nowhere near as good as District 9, but it's not that bad. Just lower your expectations and you'll be in for a fun time with a few rough edges.",Chappie
31,lesleyharris30,"An Enjoyable Two Hours with a Lovable Lead,",7,30 August 2015,"Chappie is a good movie with a well developed storyline and an impressive cast. It's a very enjoyable movie that boasts some great action sequences, impressive sci-fi and stellar special effects, but the best part of the movie has to be the title character himself, Chappie, he is a very cute and lovable character that I felt an attachment to almost as soon as he begins talking, I also thought the relationship between him and Dev Patel, who delivers a terrific performance, was a very sweet part of the story that I actually enjoyed more than the action and violence. As a story it definitely has its flaws, the worse part being that the villain is very poorly developed, we are always made fully aware of his motives but we never really get to see him truly shine and make us feel like the main characters have completely lost all hope, Hugh Jackman does his best with this character but sadly he is never fully established. I felt like the film had a lot of missed opportunities that could have easily made this an eight for me instead of seven, I thought the relationship between Chappie and Yo-Landi could have been more laid out for its audience, and once the big action sequences begin the film lost its emotional appeal for a reasonably long time, I think it definitely shouldn't have done this and also there was nothing very original or different about the action whatsoever. It certainly has its flaws in story arc, but what Chappie lacks it mostly makes up for with original and likable characters, and I would recommend as a good film to watch on television or Netflix if you're looking for a good sci-fi. A robot originally designed to work for the police force is kidnapped by a gang of criminals and his creator gets him to think and feel for himself.

Based off, Neill Blokamp's short trailer/film Tetra Vaal and set in Johannesburg, in a chaotic near-future, Chappie tells the story of a rogue, police force sentient robot created by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), named Chappie (Voiced by Sharlto Copley) whom trying to find purpose in its short life, while being raised by two criminals, Ninja (Watkin Jones) & Yolandi Visser (Anri du Toit) AKA the real-life, rap group with the same names, Die Antwoord. Only given, a week to live, Chappie discovers both the best and worst of humanity, while also trying to prevent his own demise. While, a lot of people are comparing this film to a mixed between 1987's RoboCop & 1988's Short Circuit 2. I see it, more like 1940's Pinocchio, in a way, that Chappie's pure naïve side shows through his curiosity and friendliness toward everyone he meets, while his more adult side shows in his adopting of urban culture and wielding weapons. The character of Chappie alone makes this one worth the price of admission. The opening of the film tells us that police robot's existence radically alters the world, but what we aren't told is how it came to be this way. I don't know why Blomkamp set Chappie in 2016. Having a cameo from real life reporter, Anderson Cooper at the start of the film does make it seem a bit realistic, but I really doubt: crime will be that bad, that robotics in 2016 will so advice as they portray in the film. That is left up to our imagination for now, but it's very doubtful, that the future will be, like that. The movie might have a Sci-Fi connection to his previous films like 2009's District 9, and 2013's Elysium. You do see some Easter eggs references to the events of District 9, like the bulletproof vest, and foreshadowing references like Hippo, used in Elysium, but it's really hard to connect, these films, in one universe. There are way, too many differences. To call this film, part of a film series, a trilogy, is an understatement. One big complain about this movie is the lack of logic. Nothing in the film, makes much sense. It's doesn't make sense, how a top security company like Tetra Vaal would be so clueless about the building of Chappie. Main character take reprogramming chip home, spends several days with it, and no one bats an eye. Come on! Did nobody else, besides Hugh Jackson's character knew about that? Wouldn't somebody in the office, figure out that one of their robots were missing? Another thing, I don't understand, why Deon would allow a vulnerable sentient to be raise by gun-waving hijackers, even after being threaten to. He just escape, and the crooks let him be. Yet, he doesn't tell, his company about it. I guess, it's for Chappie's safety, but it's really jarring. Chappie is one of those films about artificial intelligence, but itself lacks it. Another big complain is how awkward, the acting, is. Sharlto Copley was a good lead, as the robot. You really get the guiltless robot tone with his voicing. Still, Chappie does have that repeatable reaction that could be a bit annoying. Dev Patel was alright in the role as Deon Wilson, but there were a few stupid things that he says, that made me, want to punch him in the face. The worst thing had to be supporting characters like Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser who behaved very poorly on screen, and off screen. They're so laughable, but not in a good way. I know, they're supposed to be look tough, but likable, but they come across, as unrealistic annoying and ridiculousness. Their act as being ""gangsta"" is a complete joke. It's near verging on racist gangsta stereotypes. The film tries to make them sympathetic criminals surviving on the streets, but most people simply found them to be scumbags who manipulated Chappie into a life a crime. It's not good. The character of Hippo play by Brandon Auret is so bad of an actor, that they felt the need to add subtitles for him. His English is really thick. I really don't see any of them, as realistic criminals. They are absolutely horrifically. Another big disappointment is the performance from Hugh Jackman as the villain, Vincent Moore. Hugh Jackman in the film is just a stick in the mud. He's bland as hell. The way, he dress in the film, remind me more of an Animal Channel host than a scientist. Sigourney Weaver is in the film, as well, but her character doesn't really do anything noticeable. Both actors have talent, but there were very misused. The action is alright for the most part, but it was indeed lacking. There isn't many of those. Without spoiling it, the last action sequence was a bit disappointing. The ending is a bit, too out there. I really couldn't get into the whole resurrection sub-plot. It felt a bit rushed. In a sense, it does ask a good answer, which is fitting for the fundamental question of the film, on what consciousness and what a soul is. Overall: Somewhere, buried in the concept of hardened criminals raising a childlike robot is a good idea for a film. Unfortunately, that idea is not well-delivered here. Some critics were brutal on the film. I glad, that most audience opinions have been much more forgiving. It's not a bad film. It's just need a little more love.",Chappie
37,The-Sarkologist,An exploration of human consciousness,9,14 March 2015,"Well, all I can say is that this latest offering from Blomkamp pretty much puts him into the hall of great directors of the 21st century. Okay, while he may not be an Academy Award winning director, though I personally pay little to no attention to that Hollywood farce (and even then most of the films that I tend to like don't make it anywhere near that crowd, but that doesn't stop me enjoying them). However, when I first heard about this film from a friend I was under the impression that he was trying something a little different from his last two films. However as it turned, especially the poster which shows Chappie carrying a machine gun, I knew I was not going to be disappointed.The movie is set a little into the future where Johannesburg is using robots to supplement their police force. However the creator of the robots is running a side project where he is attempting to create artificial intelligence, which he manages to do but lacks the equipment to test it. So he borrows one of the robots that has been marked for destruction and uploads the program. Unfortunately he is hi-jacked by some gangers who kidnap the robot (who pretty much has the mind of a baby) and attempt to turn him into a member of the gang.While Chappie is not necessarily exploring ideas such as apartheid (as District 9 does) of privilege (as Elysium does), it does try to explore the idea of consciousness and whether our identity is tied to the body that we inhabit and whether it can be moved without changing the nature of who we are. It also explores the idea of artificial intelligence and whether such intelligence can create, in essence, a conscious sole.There is another really interesting aspect to this film, and that is how various parties are all fighting over attempts to influence Chappie. One of the gangers, the self proclaimed leader, simply wants Chappie to assist him with a job, while others, such as the creator, want to see if they can make him more human by developing an appreciation of art and culture. Then we have his mother who nurtures him as if he were a child. Beyond that there are also other antagonists in the film, such as the jealous co-worker whose project as been sidelined because while it may be useful, in a sense it is pretty much overkill.However, back to the idea of consciousness, and I guess the film also asks the question of what makes us human. Is our humanity defined by our appreciation of art and can this appreciation be programmed into a computer. Also, what is it that makes us who we are – are we merely the sum of our experiences, or does our identity go beyond that, and how much choice to we have in determining our identity. Chappie was created to see if he could develop as a human, but his development is interrupted with the kidnapping and he is then simply turned into another security droid, this time to act on the side of the criminals as opposed to the police. However it is also suggested that he can be influenced, such as when he is given those first orders, which results in him refusing to use guns. However, like a child, in many ways he begins as a blank slate and only develops his identity as he begins to move through and experience the world.",Chappie

39,Reno-Rangan,Its a sci-fi age and robot rules.,8,13 August 2015,"It came as a little surprise. Obviously I was looking for this film, but not expected to reach at this level. The film was really brilliant despite the influence of plenty of other films. Yes, the ideas were borrowed from the movies like 'Short Circuit', 'I, Robot', 'RoboCop', Real Steel', ""Bicentennial Man', 'Transcendence', et cetera. But that did not bother me at all. I would call it an inspiration to make a new product out that already existed.It was not completely depended on Dev Patel's role, otherwise woulda been a disaster. Its the Hugh Jackman, even though his character was not on the frontline, because of his presence, the movie was filled with some exciting and thrilling moment. His role was pretty much same to 'Real Steal', but showed in a different shade.Silly concept, even dialogues were so stupid. I don't know, maybe because of the South African accent. But the screenplay was very good. Fast and gets the point quickly than wasting time for buildups. One of the best robot movie and it will be remembered. Looks like the sequel will be more furious and going to be an action packed item, if there will be one. Worth to watch it at least once.7.5/10",Chappie
40,sol-,We are always a product of our environments,7,24 December 2015,"Set in a future in which police robots are the norm, three criminals kidnap one such robot and his inventor, hoping to reprogram the machine to work for them in this thriller from 'District 9' director Neill Blomkamp. There is, however, a lot more going on in the film than just that; it turns out the inventor has managed to make the robot sentient and self-aware. The robot also has a damaged battery that cannot be replaced, so his lifespan is limited. And then there is a rival security worker out to sabotage everything. The film undergoes some wild changes of tone and mood while juggling these plot threads; we are positioned to laugh at Chappie imitating gangster talk and throwing innocent citizens out of their cars, but then the film also begs for serious contemplation on artificial intelligence and how environmental factors determine personality! It is an odd mix to say the least, but there are several superb bits, like Chappie's activation where he emerges like a frightened animal. There is also something pointed in how the three gangsters are all gradually softened by the robot and eventually end up treating it like their own child. This agenda is not at the forefront of the film as much as it could have been though, and as exciting and well coordinated as the action sequences late in the piece are, they forgo the complexities of a robot learning to feel protective of his caregivers and vice versa. Whatever the case, the film has some magnificent motion capture special effects and offers ample food for thought even if it is not quite all one might hope from the director of 'District 9'.",Chappie
41,tomgillespie2002,"Delivers the required thrills and spills, but little else",6,23 June 2015,"Ever since South African director Neill Blomkamp's breakthrough District 9 (2009), great things have been expected. Although I personally believe his debut to be somewhat overrated, paying homage to great sci-fi movies perhaps once too often, it was certainly a breath of fresh air with it's parable of apartheid South Africa and its unconventional anti-hero. His follow-up, 2013's Elysium, was underwhelming, but it was making a point somewhere amidst it's kinky cybernetics and gaping plot-holes. His latest, Chappie, is an improvement, but Blomkamp again fails to live up to wunderkind label.Set in a near-future Johannesburg, the streets are policed by a super-efficient robot force, causing crime rates to plunge and sending criminals scampering whenever they rear their metallic faces. Created by the not-so-shady corporation Tetravaal, headed by an underused Sigourney Weaver, employee and engineering prodigy Deon (Dev Patel) manages to create artificial intelligence and steals a damaged robot headed for the scrap heap to experiment with. However, on his way home he is kidnapped by a group of local gangsters - Ninja, Yo-Landi and Yankie (The Walking Dead's Jose Pablo Cantillo) - who force Deon to programme the droid to help them with a heist that will pay-off a angry kingpin.And so Chappie is born; a robot who must learn everything like a child, albeit at a far advanced speed, and who not only possesses the ability to think and talk, but to create. Yo-Landi plays the role of mother, encouraging Chappie to express himself with art, but Ninja wants to turn him into the ultimate gangster - pimp-roll, bling and casual nose-wipe to end sentences included. But fellow Tetravaal employee Vincent (Hugh Jackman), an ex-solider jealous of Deon's accomplishments, has other ideas, attempting to sabotage Chappie at every turn in order to get his own inferior hulking droid greenlit by the company and sent out into the streets.Chappie received an unfair panning from the critics and underperformed at the box-office. Yet there's plenty to be enjoyed in the film's occasional eccentric streaks, namely in the casting of Ninja and Yo-Landi, members of South African rap group Die Antwoord. They can't act for s**t, but are at least an interesting alternative to the usual science-fiction stock characters, helping make their ridiculous persona's somewhat likable. Chappie himself, played by Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley in motion-capture, has been compared to Jar- Jar Binks in some reviews and comments I've read. While he is sometimes slightly grating, his childish naivety is endearing, and invites sympathy when he is routinely abused and manipulated by the few people around him.Yet Blomkamp seems to struggle with coming up with an original narrative. His films always seem to end up with the hero facing off against some one-note and extremely angry bad guy, pumped up by machinery or a big-ass weapon, and its no different here. It feels like Jackman's character was thrown into the mix for no other reason than to give Chappie a nemesis. Jackman himself, demonstrating one of cinema's all-time horrendous mullets, doesn't convince either. The privatisation of the police and the positive and negatives of tampering with A.I., as well as the struggles of parenthood, are crammed in and rushed over without really answering any of the many questions it poses. As a piece of entertainment, it provides all the thrills and spills required, but any deeper meditations tend to fall flat.",Chappie
42,Floated2,Interesting though could have been better,5,12 June 2017,"Chappie is another futuristic robotic action film by director Neill Blomkamp. Having received success and amounts of praise from his first major studio film District 9, then mild reviews and success from his follow up Elysium, more pressure appeared on his radar for his third film Chappie. This film is not on the level of District 9 nor is better than Elysium as both those films were more intriguing, entertaining and better story telling. Chappie is a decent film as it is entertaining at some scenes, though the film is mild disappointing as it isn't as funny or action packed as it appeared to be, and it's climax is not as great as it could have been. Hugh Jackman appears to be wasted in an odd portrayal as the lead villain, where his character did not appear to have an amount of screen time as intended. Neill Blomkamp has clear and very intriguing overall ideas, though many of them do not come out as planned.",Chappie
43,eddie_baggins,"A whole heap of fun, despite its varied flaws",7,18 March 2015,"Director Neill Blomkamp will perhaps forever have his projects unfairly compared to his outstanding directional debut District 9, it's the downside of having such a memorable and accomplished debut and after his somewhat lacking yet still hugely enjoyable secondary feature Elysium failed to garner much public goodwill, we now find Blomkamp back in South Africa once more and back with an all new form of robot in the guise of the childlike Chappie.With a delayed release here in Australia it's interesting to note just how poor Chappie's reception has been overseas, where America in particular has seen it gross some extremely lowly Box Office figures and an even more worryingly unfavourable critical reception. Taking this into account one would suspect Blomkamp has gone off the deep end but I for one am happy to be able to defend Chappie as a highly enjoyable and often startlingly unique Sci-Fi tale that is not at all dissimilar to an adult ordinated fairy tale with a visual aesthetic akin to a Terry Gilliam futuristic piece, thanks largely to the colourful and graffiti laden input from South African hip-hop duo Die Antwoord.Chappie is a film filled with abundant flaws and lacklustre story telling but it's also a film you can't help but feel a strange sense of admiration for as it seemingly cares very little in adhering to the staples of its genre conventions. The mere casting of Ninja and Yo-landi from Die Antwoord in the films major human roles suggests Blomkamp wanted his film to have a fresh flavour, as it's not as though he can't attract a name actor to a lead role, a fact supported by Elysium's Matt Damon before this and the appearance of Hugh Jackman in a major supporting turn here. Blomkamp is without question an original, District 9 was the undisputable attesting to this, Elysium was the throwaway reminding of it and now Chappie is the embodiment of his giddy childlike enthusiasm to imbue his Sci-Fi worlds with a colour and flavour, that if you're willing to go along with, will create an entertaining and totally enjoyable time at the movies.What frustrates with Chappie the film and Blomkamp the filmmaker here is the fact that you can see more potential than what was realized. Chappie as played by Blomkamp's old friend Sharlto Copley is an interesting and living character yet you can't help but feel there was more to explore within this robot's awakening and most human characters here with particular mention of the increasingly annoying Dev Patel as tech wizard Deon are anything but endearing. Hugh Jackman, sporting the beginnings of a flourishing mullet, has fun with tough guy Vincent but the film's most original and interesting players are Ninja and Yo-landi as street wise gangsters. This is not to say these two possess a great handle of the acting medium, actually it's very far from it, but they give Chappie an unpredictable nature, a Redbull infused energy that helps the film become such an adrenaline filled rush on more than one occasion, especially when the action ramps up to 11.It might not have the heart and soul District 9 had or the huge budget spectacle that Elysium possessed but Chappie is another hugely entertaining and often highly unique Sci-Fi yarn by Blomkamp. With news recently announced of Blomkamp's involvement in the Aliens franchise, on the back of this effort I for one am still strongly in favour of him taking the reigns, in what will hopefully be another hugely enjoyable trip to worlds unknown.3 and a half PS4 consoles out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Chappie
44,leonblackwood,Loved the robot but the acting was awful!,6,20 July 2015,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie but the acting was pretty poor and I thought that Hugh Jackmans character went a bit overboard. The film is set in the there near future and there are robots in the police force, helping them to cut down crime. When one of the robots gets severely injured, he is set to be crushed but the promising programmer of the robots, comes up with a new chip so he rescues the robot so he can use him to test the new chip, against the organisations wishes. On the way back from collecting the robot, he gets kidnapped but a bunch of thugs that want him to give them the switch to turn of the robots so they can commit crimes to pay of a huge debt. They then find the robot (Chappie) in the boot of the programmers car so they threaten him to programme Chappie so he can join there gang and help them to commit crimes. He then installs the new chip into Chappie and he gains the ability to think and feel for himself but he is in the baby stages of his life so the thugs bring him up as there own. The programmer tries to teach him right from wrong but the head of the gang teaches him violence and theft so they can get the money to pay off there debt. The programmer is also fighting against another programmer who can't get his robot off of the ground because of funding and the fact that the existing robots are welcome in the police force. Once the rival programmer finds out about Chappie, he makes it his mission to destroy the robots, just to prove that his robots are the best. Personally, I wasn't that impressed with the storyline but the robot was brilliant. It made me laugh when he was acting like he was down with the crew and the car jacking scenes were also amusing. There are some emotional scenes, like when his mum was reading to him in bed but it really needed some decent actors to make it more emotional. Personally, I think it was a bit too close to Robocop, especially when the big robot came into play but it's definitely worth a watch, just to see the mannerisms of the robot. Watchable!Round-Up: With big names like Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver in the cast, the director really didn't get the best use out of them. Jackman, who was sporting an awful haircut, was going way overboard to prove that his robot was the best and Dev Patel wasn't the best choice for his role. Sigourney Weaver is hardly in the movie, which is a shame and the rest of the cast was really awful, except for Chappie of course. Apart from that, the CGI is brilliant and the robot looked like he was really there. It did remind me a lot of District 9 and Robocop but I liked the emotional scenes between Chappie and his new found family. The director, Neil Blomkamp, has only made another 2 movies in his career, which are District 9 and the Elysium and at 35 years old, he really can't complain about his career so far. He made a healthy profit from this movie but his real claim to fame has to be District 9, which was his first movie. Sharlto Copley has become famous from his movies and he voiced Chappie very well. It was a bit of a weird ending, when Chappie started to turn people into robots but the action scenes were quite impressive and you can't fault it for originality. Budget: $49million Worldwide Gross: $102millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/sci-fi/thrillers about a newly programmed robot who gets brought up by a gang who shows him how to commit crimes. 6/10",Chappie

With Chappie, Blomkamp's stunning eye for visual effects is in full force, and he even gets some emotions out of his protagonist. Unfortunately, more often than not, that sentiment often comes through as corniness. So despite it's noble personality and impeccable visuals, Chappie's unbalanced tone and shaky writing keep it from greatness. Chappie is a sentient robot caught in a battle between his creator, a jealous weapons manufacturer, and a gang of bumbling criminals. Chappie's arc between these factions is kind of sloppy, with his knowledge level changing depending on the needs of the story. However, he's maybe the only character with any real humanity; everyone else is more a bad plot-device than a character. The ""gangsters"" are some of the dumbest and most annoying characters around, like a group of preteens trying to act tough. Weaver is horribly miscast and clearly out of her element. Even Jackman's natural talent and charisma can't make his one-dimensional, completely unreal and laughably predictable villain work. Other than Patel, who manages some pathos, the film clearly has a low opinion of humanity. Not that Chappie is completely devoid of compelling beats; thoughts on intelligence and humanity and playing-God abound, and at times even succeed. Unfortunately, these thoughts are usually spoken at us instead of simply existing within the film for the audience to pull out. Cool visuals and sympathetic protagonists aside, Chappie isn't as important or as good as it wants to be.",Chappie

Along the way, his lessons grow decidedly human, as he falls in with a small gang of criminals and inherits their speech, style, and sense of political outrage. I'd file it right alongside Neil Blomkamp's first two efforts, District 9 and Elysium, in that it's a technically stunning dose of conceptual wonder, grounded with a strong topical message, that just so happens to fall into the framework of a terribly simple, overplayed basic storyline. It's easy to see the promise in this work, the intense seed of morality that Blomkamp has tried so desperately to inject into a pop sci-fi shell, but for all those lofty aspirations it feels astonishingly mundane. He doesn't squeeze much from his cast - Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver are both unusually flat - and the constant stream of Die Antwoord propaganda is a bit befuddling. On one hand, the musical duo has legit street cred that makes the picture come across as more authentic and unusual, but on the other it's a great big reach to spotlight them as serious leading actors. As far as technical showcases go, this is top-notch. It really feels like the mechanical creatures are right there on the set, living, breathing and performing alongside their human counterparts. It looks like nothing else on the market, too, with fascinating art direction (and universally absurd hairstyling) that outright demands attention. A shame there's really so little to it, though, beyond a predictable set of general developments and a hollow, silly grand finale.",Chappie
53,alindsay-al,a below average film that left me bitterly disappointed,4,22 May 2015,"I am a big fan of Neil blomkamph and I was so excited to see his newest film chappie but now I have seen it I am hugely disappointed with a film that could have been better and in my opinion if done right could have been a contender for film of the year. The plot of the film sees a young inventor create the first living AI who then gets kidnapped by a group of gangsters who attempt to turn chappie into a criminal for their own gain. Now yes I know the trailer showed a different plot then that but I thought I would be honest and give you the real plot description so if you see chappie you not what film your really seeing. Now sharleto copley plays chappie and he is easily the best part of this movie, he got the mannerisms right and got the idea of chappie really right. You feel sorry for chappie because of the situation he is put in and you want to help him out instead of seeing him put into the situations that he is put in for this movie. Now dev Patel, Hugh jackman and Sigourney weaver are all good performers they all have something in common in this film and that is that they are completely underutilized. You don't buy into any of their characters or their motivations which in the end ruins what could have been a really interesting concept because the film wanted to show chappie as a gangster. And then we get to the two gangsters played by a south African band who are two of the most annoying bad actors/actresses I have ever seen and the problem is that these are bad people but the film tries to make you care about them which you never do. Now one good thing about the story is that you do care about chappie and you really want to see him taken out of this situation but as I have mentioned before they got everything else wrong which makes you not care about any of the characters in the film and not care about the film. The script is pretty bad with there being very little interesting dialogue and we'll rounded characters for the film to use that could interest the audience. There are a few decent action scene it is true but I am fed up of seeing blomkamph use the same locations for all of his films. It was great in district 9, I accepted it in Elysium but this is just one step too far and worries me that he is afraid to step out of his comfort zone. I had incredibly high hopes for this film and it didn't deliver so you don't really need to see this film especially if you weren't already interested in it.",Chappie
54,estebangonzalez10,Closer to Elysium than District 9 but still manages to entertain despite its flaws.,6,10 March 2015,"""Don't let people take away your potential Chappie.""Chappie is Neil Blomkamp's highly anticipated follow up to Elysium and District 9. His first film has become a favorite for science fiction fans, but Elysium failed to connect with many audiences. Neil himself said that he felt he messed up with Elysium, but I still found it engaging despite its flaws. Chappie has a similar style and feeling to his other movies where he introduces us to a dystopian society and presents a rather gritty glimpse of the world. His films are always fun to look at, but his screenplays seem to have some flaws. The greatest problem with Chappie is that it doesn't seem to establish its tone or target audience. At times it seems very cartoonish appealing to a younger audience and very reminiscent to the heart and cheesiness of Short Circuit and then during other moments it becomes dark and violent reminding us of scenes from Robocop. This tonal shift doesn't work well, but the title character is so appealing that I was invested in the film despite not caring too much for the rest of the characters. Blomkamp creates these dystopian worlds and uses science fiction elements to make some sort of critique towards our society. His films tend to play out as metaphors and at times they are a bit too obvious like in Elysium where he criticizes the enormous gap between classes where the rich get the best medical aid and the poor are left out to dry. In District 9 his criticism was geared towards the division of classes as well as racism. Here, I felt like Chappie played out as a sort of metaphor on religion where you have this conscious robot created by mis maker, but when raised by the wrong people he drifts and wastes his potential. There are several themes scattered throughout the movie where Chappie questions the decisions of his creator that I found similar to the questions that religion raises at times about our humanity and purpose in life. There is also an underlying message of the dangers of militarization as you have Hugh Jackman's character wanting to implement human controlled robots with heavy machinery in the police force. I may be looking too far into this movie, but those were my initial perceptions. Dev Patel plays Deon, one of the engineers responsible for creating these police droids who are replacing humans in the force. He develops a program that will give the robots a consciousness of their own, but when his boss (played by Sigourney Weaver) doesn't give him permission to test the robots, he decides to program one on his own. Just when he does this, he is kidnapped by a group of gangsters (Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser, and Jose Pablo Cantillo) who want him to shut off the robots so they can execute a heist. Seeing that he doesn't have the power to do so, they end up taking the robot, which Yolandi names Chappie and raising it themselves so they can use it to their advantage. In the meantime, there is a former military named Vincent (Hugh Jackman) working for the same company as Deon who is trying to get his project approved which consists of a human controlled robot with far advanced weaponry. Chappie is voiced extremely well by Sharlto Copley who also does some of the robot's movements and gestures. He is the highlight of the film, but as much as I enjoyed the character of Chappie and watching him learn and experience things like a child I found several flaws with the screenplay and the rest of the characters. The gangsters are portrayed as these sort of unlikable characters who we are later supposed to care about. They are actually in this film more than Patel, Jackman, and Weaver, and it does become a problem because the film begins to shift in tone. Poor decisions are made such as the idea of letting Deon go after being kidnapped knowing that he knows who these people are and where they live. Hugh Jackman's character is very poorly developed and does some things in the company that no one else seems to mind, but I know wouldn't be tolerated in a normal work setting. There are many decisions like this that don't make much sense, but that only serve the purpose of moving the story from one point to the next which the film does rather quickly. Even the security measures in the company are very dubious and the more you think about the holes in the plot the less you will enjoy it, but as long as you are engaged with Chappie's character and his development you might be entertained and forget the problems the film has. I still had a good time, but I can see why audiences might not care much for this. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Chappie
55,iquine,An Adorable RoboCop,6,30 November 2017,"(Flash Review)I primarily chose to watch this for the Hans Zimmer soundtrack, which did not disappoint and energized many scenes. This movie attempts to portray the meaning of life by personifying a robot with artificial intelligence installed and a friendly voice. Chappie was part of a robotic police department in a gloomy future. He was badly damaged in a battle and marked for destruction. An AI engineer recovers the robot and installs his AI prototype software into it. Later kidnapped by hoodlums, Chappie is being taught wrong morals in the mean streets. Will he get rescued by his 'maker', will he be trained to do the bidding of violent thieves or learn to stand up to them? A couple messages of the movie are that humans can be very bad life forms as this learning Chappie AI is more selfless than many real humans and also how easy it can be to corrupt innocent people. Overall, the movie's tone was awkward as it was an odd mix of happy moments are rather bloody violence. Arguably a few plot holes or strange character decisions but it did a great job at giving a grubby robot a wide spectrum of real emotions.",Chappie
56,jimbo-53-186511,"Blomkamp perhaps took a bit of a risk here, but it was definitely a risk worth taking",9,28 August 2015,"OK first and foremost Chappie (on the surface at least) is not terribly original as a concept - it clearly borrows from films such as Robocop, Short Circuit, I Robot, Terminator & Pacific Rim. However, for me, although Blomkamp has clearly 'lifted' ideas from other films he has done enough here to make this film very much his own beast.The thing I really liked about this film is that despite the fact that this film is set up to feel like a film that focuses on AI, Blomkamp very much makes it feel like a human story. Chappie is basically an AI with a human brain and he is a learning computer and much like a 'learning' computer he can be manipulated - which essentially acts as a central arc to the story. Another aspect that I liked about this film is that Blomkamp developed Chappie in such a delicate way that I never saw him as a machine, but actually as a human being - yes I know that was the point, but Blomkamp develops the story in such a sensitive way that I found myself really caring for Chappie (even when he goes off the rails you always know that he is being mislead rather than being a bad AI).The villains of the piece also hate Chappie at the start and merely manipulate him into being a bad-ass so that he can help them with a heist in order to pay off a debt to some heavies (undoubtedly a poorly explained and much weaker aspect of the story), but again even the heavies start to make emotional connections to Chappie - the female ringleader being the mother provided some warm exchanges. The idea that physically he's a fully grown machine, but with the mind of an infant makes it very easy for the audience to get on side with Chappie - the scene where Chappie evades Hugh Jackman's character is a good example of this. There's also a scene where the gang leave Chappie at the side of the road and allow a gang to attack him as they think he's a police officer. Due to good writing, I found that I cared for Chappie and found the scene where he is being attacked to be quite heart-rending. For this aspect to work showed good writing and good character development from Blomkamp.The film also provides many humorous moments such as when Chappie goes bad and you see him dressed up in all the bling and him uttering the word F*ckmother repeatedly. None of this is ever crass due to the nature of the story and these scenes merely act as a bit of comic relief.The performances across the board are pretty good with Patel being a particularly strong link whereby he's a nerdish type for the most part with a tougher edge when required. Jackman is the other recognisable face here and is OK (although he seems to be sporting a terrible haircut here). Sharlto Copley has worked a lot with Blomkamp and is merely a voice here, but as a 'voice' he is still probably the strongest component to this film and really brings Blomkamp's creation to life. Sigourney Weaver is in the film for about 10 minutes and does very little here, but then again what has she got to prove now?Chappie is an excellent film that's definitely worth watching. Blomkamp gets everything he can out of Chappie and creates a human AI that the audience can care for coupled with a strong story. After the rather mediocre Elysium, Blomkamp once again shows that he's taking a step in the right direction (he comes close to the brilliance of District 9 here) and is certainly proving to be a very interesting filmmaker.",Chappie

58,3xHCCH,Robotic Miseducation,6,5 March 2015,"In Johannesburg in a future time, robots called Scouts have replaced the human police force. These efficient Scouts were developed by the young genius Deon Wilson. His rival in the company is war-freak ex-soldier Vincent Moore who is trying to push his own creation, the big, mean fighting machine he calls Moose. Moore wanted nothing more than to discredit Wilson by fair means or by foul.One day, Wilson and a damaged Scout #22 (which Deon had enhanced with his experimental human-like artificial intelligence) were abducted by drug-dealers who desperately needed to pay off a $20M debt. Much to Wilson's annoyance, the low-lifes call #22 the undistinguished name Chappie. Worse, they train him in the violent ways of the 'hood in order to help them pull off a major heist.Like director Neill Blomkamp's previous film ""District 9"", his latest film once again highlights his home country of South Africa. Aside from the Johannesburg setting, his favorite actor Sharlto Copley is again in the cast. This time Copley is playing the titular Scout Chappie via motion capture. Copley tended to exaggerate the child-like demeanor and the innocent voice by which he communicates his thoughts. Some of his lines were cringe-worthy in their over-sentimentality.Moreover, for the key roles of the husband-and-wife gangsters whom Chappie learned to call his Daddy and Mommy, Blomkamp casts members of the local hip hop group Die Antwoord, even using their real names Ninja and Yolandi. I felt this was a major misstep as these two neophyte actors obviously were not up to the challenge their roles demanded. The way these two were delivering their dialogues were clearly and distractingly amateurish.The characters of Dev Patel (as Wilson) and Hugh Jackman (as Moore) were pretty one-dimensional. Patel plays a character we have seen him play before, an idealistic good guy. The way his character was written was nonsensical in many of his decisions and actions. Jackman on the other hand, was clearly enjoying his rare chance to play bad guy, and was overacting to the hilt with evil relish. Sigourney Weaver was hardly even seen as the CEO of the weapons company these two guys worked for, so casting her was inconsequential.The story draws from several other Artificial Intelligence films we have seen before, especially those where the robot actually becomes human- like. There was a bit too much going on, and furthermore it was weighed down by its own excessive melodrama, which may become mawkish. I liked what happened at the end, despite that it seemed to be impossible to pull off in the long term. The importance of proper influence and education of minors is also emphasized and I liked that as well.",Chappie

60,TdSmth5,Blomkamp does robocop and does it well.,8,26 July 2015,"In South Africa in the future robots patrol the streets. They are the first in line for any dangerous situation, followed by human cops. Unit 22 is one that is prone to suffer the effects of violence. Here it is quickly repaired and sent back on its way to a drug deal gone wrong. Police steps in to clear the situation but unit 22 finds itself on the wrong end of an RPG. The corporation named Tetravaal that builds these robots decides to decommission unit 22 and crush it.As it turns out though, Deon the scientist that developed the robots is now working feverishly on AI when he's at home and finally he succeeds. Now he needs a robot to install the AI. He wants to use unit 22 but his boss shuts down the idea. So he steals the broken robot. That very moment though he's ambushed by the drug gangster from before and abducted. We learned earlier that since the drug deal went wrong, they have to come up with 20 million or will be killed. So their idea is to grab someone from Tetravaal to obtain a robot that will help them commit crimes.So under these condition, Deon is forced to give consciousness to unit 22. But it's ""mentally"" a newborn with amazing learning skills. Deon leaves to return the next day and our gangsters take on the role of educating unit 22, now called Chappie. There are three gangsters, a girl and two guys, she is involved with one of them. She will take on the role of a mother to Chappie. While her guy wants him to become a killing machine, while the other guy is a bit more humane in his approach to turning Chappie into a gangsta. Deon in turn visits Chappie, identifies himself as his maker and tries to teach him morality, not to commit crimes and to never break a promise.But there's a problem. Robots have their one-life battery integrated into their bodies. Once the battery dies so does the robot and Chappie only has a few days left. The gangster guy gets impatient. There's no time for childhood. So he decides that it's time for Chappie to learn the streets. He dumps him in a nasty neighborhood in front of some gangsters who nearly lynch Chappie. But then Vincent shows up and grabs Chappie. Vincent is Deon's competitor at Tetravaal. He has developed a project called Moose--giant mech robots that he wants the company to develop but his boss isn't interested and neither are police departments. He has a prototype ready in case all hell breaks lose. Now he has to break all hell lose. To do that he needs a key to reprogram the robocops. That key currently is in Chappie. He grabs the key, breaks Chappie's arm and throws him off the van.Chappie limps back home where he gets a new arm. By now Vincent has reprogrammed all robocops to short-circuit. Crime erupts everywhere and Vincent gets the go-ahead to deploy Moose. His first target: Deon and Chappie, who at this point will have to man-up or face destruction. But he doesn't just fight, he has to discover a way to overcome the imminent battery failure. He'll have to figure out a way for his consciousness to survive death.Chappie starts with a scene similar to District 9 and there are some similarities. If you like Blomkamp's style, you'll enjoy Chappie. I love his style and writing so I really enjoyed Chappie. The silly name, the silly movie posters, and the trailer didn't help this movie. They presented it as a relentless tearjerker, which it is in part, unfortunately. But it is so much more. It's got great robot action, but not enough, amazing effects just like District 9, and a rich story. Familiar Blomkamp themes are there: innocence and the loss of innocence, humanity's inhumanity, seemingly invincible human immorality. There are social issues, like South Africa's poverty, gangsters, drugs, crime. But there's also the issue of AI and the transcendence of death via technology. This has been the theme of other movies, but none handles as well and intelligently as in this movie. Of course it's not perfect. It tries too hard and too often to shed a tear. It could have used some more action particularly because Blomkamp knows how to film action like no one else. None of the gangsters are actors, and it shows. But then again, the South African world that Blomkamp likes to present is such a strange world filled with odd humans. So for those of us who haven't been to Jo-burg, we wonder whether that's how people are and talk over there or just what is going on. For a movie like this to work logical shortcuts are always taken and it's best not to worry about whether it all makes sense or to what extent it is realistic.Nevertheless, Chappie gives you a good-looking fast paced, exciting movie with a great story and a lot to think about. It is yet another success from one of the most daring and original writer/directors around.",Chappie
61,s3276169,Sci fi at its best,10,14 May 2015,"It would not be too much of an exaggeration to call Chappie the best sci fi of 2015 (thus far). This is a highly original, pleasantly eccentric take on the intelligent robot as life form story line. The robot lead Chappie is many things we are all too familiar with as people and a few things we should be more often but consistently fail to be. Chappie is a very human story in spite of the its technological overtones and its all the better for it. Its easy to relate to Chappie on different emotional levels, sometimes introspective, insightful, innocent, sad and at times very funny. There is a good amount of action and a solid pace that runs through this film too. Its never, ever boring. Combine that with quality acting and you have a real winner in this film. Ten out of ten from me.",Chappie
62,peterp-450-298716,"A trashy cyber spectacle with flashy action, a comfortable pace and fine SE's which make Chappie's look lifelike.",7,1 July 2015,"What do you mean, ""reprogram him""? Don't play dumb! You know exactly what we mean. Turn that robot into the illest gangsta on the block.The number of robots used in a science fiction is uncountable. Some of them can easily be classified under the label ""A sad, technical case"". R2D2 in ""Star Wars"" was a pathetic robot most of the time. Twiki from ""Buck Rogers"" was a helpless phenomenon. David from ""AI"" was a terribly sad cyborg with the sole desire to become a real boy. Even Ava in ""Ex Machina"" was a sad piece of electronics searching for freedom. But ""Chappie"" (so called because allegedly he was ""a happy chappie"") easily beats them all when it comes to pettiness. I almost fell sorry for him. For the first time the gloomy existence of a robot was displayed. Doom and gloom all over the place. Chappie the outcast who began his career as an intervention robot to protect the civilian population against the ever rising crime, and whose final destination became the scrap heap after another impact of an explosive. And he ends up as a helpless artificially intelligent robot in the midst of a group of gangsters who start educating this childlike electronic device to become a gangsta. Just so he can help out in repaying a debt.The last year there were quite some movies about artificial intelligence and the emergence of a consciousness in mechanical and electronic creations. ""The Machine"", ""Automata"" and ""Ex Machina"" are recent films using this main theme. The ability to transfer one's consciousness to a storage medium or an operating system such as in ""Transcendence"" is the other part which is subject to speculation. That's the leitmotiv throughout this cyberpunk story of Neill Blomkamp, the creative director from South Africa who tried to convey a socially critical message in ""Elysium"". Personally, I thought ""Elysium"" was a pretty good movie (I haven't seen ""District 9"" though). To quote myself : ""A first-rate SF with extremely titillating images with a social message and mixed with a touching theme that calls for a happy ending. "". Obviously I was looking forward to ""Chappie"".Visually it looks pretty decent. ""Chappie"" itself is one elaborated robot. Just look at the eyes formed by small pixel-like animations on two screens. A kind of extended ""Short Circuit"" robot, but without caterpillar tracks. No human appearance, but ultimately there are some kind of human feelings inside that metal body. Unfortunately, the similarity to the story of ""Robocop"" is a little bit too obvious. The rivalry between Deon (Dev ""Slumdog Millionaire"" Patel) and Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) was also used in Verhoeven's film. Deon is the designer of the successful robots like Chappie. And Vincent is trying (in a somewhat violent way) to impose his design called ""Moose"", a machine controlled by a human operator. The similarities between the ""Moose"" and the ED-209 are striking. The inevitable clash is more realistic, looks flashier and more action-packed than in ""Robocop"", which is again a plus.There's one thing that leaves a lot to be desired. The interpretations. Dev Patel was an excellent choice for the naive, nerdy Deon. But Jackman looked more like a Michael Dundee, with his khaki shorts, participating in an ""Indiana Jones"" movie. The only thing missing was a fat cigar in his mouth. Him being the developer of such a sophisticated technology, seemed utterly impossible. Sigourney Weaver also played a meaningless small role as Michelle Bradley, the hard-hitting CEO of Tetra Vaal, who I'm sure has an impeccable career path, but still sweeps aside Deon's proposal to install an update so the existing robots could grow a consciousness. As CEO, I would at least form a work-group to research that proposal. And then we have the gang of criminals. Probably I'll sound old fashioned now, but I'd never heard of the South African rap group ""Die Antwoord"". They are probably excellent when it's about rapping. The acting part though was something else. But despite their lack of experience and the amateurish look, they did a fine job as educators for Chappie and as low-skilled rabble that pushes the poor robot on the wrong track.In hindsight this was an entertaining film where action and brutal violence was mixed with touching and even humorous passages. Although the latter actually is pure laughing at ""Chappie"". Aside from ""Chappie"" being composed of electronic and mechanical components, the reactions and the course of action still looks human. A pathetic robot in the hands of a few half-idiots whose own education failed. And despite the deep philosophical approach and serious themes, this film was not a boring affair full of intricate digressions. A trashy cyber spectacle with flashy action, a comfortable pace and fine SE's which make Chappie's look lifelike and after a while you actually forget you're watching at a computer animation.

63,Agent10,Certainly better than I thought it would be,7,28 December 2020,"So let's start with the obvious. I like Die Antwoord. Their music is different, I like raving to it after a long day of hearing ""Muzak"" at work, but damn why did they have to be such a central feature to the film? It's jarring and gets old after a while. I wish they had played characters rather than dystopian versions of their stage personas. Plus if you are gonna plaster their music all over the place at least play I Fink U Freeky (unless I missed it). On to the rest of the review.Chappie asks a lot do big questions in the first half of the film, and they make for an interesting narrative. A chattel industry of robots being used to aid in the shutdown of crime in Johannesburg. They could have sparked some debate about police militarization but I doubt they were thinking about this in 2015. The other big question is that can we trust an artificial intelligence to determine ""morality"" and ""objectivity"" in a police capacity better than humans? The film firmly says no, for it is easily made clear that ""human intelligence"" is rife with bad ethics and morality. Talk about unintentionally being ahead of the curve on that one.We touched on some other parts such as media overexposure, deification and crime, but it got quickly lost as the movie started rushing through a lot of these subplots. Juggling is a hard sport, and possibly simplifying the script would have aided in a smoother narrative. For example, as great as Hugh Jackman was, he could have been removed and the whole ""Moose"" subplot would have been just a tale of an expensive experiment on the back burner rather than jealousy fueled one-upmanship. It would have been cool if it had been mentioned but we never saw the Moose until it was unleashed. A lot of things could have been done but perhaps adding some more time to the movie to allow for better deconstruction of these themes would have helped.Chappie is a pretty well made movie both stylistically and plot wise. With some generic turns that didn't make much sense it still had a decent narrative. The robot effects are especially great and I loved the callbacks to the original Robocop in regards to the robot voices and the Moose.I certainly enjoy Blomkamp's type of sci-fi but he tends to leave the wrong answers as the ending, much like with Elysium. Interesting stuff to think about though.",Chappie
64,valleyjohn,This didn't make me a happy Chappie,4,31 May 2015,"Chappie is Neill Blomkamp's third film , all of which are robot related and for me it seems his films are getting progressively worse. District 9 was a good film because it was something new. Alysium was more of a Sci fi movie and was OK . Blomkamp has gone back to his South African roots with Chappie but it's definitely no District 9 . This is the story of Chappie the police droid who is given a mind of his own by his maker but is then kidnapped by Johannesburgs underworld to commit crimes. I found this nauseating and I couldn't wait for this film to end. I think Blomkamp attempted to make the audience feel sorry for Chappie and make him the only one with human feelings but he failed miserably. All he did was make Chappie look like a woose. I couldn't wait for the pathetic machine's batteries to fail , he was so annoying , as were ALL the human characters. There is something about the south African accent that annoys me too and to have a robot with the same accent didn't help. The special affect are OK but nothing you haven't seen many times before. Give this a miss.",Chappie
65,truemythmedia,Better than District 9,8,7 January 2020,"I was a big fan of ""District 9"" from the moment I saw it in theaters. Unfortunately, Blomkamp's next outing ""Elysium"" (2013) was poorly received and, in general, a complete mess of a film. When Blomkamp's next movie ""Chappie"" was slated for release, I was pretty excited because of my love for ""District 9"" but felt it wise to temper that excitement considering ""Elysium."" As the reviews began trickling in and people I knew started seeing it, I got the feeling that the consensus was that it wasn't very good. With only so much time and money at my disposal during that period of my life, I decided to skip it.O Boy, did I make the wrong choice. In fact, I think I might like ""Chappie"" more than ""District 9.""This film, while I found it incredibly moving, is not exactly an original outing for Neill Blomkamp. Structurally the film is very similar to ""District 9."" We get some incredibly well done world building which explains how the main novelty of the film, in this case a robotic police force, came to be and also the ways that it has affected various people groups and their opinions of that novelty. Then, we get some inciting incident brought on by a naive individual transgressing in some way.
Next, some soul searching and personal growth as large corporate interests are trying to take advantage of the new revelations brought on my the inciting incident,. In this case, The corporation seeks to destroy Chappie because of the liability he presents to them. Finally, we arrive at a bittersweet ending which culminates in a large action sequence or two.I can definitely understand why, if someone connects to ""District 9"" they may not feel the need or attraction for this film since it has so many similar beats. For me, however, I think I prefer ""Chappie"" not because any of the above mentioned similarities but because of the thematic difference in the films.Thematically, ""Chappie"" focuses primarily on a compressed view of human development in the form of an incredibly powerful Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) who goes through those stages incredibly quickly. As a result, I found that it connected with me on a far more individual human level than ""District 9"" which focuses primarily on group dynamics and prejudices. In that film, I am already on the 'side' of the film saying that the refugees need to be treated with respect and understanding so it all has a bit of a 'preaching to the choir vibe' that felt, to me, more like someone saying 'don't you see this is wrong?' over and over for a couple hours, albeit in an incredibly entertaining and layered way, even though I already agreed with them.With ""Chappie,"" I don't feel like there are sides that I am being asked to be on or grow out of and into another. Maybe that's because I'm reading too much into the mind of Blomkamp's intentions in ""District 9"" but I think it's because he had grown since making that movie. ""Chappie"" Feels more like a meditation, at times, on the mysteries of what it means to be human. Nature and nurture, personal responsibility and societal responsibility, self determination and respect for the freedoms of others; all are deftly handled in a film which, from the previews, looks more like and action thriller with a bit of heart.Another reason that I like this film so much is its treatment of the characters. Don't get me wrong, Wikus from ""District 9"" is a brilliant, richly developed, complicated character whose arc is one of the most interesting parts of that film. ""Chappie"" however is that times 5 since every character feels more fleshed out and powerfully realized. This is certainly due to some fine writing and directing, but also is helped tremendously by a larger, more talented and experienced cast.Instead of a standard White Guy CEO as the villain we get Sigourney Weaver (""Alien,"" 1979). Instead of a by the numbers generic mercenary we get Hugh Jackman (""Logan,"" 2017) as a jealous rival engineer (who has power armor.) Dev Patel ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" 2008) is tapped to play Chappie's creator/father/god and Sharlto Copley (""Hardcore Henry,"" 2015) performs a great bit of voice acting and motion capture as Chappie but the real standouts for me are Chappie's foster parents played by Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser of the South African Rap/Rave group Die Antwoord. These poor, disorganized, hardened gangsters will have you looking at everyone you encounter and asking 'what kind of parents must that person have had?'All in all, I was happy to add ""Chappie"" to my list of modern Sci-Fi classics and am certain I'll be revisiting it for years to come. If you are a sci-fi fan and haven't gotten around to this one yet, it's time.",Chappie
66,a_chinn,"Blomkamp delivers more smart sci-fi, but this time with more heart",7,10 December 2017,"Another smart science fiction film from writer/director Neill Blomkamp (""District 9"" and ""Elysium""). This story is set in Blomkamp's home country of South Africa, where the story has police forces now primarily consisting of new robotic police officers built by a private contractor. The scientist behind the robots wants to further his research by improving the artificial intelligence of his creation, essentially creating a super smart self aware child that he can teach. The company president, Sigourney Weaver, doesn't like the project so the scientist decides to run his experiment off-site with stolen parts, except that he's highjacked by a street gang who force him to build his robot and then raise the child-like robot to be a gansta super criminal. Much like Blomkamp's other films, this one has a clever and original story premise, but takes it much deeper. The film on the surface is an action packed story of corporate greed and the moral/ethical implications of AI, but ""Chappie"" has a much deeper subtext beyond that. At it's core, it's a story of nature vs. nurture and hooks the audience on a human level, particularly for anyone who's every raised a child. The responsibility and the decisions one has to make in how you want your child to view the world are immediately identifiable to any parent watching this film. Where the film falters is a subplot involving a competing scientist at the same company, played by Hugh Jackman, who wants to sabotage the police robot program to swing Weaver's support for his more tank-like security droid. That part of the story felt like a retread of the Robocop vs. ED 209 plot line from ""Robocop"" and was nowhere as interesting as the more human of drama happening around the raising of this childlike robot. Overall, despite it's flaws, ""Chappie"" works on a simple entertainment level, but also works on an intellectual level if you're looking for something smarter than your average sci-fi summer blockbuster.",Chappie
67,masonsaul,Good sci-fi,6,14 June 2020,"Whilst not as good as it could have been and not without some plot holes, Chappie is still good sci-fi that's reasonably emotional and enjoyable. Sharlto Copley and Dev Patel are both great and Hugh Jackman is really good which makes up for Ninja's weak performance. The visual effects are really impressive but dip in quality during the finale. It's well paced and well filmed and Neill Blomkamp's direction is good. The music by Hans Zimmer is excellent.",Chappie
68,TheOneThatYouWanted,8 out of 10 kinda deal but rounding up to offset the ravers,10,8 February 2017,"This is my second time watching this film; the first time being when it came out. That right there tells you something, it's good. This is the third in the Neil Blomkamp ""future trilogy"", and possibly the best depending on your tastes. I think this is my favorite, Elysium would have been my favorite if it wasn't for the horrible acting from the mother/girlfriend opposite Matt Damon. Anyway, I digress. This film is set in a not too distant future and is about a lone engineer who wrote a program for artificial intelligence and puts it into the body of a damaged humanoid police drone in the backset of being held in the custody of a few lifetime criminals. This film is a masterpiece. People like to complain about the acting by the South African rappers Blomkamp put in the lead roles, they basically play themselves; in other words they nail it. The only minor complaint I have is they overuse the rap couple's music a little too much. Anyway, the ending takes a twisted and uncomfortable turn. I don't agree with the moral ramifications of uploading your consciousness into a computer for the purpose of living forever but the question needs to be asked. Because there are some freaks out there pushing for this kind of stuff and it is scary. Just imagine a dictator doing this and living forever and causing pain and misery for hundreds of years. Scary times ahead, ha. Anyway this is a great film. It also covers the topic of nature vs nurture. And a bunch of other things. Many people hate on this film because they do not agree with the themes. Regardless, the film is interesting, paced very well and above all it is entertaining. I highly recommend this film. Sci-fi at its best.",Chappie
69,jadepietro,If It Only Had a Brain,2,14 August 2015,"This film is not recommended.In brief: Chappie belongs in the scrapheap.GRADE: D+To put it mildly, Chappie is horrible, surely one of the worst films of the year, or any year for that matter. With all the talent assembled both behind and on the screen, the movie is a major disappointment coming from such a creative filmmaker like Neill Blomkamp. Mr. Blomkamp made a stunning debut with the classic sci-fi fantasy District 9, then going on to make the less-than-sterling Elysium. Sadly, he continues this downward slide with his weakest film yet. Let's hope he sidesteps the M. Night Shyamalan curse. His third film, Chappie, still reigns in the sci-fi genre, but it lacks cohesiveness and logic. The characters are such stereotypes (the nerdy genius, the corrupt rival, the put-upon hero, the one- dimensional evil bad guys, etc.) and its story is just so dumb.The screenplay takes an interesting premise about A.I. prototypes gone amok (yet another cliché) and human beings tampering with science. But it also adds the most unlikeable characters ever to disgrace the screen. No one is worth rooting for. Even Chappie becomes a buffoon. The plot has the South African government successfully employing an army of robots to maintain law and order. Apparently there are two types of Robo-Cops: one created by engineer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) and the other by the increasingly unhinged and jealous Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman), who wants to sabotage Wilson's creations, which includes Chappie. However, Chappie is a slightly different model, a tin man with a brain and a heart, one that can show human emotions. Now that is all fine and dandy a narrative. Until the narrative takes the wrong detour...both Deon and Chappie are kidnapped by a crew of unappealing punk lowlife who seem like rejects from the Mad Max franchise. They are named Ninja, Yo-Landi, and Amerika and it hard to say who is the most annoying. Most of their line delivery and dialog is unintelligible, with thick South African ascents, and their behavior is even more hard to understand. (Wisely, the evil rival gang leader, Hippo (Brandon Auret), has subtitles explaining his rants, unless one becomes tired of hearing them, like me.) This all leads to the gangs trying to lead Chappie into a life of crime. (They even give his some gold bling to hang around his neck and teach him to rap and talk gangster-style.) Deon, tries to control him (He constantly states, ""I am your maker!"") but never rescues him from his captors, and Vincent plays bad-old Snidely Whiplash in his obsessive need to kill our hero.The actors are uniformly awful, with Mr. Jackman giving his worst performance in decades. The hammy Sharlto Copley plays Chappie and he has become a CGI effect here, which is a vast improvement from his live action roles. Sadly, his campy spirit has been channeled into Jose Pablo Cantillo's performance as the menacing gang leader. Ninja as Ninja and Yo-Landi as Yo-Landi are originally from a rap band and should keep their night gigs. Sigorney Weaver, in a small role as the greedy CEO of the company, should have asked for an even smaller one. At least, Dev Patel has stopped overdoing the comic shtick and finally started acting again in a movie. The script by the director and his previous collaborator Terri Tatchell, is inane and should have never been green-lighted. Characters act illogically and the plot meanders. Too much time is spent on the kidnappers (period!) and their training techniques. While some of the action sequences are well staged and the climactic showdown does have some excitement, getting there is quite a chore, or snore.There are many silly moments in this film, but none more blatantly laughable as when Chappie severely beats up one of his enemies and then scolds him saying, ""You are a very, very, bad man!"" No, Chappie, you stand corrected. You are a very, very bad movie! Avoid this droid!Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Chappie
70,Seraphion,Nice complete package of entertainment in a SciFi drama,7,6 March 2015,"Johannesburg, the near future. The police integrated robotic Scout units into the force. They don't get hacked because the manufacturer Tetravaal installs a unique guard key hardware to prevent hacking. Scout 22 keeps getting damaged in battle so the technicians scrap it for demolition. But the Scout inventor Deon decides to reuse it for experiment of his new AI program, that's capable of accelerated learning. A gang of robbers; Ninja, Yolandi and America, kidnap Deon to have him stop police droids as they do a big heist later on, Then they see the heap of parts that Deon wants to experiment on. They force Deon to activate the droid but Deon explains that this one is different for it's AI. Scout 22 gets resurrected as a baby like entity which just started to learn everything. Yolandi named him Chappie for he's like a little chap. Ninja kicks out Deon but he comes back the next day to teach Chappie to stay off crimes. Ninja and America dumps Chappie in a harsh neighborhood, dumping him and teaching him about the real world. Vincent, Deon's rival android designer, learns of Chappie and captures him, taking the guard key Deon took to activate Chappie.Chappie returns to the gang and Yolandi and America repairs his severed arm. Ninja talks to Chappie again and teaches him to rob cars. They then meet King to get explosives, and Ninja tells Chappie of his dying battery. Meanwhile Vincent uses the guard key to inject a virus that disables all Scouts including Chappie. The city's criminals run rampant and the human police are deploy again. Deon brings Chappie back to Tetravaal and manages rescue him. There Chappie learn of a new body but he must find a way to transfer his consciousness to the new body through the neural helmet. Vincent convinces the Tetravaal to launch his own human controlled Moose prototype war machine to hunt Chappie and the gang.Chappie manages to destroy Moose but America and Yolandi die and Deon gets shot fatally. Chappie brings him to Tetravaal, and after giving a lesson to Vincent, he uses his own program to transfer Deon's consciousness to a prototype Scout body. Deon uses the the same program to transfer Chappie's consciousness to another Scout body lying disabled. The two go back to Ninja and they bury Yolandi, with Chappie holding a disk of her consciousness.I really like how the story takes the now-becoming-classic SciFi theme of human and non-human relationship and gave it nice little twists here and there. The screenplay completes the story with nice elements of other genres other than the usual Neill Blomkamp ingredients of SciFi drama. We find nice snippets of very funny comedy in Chappie's child- like simplicity and the way Ninja and America teach him to do crime. There's also the classic family movie themes of fatherhood and motherhood, and also the classic David-versus-Goliath battle scene. The action parts are very Neill Blomkamp in feel, not so epic that they don't really feature much camera gimmick, not even the right amount of slow motions. They feel just right at the proportion and still look cool at the times it needs to look that way. The visual effects also feels very nice, a somewhat standard feature of every Neill Blomkamp movie. They replaced Sharlto Copley's body acting with Chappie's body very nicely on screen, similar to what we see in District 9.The acting overall is quite a good one. I expected Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver to have a major lead role here but he turned out to have the main antagonist role while she only had a minor appearance. But Jackman's performance didn't disappoint. His usual character of hardy muscle man fits quite perfectly to the soldier side of Vincent, even though the engineer side didn't really appear in him. Sharlto Copley did very well in giving life to his role of the robotic entity. His voice acting fits nicely, adding the sadness part in the ""real world"" scene, and comic fun in Chappie's dominant learning responses.My say for Chappie is this movie deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a definite yes. For a two hour long movie, this SciFi drama quite a complete package of entertainment. Anyone who enjoys Neill Blomkamp's Elysium and District 9, like myself, will also enjoy this movie.",Chappie

72,rgkarim,"Dark look at how much humanity sucks, Blomkamp returns",7,6 March 2015,"Fans of Neil Blomkamp rejoice, another tale has arisen to slap us in the face about the pessimistic place the world is. This time his vision is in the form of a robot, who obtains artificial intelligence that will, as always, revolutionize the world. While we all know the usual consequences of this motion, you never know what twists Blomkamp's movies will have. Thus for this movie called Chappie, the trailers may have youExpect: A dark, cynical tale about how humans suck, action, and something weird will happen. What you get: Blomkamp has an obsession with darker films, as seen in District 9 and Elysium. Chappie from the start brings out that darkness, plopping us in the middle of civil unrest and death as war breaks out between thugs and the robotic police force. For nearly two hours, this darkness continues to grow as we are subjugated to heavy dialog that begins to question the roles and responsibilities of humans. Why is this dark you ask? Because Blomkamp chooses to address the negative side of things, often emphasizing the less attractive qualities of greed, anger, jealousy, and arrogance to a fault. We get it humans suck, how many times do you have to deliver the same message? His efforts to further analyze the flaws of humanity are further exaggerated by panoramic shots of shacks and grime filled buildings, as well as curse laden dialog. I indeed did feel some of the message, but the movie went too far on some of the characters that I grew annoyed or laughed at the ridiculous direction the film took. Some of the scenes were a bit too much for me at times, especially the bouts of torture or slander that Chappie, the one ray of hope in this movie, had to endure. His innocence was supposed to offset the darkness, but Blomkamp and crew quickly washed that away and left me more depressed than anything. I think the darkness was further enhanced by the impressive editing the team did on the movie. In particular Chappie was animated beautifully, his detail and movements flowing without flaw. The robot is human all on his own, and shows the gullible side of our selves, in particular when we are children aiming to please. Throw in the gut wrenching orchestra work and the sadness and dismay of the plot continues to unfold and leave you a little morbid at being humans. His message is clear we need to take action, but come on a little more happiness could have gone a long way. Action wise the movie follows the same formula his previous installments have. The movie starts out with pedal to the medal shootout excitement to help establish how Chappie comes to be. However the adrenaline quickly ebbs as the ethical discussions begin and we are left to sit through about an hour and half of dialogue before the next bout of fighting begins. The end game is not quite as exhilarating though, the epic shoot out turning more bloodbath and bang as our cast of characters are tortured. Again darkness seems to be the calling of this tale, and the action is not spared of the honed, ruthless edge of blood and death. The scenes are also melodramatic as well, the actors falling in cascades of slow motion screaming and running. I wasn't impressed with the promise the trailers held, but again you never know with Blomkamp. As for the weird factor well the entire movie is pretty much weird. The artificial intelligence angle has been played a bunch of times, but this one is a bit weird in terms of Chappie thinking the humans are its parents. Another twist was discussing the nature of consciousness and its involvement in making us human. You'll find this is centered once again around death, and is relayed to what a soul is. Such concepts may be a little too much for some audience members, and I admit leads to some very ""interesting"" albeit philosophical paths. You will find that the ending is very similar to some other big blockbuster plots. I can say that the ending provides some light at the end of the dark tunnel, but it also leaves it on an ambiguous note as well, most likely to open for another potential sequel. I can say Chappie is a very well produced movie, with fantastic special effects, animation, and a reassessment of humanity. Yet the cynical approach to this movie left me depressed, which when combined with the morbid dialog bored me at times. This film is definitely an artistic, with much symbology and passion captured on screen, but I still look for more entertainment in my movies. So who can I recommend this movie to? I will definitely recommend this film to fans of District 9 and Elysium, as well as those who like a dark approach to their science fiction movies. In addition if you like having a philosophical blow out during a movie, again I recommend this. Otherwise, skip this film and wait for next weekend's releases as they hold more promise. My scores for this movie are:Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.0 Overall: 6.5",Chappie
73,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Chappie,6,14 March 2015,"""He's a happy chappie."" So says the character Yolandi and in one instant, a funky robot from Neill Blomkamp's latest release, gets his name. Playing itself out as RoboCop meets Short Circuit (the gangster version), 2015's Chappie really finds its director in his element here. Blomkamp's vision of sci-fi consists of slow motion shots featuring his caricatures leaping, plenty of artificial intelligence red herrings, and a grubby, draggy look that in turn, gives an audience member the feeling of a slumming, dystopian punk rock society. This is a guy who tends to make the same vehicle again and again with gadgetry masked as art exhibit. The only difference is that Chappie as opposed to his two other feature films (Elysium and District 9), tends to have more of a heart in certain scenes. I may be rambling but is he the right choice to take over the Alien franchise? Based on a stubbornly, headstrong style, probably not. Is he wholly original minus the occasional borrowing from other futuristic, action/thriller fare? Sure, I'll give you that one.Chappie takes place in a militarized, corrupt civilization where regular cops are called ""pigs"" and robotic cops are called ""dogs"". It's violent in a hail of gunfire sort of way but bloodless for almost half of its tempestuous two hours (there's less heads exploding this time around). The story brings us back to Blomkamp's old digs being the dusty slums of Johannesburg, South Africa. Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) is an inventor of robots. These robots are used in harnessing the crime wave via Johannesburg's many decaying neighborhoods. Deon's boss at Tetravaal (the company he works at) is Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver). She's happy with Deon's work but prevents him from developing a new concept, robots that mimic the human mind. Deon defies her and instead implants a forbidding program into one of the bots who was destroyed in the line of duty. The plot workings then become more compound. Deon gets robbed by hoodlums who want to use his new found creation (Chappie, a humanistic android whose learning process initially is that of a five year old) to pull off a major heist. They owe twenty million dollars to the type of nasty criminal you don't want to tick off. And it doesn't help that a disgruntled employee at the other end of Tetravaal's ideals (Hugh Jackman as weapons expert Vincent Moore), wants to destroy Chappie in order to make way for his own robotic menace, MOOSE.Now I liked almost all the characters in Chappie and the acting ranged from standard to haphazard to flat out excellent. Sharlto Copley who's a Blomkamp mainstay, gets the mannerisms of Chappie just right. He doesn't put on an actual robot suit (it's more complicated than that) but his voice is perfect as are his jerky, protracted movements. In the case of Sigourney Weaver, well her performance was probably the low point. It seemed like it was totally phoned in. She will always be a legend in my book but her CEO (Michelle Bradley) should have been more important than was advertised. Ripley doesn't register so much as a blimp. As for Hugh Jackman, well he's an interesting choice to play the heavy. He does an adequate job channeling a jealous, sniveling rat in the Tetravaal corporation. Oh and he rocks the mullet (as well as multiple sets of khaki pants). Finally, there's Dev Patel who completely shines in his role. He brings sympathy and believability to Deon Wilson, Chappie's quote unquote ""maker"". And in truth, he's been a busy boy lately (his other film The Second Marigold Hotel is currently in theaters as well).Out of the box casting choices aside, the ending to Chappie may be one of two reservations I have for not recommending it. This a complex affair but it concludes with the notion that humans are better off living forever as robots. With their consciences transferred from dying bodies to connected hunks of metal, it feels like Blomkamp wanted to tack something on without knowing that it might reek of desperation. I mean, the problem with science fiction movies these days is that every contingent has been done already. I don't fault him entirely though because the journey to get to Chappie's weary conclusion is almost worth it. The other reservation I have involves the undramatic rap music that accompanies the flick's second act and the closing credits. It feels sort of muddled as does Chappie's uneven attempts at humor (the teaching of Chappie by uncompromising thugs on how to talk like a bad ass and putting gold chains around his neck are prime examples).In conclusion, during the film's opening half hour, the main protagonist proclaims, ""this is a new kind of life form, a new step in evolution"". I don't share the same sentiment with Neill Blomkamp's latest (filmwise) but it feels like something he's always wanted to make, a pet project if you will. Result: two and a half stars.Of note: the workplace environment at the weapons manufacturer Tetravaal, is comprised of cubicles like in 1999's Office Space. I snickered a bit. I mean you have Patel and Jackman's characters sitting at their desks near a bunch of other people who apparently don't do any work for the company. They're just there next to computers, like props if you will. I figured Patel and Jackman would be out in the testing field or I guess, the war rooms (which for most of the time, they aren't). Oh and if you take in a viewing of Chappie, get ready to be introduced to a new word. That word would be f**kmother (said over and over again).",Chappie
74,Rob_Taylor,A Very Happy Chappie,7,25 August 2015,"So, this movie has received a deal of negativity and I think I can point straight to reason why that is.It doesn't take itself too seriously, unlike those reviewing it, for the most part.Chappie is not, nor was it ever meant to be, a high concept scifi movie. It was meant to be entertaining and a little thought-provoking. Blomkamp didn't intend for this to challenge deeper movies as to the nature of sentience. If anything, its aim was to highlight how we deal with those who are more naive than we are.Chappie lets us take a look at ourselves and how we treat those we consider as inferior, and the image it paints isn't a particularly good one.However, Chappie is, for the most part, just meant as an entertainment piece and people should treat it like that. The story has its faults, but it moves along nicely and there aren't many dull moments. As for those who say it is just a re-working of Short Circuit... Are you saying that because it features a robot achieving sentience? Or is it just because his creator happens to be of a similar perceived ethnicity as Ben from Short Circuit? If the former well...there are many such stories - you could argue the same about Wall-E. If the latter... then that says more about you than it does about the movie.So is Chappie any good? Yes, it is. Is it the best thing since sliced bread? No. There are plot holes and the thugs, despite the violence, are a little too cartoonish and stereotypical for my tastes. The film does, however, turn your view of the gang around quite considerably during its run-time. And although the ending was a little overdone, at least the film didn't simply discard its own logic concerning the transfer of consciousness. It stuck with it.As someone else noted, it is rather like a Disney movie, but with thugs and violence thrown in. Whilst some may find that objectionable, it is nice to see something a little different from the endless fare of formula blockbusters. We could do worse than have more films of this ilk.SUMMARY: Not for everyone, but a blend of violence, comedy and grimness that works well with some genuine heart-warming moments thrown in for good measure. More pleasant than nasty and worth your time.",Chappie
75,brando647,Weak Writing; Chappie is the Only Real Fun in CHAPPIE,6,16 February 2016,"I've been following the career of director Neill Blomkamp since he blew me away in 2009 with his debut DISTRICT 9 and, I've got to say, there's been a slow decline. I absolutely loved DISTRICT 9 and, while it was nowhere near the same level, I even enjoyed ELYSIUM. But, man, I don't know what to think of CHAPPIE. I do find that I sort of like it, in spite of some pretty annoying flaws. Those flaws would be sloppier writing and the idiot characters. Everything else lives up to what I expect from a Blomkamp movie, and this movie isn't enough for me to write the man off. I'm just a little disappointed. I guess I was hoping the dip into mediocrity that was ELYSIUM was a fluke and CHAPPIE would be a return to form. Once again set in Blomkamp's usual stomping ground of South Africa, CHAPPIE is set in the brutal world of gangsters in Johannesburg. In an effort to combat crime, the government has utilized a robotic police force and it seems to be working out. As good as this might be for Johannesburg, it's bad news for a trio of small-time criminals who need to pull off a pretty decent heist if they want to pay off their debts to a murderous local kingpin. By a stroke of luck, the three cross paths with Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), creator of the police robots, and he just so happens to have a busted robot in the trunk of his van that he'd planned on using to test his new artificial intelligence program. Instead, the gangsters see their chance to put the newly sentient 'bot to good use in solving their own problems.My problems with CHAPPIE really go hand-in-hand. The overall story is pretty cool: the naïve ""newborn"" robot essentially being raised by these criminals and the conflict between his gangster upbringing and the more positive messages bestowed on him by his maker, Deon. The problems in the writing that bother me endlessly are with the characters, their actions, and the seemingly lack of consequences to all of the ignorant decisions being made. This isn't limited to the street thugs. I expect them to make stupid decisions (and they do); this goes for everyone. Deon, for example, steals a broken police robot from work that was scheduled for recycling because it was beyond repair. Sure, this sets the whole plot in motion but why is someone so intelligent acting so stupid? We see Deon's home. He's got loads of machines and he's even got a tiny butler robot that cleans up his messes. Why not implant the program in one of them and test it out? Was it really the best decision to steal what is most assuredly a multi-million dollar product from your company and, remember, the local government (it was a police 'bot, after all)? Then he gets hijacked by our trio of main criminalsNinja, Yo- Landi, and Amerikaand they demand to keep the newly sentient robot for themselves. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up in a high crime areamaybe Deon's just desensitized to threats of violencebut when an obviously unstable street thug starts waving a gun around and demands I get lost and leave the robot, I get lost. Cut your losses, man. Call the cops and let them deal with it. Seeing as how he's such an asset to his company, he might not even lose his job for ""borrowing"" the busted robot. Instead, Deon insists on returning to the criminal's hideout again and again and again so he can continue teaching Chappie, risking a bullet to the brain every time and rarely acknowledging the constant threats of death.So, Deon's an idiot. How do Chappie's other parents fare? Yo-Landi is Chappie's surrogate mother and the most sympathetic of the cast. From the moment Chappie goes online, Yo-Landi's maternal instincts kick in and she adopts him as her own child; she's even the one to name him. Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) is sort of the cool uncle. He helps teach Chappie swagger and how to carry himself like a gangster. He actually seems to care about Chappie but he never oversteps his bounds, knowing this is Ninja's operation and therefore Ninja's robot. And Ninjawell, Ninja's made almost impossible to like (despite being a main character in the film) because of how much we sympathize with Chappie. A quick bit about Chappie: I love the character. Sharlto Copley does a phenomenal job bringing the robot to life and making the audience love him. For the majority of the film, Chappie is mentally a ""child"". His behavior, his speech, his naivetyChappie is a child and it's near impossible not to care about him. This is why it's so easy for me to hate the character of Ninja. I suppose Ninja would be comparable to Chappie's stepfather (I see Deon as more the father role though Chappie does refer to Ninja as his father) and he's an abusive S.O.B. Yes, Chappie is a robot but it's enough that I can't stand Ninja, despite his attempted redemption at the end.I don't hate CHAPPIE. I'm not mad. I'm justdisappointed. I expected better. Still, Chappie himself was done incredibly well (both VFX and performance) and Yo-Landi was surprisingly decent. It's Blomkamp's biggest misstep so far but it's entertaining enough. Wait for it to drop on cable for this one; no rush.",Chappie
76,moviexclusive,"Frenetic, overblown, and yet under-developed, this mash-up of 'Robocop' and 'Short Circuit' is a jumbled mess made from recycled parts of much better sci-fi equivalents",4,4 March 2015,"It's a good thing Neill Blomkamp secured his next directing gig before his latest went into wide release; indeed, 'Chappie' marks yet another costly misstep that threatens to send his career the way of the Wachowskis. Its premise of an artificial intelligence becoming human is by now a familiar one, but rather than build on what its predecessors had to offer, this childish and noisy spectacle fails to develop any of its themes, be it the oft-repeated idea of consciousness or its social allegory of class divisions.Set once again in Johannesburg in the near future, 'Chappie' opens in the same way as 'District 9' with mock news footage establishing how the police have commissioned an elite team of human-sized droids – called 'Scouts' – from a robotics firm known as Tetravaal to restore law and city and reduce the body count for the force as well. The 'Scouts' are the brainchild of an idealistic inventor called Deon (Dev Patel), whose creation is hailed by his company's CEO (Sigourney Weaver) to the consternation of a jealous colleague Vincent (Hugh Jackman). Unlike the 'Scouts', Vincent own invention dubbed the 'Moose' requires direct human control, and has understandably been sidelined as his company banks its future on greater deployment of the 'Scouts'. Their rivalry is supposed to set in motion a series of events that leads to our titular character taking on a much more heavily-armed 'Moose' in the overblown finale, but any sort of meaningful build-up between Deon and Vincent is cast aside in favour of a gangsta subplot that is frankly misplaced.Celebrating his love for his homeland's rap-rave group Die Antwoord, Blomkamp has cast both members as low-life gangsters Ninja and Yo- Landi (played by the group's Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser), who in the opening sequence following the scene-setting newsreel are seen to have bungled a heist and now owe their boss Hippo $20 million. To procure the compensation owed, Yo-Landi comes up with the laughable notion of obtaining a remote control so that they can switch off the Scouts. The search for that 'remote' leads them to kidnap Deon, just as the latter has prepped one of the decommissioned Scouts – or 'Scout 22' as he calls it – for his experiment in synthetic consciousness. By simply uploading a data file he created, Deon turns that scout into a thinking and feeling robot who is also taken together with his inventor and earns the affection of Yo-Landi. It is Yo-Landi who gives him the name 'Chappie', and in turn, Chappie calls her 'Mommy' and Ninja 'Daddy'.Almost the whole second act is dedicated to Chappie's learning as a sentient being, which is disturbing to say the least. On one hand, Mommy teaches him English, reads him bedtime stories and encourages him to go pursue his dreams. On the other, Daddy and his accomplice Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) try to manipulate his fundamental mental constructs in order that he may assist them in their heist of an armoured vehicle. The fact that many of these scenes are played as comedy without any acknowledgment of its anarchic undertones only reinforces just how tone-deaf Blomkamp's movie is, so much so that Chappie's questioning of our human failings – expressed in his confusion why humans break promises and do bad things – rings hollow and even hypocritical.There is no apartheid allegory here, but it is clear right from the onset that Blomkamp's sympathies still lie with the disfranchised in society. Though that posture may have worked in 'District 9', it feels shockingly misplaced here, in particular since their 'tutelage' leads only to violence, crime and death. It doesn't help that Chappie isn't an endearing character in his own right, coming across as a hyper-active chatterbox without nuance or restraint – and Chappie remains an unrelatable character from start to finish.Despite his efforts at trying to get his audience to identify with his character's struggle to develop a mind and soul of his own – not just what his 'maker' programmes himself to be or what he has been taught to follow – Blomkamp fails to make good on an intriguing theme that several other filmmakers have explored to much, much better effect before or draw any poignancy out of it. Between Chappie's incessant chatter and Blomkamp's attempt to pack as much diffuse plot into the runtime, there is hardly any space given to explore the intellectual notions that the movie flirts with (but never indulges in any serious manner).The same idiocy unfortunately extends to its stock character archetypes. Patel's inventor is never given any motivation why he developed a consciousness for his androids in the first place. His rival played by Jackman is no more than a cartoonish villain, and even embarrassing for the A-list actor. Weaver continues a streak of playing the thankless supporting character, but the most ill-advised bit of scripting and casting has got to be the triumvirate of Ninja, Yo- Landi and Amerika/ Padillo, who are not only caricatures through and through but some of the more off-putting ones in recent memory. Sharlto Copley does a capable motion-capture for Chappie, but that work is sadly overshadowed by a character that could absolutely do with an overhaul.Ditto for the whole picture in fact, which recycles themes from much better genre equivalents and gives them a South African underbelly spin that frankly doesn't work. Blomkamp's flair for staging a propulsive picture (with some help from an equally intrusive score from Hans Zimmer) is still intact, and so is his verve, but 'Chappie' is hyper-frenetic, over-plotted and yet under-developed at the same time. It is not even 'Elysium', which Blomkamp has in recent weeks admitted that he 'f**ked up'. We only wonder what he is going to say about 'Chappie' when he starts doing his rounds for the next 'Alien' movie.",Chappie
77,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Chappie""- Almost a great film. Almost. Worth seeing for all it does right despite its many faults.",7,22 November 2017,"It might seem almost paradoxical, but I found myself quite taken by the bulk of the film ""Chappie"" despite the fact that honestly... it's a pretty wonky film when viewed as a whole. Director Neill Blomkamp's tale of artificial intelligence and criminal corruption was a peculiar release in 2015 that garnered a generally mixed response from both critics and audiences alike. Some applauded it for asking big questions and delving into a classic morality tale of what constitutes life and purpose. Others despised it for its unlikable characters and messy narrative structure. And me? Well, I'm somewhere in the middle. Able to recognize and condemn its faults while still finding great value in the elements and aspects of the story that do work.In the not too distant future, robotics and programming expert Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) has helped to create the ""Scouts""- robotic police androids that are licensed out to help take back the streets of Johannesburg from criminals and gangsters. One day, Deon secretly steals a damaged Scout body to use as a guinea-pig for an Artificial Intelligence experiment... only to be kidnapped by a group of common street-thugs (Ninja and Yolandi of the rap-group ""Die Antwoord"", Jose Pablo Cantillo) who wish to use the robot to pull heists and make dirty money. Dubbed ""Chappie"", the ""newborn"" AI operates on the same level as a young child, and is pulled between his decent creator and his violent ""adoptive family."" At the same time, Deon's work rival Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) learns of Chappie's existence and, viewing him as an ungodly creation, vows to destroy him along with the other Scouts in order to push forward his own robotic-police units...In many ways, ""Chappie"" is a frustrating watch because it's almost a great film... but it's not quite there. It's an almost perfect inversion of that old saying ""The whole is greater than the sum of the parts."" All of the individual elements at play in ""Chappie"" are engrossing, compelling and incredibly enjoyable. But it doesn't exactly come together. The film's biggest fault is the fact that the writing feels rushed and patched together- like Blomkamp and co-writer Terri Tatchell had a lot of brilliant ideas for different parts of the story, but couldn't quite fit them together and rushed into production without a completed script. The pacing is weird, there's some bizarre inconsistencies in the structure, and just a few too many moments of convenience and coincidence. It needed another draft, plain and simple.And that should be the kiss of death... but it's not. Because everything else works so well, that I found myself very willing to forgive the troubled writing and shaky foundation. The story has some clever ideas and heady themes that I found fascinating, and I loved the fact that Blomkamp and Tatchell allow the movie to operate in a morally grey zone- they raise questions, but often leave the answers up to the audience's interpretation. As always, Blomkamp's visual direction is a phenomena, and his sense of scope, composition and color is just awe-inspiring. His films always have a unique balance between gritty realism and melodramatic hyper-reality, and he nails that in ""Chappie"" in the best of ways. And I found all of the characters quite compelling in their own ways. Heck, you might very well find yourself growing attached to the robotic Chappie and the criminals who are ""raising"" him more than the other, much more human and humane characters.This is aided by surprisingly solid performances from basically involved. Patel is a joy as always, and it's great seeing him on- screen once again. Jackman is a delightfully slimy villain who seems to be having a blast chewing the scenery. And heck... I even though Ninja and Yolandi of Die Antwoord did pretty darned good. Particularly Yolandi, whom grows close to Chappie and begins to mother and nurture him in a genuinely loving way- forming the film's strongest emotional through-line. But of course, the incredible Sharlto Copley shines through as the voice of the titular Chappie. Copley might not be a household name, but he's quickly become one of my favorite actors working today with his incredible turns in films including Blomkamp's own ""District 9"" and the underrated ""A-Team"" feature film. And his wondrous and childlike take on the character of Chappie is another strong win for Copley.At the end of the day, it comes down to this. ""Chappie"" is almost a great film. But it's not. It's messy. It's uneven. And it has a ton of problems. And yet... I feel that it does enough right to be worth checking out. It has interesting themes, plenty of entertainment value, a beautiful scope and fine performances. And to me, that makes up for most of the problems I have with the shoddy writing. I'm giving ""Chappie"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Give it a shot. You might like it.",Chappie
78,quincytheodore,Chappie is far away from District 9,5,5 March 2015,"Artificial intelligent premise has been done so many times, the recent Transcendence and Automata come to mind. Most of them fail to utilize this classic futuristic formula. Now a lot of hope rests on Neill Blomkamp's shoulders to put unique twist, and although Chappie has some decent visual effects, it is excruciatingly bland, juvenile and overly quirky to establish any sort of emotional connection.Plot is simplistic, and for those who haven't seen the trailer, it's about the titular robot that serendipitously enhanced by AI program. He, it, must learn the basic of human behavior and society. Right as it starts, the basic flaw is apparent. Chappie needs to make audience invest to its animated life, so to speak, and it simply fails to do so.The newborn robot mimics others, almost in infantile manner. However, majority of the characters are too exaggerated and ridiculously flamboyant, which leaves the confused robot in either dull childish antics or forced gangster style. The movie sloppily uses prejudice or bullying theme to attract any sort of connection, yet these cliché efforts don't draw much sympathy with its heavy handed approach. Then it tries to use humor, only to ironically make Chappie annoying.Some stellar actors contribute to the movie. Dev Patel as Deon the programmer, admirably tries his best. After The Last Airbender, it's clear he will do his best whatever the medium. Hugh Jackman as Vincent, is the most disgruntled employee of the year. He reacts in the most vilify way, perhaps because the film needs some dilemma. The characters are frantic like some anime reject, it's hard to relate since their motives and reactions are questionable at best.There are some plot holes as well, mainly inconsistency between Chappie's growth and technical issues, in which the film ultimately resorts to Deus Ex Machina. If there are some good points, it's that the gritty sandy look works well with the setting of Johannesburg. Sci-fi visual effects are nice as well, although it's not superior to Elysium, let alone District 9. Soundtracks are odd, mostly blaring techno, but they can't be faulted of not fitting the movie.The film means to deliver meaningful message, but the voice it comes out from is too weak for such task. It's an average sci-fi spectacle which may engage with effect and sadly little else. As for the robotic lead, the largely uninteresting Chappie is no better than Baymax.",Chappie
79,mike48128,Short Circuit and Robocop Misfire,7,29 September 2018,"I wanted to love this movie but the screenplay borrows too much from the above mentioned films. Thsi is a Pinocchio tale with a twist. ""Chappie"" is part of several hundred ""Robocop"" wannabees that have no human soul. There is a protagonist ""bad"" robot called ""Moose"" that steps in at the finale somewhat like in ""Robocop 2"" So you have a violent gang that is the excuse for most of the murder and mayhem in the film, with a ""crazy"" leader that requires subtitles as his English accent is atrocious. Enter the nice programmer who reprograms a robot to be ""alive"" and two barely-bad villains who nurture Chappie. He calls one ""mommy"". An attempt at humor is made when the rest of the violent gang turns Chappie into a ""bad-ass"", complete with gold chains, as he robs money and steals cars. A waste of time for the talents of Sigorny Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Like all ""Frankenstein"" Tales, order is restored to the humans in the end, with the surprising turn-of-events as the 3 ""heroes"" are now all robotic. Sequels were planned...",Chappie
80,Screen_Blitz,Certainly not what visionary Neill Bloomkamp could have delivered,5,18 June 2015,"Neill Bloomkamp demonstrate his visionary talents in the 2009 documnetary-style hit 'District 9', and his immersive talent in portraying realism in stories set violent, post-apocalyptic environments continued gracefully on his follow-up 'Elysium' which though didn't live up to the heights of the former; was brilliantly crafted by Bloomkamp's amazing talent on illustrating a compelling idea and blossoming it to life on screen. But the freshness of his directorial efforts he brought to these films feel awfully abandoned in this film in which he appears to driving for a more style-over-substance approach. What results is a film boasting plenty of captivating visual heft, but not enough nuance or engaging substance to make it interesting. Set in the future in the ghettos of South Africa, Chappie follows Deon Wilson (played by Dev Petel), an high-rank executive at a Robot Police Force Company, an organization that employs artificially engineered robots as police officers to fend against crime against in the city. Deon builds a robot in intention of making with the intelligence of a human, only for his project to be turned down by the corporate CEO Michelle Bradley (played by Sigourney Weaver). He is then kidnapped by a trio of low-life criminals (played by the band Die Antwood) who want the robot. When the robot comes alive and begins communicating like a child (but smarter), they name it ""Chappie"" (voiced by Sharlto Copley) and began teaching it their morally gray ways including robbery and petty trash talk. The robot's life becomes in endanger when the company deems it as a threat, primarily by fellow corporate engineer Vincent Moore (played by Hugh Jackman) who wants to take the poor robot down. Neill Bloomkamp doesn't hold back when introducing interesting concepts, and the idea of robots being employed into law enforcement (the police force in particular), pursuing justice in the crime-ridden ghettos of South Africa which like in Bloomkamp's previous work, is brought to life by Bloomkamp's inspiring visual style giving the setting a third-world look of an economically depressed country. The robots including the titular little robot Chappie himself spring to life with the use of some gritty motion capture technology and computerized voice-over. The idea could have worked more sufficiently with if it had a more powerful plot and characters to supplement with it. Unfortunately, these aspects lie the film's major faults. While the story proceeds its awe-inspiring premise dealing with the conflict between the robotic law enforcement and the amoral outlaws that make enemy to the law, it transcend into a clumsy plot that too often focuses more on the low-life gangsters drawing Chappie into their soulless lifestyle, and less on the titular character's relationship with his creator and the conflict against the humans and the robots. What we are treated with is a goofy tale on the gangsters and Deon Wilson (who is pushed into a supporting character position) bickering against these three junkies who try turning the child-minded Chappie into an unruly little crime thriver, and the way in which Bloomkamp executes this subplot is not only silly, but pushes the plot into an uneven mix. It's not until the final thirty minutes when bullets starts flying, explosions go off, and people are suddenly blown to bits in an all-out war. The character department lies another area in which Neill Bloomkamp seems to have skewered over. This is becomes a shame as we spend almost two hours with characters who are shallowly developed and thus, we never come to care about. Dev Patel, the young man who made an everlasting impression on Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' in 2008 gives it his best here, but the story fails to dive deep into his character Deon Wilson, but this doesn't come as shocking as the fact that Deon is senselessly left out as the main character, which the three gangsters (played by Yolandi Visser, Jose Cantillo, and Ninja) seemed to take position for as they endure way more screen time than Patel; and these characters aren't even charismatic or well-developed either. Then, you got Hugh Jackman (using his rare Austrailian accent) who playing an antagonistic role of a corporate engineer trying to kill Chappie, but the laziness in which his character is written make him almost instantly forgettable. Finally, there is Chappie who is supposed to be a powerfully engineered robot wired with artificial intelligence to supplement him with the mind of a little child in pre-school, and this is sadly where most of the silliness comes in. The film more often than not toys with the robotic character by giving him a childish personality that comes off rather silly, if not obnoxious. Yes, I understand he has the mind of a orphan child born without a mother or father, and looks to Yolandi as his mother while the other two gangsters are rather abusive and teach him to be another crime heathen, but the dialogue he delivers is just silly and for the film's general tone, somewhat out of place.Overall, Chappie is an okay film that could have been another hit from director Neill Bloomkamp, but doesn't quite fire up to it's full potential nor it ever come off as engaging or smartly structured as his previous works. In the midst of its flaws, there is at least some good value to be handed to its premise and visual heft.",Chappie
81,Troy_Campbell,Ambitious and intelligent.,8,12 March 2015,"With his amazing debut movie District 9, South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp announced himself as a unique and ambitious player in the sci-fi arena. After hiccupping with sophomore effort Elysium, Blomkamp is back to his (almost) best with this endearing and singularly cool AI-centric tale. Revolving around the eponymous robot that is gifted with a rapid-developing consciousness, but dubiously raised by thieving gangsters, Chappie is emotionally and intellectually strong despite some plot-based weaknesses. Some will find the not-so-subtle moral metaphors – follow your heart, it's who you are on the inside that counts, etc – to be clunky and corny, however get past these and there's real meat to chew on. It's also nice to see a director wear his sentimentality proudly on his sleeve, not eschewing moments of heartbreak or affection to avoid ridicule from the lowest common denominator within the audience. There is a surprisingly large amount of unconventional, and occasionally dark, humour littered throughout too. A scene in which Chappie is taught how to be ""gangsta cool"" and another in which he steals cars with ignorant glee are laugh-out-loud funny, even if you feel slightly wrong for laughing immediately afterwards. From a visual standpoint, Blomkamp and his regular cinematographer Trent Opaloch again nail the grimy, quasi-apocalyptic-future look, the Johannesburg setting a welcome departure from the usual action-flick locations. Boasting cleverly staged set pieces, the judicious placement of graphic violence and some magnificent slow motion sequences, the hyper-stylised action is executed with aplomb. Sharlto Copley delivers an impressive motion-capture performance as the childlike protagonist (who is flawlessly animated with photorealistic CGI), whilst Dev Patel gets back to his Slumdog Millionaire best after a few rocky career choices saw his stocks plummet. Full of bluster and bravado, strangely magnetic co-leads Ninja and Yolinda – real life rap-rave duo Die Antwoord, who also contribute to the sensational soundtrack – are forces of nature in their meta-roles; their characters are unlike anything you have ever seen, or will see, in a Hollywood blockbuster. On the other hand, Hugh Jackman is sorely miscast as a jealous ex-soldier-turned-engineer who is threatened by Chappie's existence, and Sigourney Weaver appears for another one-note cameo that rivals her brief work in Exodus as the bigger waste of time. Grand ambitions, a big heart and slick visuals, not to mention Blomkamp's admirable pursuance of original properties, elevate Chappie above its faults to sit comfortably in the higher echelon of sci-fi films.",Chappie
82,pyrocitor,RoboFlop,4,10 August 2015,"Hollywood, consciously or not, is remarkably trendy in terms of annual preoccupations in output. 2015's theme-du-jour, permeating more intimate dramas (Ex Machina) and box- office busting superhero romps (Avengers: Age of Ultron) alike: artificial intelligence. Initially, the prospect of visionary director Neil Blomkamp contributing to the AI hive mind with the same gritty intensity, off-kilter humour and surreal inventiveness brought to his celebrated past works, District 9 and Elysium, may have been mouth-watering – surely more WALL-E than I, Robot. Unfortunately, there is no question that, like its titular android, somewhere along the line, Chappie's wires got badly crossed. The final product is well-intentioned but, at best, clumsy and messy, and, at worst, embarrassing and cringe-worthy. Blomkamp's speciality is not only crafting impressively grungy, immersive atmosphere, but relocating the scene of the crime from the oft-trod 'Murrcan locales to his native Johannesburg , South Africa. And while exploring the role of police presence in a more hostile, gang violence-infused environment could have made for a fascinating social drama, Blomkamp is clearly more of an avid RoboCop fan, as Chappie takes inspiration and reverence nearly to the point of plagiarism. Pilfered and repacked here is not only the film's central premise of a robotic police force, but terribly familiar opening newsreel footage detailing the local crime epidemic, a similarly Paul Verhoeven grainy visual aesthetic, and even, most brazenly, its central robo-antagonist, here unironically branded 'The Moose'. Nice.It would be easier to excuse Blomkamp for leaning a little over-zealously on intertextuality if Chappie had a sturdier foundation of its own to stand on. Sadly, Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell's script is so loud and incoherent it appears to be attempting to deliver three movies at once, none of them good. The plot absentmindedly bounces around between character and conflict, abandoning many along the way, with the dithering dialogue oscillating between trite moralizing and nearly incomprehensible bellowing. Blomkamp attempts to diffuse the stagnant, meandering action by raising the general volume to its cacophonous limit, with the cast constantly yelling, as if striving to be heard over the blaring Die Antwood score. The objective is edgy and energetic, but the result is a thoroughly muddy and generally unpleasant viewing experience. Moreover, even Chappie's central conceit – interrogating the 'nature/nurture' debate in sentient robotics by having Chappie kidnapped and 'raised' by violent gangsters ¬– only serves to unearth the film's weakest elements. Although importing artists Ninja and Yo-landi from horror-show hip hop(?) group Die Antwood might help lend the film a grungy, edgy credibility, actors they are resoundingly not. Relying on the pair's hysterical, campy ravings to carry the glut of the film's most dramatic scenes feels like a bizarre exercise in experimental performance art and not in a good way. Yo-landi's screeching attempts at 'mothering' Chappie makes for a lazy and quickly discarded subplot, while a montage of Ninja attempting to groom Chappie in the ways of proper 'Thug Lyfe' posturing is almost too cringe-worthy to watch. The film is purportedly gearing up to their coercing Chappie to help with their 'one big heist', but the narrative slouches along, an agonizing slew of interactions with Chappie that alternate between cloying or staggeringly cruel (Chappie is tortured and set on fire more than once) in this cartoon caricature of Johannesburg, until this is all but forgotten. Instead, the film lurches into a climax and resolution so utterly bonkers it suggests David Cronenberg directing a 1980s sci-fi movie for the Disney channel (again, not as good as it sounds). Even Paul Verhoeven at his most unhinged would be wise enough to stop short of such frenzied, muddled, camp insanity. Even the film's more customarily talented performers are wasted here. Saddled up in performance capture gear, Sharlto Copley strives for the eccentric innocence of a robotic E.T., but his monotone chirping and vaguely offensive broken English makes his Chappie too irritating to sympathize with. The delightful Dev Patel, in a rare lead role, doesn't fare much better as Chappie's idealistic creator, his natural charm stilted by lurches in characterization (and, again, lots o' yelling) constantly undercutting any hope of his character becoming likable. Hugh Jackman, clearly relishing a rare foray into villainy, lets his ludicrous mullet do most of his acting for him, and although his brawly, roaring military bogan is arguably the film's most enjoyable performance, that's still not saying much. Even a potentially lucrative cameo from Sigourney Weaver as the robotic task force's CEO is ultimately just extraneous and snooze-worthy, the cherry on top of the film's botched potential. Packed full of un-thrilling action, under-thought thematic musings, peppered with un-funny attempts at comedy, and propelled by a muddled, asinine script performed by a universally unlikeable cast of characters, there's very little to take to in Chappie, even for the most generous of viewers. Those with an insatiable thirst for robotic antics might find it a momentary diversion, but, for the most part, staying away from one of the most visually and tonally ugly films released in some time would be for the best. As alternative viewing, check out a rather excellent '80s action jaunt called RoboCop. You may have heard of it; Neil Blomkamp certainly has.I'd buy that for a dollar. -4/10",Chappie
83,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Not bad, but...",7,7 October 2017,"... also not fantastic.I absolutely loved Neil Blomkamp's first film, District 9, enough to have at least some interest in whatever he ended up making next. Elysium I thought was good but also a step down from District 9 in terms of quality, and now Chappie, in my opinion, is probably another slight step down from that.In fact, it was this movie's fairly poor critical response that put me off seeing it until now. Never caught it at the cinema, fearing it'd be a waste of time and an expensive movie ticket. However, I do feel somewhat stupid about this now that I've actually watched the movie, and found it largely enjoyable. Not a great film, mind you, as there are a few too many flaws here for it to reach the standards of a genuine sci-fi classic like District 9.The writing was a little clunky at times, there were some strange plot conveniences here and there, the dialogue was a little hit and miss, and I wasn't really sure that the members of the rap group Die Antwoord were well suited to acting (never listened to their music, but I don't think acting's their strong suite). On the topic of acting, most of the rest of the cast were pretty decent. Hugh Jackman's definitely been better, but he did an okay job considering he was playing a relatively straightforward villainous role. Sigourney Weaver was kinda underused, but generally fine, while Dev Patel did a good job at playing the lead 'human' character. And Sharlto Copley was really good as the voice of Chappie- his delivery was all around pretty great, and really helped make the title character sympathetic, charismatic, and likable.There's a few decent action scenes, some funny moments and lines here and there, and overall, the film moves at a good pace throughout, never feeling boring. But there's certainly less substance and food for thought here than I'm used to seeing in a Neil Blomkamp film, even if there's a good deal of style, with the film being generally well-shot and nice to look at. It's pretty good entertainment, and a nice way to kill a couple of hours, but there's a few too many problems scattered throughout to make it a great film, as well as being a little shallower than I was expecting. I doubt it'll stick with me, but I certainly don't regret watching it.",Chappie

85,brchthethird,"Well-intentioned, but messy -- only scrapes the surface of its interesting themes",7,22 June 2015,"Neill Blomkamp has yet to live up to the promise displayed in DISTRICT 9, which still holds up as one of the best science-fiction films of the last decade. CHAPPIE, while still featuring some awesome special effects and lightly touching on important AI-related themes, feels rather commercial in comparison. It's as if the strong reaction against the overt social messaging in ELYSIUM caused him to back further in the other direction. That's not to say that what he created here isn't good. It's quite entertaining actually. The problem is that the film lacks focus for a good portion of its running time, and also gets a little too cartoonish for its own good at times. The basics of the plot is that a scientist/programmer (Dev Patel) who works for a a weapons company comes up with a program for consciousness. Under the nose of his boss (Sigourney Weaver), he tests it out on a defective police robot scheduled for destruction, but only after it is stolen by a pair of a gangsters (played by Die Antwoord) who want to use it to commit crimes. The setup for the plot is probably the most interesting part of the whole film, with the potential to discuss the meaning of consciousness, what it means to be alive. Instead, it opts to spend a lot of its time devoted to teaching Chappie (Sharlto Copley) how to emulate its ""parents"" (Die Antwoord), who have a serious acting deficiency and are gratingly profane at times. Then there's the rival co-worker of Dev Patel's character (Hugh Jackman) who is saddled with playing a cartoonish villain more suited to a ROBOCOP movie than this one. Also, Sigourney Weaver is wasted as the company boss. Even still, the film manages to pull itself together in the final 30 minutes and salvage what, up to that point, had been rather mediocre at best. In this final act, however lightly, it delves a little deeper into themes I wish had been the central focus all along as Chappie is faced with the choice to do good or evil, and ""his"" own mortality. There's also some well-done action as well. The film's undeniable strength comes from its impeccable production design and visual effects, as well as the performances (save Die Antwoord: please don't let them act again), despite the characters lacking depth outside of Chappie. The film also has a decent score courtesy of Hans Zimmer. As far as AI-related films go this year, CHAPPIE is hardly the best, but it is quite enjoyable and watchable. If you go in with reduced expectations, I don't see why you wouldn't have a good time.",Chappie
86,blott2319-1,"Die Die Antwoord, please",4,11 March 2020,"I've seen Short Circuit many times before, and it's hard to deny that Chappie is extremely reminiscent of that film. The biggest difference between the two is that the people who end up in possession of Chappie are the most annoying human beings in South Africa. I know that Die Antwoord is a thing down there, but I swear their faux ""gangsta"" personalities are even more offensive than Fisher Stevens playing an Indian man. Every moment they were on screen, I was annoyed and wishing they would shut up. Then at the end, for some reason, they expect us to fear for their lives. I was anxious for them to die and stop ruining the movie. The funny thing is Hugh Jackman is also delivering a ridiculously over-the-top performance, but I didn't mind at all. It works coming from him, and he's supposed to be the villain anyways.The sad truth is, there's a decent film at the heart of Chappie. The visual effects of the robot are amazing, and Sharlto Copley's motion capture and voice work are brilliant. He embodies the innocence of a robot with an infantile mind to perfection. I also thought Dev Patel worked well as the brains behind the robots, and his conflict with Chappie made sense and created the one effective emotional arc in the film. It's just too bad that Neill Blomkamp decided to build the story around his friends Yo-Landi and Ninja instead of simply concentrating on what would make for the best film. I want to like this movie more, and it has a number of elements that I did enjoy. But I will probably just go back to watch Short Circuit or Robocop to get all the same story beats in a better film, despite the fact that Chappie had potential to be on par with one of those movies.",Chappie

We are in Johannesburg in the very near future and we are told that crime was so high in the recent past, that the police force was entirely automatized in the form of robot cops (the Robocop franchise is clearly an influence on this movie) and as a result crime has considerably fallen (though there are still a lot of heavily armed gangs around). The robots are made by a greedy company named Tetravaal (whose CEO is played by Sigourney Weaver) and whose two main engineers seems to be the nerdy Indian Deon (Dev Patel, who dreams to somehow incorporate conscience into the robots), and a nasty ex soldier (played by Hugh Jackman) whose rival project is a sort of tank cum robot (the battle of two sort of robots was also at Robocop). Eventually, one of the robot cops end up on the hands of a criminal gang, who kidnap Deon in order to make him program the robot to become a master criminal.This is just the beginning (the movie is almost two hours long) and much more things happen in the movie, which I do not reveal.

Gradually however it is in wrong hands doing wrong and the story sets in to maintain everything.The first 1/3rd of film made me think, it's good for maybe 14 yrs old. Well to understand consciousness n getting it downloaded in device, even if acceptable, cant b made to give to handle to those junkies even at cost of one's life. It's okay if one does not think much. Its d idea that occurred in last 20 minutes made the movie shine. Numerous conscious devices, kept aloof from feelings such as touch and now my friends they will learn to serve society in real terms. Extra mark for last 20 minute,s. Fairly recommended.",Chappie
89,Bob-45,"An instant classic, joining ""Robocop"" and ""Terminator 2"" as best of the genre",10,12 July 2015,"Given the insipid ad campaign by Sony for ""Chappie,"" I did not expect much. Boy, was I surprised. ""Chappie"" joins ""Robocop"" and Terminator 2"" as best of the genre, whose theme is ""Do we have a soul; and is the 'soul' what makes us 'human'""? However, while ""Robocop"" and ""T2"" asked this question indirectly, while engaging in great action and dark comedy, ""Chappie"" approaches it directly, while still providing exciting entertainment without the preachiness of ""T2"". Let us say, while ""Robocop"" and ""T2"" struck gold by variations on familiar paths, ""Chappie"" takes ""the road less traveled"" and strikes platinum. I certainly hope, when the Academy and the Writers Guild are selecting ""Best Screenplay"" nominees, ""Chappie"" is one of them.""Chappie"" takes the ""Simpson's dysfunctional family"" approach, providing ""Chappie"" with an extended family of violent drug dealers. Yet, despite their chosen profession and lifestyle, each of the ""family"" members possess strong redeeming elements of likability, humor, heroism and self-sacrifice. Most notable among these is ""Mommy"" (Yo-landi Visser), whose off-putting makeup and wardrobe hides an unconventionally beautiful woman, both physically and spiritually. As Chappie's creator, Dev Patel creates an even more engaging ""science geek"" than the male cast members of ""The Big Bang Theory"". Dev reminds me a bit of Rahul Kholi on ""IZombie"". His ""home helper"" robots are absolutely adorable; and they perfectly reflect Rahul's character.While Sigorney Weaver is a bit typecast, Hugh Jackman provides perfect contrast to his usual ""stalwart hero"" roles. One keeps expecting Jackman to turn out to be the ""hero"" of this piece; and THAT is good casting.Hans Zimmer provides his usual, beautifully appropriate music to ""Chappie"". His music particularly raises the adrenalin-level of what are really pretty conventional action scenes.I can see no way anyone could improve on ""Chappie"". Thus, I feel fully justified in giving ""Chappie"" a resounding ""10"".",Chappie
90,RforFilm,"Chappie the robot wants to live, but Chappie the movie is more like a violent gun crazy kid on too much sugar",4,6 March 2015,"Much of us have commented that we are nearly on the brink of creating artificial intelligence, but if regular people use the Siri on their iPhones to make calls or hear about the weather, then it would seem like that we have been using it for a while. When most people think about artificial intelligence, they assume that a Stephen Hawking-like machine will be able to teach a class the next day, but they don't seem to understand the definition. Having intelligence doesn't quite mean genius, so that intelligence could only apply to a bit of information like what your phones are telling you. So if we have this so called intelligence, then why is everyone still complaining that we don't have it yet?I think what people really want are computers that have the intelligence capabilities of a person; one of such that can also think and have emotions. What's tough for most scientists is that our emotions are complicated, spreading a lot of similar ideas (such as jealousy and envy, and love and lust) that are difficult to claim a difference in. So what a lot of people seem to want out of machines and robots are artificial consciences. One such robot acquires one in Chappie. In 2016 in Johannesburg, crime levels have gotten so high that the human police force cannot keep up with the demand and must employ robot droid to assist, as built by engineer Deon Wilson (played by Dev Patel). His machines are a success and is asked to continue providing these things by his boss Michelle (played by Sigourney Weaver), though he seems more interested in progressing the innovation of the robot mind. Meanwhile, two criminals, Ninja and Yolandi (played by the South African rap group of the same name) are planning a big heist to pay off a war lord and are looking for a way to shut off the droid to accomplish this. The two crooks manage to kidnap Deon and find a droid in the back of his van. Deon reveals that he's been working on a droid that can think for itself. They turn him on to see that the robot is just like a child. Yolandi names him ""Chappie"" (as voiced by Sharlto Copley) and decides to raise him as one of their own. Deon would rather not have his robot be trained for criminal purposes, though Ninja and Yolandi insist that they are the parents. As Chappie learns more about being alive and the privilege to think and feel, Fellow engineer Vincent Moore (played by Hugh Jackman) is looking to use a giant robot of his own creation and the existence of Chappie may finally gives him that excuse. I'll give credit to Chappie as it has an interesting idea of a robot with the first artificial conscience (even though I know I've seen this story before in Short Circuit). The robot effects are really good and barley seem like CGI. Chappie himself is well portrayed like an autistic savant and I'm intrigued to see how his emotions are developed. I just wished that the rest of the movie was just as interesting.Director Neil Blomkamp is a man with a lot of good ideas with his stories, but they seem to have similar problems; that narrative concepts are thrown out in the middle of the story in place of more action and gunfire. There's an entire fight with a big droid that barley feels needed, not to mention that the big heist that's talked about is surprisingly glanced over. My other issue with Chappie is that most of the other characters are unlikable. Ninja and Yolandi are clearly new to acting as they seem to sway from subtle to very over the top. I think that the movie was trying to make them complex characters, but their actions make them unlikable to support as protagonists. Even Hugh Jackman tends to overact a bit here. The only one I give credit for is Dev Patel who seems to breath more human emotion into his character then the other people.I'll give this four Chappies out of ten. Perhaps is Chappie's tone was changed from a hard R adult to something more like a PG-13 blockbuster along with better direction, we might have gotten something out of this. But grim tone and bad acting prevent Chappie from showing us it's desired thought.",Chappie
91,Anurag-Shetty,A not very original yet effective movie about Artificial Intelligence.,8,17 March 2015,"Chappie is a movie set in the future, where the human police force has been replaced by a robotic police force. The man behind these police droids, Deon Wilson(Dev Patel), wants to make the robots even more advanced. When a police droid is rejected, Deon uses this droid to test his latest idea. This gives birth to Chappie(Sharlto Copley), a robot that is capable of thoughts & emotions. One of Deon's colleagues, Vincent Moore(Hugh Jackman) is completely against artificially intelligent robots. He finds out about Chappie. Now, Vincent will stop at nothing to eradicate Chappie & it is up to Deon to protect Chappie at any cost. Chappie is a welcome addition to the sci-fi genre. Chappie is really adorable. The way Chappie learns about life & people is the highlight of the film. Chappie's innocence is endearing. Though Chappie is a robot with a fixed face, he is capable of making the viewers laugh & cry. The action sequences & special effects of the movie are outstanding. If I could pinpoint anything wrong with the film its that, the concepts in it have been done before many times. A few examples are Transcendence & Big Hero 6. However, Chappie is not nearly as lovable as Baymax! Another flaw of the film is that brilliant actors like Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver & Dev Patel are given significantly less screen time even though they're the top billed cast. Instead, lesser known actors like Ninja & Yo-Landi Visser are given more screen time. Sharlto Copley is incredible as Chappie. Copley's voice actually sounds like a robot's voice without getting monotonous. Also, brilliant work by the motion capture team to bring Copley's Chappie to life. Dev Patel is excellent as Deon Wilson. Ninja & Yo-Landi Visser are effective as Ninja & Yolandi. Jose Pablo Cantillo is good as Yankie(Amerika). Hugh Jackman is unforgettable as Vincent Moore. It is refreshing to see Jackman in a villainous role & he hits it out of the ballpark. Sigourney Weaver is great as Michelle Bradley. Brandon Auret is annoying as Hippo. Despite its flaws, Chappie is worth a watch.",Chappie

93,Vivekmaru45,Under The Shadow Of District 9(2009).,5,1 August 2015,"I call films of this sort toilet-paper films. I find the film is specifically catered towards keeping South African viewers happy. In the film there is a scene which evoked strong feelings of the era of apartheid which was prevalent from 1948 to 1994. District 9 had a decent plot about it which kept the viewer engrossed till the end. In this film, we have a robot that achieves a distinct personality that develops with each character that he comes into contact with. The choices this robot make is entirely his own. Eventually the head of the company that manufactured him orders its destruction.Plot in brief: In an effort to combat a record high crime rate in the city of Johannesburg, the South African government purchases a squadron of state-of-the-art, armour-plated A.I. attack robots from American weapons manufacturer Tetravaal, developed by British engineer Deon Wilson. A competing project is the remotely controlled MOOSE, developed by Australian soldier-turned-engineer Vincent Moore. The robots are an instant success, wiping out some of the city's most powerful drug and organised crime gangs in a matter of months, and before long, Tetravaal move their main headquarters to Johannesburg. Deon receives plenty of recognition for the company's success, but Vincent grows jealous when the police are unwilling to give his heavy weapons platform equal attention. At home, Deon creates a prototype artificial intelligence that mimics a human mind to the point of feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley refuses to let him test the A.I. on a police robot. Undeterred, Deon steals a recently damaged robot before it is destroyed and puts it in his van, along with the ""guard key"" needed to update the robot's software. On his way home, he is kidnapped by a group of gangsters, Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika, who threaten to kill him unless he reprograms a police robot to fight for them. Deon installs the new software into the damaged robot, which responds with childlike terror upon powering up. Deon and Yolandi calm the robot, teaching it words and naming it ""Chappie"". Verdict: special effects, sound-effects and photography is up to today's standard. The cast and acting is decent. The director directs ditto to the script and does not alter the script to make it more appealing to international viewers. Blomkamp's regular choice Sharlto Copley is here, along with veteran Hollywood actors Sigourney Weaver, Hugh Jackman and British actor Dev Patel. S.A. Rockstars Watkin Tudor Jones (Ninja) and Yolandi Visser of the South African zef rap-rave group Die Antwoord are also present in the film. Hugh Jackman gives an impressive performance in a negative role. The star of the film is undeniably Dev Patel. He gives a superb performance and this will give him more film offers.

Unfortunately, the entourage in which he is ""born"" is not very normal or pleasant so he will soon begin to inherit bad habits, while his maker continuously tries to teach him good. Although having a very good idea, this movie turned out to be a terrible example of how to not make a film. The story is linear, predictable, boring and truly stupid. The whole plot is in fact stupid, filled with dull, unsympathetic and even idiotic characters, who actually make this technological wonder look really bad. Furthermore, the whole movie is filled with plot holes, inconsistencies and even inexplicable events which absolutely ruin the overall experience. You cannot tell people that you can simply steal a robot, be it ready for disposal, from a state of the art facility without anyone noticing or even asking a question, while at the same time ""borrowing"" the security master key for two full days until someone actually raises an eyebrow. It's ridiculous and absurd, not to say the fact that the movie bases its entire action on a robot with a conscience which ends up getting raised by drug dealers, who simply act like retarded monkeys. Couldn't they have come with something which is not completely stupid and somehow end up with something even remotely interesting? Or at least not as insulting... And to think that they had two great actors which ended up with bad side characters which couldn't do anything to salvage this sinking ship. Oh, and to add the cherry on top of the cake, the finale is in tone with the rest of the movie, being unsatisfying, inconclusive and even dumb.Overall, it's another movie which had a good premise but somehow managed to turn it into such a bad movie as this one is.

95,abisio,"An incredible original mix of sci-fi, sweet moments and extremely violent scenes",9,10 March 2015,"A few years ago; Neill Blomkamp; from South Africa, came up with a strange and quite original sci-fi movie called ""District 9""; filmed in the worst part of Johannesburg; with had an open ending that left everybody wanting for more. The movie had a well deserved success; however Blomkamp follow up was ""Elysium""; a Hollywood expensive (and quite controlled) production with big stars; that did not reach the greatness of his previous work. Now; the guy bring us a cheaper (but far less Hollywood controlled) sci-fi tale; filmed again in Johannesburg dumps; that will work every possible emotion you can have with an open but quite strange ending. Dev Patel (a great actor that really deserves more work) is Deon; an engineer working for a public corporation who has developed a droid used to help the police forces. The droids are a selling very good; but Deon wants to implement Artificial Intelligence in the droids. Something his boss do not allow; so he steals a damaged but partially operational droid to make an experiment. However, three tugs (Ninja, Yolandi and Jose Pablo Cantilo ) kidnap him and the droid. When Deon install the AI the droid starts acting like a child so Yolandi; a drug addict with failed maternal desires; name him Chappie and start treating as a kid while Ninja tries to use it for a robbery. Deon is released; but he refuse to leave because he wants to follow up Chappie's building conscience. There is also another engineer; Vincent (Hugh Jackman in an unexpected bad / nuts guy role) envious of Deon success; discover the new Intelligent droid and tries to sabotage everything creating a total chaos. The movie goes from a very violent start to tender moments (Chappie is adorable and innocent) to dramatic situations (Ninja refuse to consider himself a father), to comedy (Chappie becomes a gang member) to more violent and sometimes quite gory situations to a dramatic, tense and even more violent third act and finally to a poetic ending (depending your religion beliefs). There is no boring moment and laughs or suspense grow easily and unexpected.In brief; if Chappie catch you emotional handle; it will keep you tied up until the very end. If you are a cold and insensitive person you will notice only the violence and perhaps part of the humor; if you are a person of certain faith; you will probably hated it but in any case is a great movie for everybody but not for kids.",Chappie
96,witster18,The Tale of Two Halves,8,20 December 2016,"The first half of ""Chappie"" is plodding and stage-like, a bit hokey, and not all that entertaining. It's an extended set-up that might hurt the film and lose some viewers by the mid-way point. That's what happened to me. I became disinterested and didn't think much of the film because I found something else to do.A few months later I picked-up about where I left-off, and kicked myself in the butt for giving up on it. The last half of Chappie is immensely entertaining and runs at 8000RPM, and never slows down. The subtleties of the first half of the film come full-circle, and the film makes a colossal comeback.This is a really good movie. I think the 6.9 current rating is probably a product of some incomplete viewings. One shouldn't rate anything that they haven't watched in full. The action in the second half is truly incredible. The emotional aspects are too. This is a solid flick, but you have to stick with it.THe film just doesn't seem to ""get out of a box"" for the first 45 minutes, but when it breaks out, it breaks-out in a really big way. The fire alarm gets pulled and it is chaos in the best way possible for movie fans. I wouldn't have thought this would make my top 25 upon my abbreviated 1rst viewing, but I have moved this into the Top 25 of 2015 since finishing- it(17?). I recommend this.

The genius behind these machines is Deon Wilson (Dev Patel). His rival, war-mongrel Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) wants his own device up and running. And he will do just about anything to discredit Wilson, even if it means foul play. When Scout #22 is damaged from a routine take down, Wilson bestows the idea to upload an experimental program into the robot's neural network. Wilson and Scout #22 are abducted by a group of drug dealers (played by Ninja and Yo-landi from the band Die Antwoord), where he is forced to upload the software into the robot in order to assist them on a $20 million heist. Scout #22 becomes Chappie, the first machine to be able to think on his own and learn new features like a human child. The core of ""Chappie"" is the titular character's relationship with others and how they mold him into either doing good or bad actions. Yo-landi takes up the mantle as the nurturing mother figure that wants him to find his own way while Ninja poses as the violent father figure, who only wants to use him for his own unsavory activities. Interestingly, director Neill Blomkamp chose to keep the band members' names as the character names. Both neophyte actors do not deliver bad performances, but they could have been better. Their characters are rather one-dimensional and flat. The same goes for most of the other cast members. Sigourney Weaver as the CEO of the robot company has too little screen time to develop at all. Dev Patel plays the idealistic genius too well to the point that he feels more like a caricature than an actual character. Hugh Jackman is somewhat of an effective antagonist and his motives are clear for wanting to derail Wilson and his pet project, but his over-the-top performance makes him someone not to be taken seriously. Then there is Chappie, played by Sharlto Copley in a MOCAP suit. From his movements and voice (digitally altered of course), he rivals the prowess of Andy Serkis. He has a natural energy about him that for the whole two hours, I failed to see his character as a man in a dotted suit. By default, much sentimentality is given to Chappie for his innocent and childlike behavior. This never gets in the way for the audience to enjoy the robot with manlike features and bunny eared antennas. The quieter moments, such as him learning new words or how to paint a picture make this a more worthwhile movie over the action and explosions. Sadly though, they are often interrupted by gunfire or mass destruction. Like so many past sci-fi movies like ""E.T."" or ""The Iron Giant,"" Chappie is another non-human character we can feel sympathy for. The overall pacifist personality he exhibits is a nice touch, too.Neill Blomkamp never seems to escape his location of home, depicting trash invested regions, criminals that prove to be anti-heroes instead of villains, Afrikaans dialog, and a gratuitous amount of violence. Fortunately no bodies are blown to pieces, though one guy does get ripped in half. Chappie exceeds over its director's previous film ""Elysium."" It takes a potentially cool idea and charges forward with some avenue of success. ""Chappie"" is simply a movie too enjoy. Very easily, with some more polish and time geared toward re-written script drafts, this could have been the best science-fiction film of the decade. Blomkamp still has not yet reached the masterpiece level that I know he can. ""Chappie"" though is still lots of fun and it has some heart.",Chappie
101,Likes_Ninjas90,"While not an entirely brainless experiment, too many scrap parts in the script lead Chappie and its cast astray",5,15 March 2015,"Chappie is set in futuristic South Africa where the police have employed robotic officers to fight criminal gangs. When one of the robots is seemingly destroyed in a gunfight, engineer Wilson Deon (Dev Patel) looks to recover the body and repair it. This is despite resistance from his boss Michelle (Sigourney Weaver) and ongoing intimidation from rival employee Vincent (Hugh Jackman) who wants his overlarge, clunky robot design funded. When Deon manages to steal the robot and brings it to life he is kidnapped by a small group of criminals, led by Ninja (played by rapper Ninja). These thugs are looking to use the robot to help them with a final heist, which will get another mobster off their back. Ninja and Yolandi (rapper Yolandi Visser) take to educating the robot, naming him Chappie, and raise him like a child. Yolandi becomes a mother figure to him but Ninja teaches him in his words how to be the ""number one ill-gangster"", which results more clearly in Chappie learning to carjack people and becoming more violent, much to the protest of Deon.There is a lot to dislike about Chappie, the third film by Neill Blomkamp whose first two films District 9 and Elysium took place in dystopian South Africa and featured Sharlto Copley. His film style this time is overcharged, impatient and adolescent. The score booms and the film blasts its way through action sequences and rarely stops to let us time to breathe. This is a shame because in spite of many flaws there is something bizarrely endearing about Chappie the robot rather than the overall film. Voiced and motion captured by Copley, Chappie is childlike, fearful and curious against the backdrop of the war zone and the criminal minds. His personality traits provides a degree of poignancy in the all too rare moments where the film slows down and we see Chappie reading a children's book or being tormented by his father figure to embrace the alpha male culture and tough love. At one point Chappie has to hide a doll from his father behind his back and is also thrown into the wild alone where he's attack by gang thugs and set on fire. It's a very silly story, particularly when stealing the cars, but there's some trace of a thematic spine and sci-fi tropes sprinkled between the gunfire.Outside Chappie's character arc and a potentially rich but derivative premise about social conditioning (borrowed from The Terminator, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, Her), the rest of the film is about as useful and overblown as Vincent's clunky robot scheme. Whether by design or not, Ninja looks suitable ragged but he and fellow rapper Yolandi Visser (from their group Die Antwoord) are weak actors and provide unintentional belly laughs. Their on the nose dialogue is terrible, particularly when talking about preparing one last heist and teaching Chappie how to act ""gangster"". They don't earn our sympathies when they become heroic in the predictably overblown finale. During the latter, a stupid sequence, the film's video game aspirations are unleashed as a character operates a joystick and virtual reality style device to unload volumes of firepower. Dave Patel is more restrained than in the recent Marigold sequel but outside his love of electronics there's no logic or reason about why Deon returns to a dangerous hotspot with gun-wielding criminals to check on Chappie. Hugh Jackman is poorly directed and undeserved by the script. In an intrusive subplot, his character never breaks free from a simple brood and Sigourney Weaver's small role is a throwaway one which doesn't make enough of her screen power. While not an entirely brainless experiment, too many scrap parts in the script lead Chappie and its cast astray.",Chappie
102,Imdbidia,"Funny, entertaining and thought-provoking",7,28 January 2017,"I had a great time watching Chappie, and I thought it was entertaining, light and funny, and gathers the main themes that pervade Blomkamp's filmography.Chappie connects more with District 9 than with Elyseum in themes and format. Like District 9, Chappie starts with a sort of mock newsreel about the amazing development of robotics and how we have gotten to the situation from which the story departs. Like District 9, the end of this film provides a mutation of the main character into something else that is, at the same time, human and not human. Like District 9, there is a reflection on the nature of what makes us human, and how ""humanity"" shows in humans.Some of the more philosophical points are presented in the same light-hearted way. Is having consciousness what makes us human? Or is it a mix of both body and consciousness? If you transplant the consciousness of a human being into a robot, would that robot be able to behave like a human, with feelings, reason and ethical codes? On the other hand, the focus on Chappie's education is not gratuitous, because is queries, albeit hilariously, on what makes us human: is it our consciousness? Our upbringing? The milieu in which we grow up? Our inner compass? Our options in life? Our choices? Our inner programming? Assimov served as choc-chip in a scoop of refreshing ice-cream.I found most actors correct in their respective roles. I was especially surprised by Jackman, an actor I usually don't like, but I thought he was good as the badass Vincent Moore; he should play more baddies! I also liked some of the other baddies, especially the couple of Sudafrican rappers who play ""daddy"" (Ninja), ""mummy"" (Yo-Landi Visser), and of course ""Chappie"" Copley. Sharlto is really a versatile actor, who is believable playing any role you throw at him, and he does a terrific job at infusing Chappie with life and soul.The film does not dig into the nature and motives of all the main characters, except for Chappie. We meet the characters at a certain stage in their lives and we aren't provided with any background, and that is, precisely, the weakest link of the story.I found some of the premises of the movie a homage or retake on the original Robocop, a movie that I watched too many times in the past not to recognize it if it's referenced to. Was that referencing necessary? Well, I don't know. Watch Chappie as a light-hearted science-fiction, as it was intended, and you will enjoy it much more than if you expect a galactic battle or a lecture on philosophical issues revolving robotics. However, you will find that the movie is not only funny, but it also makes some valid points of reflection on those very issues that many people don't see despite having them right in front of the noses. Not the best science-fiction film out there, for sure, but a good one, and one that I truly enjoyed.",Chappie
103,CANpatbuck3664,"A True Disappointment, I Expected A Lot More Considering Who Was Involved",3,17 January 2016,"It's hard leaving previous loyalties behind. I think we want to love Neil Blomkamp's work unconditionally. I also think when most people saw the trailer for Chappie we saw that it was from the director of District 9 and we all started jumping up and down and there's nothing wrong with that. District 9 is awesome, one of the best science fiction movies ever made and although the reception of Elysium was mixed I found it to be a fun action/science fiction mix although it wasn't deep like District 9. I wasn't sure about Chappie as there seemed to be a disparity between negative critical reception but most of the crowd reports were positive. I decided to see Chappie and I couldn't have been more disappointed, this was probably the worst movie I saw last year.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The film starts with a documentary style telling of how police robots were created to control crime in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. These robots were created by the company Tetravaal and have been a resounding success. The chief developer for these robots was Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) and although the robots are selling well and his superior Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) is happy with their performance, Deon has been working on a side project. He has developed an artificial intelligence program and wants a chance to test it which is denied by Michelle. But Deon decides his program needs to be tested and he steals a damaged police model robot and tries to bring it to a secluded area for those purposes.But he is intercepted by a group of gangsters Ninja (Ninja), Yolandi (Yolandi) and Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) who have recently run afoul of a gang lord named Hippo and are in debt of $20 million. They take the robot, thinking that with the advantage of having a super soldier on their side plus perhaps inside info on the police, they'll be able to execute a heist to gain the money to pay off Hippo. Also important to know is that in the Tetravaal office is rival developer Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) who has developed a different prototype which is more keyed towards being aggressive, as opposed to Deon's more low-key and functional robots. Vincent doesn't like Deon and is looking for an edge to take Deon down.When I talk about a movie that I didn't like, I try to get to the positives first, no matter how small they are. The locations are suitably dirty and gritty, the design of the robots is interesting and they're well animated (even though the MOOSE is basically a giant murder bot, it at least looked cool). I thought Sharlto Copley's vocal performance lent a lot to Chappie (he out-shined the rest of the cast despite never appearing on the screen as his performance of Chappie was not motion capture, the character was CGI). In terms of positives, that's about all I have.The biggest problem with Chappie isn't the acting or the ideas the film was created around. The problem with Chappie is the predictability of the plot and the awful characters. Starting with the characters, there isn't a single likable one in the movie. Chappie is supposed to be our hero and you want to latch onto him but he's too much of a blank slate, he has little personality and he's being manipulated into doing awful things by awful people. Deon is compassionate towards Chappie but he's a wuss and even though he's dealing with dangerous people his expectations of both them and his creation are unrealistic and removed from reality. Yolandi is the closest of our gangster characters to being human but she knows what they're doing to Chappie is wrong and goes along with it. Ninja and Amerika aren't remotely decent people, they're essentially Chappie's abusive step-dads, beating him up and feeding him bullshit. When they face the inevitable turn towards redemption, it happens on a dime and I didn't buy it. Lastly, Vincent is just a cardboard cutout of an evil adversary and Michelle is just your typical corporate disapproving boss who delivers stock lines and is just a plot device.The plot is completely predictable and when it deviates from formula it's dumb. The larger progression within the story, you can see coming after 20 minutes. When looking at the finer points of the story, I found myself either in complete disbelief or laughing. Chappie's intelligence jumps around rapidly, he can't understand that shooting or stabbing someone can cause death to believing he can solve the problem of life after death. Ninja, Yolandi and Amerika blindly believe that if they can come up with $20 million Hippo will let them go when it's clearly not about money. The fact that the design of Vincent's robot could be used for anything other than mass killings is a joke. It's the small things that made this movie so nonsensical to me that I couldn't take it seriously. The dialogue is also terrible.I haven't talked about the acting but all you need to know is that even though this is a cast full of talented people, they can't overcome the lacklustre material. A lot was made of the performances or Ninja and Yolandi because they aren't actors by trade, they're rappers. I would agree they aren't very strong but they aren't as detrimental to Chappie as they have been made out to be, the movie is weak around them not vice versa.When I heard Neil criticize himself for not spending enough time on Elysium's story, I was shocked. Elysium seems award worthy next to Chappie. I wanted this to be good, I didn't go in wanting to hate Chappie but it was what I described, a big disappointment. I hope Blomkamp can rebound from this, he's extremely talented but he's on a slide, let's hope it's short lived.",Chappie
104,Laakbaar,Skip this one,5,25 March 2015,"I love the genre, I loved Blomkamp's first movie and I love South Africa. This movie should have worked for me. However, it did not. Indeed, there was a moment when I seriously considered walking out. I would not recommend this movie to a friend.The dialogue and writing bothered me. It felt sophomoric. Cringeworthy at times. OK, maybe the story line as well. It felt too contrived and unbelievable. There were gaps and illogical jumps. Much of it was just childish.The cartoonish portrayal of the gangsters, their lives, their interactions, their lairs and their style bothered me. What was that all about? I hated Ninja. I appreciate their use of non-actors as the two gangster leads, but it didn't work for me.The strange mix of nationalities bothered me. What was a Latino doing there?? I loved that it was set in South Africa, but the portrayal of Johannesburg as a dreadful sh*thole bothered me. I was filled with regret that this has happened to what used to be Africa's greatest city.It was a mostly well executed movie, I suppose, but it didn't seem to me to be intelligent, sophisticated or good science fiction. Sorry to the people who worked so hard on it.It's worth about 4, but I'll give it a 5 for now because of the dynamic music and the one or two good moments in the film. The IMDb score is too high. If the IMDb score had been more accurate, I wouldn't have gone, and I would have been spared this.",Chappie

106,billygoat1071,Blockbuster Demands,6,5 March 2015,"Neill Blomkamp might be one of the most fascinating storytellers in blockbuster filmmaking today. His Sci-Fi stories are basically an allegory of the third world culture. Chappie now tackles the subject of being raised in a troubling environment. The movie becomes real engaging when it sticks to that mode, but the same problem of the director stays, as his enthusiasm of blockbuster filmmaking makes its important theme seem lost. It's not bad adding some explosions, except the major conflict of the plot bogs down its potential, turning it into a generic action film and also has a dumb climax with an ending that hardly makes sense. It should have been straightforward with its social analogy, because there the movie becomes really gripping.There's actually two stories involved in Chappie: one is how humans fear the artificial intelligence and how it would affect to the future of their society; the other is a robot who has to choose whether he is going to choose two paths: the wish of his maker or the life of an urban thug. The second story is much fascinating, Chappie is often described as a child who is still learning how the world works. The film makes some compelling points on how the robot influences from the reality; the good and the bad. But the film keeps getting hindered by blockbuster elements with a generic arrogant corporal villains, and of course, giant robots and bigger guns. The explosions are fine, but the ideas towards that side hardly felt like it belongs there, or at least helped improving the storyline. It might have first thought that it would make it more thrilling or entertaining, but the gangster side felt more natural at this concept, probably leading to a much powerful experience in the end.But when the third act comes, it keeps sprinkling more ideas that makes its core even more complicated. The movie is more intriguing when it keeps things smaller and slow, putting aside those bombastic battles and political conflict. The acting is alright. Sharlto Copley is in motion capture as Chappie and he brings a palpable full of energy, he decently captures the robot's growth in his environment, he may not be given a full character, but the performance keeps the character shine anyway. Dev Patel obviously does well as the film's serious heart of this weird world. Ninja and Yolandi plays the fictional version of themselves, which feels pretty self-indulgent, but does fine to the picture anyway, in spite of still wearing the merch of their Die Antwoord and the movie they are in. The best talents ended up playing the most unnecessary villains; with Hugh Jackman goes over-the-top as the villain who you'd love to hate (a lot like Stephen Lang in Avatar) while Sigourney Weaver is underused in a role that actually doesn't do much to the story.It seems like Chappie fears that it won't fit in today's realm of loud blockbusters, it's definitely not bold enough to be honest with itself, which is a shame. Blomkamp comes up with these interesting stories, but unable to fully comprehend with its actual message or something else. There is still a talk about the consequence of having artificial intelligence walking among us, but the movie is more powerful when it stays at its allegorical roots, getting to know the dark side of the streets and growing up in a violent world of crime, while struggle with fragile moral dilemmas, but as a blockbuster, it demands more explosions and clashing CGI effects. It's less interesting at that point. Chappie deserves more tweaks, I want Chappie to be better than that.",Chappie

108,RevRonster,What a disappointment...,4,30 June 2015,"I still think ""District 9"" is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and I also enjoy ""Elysium."" So, needless to say, I was pretty excited for Neill Blomkamp's new film ""Chappie."" I will concede that Blomkamp isn't the most subtle when it comes to his messages in his films but I can overlook that. I can even overlook how glaring it is that ""Chappie"" looks like a gritty reboot of ""Short Circuit"" and its sequel. The movie has Sharlto Copley as a robot who becomes sentient and Hugh Jackman doing something rare and playing a villain, I was onboard.Maybe I set my sights too high but this film disappointed me greatly. While there are some great actors in the film (like Sigourney Weaver, Hugh Jackman, and Sharlto Copley), pretty much none of them really get their time to shine due to a weak script that does little to develop the characters. Pretty much all characters are one-dimensional and all of them go through little to almost no growth. Chappie is the only one that kinda/sorta grows as a character but, even then, it's not as significant or as deep as it could have been.Additionally, this film has a lot of bad acting in it. Mostly in the form of the rap duo Die Antwoord. While not disgustingly bad, the duo are too cartoonish to take seriously in their role and were impossible for me to take seriously as gangsters.Finally, the film feels weak as it takes the deep Sci-Fi concepts of Artificial Intelligence and the philosophical concepts of what constitutes being alive and what defines consciousness and does very little with them. Granted, these are hard concepts to grapple with but it feels like writers Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell felt they tackled it slightly enough and rather than go any deeper they just decided to add more fluff sequences of Chappie learning what it is to be cool from a guy in a mullet.I will admit the film has some awesome special effects but, as the credits rolled, that proved to be the only thing I walked away enjoying about the film. I really wanted to like ""Chappie"" but it just was disappointing to me and I just did not find it entertaining.Greetings, fellow humans! The name is Rev.

I'm speaking mostly of Sharlto Copley who plays Chappie, This generation's Johnny 5.Can't help to observe that Blomkamp's story content gets weaker and replaced with Hollywood visuals and style, but I guess that is the price that has to be paid in order to get the money to do these type of sci-fi movies that star Hugh Jackman as a Mullett wearing ultimate bad co-worker trying to push his project through, over the more ideal work of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel's Dev Patel in a plot similar to the original RoboCop, all the way down to the similarities between the Moose in this film and Ed 209 in RoboCop.Although there is some social commentary, like with his last movies, This one taking a look at police corruption, Neill is more focus on Earth evolution similar to Autómata starring Antonio Banderas, with the foundation of the ideas of what happens when man itself creates something that can replace it as the ""superior being"" on this planet.Though I must admit this is not Blomkamp's best film, Chappie is a really good movie, perfect for fans of District 9 and Elysium.",Chappie

111,MattBrady099,Chappie the ass-hole robot.,4,14 March 2015,"Chappie: ""I've got blings?... I've got blings!"". That's the kind of dialogue you get from this movie and I was actually forward to this until I sawed.The story is about a near future, crime is patrolled by an oppressive mechanized police force. But now, the people are fighting back. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. As powerful, destructive forces start to see Chappie as a danger to mankind and order, they will stop at nothing to maintain the status quo and ensure that Chappie is the last of his kind.I remembered watching the first trailer for Chappie and being so moved and so interested in the idea of a Short Circuit mash with a little violent future with the street gangs and people just being A- holes to each other. I got pumped for the movie and Neill Blomkamp hasn't disappointed me yet and some people may dislike Elysium but to me I enjoyed that film and I really enjoyed District 9, I mean it was such a original, new and today's Sci-Fi classic. So why on earth wouldn't I not be looking forward to this movie. After seeing the movie, you know what else hurts more than pain? Disappointment.Let's first start of with the positive things in this movie: Sharlto Copley did a fantastic job playing Chappie and he also did great doing the Motion capture. Copley really brought life to his character and it was a good choice to do. Dev Patel was also good as well, his character was the only likable human being in the whole movie, so was Chappie before he turns into a little ass-hole later on.The visual effect's was good as well. What Neill Blomkamp dose well in his movies is blend in effect's and story together smoothly and well done. The action scenes were shot very well and the sound mixing & editing were really good.Now for the bad and there's a lot: The two band members in this movie Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser who are known as Die Antwoord for they band name, well the acting from those two was not very good...it was god awful bad. These two really can't act and I heard that they never had acting lesson's before and this is basically they first time in a movie acting and it shows really well. They character's in the movie have to be the most annoying, unlikable and scum of the earth A-holes that I wanted to die because they were bad people doing bad things.Later on in the movie Chappie himself turns into a big dick to everyone. He throws grenades at people and steals people cars. Are main hero everyone, when his not treating or hurting people he goes around talking gangster in that annoying voice of his and at's rude to everyone around. Chappie the ass-hole robot.Hugh Jackman as the villain is the stick in the mood bland villain that his plains don't work or don't really make any sense at all. Sigourney Weaver only has a couple of scenes in this movie and her character doesn't really do anything special or anything worth talking about.I love Han Zimmer music in every movie his a part of and in this movie his music once again was great to listen to, but that quickly stopped as the music changed into Die Antwoord music and I know some people out there are fans of they music but I'm not. This has to be the worst and the most annoying peace of music I ever heard, it was trash music and I hated it.Listen, you had no idea how much I wanted this to be good, actually I wanted this to be amazing, but I was extremely disappointed and kind of upset that this turned out bad. The movie could have Neill Blomkamp second best film and it could broken new grounds with it's story and message that's true to life, but no, you know what we got? Annoying human characters that I couldn't give a damn if they die or not, and the movie itself was a big giant mess, I'm pretty shocked how messy this film is.I'm sorry everyone but this movie was awful.",Chappie
112,Al_The_Strange,Illest robot in tha hood,8,11 March 2015,"Can a machine posses a consciousness? Will a robot be able to feel, or express itself with art, or judge morality? Sci-fi has asked these questions before in everything from the books of Isaac Asimov to Star Trek. In the hands of Neill Blomkamp, who previously explored the possibility of aliens in the ghettos of Johannesburg, tackles the subject of robot sentience...once again in the slums of Joburg.Chappie borrows a few aspects from other movies we're probably already familiar with: the idea of a robotic police force echoes RoboCop, and Chappie's exploration of the outside world immediately brings Short Circuit to mind. Watching Chappie become a gangster might have been inspired by Bender from Futurama, and his body is like a slimmed-down version of Briareos from Appleseed. One other robot resembles a Mechwarrior. However, the film plays with all the same textures and themes that Blomkamp previously explored in District 9 and Elysium: all these movies share common character archetypes, plot structures, and settings.So Chappie might not be anything new, but it is a funny little animal in its own right. Most of the film focuses on Chappie, the robot created in secret by a company scientist who wanted to grant consciousness to his machines. Chappie winds up in the hands of some thugs, who try to mold him into a mean killing machine. What follows is often funny, as Chappie learns to talk all gangsta while learning the ways of the world. It can be sobering too, as Chappie is manipulated, beaten, and abused. It all builds up to a heavy-duty climax, complete with loud and bloody shoot-outs, and explosive robot fighting. The film may not have nearly as much action as Elysium or D9, but it is consistently entertaining and charming at times.The story could have used some refinement, as parts of it are condensed or left unexplained. There are a few contrivances or plot holes that can undoubtedly be found. However, the story does succeed in making Chappie a character we can care for, and his evolution from a newborn to a troubled and conflicted soul makes the story worth telling. In spite of this, the film unearths fascinating themes of morality and the nature of consciousness. I'd even go so far to say that the film has implicit parallels between Chappie's growth and the growth of all human beings, and it suggests that there's more to our short lives than mere money.As expected, this film captures its scuzzy crime-ridden settings with decent photography, plentiful amounts of slow-motion, and quality editing. Sharlto Copley's voice acting is quite lively and playful, matching the character well. In place of his usual villainous archetype, Hugh Jackman stands in and does a pretty good job playing a jerk. Sigourney Weaver is as great as ever, but her role is minimal. Yolandi and Ninja, of the band Die Antwoord, play themselves and are okay at it. And Dev Patel is not bad. Writing probably could have been fleshed out more, but it gets the job done. This production uses highly-detailed and real-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. Die Antwoord's music is featured throughout, and fits the movie well. The score by Hans Zimmer is pretty cool.This movie probably could have used refinement, but it is a satisfying sci-fi flick that offers a fair amount of thought food and a fair amount of action. It's probably best recommended to fans of robot sci-fi and fans of the director.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",Chappie
113,Offworld_Colony,I think I hated this film the first time I saw this...,7,6 February 2020,"...but upon seeing it a second time, knowing its flaws, of which there are many, but appreciating it as a piece of tremendous VFX work, solid directing, great cast and design, I enjoyed it a lot. Especially after Blomkamp's sister piece Elysium was such a backwards step from District 9, Chappie is a proper modern Cyberpunk story ripped straight from the novels, with a clever sort of abusive father figure in the hilarious Die Antwood's Ninja, a child-soldier allegory and Dev Patel's well-rounded Maker/Scientist character. I think the film could have done without the (always brilliant) Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver characters and their subplots which veer into the generic and cliche. Which seems to be Blomkamp's MO these days; great, edgy, high concept and human ideas with superb execution wrapped up in a rote and passé shell with cutting edge visuals but ending up saying really nothing at all.",Chappie
114,ArchonCinemaReviews,Like a two hour Die Antwoord music video - aka awesomesauce!,7,6 August 2015,"Neill Bloomkamp made a name for himself with his first feature film District 9, which garnered four Oscar nominations and countless other accolades. Since then Bloomkamp has stuck to the same science fiction thematic where there is a clash between humanity and alternative life forms in the not so distant future.In that way, Chappie is a stale recreation, as it too follows the similar plot structure. This time, the clash arises from technology utilized in a mechanized police force and the argument of whether these robotic cyborgs can exist autonomously. Chappie also examines the existence of artificial life, and what makes us human. Don't worry though, while all that material sounds overly dense and philosophical, Chappie is a vivid and hilarious adventure of crime, badassery and killer clothes and hair.It seems as though Chappie is a get it or miss it, love it or hate it, kind of film. Lucky for the producers and actors, we at Archon loved it and got it. It is a sweet film that creatively looks into the existence of life, consciousness and innocence in a ridiculously creative way. The presence of Die Antwoord, namely Ninja and Yolandi-Visser, is a wonderful complement to the ideas and humor of the film.It's hard to describe Chappie because it's such a mixture of different components. But, imagine a delightful and enchanting concoction of candy, neon lights, drugs, alcohol, guns all held together with a good helping of alternative hip-hop and electronic rave music thrown in.So what do you have to look forward to if you give Chappie a chance? An endearing robot named Chappie learning who he is, what he is, and how he fits into the world. This wide-eyed view of a gangster-ridden South Africa might not have been enough, but learning from near cartoonish Ninja and Yolandi is original and wildly entertaining.If you are a fan of creativity, and tend to move ahead of trends rather than with them, you will adore this film. Chappie has heart, charisma, and a broader message, the characters are compelling and connect with the audience, drawing them in for the entirety of the narrative.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Chappie

116,david-meldrum,"Gunplay, good theology and lazy plotting",7,29 March 2015,"Gun-play and good theology don't have a happy history together. You can usually bet that if a theological viewpoint needs the reinforcement of heavy weaponry, it's flawed. Just ask the Tea Party. Not so with South African film-maker Neil Blomkamp's latest.Let's be clear from the start: this is no masterpiece; nor is it as good as his breakout first film District 9. But it is better than the confused surface-sheen of second feature Elysium. We're in near-future Johannesburg, where crime is controlled by intelligent police-robots exclusively provided by one weapons-company. Dev Patel is the genius behind it, and it just so happens that in the shape of a reconstituted damaged robot that's he cracked the problem of evolving artificial intelligence (the title character, in a brilliant motion-capture performance by Blomkamp stalwart Sharlto Copley). The picture is complicated by a team of gangsters (played terribly by South African music stars Die Antwoord) stealing Chappie and some internal company rivalry from Hugh Jackman and his really big robot Moose. So the story develops ... sort of. Being kind, plot isn't this film's strong point. There are holes in the narrative that Moose could blunder through without noticing: conveniently non-existent security at a cutting edge arms-firm? Motive-less characters? Characters with no discernible need to appear in the story at all? All these more are present and incorrect. Where it scores, though, is in some blistering but simply shot action scenes and an eye for the big issues. All three of Blomkamp's features this far have had bigger dimensions than simply themselves at work, and here we're in serious territory. The film asks and asks you to consider fundamental questions: what it means to be created, what it means to be human, the nature of consciousness and the purpose of the body. It's this latest that's perhaps the most interesting: just when you think it's going to default into some vaguely spiritual nonsense about the body not really mattering, it goes somewhere really clever and suggests the body is so important that after death we have to get new ones. That's orthodox-Christian theology, in case you didn't spot it; we don't leave bodies behind, we get remade ones. That's why God came in a body, not just a spirit. It's an unusual sci-fi action film the companion reading for which should be the New Testament and a Tom Wright primer. It's just a shame that the holes in the plot are so obvious that the performances are not consistent enough; better casting here, more care there and we'd have something at least as good as District 9 on our hands. Neill Blomkamp's next film seems likely to be the next in the Alien series. He's clearly got the talent and the backing to do it; but on such hallowed ground he'll need to take more care than this, and have patience to match his vision. If he can harness it, it'll be something special.",Chappie
117,socrates99,OK there's maybe one thing to complain about,9,7 March 2015,"It's about 5 minutes too long. But 5 minutes out of 2 hours would qualify as a spectacular time in anyone's book.There's something very facile and honest about Neill Blomkamp's direction. No putting on airs here. His bad guys don't waste any energy wondering whether they should go overboard or not. And his good guys don't think twice about taking chances either. It makes for a volatile and very entertaining mix. His world is more direct and unflinching than ours and it's beautifully rendered here.The chief protagonist is the only robot fitted with artificial intelligence in this near future, Chappie. Unfortunately that means he's learning from scratch and that puts him in danger almost every moment he's on his own in this violent urban landscape. The problem is he's learning about the world from crooks who themselves are being bullied by even greater crooks all of whom are of the Mad Max variety. They have this oddly humanistic edge to them. Their battle scenes seem both goofy and borderline heroic. But I loved the fact that the gang's only girl wears an American flag for one scene and that the one Latin-American is called Yankie or Amerika.Chappie is a very impressive CGI character. The digital artists have given Sharlto Copley, the actor behind his performance, a seamless appearance and a very clever design that hints of a none too serious approach. (For example his arms are plug and play.) I loved the fact he makes sense of his world by taking his two keepers to be his parents and that they tend to favorably respond to his mistake. And that he takes the engineer who gives him true intelligence as his creator.Hugh Jackman adds useful artistry to the mix as a villain of sorts and Sigourney Weaver is somewhat miscast but all in all this is one very enjoyable night at the movies. And that would have been a surprise if I'd been listening to the critics.The nearest big city to me is Chicago and there the mainstream newspaper's chief movie critic actually gave this film zero stars. Luckily I didn't see that until after seeing the movie. Now after reading his review, I'm thinking this guy may be one of the snobby critics ever. He even suggested its name was a mistake and someone had switched out the 'r' for an 'h'. Don't you believe it.",Chappie
118,dcarsonhagy,Robot from the Hood,5,7 July 2015,"This one was a toss-up for me. I had not read other reviews, so I don't think I was one bit tainted when it came to my review. ""Chappie"" tells the story of a future Johannesburg, South Africa, where robots make up the primary police force. It seems it is easier to deploy robots and, thus, save human lives. Chappie is built from a throw-away robot who had been terminated during some kind of drug raid. The difference between Chappie and others of his ilk is that Chappie has been given actual human emotions. He can actually feel, reason, think, love, hate--he has ALL the emotions. This premise (one would think) should make for an interesting movie. For me, it did not, and I'll tell you why.The brogues in here were SO heavy it was actually difficult for me to understand what people were saying. If a movie ever needed sub- titles, this one did. If I could have understood a little better what was going on, perhaps I could have been better able to follow the movie. As it was, it was ""rewind, listen, rewind, listen again, rewind""...you get the picture. And the music...PUH-LEEZE. From the opening to the beginning it sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks on acid: incomprehensible and annoying as all get-out. One of the few parts that I actually enjoyed, though, was Hugh Jackman getting the absolute crap kicked out of him. Also, I thought the ending was weak and very predictable.""Chappie"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity. I expected so much more and found this movie was long on dialogue and short on action. This one's a toss-up. You decide.",Chappie

And it's too bad because there are some really good ideas there and a great potential. The idea of Chappie acting like a toddler that learns new stuff is great.

120,in1984,Catching up to Cyberpunk,8,17 May 2015,"8 of 10. While it's not as near perfection as District 9, it does prove that Neill Blomkamp is one of the rare people capable of writing, directing, and producing great films. The typical result of someone attempting to do all 3 with a film is an art school mess that simply shows technical competence as opposed to high level creativity and skill.For hard science fiction fans, Chappie also isn't quite up to Ex Machina (2015), which does a much better job exploring and explaining the technical aspects of making an AI and turning it into a robot. It's more of a near future Automata (2014) - another great recent cyberpunk dystopia film.What Chappie adds mainly is action and a super soundtrack along with a more Robocop than the remake quality without any imitation including the question of whether we're in a utopia, dystopia, or both. It's a more optimistic and real morphing of Blade Runner and Robocop into modern day reality.The last burst of high quality robot/AI sci-fi we had was 2008-2009. We should consider this a wonderful, probably temporary, period of cyberpunk film that will be looked upon and treasured. Other recent films with a similar story theme: Robocop (2014), Machine (2014), Robot and Frank (2012), and Transcendence (2014).",Chappie

122,James_De_Bello,3.5/10,3,9 April 2015,"Dull, boring, overlong, but most of all dumb, this is further proof of what I have been saying since District 9 (which for the record I liked): Neil Blomkamp isn't a good director. District 9 was just lightning in a bottle, it was pretty good, but it wasn't the masterpiece people claimed and it certainly wasn't handled with solid direction, Elysium was boring and practically the same movie, it had some redeemable qualities, but again had no good direction, and now comes Chappie which is a total directorial disaster. Chappie is to 2015 what Transcendence was to 2014, a Sci-Fi movie with all the good cards in place that had the potential to be a great one, but ended up wasting all, and by all I mean ALL of them, in a endless bore.I'll just get out of the way the few positives first because there isn't much to talk about. Chappie and the production design look amazing, if there is one thing that Blomkamp excels in, it is making special effects look seamless. Chappie's look is good enough to get you through the duration of the film. A good score form Hans Zimmer and Hugh Jackman's usual charisma and fun performance are two other elements that had enough flavor for me to enjoy them and where definitely a light in the dullness of the film. Finally, and this isn't really a positive, the movie was never bad enough for me to get angry about it, I guess that's a positive.Not even the visuals, which were excellent across the board in his previous to films, were good in this one. They were basic, repetitive and in some parts not even worthy of a low-budget independent movie. The product placement in here is shameless, distracting and almost offensive. Did Blomkamp even care about this movie? His directing is usually always off for me, but here it looked like he didn't even give a f**k. That's the only way to explain the casting of the musicians they give terrible performance. The only thing that could save them is that the rest of the cast does too (with exception of Jackman), even Sigourney Weaver is terrible for heaven's sake! I'm speaking school play level of terrible! It was ridiculous. Add to this a childish script that firstly, clearly does not understand the basics of storytelling, does take into consideration any possible coherence, dialogue is actually, for real of the quality of what a child would write and worst of all had an all over the place sense of morality and a disastrously murky message.I hated this film and I wanted to like it so bad! Being a huge Hugh Jackman fan that hurts to say trust me. I wanted to be proved wrong of what I thought of Blomkamp. I now could not be more worried about the Alien sequel, I really hope he does not ruin that and pulls some magic out of the bag, he really needs it. Don't see this one it would be a waste of time.",Chappie
123,scottshak_111,A vapid plot drowns Chappie,6,17 March 2015,"Chappie misses out by miles on what it set out to achieve. The trailer promised an epic tale of Sci-Fi with A.I. in its vanguard manifesting right bits of drama. Unfortunately it belied the actual prosaic content.Taking Elysium's mediocrity into consideration, Neil Blomkamp's robot with a mind of his own doesn't go far either. You can munch on your popcorn pointing out at the clumsiness of the machine, but that's pretty much it. It isn't outstanding. At the same time it is entirely bad either.The plot of the flick unfolds brilliantly at first however midway ends up being insipid. The story is very predictable to the point you might actually end up saying: I saw that coming! As the movie reaches its laughable climax, you just wonder out loud if the director was really serious going in for the bizarre cessation.Chappie was written poorly in mediocrity. The only thing that works pretty well for the movie is its visual effect. Details on the robot are extremely well fabricated. Also some action visuals look pretty dope.Chappie cannot be compared to the likes of any good artificial intelligence movie. Nowhere near A.I. or Her of course. Its drama isn't at all moving. Screenplay has nothing much to offer and every projected bit seems deliberate – to make the movie work of course.SPOILERS AHEAD: To begin with, Chappie lacks focus big time. There is literally no time spent on character development, and we are forced to jump into a pyre of a chaotic backdrop with a news report showing glimpses of quintessential elements in the tale. You are shown a tattered robot receiving an engineering treatment. The amount of focus it receives tells us it must be our protagonist. (Very obvious direction!) You have a creator (Dev Patel), an antagonist brimming with malice (Hugh Jackman), and a boss (Sigourney Weaver) that doesn't do much for whom both are working. For an A.I. to learn stuff, Neil throws Chappie into an abyss of gangsters to spice things up, with an unusual home to influence his mind with outrageous stuff and contrasting moral values. Although to our surprise the lady gangster starts playing mommy out of the blue. A softer side emerges in her and that too without any drama.Whilst Chappie is learning stuff, at first things are a tad cute, but as we dig deeper it becomes downright sad. Dev Patel seems to be in a constant fit. He looks like he is heading for a nervous breakdown. Hugh's presence was supposed to make things powerful however Neil doesn't offer him much to act on.Neil's obsession with Sci-Fi has become sheer pathetic. He seems to be trying to assemble a golden egg like District 9 but unfortunately he has simply ran out of juice. He doesn't surprise us anymore. With Chappie coming in strong as a bland and lacklustre movie, I wonder what would he do to his next best thing – The Alien project?",Chappie
124,saraccan,I knew it wasnt gonna be good yet im still dissappointed,4,6 June 2018,Terrible acting by the non-actors.

125,DuskShadow,A thinly veiled Sympathy Piece,3,9 September 2015,"A thinly veiled propaganda piece. A Die Antwoord music video in a District 9 like fashion. A possible, pre I, Robot emergence timeline where the beginning of so called robotics has truly kicked off. The films purpose is to make us sympathetic to the idea of trans humanism and implementation of artificial intelligence, even if its militarized. But its okay though...cause they can play with dolls and say mommy... *sighs* Oh powers that be, how you wield your Hollywood tool against the world's simple masses. Well from a pedestrian point of view the movie would likely be enjoyable, and no doubt would be to anyone not in the know to see whats happening in our world. Even before Stephen Hawkings and other so called tech gurus denounced the implementation of A.I., I was a proponent of focusing on natural developments, not those of the software variety. YEt more movies like this get pumped out off the conveyor belt, to use a bad pun. The Cg was okay, the acting was tired, and the makeup jobs were crude. The random placement of an actor whom at least plays a latino, though the film is in South Africa, was like a token character to assuage some misplaced fear of alienating part of an specific target audience. Not that I really mind, but it was just...odd. Coupled with the fact that multiple characters in film supposedly have the brilliance to even program at such levels in the movie, the lack of more common sense leads me to believe the film's writers are either very young and inexperienced, or they are complete tools. Which leads back to the fact that films like this are pure robot loving propaganda. If you are a drinker or do..whatever if you can afford it and just want something to idle some time away, have at this film. Otherwise, read an actual book on the subject. I would suggest anything by Isaac Asimov, obviously.",Chappie
126,gavinp9,Good robot coming-of-age story,7,2 January 2018,"'Chappie' is Blomkamp's third film, after 'District 9' and 'Elysium' and easily sits between them in terms of quality. It's a near-future tale of artificial intelligence and how this could play out on a small and large scale. It's nothing new ('Terminator', 'Short Circuit'), but it is done in an interesting way. Deon (Patel) develops ""scouts"" (basically literal robocops), which Vincent (Jackman) wants to supersede with his mech-warriors. When Deon creates an AI ""conscious"", Chappie is ""born"".Unfortunately for Chappie, his ""parents"" are Ninja & Yo-Landi from 'Die Antwoord', a South African rap-rave ""band"" (thanks Wikipedia. If you haven't heard them before, don't bother!) I can only assume Blomkamp loves their music (god knows how) and asked them to be in this as a favour. Their faux-gangster act forces Chappie into doing things he doesn't want to and disaster ensues. Jackman is adequately douchey as the Aussie-redneck, Sigourney Weaver is massively underutilised, Patel is solid and Copley is great as the South African-accented voice of Chappie, providing most of the laughs due to his interpretation of sayings.The visual effects - particularly of Chappie and the other scouts - is superb. There's not too much philosophising on the impacts AI could have on humans/the world. The ending was a little drawn-out and obvious - not necessarily good or bad.",Chappie

Only saw it in theaters because i saw promise in the trailers and liked Bloomkamp's District 9. I actually gave it a chance and it was great. Lots of other people just acted like sheep and came in hating it, coupled with the emphasis on South African culture, people didn't give it a chance.Seeing movies like this fail shows that change is coming to the movie industry.

This is one of those films that would be so frightening if it were real, but it leaves me thinking that with the way technology is advancing, if someone can imagine it....one day someone will make it. Not so very far in the future the police force contains a large percentage of robot law enforcement officers. Within the company that make the robots there are two warring factions. Dev Patel plays Deon, who designed the robots and Hugh Jackman plays Vincent a rival designer who sees his budget cut year after year, leaving him frustrated and bitter. When Deon steals the body of a robot destined for scrap to upload a new programme, Chappie is born....a robot that can learn and think for itself. Set in South Africa, this is a story that takes you through all kinds of emotions and we find the humans learning compassion from the robot. Although Dev Patel is playing a grown up brainiac in his role of Deon, we can still see the boy who is running his hotel in India. However, he brings from that character to this a determination to see the job through and to do right by everyone. Add a stirring score from the wonderful Hans Zimmer and on the whole this film wasn't bad at all.",Chappie
129,mike-c-b,No likeable characters.,1,11 October 2019,"The VFX is fantastic, but there are no likeable characters.The AI geek is completely unconvincing. It takes deep thought and knowledge about psychology to do his job, but his character has none. Feels more like a teenager on a field trip.The ""bad guys"" feel like jacked up pizza delivery guys on a break. Mean nothing they say even though they yell.Hugh Jackman's character is a guy inventing a larger robot and gives a presentation at one point, but his hair is still combed straight-forward (and with a mullet) like an australian road worker/miner.Sigourney Weaver's character is just a stone wall. So you never look forward to hearing her speak.The Chappie robot itself, starts off acting rediculously afraid, and the film is edited around you relating to this for a solid 15 minutes... as if a hyper afraid slavish attitude is the norm.Directing, editing, script, acting... what is wrong with people... were good movies all ""luck"" before??",Chappie

I didn't have very high expectations but I did end up enjoying this movie. It is fairly predictable and a little cheesy, you kind of know how this movie is going to go once everyone is introduced.Even with that is was pretty entertaining. I found Die Antwood was not as bad I I was expecting (there music is the soundtrack to the movie...obvi)It's kind of an action movie, kind of a drama. The basics are a robot AI is adopted by some gangsters who train it to do their bidding, the twist being the gangsters are the anti heros of the movie. The bad guy is introduced (Hugh Jackman), who rocks a mullet so hard in this movie, and the battle of good guys vs bad guys sets the scene for the rest of the movie.I would recommend this to anyone who liked District 9 (that was a way better movie) or anyone who liked Short Circuit.",Chappie
131,themadmovieman,Another good premise from Blomkamp that falls flat on its face,6,8 March 2015,"This is the third film from director Neill Blomkamp, and the third of his films that has a really good premise, but falls flat on its face. This film has a promising start, and flashes of fun throughout that made it a little bit different, but it was on the whole a very weak story that was littered with boring action and some insanely preposterous ideas.Now, although it's slow-starting, once this film gets into the whole idea of an artificially intelligent robot learning and growing like a child, it's a quite fun to watch. It's not particularly interesting or profound like some of the messages in District 9 were, but the concept is initially believable enough to go along with and enjoy.What prevented this from being an overall boring film, however, was the fact that it was pretty funny for a good twenty minutes. Eventually, once you've got a hang of the AI thing, that aspect gets a little boring, but it's replaced by a hilarious sequence in the middle of the film, and this period was by far the highlight of the film, because it took on a refreshingly light tone in comparison to what you'd expect, but also tried something a little bit different that wasn't the ultimately boring action story.That's where this film really fell down, in the final act. In almost identical fashion to District 9 and almost as badly as Elysium, the story drops all of its cool initial concepts in return for an overly drawn out final hour full of explosions and gunfights that don't add much to the story, and are not actually that exciting because you haven't really got to empathise with the characters throughout the whole film.Also, there were some major exaggerations in terms of the characters here that really annoyed me. Chappie was great, but the rest of the people in this film were just not really that believable, particularly Hugh Jackman's character, whose excessively strong vendetta towards Dev Patel was just not at all convincing, and made for a ridiculously evil villain that didn't worry me one bit.The worst thing about this film, however, was the finale. It dies down a bit after the action, but then there comes one of the most preposterous and pointless endings to a film I've ever seen, where I was much more entertained by the seconds ticking on my watch than the gibberish on screen.Finally, back on the bright side, the visual effects in this film are absolutely stunning. It really builds on the sort of feel that you got from the prawns in District 9, but creates a very slick image of this artificially intelligent robot, and was a major component in making that part of the story more believable.Overall, I'll give this a 6, because it had a story that was at times fun and entertaining to watch, along with great visuals, although its final hour was pretty dull and stupid.www.themadmovieman.com",Chappie
132,jb_campo,Entertaining robot-like film,7,12 December 2015,"Chappie is an entertaining film that won't wow you, but will draw some emotions while getting you to think about what it means to be human. The film takes place in a law-challenged South Africa at an undetermined time, seems to be in the future. Robot police have been created to fight against the crime outbreak, and crime has dropped. In a firefight with bad guys, Droid #22 gets injured. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) plays the lead developer of the droids. But he is working on a program to give them Artificial Intelligence. His nemesis is Hugh Jackman (X-men series), another developer in the same company, who has created this huge robot that is human controlled, by Jackman wearing a helmet.The storyline revolves around this struggle for power between Dev Patel and Jackman. The stars of this movie however, are not these two well known actors, nor even Sigourney Weaver, who plays a bit role as the company's CEO. Besides Chappie, the name given to the Droid who comes to life, the two criminals Ninja and Yolandi are really fun to watch. They try to teach Chappie evil tendencies, while Chappie is being told by his creator to NOT do bad things. It was almost like watching a little kid grow up and try to make good choices, but not always doing so. In many ways, this movie pulls in story lines from RoboCop (the original) and the Short Circuit movies. In-fighting in a company that produces robots that are fighting criminals. But Short Circuit had Johnny 5 with this storm-given real life sentient thoughts. Chappie differs from Johnny 5, but faces similar challenges.This movie kept me interested, and it's either a 6 or 7/10, so I'll give it higher. The acting of Jackman and Weaver was really minimal - they had not much to work with. Patel is OK. But Ninja and Yolandi and Chappie were outstanding. In the end, you feel sad for many people. But you also feel sad for the robots, and that is what makes this movie stand apart. Enjoy.",Chappie
133,ritera1,7.2 IMDb user rating? Are you kidding me?!,2,14 May 2015,"What are you people smokin'?This was a writing disaster at every turn. I was stunned.I'm not even a scientist on TV and I was aghast at the stupid science, even for science fiction. I'm absolutely okay with a giant costumed guy with a magical hammer. But this? No!Why does our intrepid scientist need an actual robot to test his AI? He could easily do it from a computer. A box. Without legs and feet. Then, in a perfect storm, the bad guys kidnap him and get their hands on the robot. Not only do they let the scientist go with full knowledge of their location, they have a time limit on getting money for their boss. What do they do? They turn in early for bed!(And how does an American barrio gangster end-up in South Africa?)Sure enough, the scientist comes back a couple times to the hideout! Let's not forget that the scientist easily sneaks out the back door of the factory a robot, along with the ONLY (and I mean ONLY) key to reprogramming the robots in the entire world. No time to make another?Then the bulk of the movie hinges on the growth of the robot. He's suppose to be a child and we believe he's as cute as a kitten. Nevermind that the robot eventually downloads the entirety of the Internet into his data-banks (why not at the beginning of the film?) and is still the blithering idiot he was before. And let us not forget Hugh Jackman who made a giant mistake on this one. His character is jealous that HIS version of the robot is not being used. As we found out from the finale, it was apparently a piece of crap that Sigourney Weaver's character should have known with a little quality check. And the guy pulls a gun in an office and then laughs it off. Nobody would have reported him?Even that. This company's two prized project leaders are regulated to the cubicle jungle? (I enjoyed near the end when Sigourney Weaver escaped her office in the midst of bedlam WITH her purse and jacket.)And also the robberies the bad guys do in order to get out from under their debt could have been done without the robot. Thus, no movie.So we go with the assumption that Chappie is now a sentient being with a consciousness that could not be simply transferred to another computer. Uhm...no.In the interim, the two scumbag crooks that kidnapped Chappie (the guy) SUDDENLY turn into good guys at the end. Uhm...no. F'k 'em.(I seem to remember that when this pile of c'p was marketed, it positioned itself as rebels resisting a oppressive government. I'm sure the producers were panicking as that has nothing to do with this garbage.)And the shot and dying scientist has no other choice than being transferred to another robot. Not into another computer like I mentioned earlier? ONLY into a robot (essentially the same thing). And the same for Chappie.I've liked Bowkamp's movies before. This one is shockingly bad. It was directed well and looked good. But you know what? Didn't matter at all.",Chappie
134,squirrel_burst,"A few rough spots, but I can forgive those because of the ideas present",8,26 March 2015,"There are a lot of cool things and more importantly, a lot of intelligent ideas present inside of ""Chappie"". I have a few minor issues here and there, mostly with a single villainous character that while essential, does make the story more conventional than I would have liked to have seen. I'll freely admit that it does serve the story well and does make for some pretty exciting confrontations though. This is the story of the world's first fully self-aware, sentient artificial intelligence. A consciousness put inside the body of a broken police robot (an android that is sent to crush crime in the violent areas of Johannesburg). The problem is that Chappie (Sharlto Copley, who does the voice and performs via motion-capture) is not being raised by his maker Deon (Dev Patel). His mother and father (African rap artists Ninja and Yolandi Visser) are a bunch of thugs that want to raise this robot to become a bank robber so they can settle their drug debt.What I like best about this movie is also in a way, it's fault. There are so many different things and ideas going around. You have the concept of the artificial intelligence, Chappie (who begins its life as a child) growing up at an incredibly quick pace, the moral implications of child soldiers and/or of brainwashing children to do crimes, and the plot of Deon trying to figure out what he is going to do about Chappie being led astray. That's already a lot, but there's even more going on. The film also talks about trans-humanism, robotic police forces, the the gangster life and how poverty affects people's growth, tensions within the office between people wanting to have robots as strictly military weapons and Deon believing that the next step is a more peaceful, gentle creation. There's even more, but any details about those plot points would be spoiling the movie. I love all of these subjects because the central idea of this film, the very first artificial intelligence being raised in a world that doesn't understand it naturally flows into all of these other concepts very organically. The problem is that there are so many different ideas going on that there isn't a lot of room for them to breathe. If you look at a similar film like ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" for example, that movie deals with complex issues, but not nearly as many which means there is plenty of time to have moments that ""don't matter"". What I mean by that is moments where what the characters are talking about aren't just in there to set up an action or a plot point later in the film. In that film, a scene where a character is looking out the window could have easily been cut, but it's important to give you a feel of what the characters are like when the plot is going full-throttle. There aren't many, if any moments like that in ""Chappie"" and it's a shame because I really would like to see what the characters in this story would be like on a normal day where nothing exciting happened.The other criticism that I have is that this story isn't really an action movie, but at times it tries to be. Now don't get me wrong. I thought the conflict was very exciting, a lot of fun and very satisfying. I do feel like it could have possibly being included in a sequel movie though. Because there is so much going on here, and the movie lasts 2 hours that fly by like it was nothing, some of the plot points with the villain feel rushed. They made sense to me, I liked where it went but once again, I would have liked to have seen the villain be just a regular guy for at least a little bit, so that I could have really learned what makes him tick before he went all the way bad.Another element that I really enjoyed here was the down-to-earth, very colloquial style present throughout. Chappie is being raised by thugs that are criminals, at times not very likable and not the kind of people I would ever want to meet in real life, but I have to admit that I like them as characters. Ninja and Yolandi are broad characters, but I believed them. They're dirty, uneducated and simple people but I did see them grow as characters throughout and I thought the fact that they were just these random people, they weren't scientists or even wide-eyed children gave an extra bit of spice to the story of Chappie. Not to mention that I am 100% sure that there are actually people like them out there, and probably more than you would think. I also liked the way they look. They're so crazy-looking that you know they're completely genuine. That means they end up raising a robot that is totally unique to every other one I've seen in any media. I loved every moment where Chappie was interacting with people because his personality is a really complex one. I actually think separating Chappie from his maker was one of the most interesting and smartest things this script did.There are a few things that rubbed me the wrong way, but only slightly. It's almost like yeah those issues could have been fixed, but it the story would have changed so much that it wouldn't have been anything like the final product we have here so I can let that go. ""Chappie"" has the ideas, the characters, the special effects, the emotion and even the action I hope to see when I check out a new science fiction movie. It's a very intelligent movie and I enjoyed watching it, and discussing it a lot. (Theatrical version on the big screen, March 22, 2015)",Chappie
135,nicolechan916,Intriguing concept that would be much better without the violence.,6,3 August 2015,"The acting was pretty all right. Dev Patel looks quite grown up from the last time I saw him - which was in Slumdog Millionaire, and he did great. His expressions and his delivery was very convincing of someone capable of creating artificial intelligence. Jackman and Weaver did OK; they played characters that they're pretty much used to with Jackman as the tough guy and Weaver as the one in control (though she doesn't get much screen time). Yo-Landi, Ninja and Jose Pablo Cantillo (who plays Yankie) played a group of gangster like thugs and I guess they did well in their roles.On that note, I really do not get the purpose of all the gangster thug characters. Is this a depiction of what Johannesburg is like? Because if so, that is pretty concerning. That was my main issue with the film. It has a lot of violence and aggression and I am not the type of person who likes that kind of thing. I mean they could have made an even better film with Chappie in a different context. Well I guess the police robot force thing works, but I feel that there need not have been so much thug life and violence involved.Also, the ending was very surprising for me. I wouldn't want to have the same thing happen to me, but the film does raise questions of life and living. I am interested in knowing how they continue to live after the end of the film. The only great thing in this film is the connection between Deon and Chappie.Overall an intriguing concept with good acting but too much masculinity and unnecessary violence.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Chappie
136,trublu215,An awesome sci-fi spectacle that is more heart than it is brawn,8,7 March 2015,"Chappie marks Neil Blomkamp's third outing in the sci-fi genre, telling the story of a robot who becomes self aware and must adapt to life and the horrors that come with it. Featuring a cast made up of Dev Patel, Sigourney Weaver, and Hugh Jackman along with the voice of Sharlto Copley, Chappie benefits from its actors and uses it to its advantage. The film is very watchable due to its leads and Blomkamp does show his slipping as a filmmaker here. Regarding its technical level, Chappie isn't all that impressive considering District 9 is a benchmark film at this point, one would hope Blomkamp would have moved on to more mesmerizing work, not that Chappie isn't a good movie, it just doesn't show growth as a filmmaker. The story's first act borrows from 1987's RoboCop heavily. A battle of wits between Patel's and Jackman's characters mirrors the confrontations between Miguel Ferrer and Ronny Cox but, as I said, the flaws are largely able to get by you because of Jackman and Patel in these roles, they really do add charisma and do an awesome job with what they were given. The film then treads into territory that is new, teaching a robot like a child and as he is learning the world, he is also seeing the horrifying side to it. It makes for a wonderful dynamic for Chappie and without spoiling anything further, the film then takes a really brutal turn that leads to an explosive finale. Overall, Chappie is a good film that wears its influences loud and proud but has enough heart behind its talented cast to make it memorable.",Chappie

Yes, it's really a shame, because the directing is solid and the special effects are good.What is totally unnecessary in the film is the characterization of the character played by Hugh Jackman, Vincent Moore, the director could not restrain himself obviously and the film suffers because of that.The cast is great, but it can't save the film because the characters are simply shallow and banal.And the most banal is Vincent Moore, a character who can't be saved even by the great Hugh Jackman. If it was satire, it was a complete failure.This lowered the impression of the whole film, completely unnecessary and contradicting the whole concept. The film at times resembles a bad parody.The actors did their best, but the script is simply full of flaws.

The story is interesting and nicely paced, the special effects are unbelievably realistic and the characters bring a unique story to life through their amazing performances. Chappie is portrayed by Sharlto Copley who absolutely hit the nail on the head as always. Dev Patel portrays Devon Wilson, who is an interesting secondary main character. The addition of Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman upped the ante up even more, as these are amazing actors as well. The rap dup was a mixed bag for a lot of people, which is somewhat understandable, but I think they served their purpose in the movie and that their performances worked out in the movie's favor. By the end of the movie I got pretty attached to Chappie as a character, and I hope that Chappie makes a return one day. I want you to ignore the bad reviews, check the movie out for yourself and make your own review afterwards. You will most likely not be disappointed.",Chappie
140,dpolwatte,Chappie,6,6 December 2018,Neil Blomkamp is losing it with each of his upcoming films. He debuted With a 'blast' - District 9. And 'Elysium' was okay. But this is a waste of time.Seriously a mindless action flick trying to produce unnecessary philosophical assumptions on humanity and it is without any logic and the story flows without any premise.Like I said an unworthy film of every aspect because in my personal view of trying to be a wannabe philosophical film on human nature.,Chappie
141,fung0,Half marks for a half-good movie,5,22 June 2015,"Chappie is about 50% brilliant. The other 50% is standard action-movie filler. So it's not surprising that people either love it or hate it.The first half of the film is really clever. It asks deep questions about the meaning of life, the way we raise our children, the problem of evil in the world. And it paints a beautifully sympathetic picture of the central character, Chappie. The animation reminded me of Wall*E, in the way it created a range of emotion using very limited moving elements. Chappie is a really interesting character, by far the best thing about this film.Unfortunately, about halfway through, the film veers away from all the really interesting questions, and ultimately answers none of them. I had the feeling that someone felt things were becoming too intellectual and too dark, and did a fast rewrite. (** Mild non-spoiler: the arbitrary addition of a new technological breakthrough late in the film is particularly weak. A self-aware robot should be concept enough for one movie. **)What you end up with is not a terrible action film, but one that's going to produce a feeling of extreme disappointment in anyone who gets seduced by the philosophical dimensions of the first half. I had a similar reaction to Blomkamp's previous Elysium - a beginning based on big ideas, an arbitrary ending based on action-film clichés. (EDIT: I've given Elysium a second try, and liked it much better this time. Compared to Chappie, it strikes a much better balance between slam-bang action and social commentary.)Chappie is potentially worth a look, but try not to let your expectations get too high.",Chappie
142,FairlyAnonymous,"Mixed thoughts on this one: Much more intelligent than the average flick, but not really good",6,8 March 2015,"Chappie is an interesting film because it could be ridiculed for random themes and inconsistent story, or it could be praised for the fact that it brings up a lot of ambitious ideas and concepts.It is a really interesting film as far as themes go. The movie brings up a lot of ideas that aren't brought up in most ""AI"" films such as: Does the robot recognize his own mortality? Does the robot feel guilt? How does the robot react to having one parent being a criminal and the other parent being a respectful scientist? There were a lot of scenes where I was thinking ""Dang, this could lead to a pretty cool concept"". Unfortunately, the movie never fleshes out any of its themes.It is always very sad to see a movie like this: A movie that has all the right elements to be good, but it gets too distracted in being too many things so it never gets any of the elements right. For example, one of the ingenious themes is the fact that Chappie has two parents: A scientist and a very violent thug. On one side Chappie is learning about the basics of language and how to be a model citizen, but on the other side he is learning how to properly mug people, how to fight, how to talk cool, how to walk cool, and how to earn respect from other people. This is very interesting because the movie never starts Chappie out as super intelligent, it starts him out as a very quick learning child. This means you can see him slowly learn and make connections between every event in his life.A great example of this is Chappie is told that knives make people go to sleep, so naturally Chappie tries to stab people until he is told that they don't want to go to sleep. However, when Chappie starts stabbing people later, you see him pause and looks into someone's eyes and say ""I'm sorry, I didn't know. Don't go to sleep"". But he says it very quietly so that no one else can hear.These are some very deep and interesting themes and Chappie is a very interesting character. Unfortunately, it never fleshes out its themes. This means a lot of very profound themes will fly by in about five minutes and not show up later. This also brings us to one hilarious big issue with the movie:Every scene involving the villain makes little to no sense. It's not that I don't mind Hugh Jackman, or the approach they were taking, it was how insane and over the top he becomes. He is supposed to be playing a local engineer/scientist who wants to make human controlled mechs that are grossly over-powered for the job of law enforcement. Instead of modifying his idea and making it work for the job, he still says that law-enforcement needs a mech with... mini-guns, claws, machine guns, rockets, cluster missiles, and just about anything you can think of. It really makes no sense to want that on the street. This brings up several questions: Why not just sell it to the military? He does work for a weapons company so if not law enforcement why not military (He was hinted at being an ex- solider/Veteran). So his obsession doesn't really make sense: If he really wants human controlled machines, then make one less overpowered. If he really wants an overpowered mech, then sell it to the military.However, because he doesn't do either of these, he becomes an insane psychopath who literally shuts down all of the security/robots in the city just to prove that they need heavier firepower for the job. This brings up a lot of plot-holes: How was he able to do this so easily? Any company (even your local cable company) can track a computer that is shutting down other equipment. How did no one notice him doing this? Why didn't the protagonist tell anyone else that he was doing this? How was he able to gruesomely kill fairly innocent people, while laughing, and no one in the office space took notice? This element of the movie truly absurd and doesn't even fit into the plot. He really is a shoe-horned villain. Just about anyone else could've been the villain and it would've made more sense. Why not the ring-leader from the beginning? He said he wanted to shut- down all of the robots? Several other people were looking for a remote to shutdown all of the robots, so literally anyone could've been the villain and would've had better motives than Hugh Jackman.Other than that, the ending is a bit random, but I was okay with it until the last minute or so. The very very end is kind of... okay? That doesn't make sense with the universe's set rules, but... okay... Fortunately, the other characters in this movie are pretty good. Some people may find them annoying, but I found it interesting because its not like Chappie fell into the hands of perfect people who knew how to use him, Chappie fell into the hands of people who have no idea how robots work or the science behind them. So certain people attach to him differently. Some people treat him like a human, while others do not.All in all, a smarter than your average film, but full of plot-holes and issues. Kind of sad, really.",Chappie
143,virindra,"Like District 9; fresh movie, not worth to re-watch.",6,17 July 2015,"I like movies like District 9 or Chappie. They are made very realistic and it's hard to see what is special effects and what isn't. That's the big plus of the movie.Movie is about making a robot, called Chappie, more human. I expected more TA in this part, because the robot starts from scratch as a child. That didn't happen. That brought the realism of the movie down. What happens if a child gets exposed to violence? Well, not what happened in the movie.Acting is flat. At the end Chappie and Deon look for a robot to transfer their consciousness. They forgot there was a brand new robot in the office of Michelle Bradley. Movie was fun. A bit too much of the same, with Chappie swiping the nose he doesn't have. Movie is not interesting enough to watch a second time. I'm glad I didn't watch it in the cinemas.",Chappie
144,anthonyjlangford,Misunderstood,8,10 April 2015,"The reviewers totally misunderstood this film. It's not about Artificial Intelligence, Die Antwood, Robocop or South Africa. This is the quintessential 'outsider' film. Everyone character is alone, from Sigourney Weaver to Hugh Jackman. Even the gang members aren't united. Blomkamp hands it to us on a platter with the 'Black Sheep' story but the critics overlooked it. It's a film about trying to find your identity. It's about bullies. Its about how cruel and selfish people can be. 'You all lie!' Sure there are a couple of plot holes and Jackman's 'bogan' speak is poorly researched, but hopefully, in time, this film will find it's way into acceptance.

It's also sad to see that Yo-Landi whittles away the farther the film goes, from being a powerful gangsta queen into some greyish Mother to Chappie. Yeah, it's a sad state of affairs.",Chappie

When Chappie worked with the criminals after being separated from his master, I couldn't tell if some of the scenes were funny or serious. In fact, the last act worked best with the twist on what happens to his master and I wish that was more of the story. There still could've been a movie involving another subplot with the girl in the film's final scene. They shouldn't have ended it so abruptly. Maybe the last act should have started the story. It seemed unfocused. The opening fake documentary footage was unnecessary and felt like it was referencing District 9.",Chappie
147,CleveMan66,"In short, ""Chappie"" is pretty crappie. But read on. I'll actually have some intelligent reasons to back up that rhyming pun.",1,7 March 2015,"Hollywood has been trying to join robot intelligence with human intelligence for decades. The 1980s gave us the funny and touching ""Short Circuit"" (""Johnny Five is ALIVE!""), along with ""Robocop"" and ""Terminator"". Each of those movies spawned sequels, then, around the turn of the century, we got ""Bicentennial Man"", ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" and ""I, Robot"". All these films, some excellent and some very forgettable, explored the potential and the dangers of robots that could think and feel as humans do. More recently, a new twist on the genre showed attempts to upload a person's humanity into a computer. In 2014, ""Transcendence"" did it with heart, intelligence and drama, while ""Lucy"" did it with ridiculousness. Then there's ""Chappie"" (R, 2:00). Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'd have to rank this one closer to ""Lucy"" than ""Transcendence"".Deon Wilson (Dev Patel, of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame) is a brilliant engineer who creates a series of robots being used to help police up Johannesburg, South Africa. Rival engineer Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) has developed a robot too. His is more powerful and packs more firepower, but is too expensive. Guiding all this robot development is Tetra Vaal Corporation CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver). She reduces funding for Vincent's ""Moose"" as the police order more and more of Deon's ""Scouts"". Then Deon requests additional funding (or at least some time and resources) to upgrade his robots further. He wants to take them beyond just thinking like humans to the point that they can feel and even create. Denied! Not much call for poets and painters on the police force. So, Deon does what any singularly brilliant big screen scientist would do – he moves forward with his plan anyway.When Deon finishes writing the computer code that would allow a robot brain to develop like a human brain, he steals a badly-damaged scout that is slated to be destroyed, grabs some spare robot parts, throws it all in the back of a company van and heads for his place. Before he can get there, he's van-jacked by three street thugs named Yankie (Jose Pablo Cantillo), Yolandi and Ninja (those last two played by Yo-Landi Vi$$er and Ninja, of the real-life South African hip-hop band ""Die Antwoord""). These three small-time criminals owe the local crime lord, Hippo (Brandon Auret), a lot of money for a botched job and they figure that the creator of the police robots can help them disable those robots so they can ""earn"" the money they need to pay off Hippo. When Ninja and his gang see what's in the back of Deon's van, he's got some 'splaining to do. He tells them that he's building a robot that can think and learn which means he can be taught to commit crimes. Ninja forces Deon to put the robot together and Deon's A-I program works. However, like a child whose brain is learning, the robot's brain has to learn, but he learns faster than your average Dick or Jane. In fact, a few words from his maker, gifts of a rubber chicken and a book, a few minutes of watching an old ""He-Man"" cartoon and he's good to go. (It really is not much more than that. I'm not making this stuff up. I wouldn't do that to a movie audience.)The innocent and vulnerable robot brings out the maternal instincts in Yolandi, who names the robot ""Chappie"", comforts him, reads to him and tries to teach him what it means to be human. (Chappie is voiced by Sharlto Copely, who previously starred in director Neill Blomkamp's 2009 ""District 9"", which was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.) Meanwhile, as Yolandi is being ""mommy"" to Chappie, Ninja and Yankie teach Chappie to be a ""number one robot gangster"" and Deon, who insists on returning to the criminals' lair after they throw him out, teaches Chappie to think, to make decisions, to feel and to be moral. The rest of the movie is a fight for Chappie's ""soul"" as the rivalry between Deon and Vincent plays out, with Chappie's ""life"" and the safety of the people of Johannesburg at stake. If only ""Chappie"" were as entertaining as I just made it sound. The underbelly of society near-future setting of the film is dirty, obnoxious, obscene and depressing. Trying to make three practically amoral criminals into sympathetic characters just didn't work for me. And they drag Chappie down to their level. Seeing the robot learn to move, talk and wear bling like a gangster is mildly amusing at first, but the joke wears thin pretty quickly. When Chappie's ""daddy"" (as he calls Ninja) lies to him to get him to commit crimes (which the robot does well and enthusiastically), it's hard to even think about Chappie as a sympathetic character. And it doesn't help that Chappie spends much of the movie more concerned with his own survival than using his digital humanity for something positive. The way Chappie is ""raised"" and the way he turns out seems to be saying something about the importance of parents positively influencing their children, but the story doesn't even do that very well. Mixed messages abound. And what is this movie saying about our humanity? That it's nothing more than a bunch of zeroes and ones? The movie never makes it clear and I couldn't ever make myself care. Basically, if you'll forgive the rhyming pun, ""Chappie"" is pretty crappie. ""D""",Chappie
148,loco_73,Chappie...meet Crappie!,6,20 March 2015,"When I first saw ""District 9"" a few years ago, I realized that a new voice and talent had come on scene in the form of the exciting director Neil Blomkamp. The movie went on to even garner a Best Picture, Oscar nomination at the 2009 Academy Awards. It actually got four nominations in total that year. Well deserved, I might add.Blomkamp's next effort was ""Elysium"", a bigger scale, bigger budget, bigger cast film. Though thematically different from ""District 9"" it contained some of the same ideas and concepts albeit in a different setting. The movie proved somewhat divisive for both critics and fans alike. Personally I thought it was a good movie. Was I enamoured with it? No, but it was a decent effort nonetheless. And a far cry from Crappie...err I mean ""Chappie""! ""Chappie"" is an uneven, disjointed directing effort from Blomkamp, a movie choke-full of interesting ideas and concepts, some of which are becoming repetitive though, since they carry over from ""District 9"".I would venture to guess that Blomkamp, the cerebral director he is, is soo fascinated and taken with the ideas and concepts he touches on as a moviemaker, that he seems to forget that true and tried adage, the devil is in the details, and that directing and telling a coherent story is just as important as telling a compelling one.Don't get me wrong, this movie does not suffer on the technical or special effects side. Blomkamp has proved himself to be among the best in his craft when it comes to those aspects, and able to deliver movies for relatively modest budgets by today's standards.Jo-burg aka Johannesburg, or at least the movie approximation of it, is a supremely interesting location as are its denizens. South Africa and its people are a fascinating combination to say the least.What brings this movie low is the script and the characters. It is weak and they are weak. The cast is oftentimes misspent and misused throughout the duration of the movie. Some are just walking clichés and others are redundant. The script is a badly composed mess, trying to decide if this movie is a philosophical treatise on artificial intelligence, humanity in the technological age, what is consciousness, what makes an individual...or a comedy...or an action movie. It ends up being neither of those. An botched mixture at best.That includes the title character himself, or itself, the ex-cop robot turned sentient AI, Chappie, a mixture of Alf and Number 5 aka Johnny Five from the ""Short Circuit"" movies, movies that ""Chappie"" clearly echoes. Because it is clear from the outset that this is by no means an original concept or idea, one that people such as author Isaac Asimov dealt with in his ""I, Robot"" novels, or Steven Spielberg in his and Stanley Kubrick's movie ""A.I."". Heck you could even throw Data from ""Star Trek TNG"" and ""Pinochio"" in the mix.Yet , even though this film borrows elements from other books, movies etc., it does nothing to incorporate them and in the process elevate itself.I know Blomkamp is better than this, I've seen it! I hope that this is just a hick-up along the way, that he learns from this and does better, much better in the future, lest this becomes a trend, and another once promising director is undone by mediocrity...yeah M. Night Shyamalan, I am looking at you! To be honest, I am actually looking forward to movies like ""Automata"" and ""Ex-Machina"" to fill in the gaps, that ""Chappie"" left wide open...",Chappie

Very rarely does a movie do that.,8,15 October 2015,"I had very high hopes for this film, as Blomkamp is one of my favorite creative forces in the film industry (I place him up there with Snyder and Del Toro). I am so glad that the movie did not disappoint. The special effects were amazing, the story was interesting and incredibly amusing, and the performances were very real. I believed everyone involved in this, which is the most important party of any Sci-Fi, CGI spectacle. In the end, I fell in love with not only the ""heroes"", but the ""bad guys"" as well, and no other movie has made me sympathize with both the protagonists and the (supposed) antagonists before. One of my favorite Sci-FI films to date.The only downside is making Chappie into a wannabe gangsta, with all the rap crap playing and such.

153,Semisonic,How to train your robot,5,3 June 2015,"If we look at Neill Blomcamp's filmography, we may safely assume that he's publicly known for just three movies: District 9, Elysium and Chappie. It's hard to perfectly define distinctive traits of a director when you have this little material, but if we wanted to speculate, those films could definitely say some things about their maker.First of all, do you know any other relatively world-famous director who sets his movies in Johannesburg? I certainly don't. And this is actually something i'm grateful to Blomcamp for, because the traditional US, European or even South American locations are getting too much. Second of all, all of Blomcamp's movies are more or less about the same thing: about human (or not so much) beings alienated by the system and struggling to find a proper place in this world. And finally, there's obviously Sharlto Copley. He and Neill Blomcamp are as inseparable as Peter Jackson and Andy Serkis, be it for the better or worse.All the above was not just a random recap to brag how savvy i am. Because with Chappie, it's much more interesting to see it not as a standalone movie but a step on a bigger path. Which, unfortunately, isn't the best of them all.District 9 was the least promising and the most delivering in terms of thought provocation. An aliens theme is not something of a surprise in modern day cinema. Aliens who are helpless and victimized by the human society was another matter entirely. It was definitely a breath of fresh air, a first real chance for the worldwide audience to see how the life is viewed by a movie director from a country with a fresh history of apartheid regime.Elysium, in a way, tried to build upon the Dictrict 9's success and plunge deeper into Blomcamp's socialist beliefs. An idea of many suffering so that a chosen few could prosper isn't that new, but still it's something that a lot of people could relate to. Elysium could be a cool ""rebel against the system"" flick, but Blomcamp clearly paid more attention to the visuals than to the plausibility of the universe he created. This led to Elysium feeling more like a cardboard facade with economical and social rules only a child could be satisfied with, which went against the director's message and left the movie, while still banging and glossy on the surface, rather stumbling and shallow inside.Chappie is a Blomcamp's return to the topic of ""a single person against the system"" confrontation, but this time it's just one tier in a multilayer composition. Corporate discipline and rigidness vs a single person's creativity. Humane ethics vs cold machine metrics. Even love vs exploitation. Blomcamp also tries to reach a higher, more metaphysical plain, with questions like ""But you're my maker, why'd you just make me so I could die?"". And, at first glance, it all may seem like a powerful mix, especially combined with impressive visuals we already have come to expect from this director.Unfortunately, while exposing numerous flaws and mistakes of the modern society, Blomcamp ends up making one of them himself. Just like Hugh Jackman's character of Vincent Moore, whose robot Moose isn't favored by the customers because it has so many features that it became monstrously overburdened and underdeveloped at the same time, Blomcamp tried to squeeze so many of his thoughts and ideas into two hours of time that each particular of them has no chance of showing any depth or progression. And what is the seemingly best way to compensate for the shallowness of your work? Exactly: to make what you have as screamingly grotesque as possible.This is the only explanation i have for the way characters from this movie look and behave. Deon Wilson is a brilliant inventor who created first truly sentient AI - so let's show him as a restless nerd who's typing some nonsense on his keyboard with insane speed, who never sleeps and clearly has a problem with energetic drink abuse. Vincent Moore is a closed-minded soldier-turned-engineer who clearly has a grudge against those more successful than him - so let's show him as a muscle-over-brains redneck type of guy wearing some weird haircut and carrying a pistol in open holster all the time. Michelle Bradley is a corporation's CEO - sure, let's make her a profit-hungry b!tch who sits in her spacious office, does motivation speeches broadcasted to the whole company building and doesn't see beyond the current selling points. Hippo is the main gangsta badass in Joburg - so why don't we show him as a dumb brute who shoots on any occasion and yells ""I want everything!!1!"". Chappie himself is a robot with a mind of a child prodigy - so let's make him a brat who either completely mimics what he's shown like some monkey or does something you'd expect from a disgruntled pre-teen. And i'm not even talking about the thug couple of Ninja and Yolandi who are supposed to be not just criminals but also ""parents"" to their unexpected robot ""child"" - so let's just invite the freaks from the local rap-rave group Die Antwoord and let them be themselves, with changing neither appearance nor names. And make them do some music for the movie while they're at it.The finale, both tragic and sorta open, is trying to leave a more dramatic aftertaste, but it's a weak attempt to change the overall impression. And to me, Chappie was as impressive as Ninja's set of tattoos: abundance of quantity but somewhat amateur quality. Which rather suits a counterculture rapper, but a movie that takes itself seriously - not so much.",Chappie
154,stephendaxter,An good and entertaining movie from director Neill Blomkamp,7,12 March 2015,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film from the really cool looking trailers because of the fact that it is directed by the mind behind District 9 and stars Sharlto Copley and Hugh Jackman. Now i didn't expect this film to be as good as District 9 but i did have high hopes for it. I was shocked to see early critic reviews be so low, but i still made the decision to go and see it in theatres........ and i am glad i did. It had all of the elements that you can expect from Blomkamp's films, amazingly realistic visual effects, great hidden meanings and emotion, and some really interesting and well written characters.....SOME. I really wanted this film to focus on Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) and Chappie vs Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) as that was one of the most interesting things in the trailer, the relationships, but you don't really get a whole lot of that until the final 30 minutes. The rest of the film is filled with watching Chappie learn and adapt to different lifestyles which was really interesting to watch, and focusing on two supporting characters Ninja and Yolandi, which wasn't so interesting. Watching Chappie grow smarter and learn from these characters was pretty entertaining, the scenes with Chappie reacting to the world wee definitely some of the best. But the film focused quite a bit of time on these two characters whether Chappie was or wasn't around. The scenes dragged on as they kept on going back to these characters over and over that they really wanted you to care about but you just didn't. I believe it was a mistake to include them so prominently in the film, they didn't do a terrible job but as supporting characters shouldn't have had so much screen time. I did like the ending, except for the final scene it was a solid, and interesting ending. In the end Chappie was a pretty good film that could have been a lot better if they focused a little more on the feud between Hugh Jackman and Dev Patel and less on Ninja and Yolandi. - 7.3",Chappie
155,stevepat99,Good versus evil .... without the 'good' = awful!,1,9 March 2015,"Saw the great ratings and then was on the verge of bailing for the first time in years. So the first 'intelligent' robot hangs with dope dealing, violent thugs, wears gold chains, swaggers and finally when Chappie tells them he can not commit a crime they easily convince him that by not using his gun he can stop cars, toss the drivers a hundred feed in the air (which might kill them) and take their cars... all the while Chappies can not figure out, with all his 'intelligence' that he has become a major felon like the rest of the gang. Before this mess is over Chappie never saves even one innocent civilian but does manage to draw blood from an innocent armored car driver as he commits yet another major felony.On the sci-fi part of the equation... we know Chappie's creator has invented a program that allows for the first 'thinking' robot. Suddenly, out of no where we're seeing the ability to transfer human's conscience to a robot. No explanation about how or way that is suddenly possible.The IMDb description of the film is nonsensical. Chappie, is hunted when he is seen committing crime and not because he is trying to save humanity. The stars of this film and role model for Chappie are on the verge, several times, of executing Chappies creator. They are low life armed and dangerous dope dealing thugs.Chappies amazing 'intelligence' finds him mindlessly following whomever is the latest person talking to him. Reasoning, morality, free will are out the window. Tell Chappie evil is good and he'll run with it. Finally a gizmo, the size of a flash drive can put the city at peril. Yet, it seems easy as pie for employees to snatch it and do very dirty deeds. There is way more security on your local bank's safety deposit box.

156,lucasnochez,Film Review: Chappie,10,9 March 2015,"A sense of belonging seems to be writer/director/producer Neill Blomkamp's greatest asset when it comes to filmmaking. The man behind the revered District 9 picks up the pieces of his fumbled second feature film Elysium by introducing us to the second cutest robot to ever grace the silver screen, Chappie. If you are wondering who managed to snatch the first place title of cutest robot to hit the big screen, I would easily argue Wall-E as the clear champion, albeit, animation (as well as Disney) have a fantastic way of bringing out the cute in everything, even a teapot. Luckily for audiences and movie-goers, Chappie is different; Chappie is real: Chappie is alive and Chappie is very much one of the best things to happen to the year 2015 in film.Blomkamp again introduces us to a world not far off from the one we live in today. Launching his story in his hometown Johannesburg, South Africa, local police are shown to have begun implementing a robotic policing force, known as the Scout program, from a weapons corporation Tetravaal. Its creator, Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), has been successful in creating easily operated and incorruptible weapons for the greater good, but we quickly learn that Deon is in search of something more – artificial intelligence and the creation of the first living, feeling sentinel being.While Blomkamp's film relies heavily on action, visual effects, and character development, Chappie can easily be hailed as the director's most personal, emotional, and sentimental feature film. Never shying away from very real and often times imaginative social commentaries set within uncomfortable and contemporary political setting, Blomkamp wastes no time in introducing Chappie, developing his character as much (if not more) than any other human being seen on screen.Hot off the heals of a very painful and personal failed program, ex-soldier turned engineered Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) is persistent to prove Wilson's Scout program as a failure, never being able to trust or rely on artificial intelligence. Deeming the program unpredictable, and arguing the ethics of A.I with that of a human being and the morality, ethics and fine fabrics that make man, Moore sets up the film for its greatest and deepest commentary. The very essence of Chappie relies heavily between the conflicts and struggles of two very real people: Deon and Vincent, and how their creations used for the greater good become catalysts to eliminate crime in a violently filled South African capital. Yet, throughout Chappie, the greatest animalistic behaviours and torn examples of violence, inhumanity and injustice/crime are seen by human beings. Moore spends most of the film trying to deceit and ruin Wilson, from nothing more than we can understand as revenge and jealousy, allowing us to pose the questions: would we want this man governing and policing our streets? Are these the beginnings of corruption?In addition to these scenes of treacherous human behaviour, the realest and most humane scenes of the film are those, almost exclusively, involving Chappie. From a quiet and sad encounter with a dog, to a very confused and apologetic encounter with a bleeding police officer on a bridge during a heist, to his many interactions with his ""maker"" Deon, Chappie shines with the most unwavering signs of humanity and moral justice.The underlining context of Blomkamp could easily be observed for many viewings, which makes Chappie, a robot with a bright orange ""reject"" sticker across his forehead, one of the most brilliant and under-appreciated films of 2015, deserving of being seen at least twice.Thankfully, although Chappie may be credited as being the most human character in the film, despite the simple fact that he is indeed a robot, he is not the only interesting individual. Endearing robot aside, Blomkamp's emotionally rich and deeply subconscious film is filled with fascinating characters. The two roles bound to be the most talked about make up the duo that will determine whether or not people enjoy the film. Of course, the pair is none other than Chappie's Mommy and Daddy: Ninja and Yolandi (Watkin Tudor Jones and Anri du Toit or, better known as, Ninja and Yo-Landi in the rap/synth South African musical duo Die Antwoord). Quite possibly the biggest reason Chappie may not be a success nor treated as the bravest science fiction film of 2015, is the inclusion of Die Antwoord. As it was for myself once I got wind of the casting choice, their involvement may be a real mystery to viewers. Truthfully, I wasn't fully able to understand their significance being cast up until the rolling of the end credits, ironically enough, while their song Cookie Thumper! penetrated my ear lobes. Blomkamp, a master filmmaker whose obsession with analyzing and capturing the essence of reality and significance of his hometown upbringing, truly brings a unique commentary about lower class societies, gangster culture, and the ultimate understanding of low-income family raising alongside crime- filled patriarchal ties.",Chappie
157,Spartan_1_1_7,Some quirks and bad plot points keeps it from being GREAT,7,27 May 2015,"Chappie is the third film directed by Neill Blomkamp, the guy who directed the awesome District 9. And while I enjoyed his second film, Elysium, it was no where near as good as D9. And after watching this, I guess I'll have to wait for his next film in hopes of getting something equally good as D9. Now, Chappie is set in a not so distant futuristic Johannesburg where police force is dominated by Robots and one of them gets a new programming which makes it a fully fledged A.I Sharlto Copley did a great job voicing Chappie. Loved him. Hugh Jackman played the main antagonist, and while he was good in it, his character just wasn't fleshed out more. He ended up being cliché typical villain. Sigourney Weaver was totally wasted in the movie. Her role was very limited and could have been played by anyone. Dev Patel was OK. Those Gangsters were NOT GOOD AT ALL. Sure they had their punk/hip style and all but as actors, MEH. Chappie sets it self apart from most other A.I films in a way that the A.I is not directly connected to the internet when it is created or something like that. It doesn't get access to all the knowledge and stuff. So in a way, the A.I (Chappie) is like a new born baby and his development depends upon the people he reacts with and his surroundings. It was sort of a refreshing experience and I really liked it. Only the bummer was that he ended up with some punk ass gangsters. It just ruined a lot of possibilities. But it did provide with some really FUNNY scenes. I honestly laughed out loud at some points. The action was pretty good. And the soundtrack was very varied and fitting, liked it a lot. CGI was mostly great. There were some plot points that just felt too stupid or lame that suspension of disbelief just didn't cut it there. But despite this movie's problems, it had heart, it made me care (For chappie) and ended up making me have a good time. If only some of the quirks weren't present and some plot points were different, this could have been a great film.7.5/10",Chappie

I also felt it gives some insight into how young gangsters are made. It should be a cartoon but somehow got made into an actual film. The writers make things up as they go along and expect the audience to forgive things that can't be explained or aren't thought out. There are so many unanswered questions and implausible actions that you would need at least one more film to try to explain them. Thankfully, this seems to be the only one.",Chappie
159,rprince-832-6294,"A lot of missed opportunities, but enjoyable",7,7 March 2015,"-Chappie (2015) movie review: -Chappie, from the creators of District 9 and Elysium, takes place a few years in the future, where police are mostly replaced by robots. When the creator of the robots steals one of them and installs an artificial intelligence program, the robot, Chappie, becomes able to think and feel for himself. This causes all sorts of questions and problems that you should really just watch the trailer for.-Chappie is a good example of a film that missed some opportunities. However, it was not bad, to mixed bag review incoming.-The story has been done before, but the film put an original feel on it successfully. Having the robot learn for itself like a child and deal with the pretty awful world was different than like I, Robot or Automata. However, Chappie spends a large portion of the film with Ninja and Yolandi, who are criminals. Although Yolandi provides a very mothering character to Chappie, Ninja is just an awful person and spends a good part of the film trying to corrupt and lower the bar for Chappie. This means that instead of being good and having to be less good to make the world better, Chappie goes from not good to just mire good, making the whole morality thing a waste. By the way, the actors real names are Ninja and Yo-Landi.-The pace was good.-The acting was fine. Dev Patel, Yo-Landi, Ninja, Hugh Jackman as the villain, and Anderson Cooper as himself all did a fine job. Sigourney Weaver did an impressive job. Most importantly though, was Shartlto Copley as Chappie, so did an Andy Circus great job! -The characters: Chappie was a fantastic, deep, likable, etc. etc. character. He's to fun to watch as he grows and learns and stuff. The guy who makes the robots is likable and good. Hugh Jackman was a great villain who offered a pretty cool motive. Again, biggest problem was the two criminals. I already talked about them, so yeah. I will say Chappie does end up teaching them a lot, so you do like them alittle better, but not enough. Not quite.-The music was sweet. I have no idea who composed it, but I kinda want it.-The effects, minus one or two moments, were pretty top-notch. I would not put an Oscar nod below it.-So to kinda sum up, Chappie had cool and emotional scenes and took advantage of some smart writing, but it also had some really wasted opportunities where cliché would have been much better. The film lacked focus, but I still really enjoyed it. So basically watch the two trailers. If you like them, you will like Chappie. If you don't, you won't. I liked it, so I personally will say that Chappie is still worth seeing in theaters! -Chappie is rated-R for some language, brief violence, and partial nudity on a TV. Really some language.",Chappie
160,marc5477,Johnny 5 meets Robocop in a mediocre way,5,2 June 2015,"A fun movie about a programmer who creates a sentient robot out of a discarded police robot. Once sentient, it needs to learn how to deal with the world. The twist in this movie is that the programmer is caught by street criminals and they become the ""parents"" of the robot. The parents are deadbeat losers and as it turns out the robot Chappie makes them better people by becoming their ""son"" in a way. Is it believable? Not really. the emotional conversion is not done very well and is too abrupt. The parents change their disposition in a few days from uncaring druggie drunk thieves (and maybe murderers) to caring people who not just care for Chappie but for each other as well. They are not believable. Chappie however is somewhat believable the same way Johnny 5 was in Short Circuit... except that Chappie has the internet to play with. Once Chappie is better educated he turns into a powerful being able to understand things human cannot and takes revenge against the people who hurt him and his ""family.""

And the plot has a few nice original ideas - having to train an AI, for example. But overall the plot involves too many side lines that its hard to know what the main story actually is.

165,LiamBlackburn,Chappie the blank slate,8,17 May 2015,"I have to admit that about a third of the way through this, I started to get really annoyed with overplayed ""gangster"" characters. It started to make the movie look juvenile and silly. It almost looked like it was going to tailspin into a cinematic oblivion of ""juvenile Disney movie thuggery"" (best description I can think of) as Chappie learns how to rap and throw ninja stars (facepalm). You start to question why the director would let the gangster characters continue to become even more outlandishly silly and over-the-top. Then, you are refreshingly reminded of the first thing that ""Daddy"" taught Chappie which was not to harm others or commit crimes. Luckily, for the movie's sake, a conscious viewer can begin to understand the imagery and story-telling that is taking place. We can then choose to see a character (in Chappie) as the embodiment of all SA children. Chappie (like the SA children) are born with a ""blank slate"" mind into a world of thugs and guns and crime. This then begins to have a profound cerebral effect on you as you follow Chappie's character development onward. I think it will be easy to write this movie off based on how silly the characters are. They are incredibly over-the-top, but I guess that is the whole idea. To show how stupid thugs look and to highlight their chaotic behaviour.",Chappie
166,Paynebyname,"Give it a chance, I'm glad that I did",8,14 February 2017,"To set the scene about my review on this film, I do have to provide a little bit of context. District 9 is one of my favourite films. The way it made me feel when I saw it, the wonder of the effects, the performances of those involved, the involving story that it told and the brilliance of the makers (Blomkamp and co) who burst onto the scene with this first film. I was awed and I lapped the film up. When Elysium was due to come out, I avoided all trailers and descriptions of the films. I had bundles of confidence in Neill and his team and wanted to enter the cinema as 'innocent' to the story as I had with D9.However, I was crushed by Elysium. It felt so weak, so hackneyed, so overplayed and so preachy. Big money had got involved, big stars had signed up and it felt like the creativity and wonder of the team had been bloated and corrupted by the studios offering Neill a blank cheque to do what he wanted. I was so disappointed. I couldn't even take comfort that Elysium might be a flash in the plan as a little research after the film revealed that the next film would be Chappie – what a stupid name I thought. And whereas with Elysium I gave myself an information ban, on Chappie I did the opposite. As you well know the reviews were scathing, the trailers gave conflicting interpretations of what the film was and the haircuts looked ridiculous. More review reading, more IMDb message board surfing and more research into the unlikeable characters and a head of negative steam built up against the film, that couldn't be over turned. I still loved D9 but even that wasn't strong enough to give me the confidence in Neill and go to see the film.Fast forward to a week ago and I receive an offer to have Sky movies as part of my existing Virgin package. I come home that night and start trawling through the available films to throw some bits in the watch later list and I notice Chappie. My interest is piqued out of morbid curiosity but I have no intention of making it a tent pole weekend film. It's a Wednesday night around about midnight and with work the next day, I decide to give it half an hour with the knowledge that if it's crap I can switch off and hit the sack.Well the music got me first. It was wonderful and had a great 80's Tron vibe to it. I am a big fan on Jean Michel Jarre and Tangerine Dream and the music had welcome nods to those artists. The story felt a little clichéd, the haircuts looked laughable and the characters of Ninja and Yolandi flat out annoying. But it began to get under my skin. My brain was stimulated and in the early hours of a work night, I was wide awake.Maybe I'm a sentimental old fool but I didn't like the harsh treatment that the innocent Chappie was receiving though looking back I understand that it was a tool to make me empathise with his plight and cement a connection to his character.Two thirds of the way through and I was hooked. I was invested in Chappie. Ninja and Yolandi were mellowing (or at least becoming more likable) and I was on board with the story and wondering what would happen. Yes it has nods towards Short Circuit and Robocop and any other sentient robot film but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have its own story to tell.The final battle in the disused factory, whilst not as good as the epic fight in D9, had me on the edge of the seat and the brutal actions scenes and swelling score were a tour de force. By the last 15 minutes, I was willing Chappie to make it and worried his power would run out or be captured. The resolution to his and Deon's problem was wonderfully original and I let the whole credits roll as a mark of respect for my enjoyment and to hear as much of the soundtrack as I could.I watched the film again three days later and enjoyed it even more, picking up on more of the subtleties of Copley's physical movement and some of the other musical cues. I'm going to purchase the Blu Ray as I feel I owe it to the makers and it's worthy of being in my collection. I feel bad for not showing faith in the director and listening to the critics and reviews but Elysium was such a disappointment that I guess I couldn't look beyond it. On the upside though, I got a really nice surprise of seeing a cracking, entertaining film on my own and when I least expected it.",Chappie
167,lucasversantvoort,A jumbled pile of wasted ideas,5,11 May 2015,"Neill Blomkamp seems to be channeling his inner Shyamalan, because everyone one of his films seem duller than the one that came before. I'll come right out and say I wasn't blown away by Blomkamp's breakout film District 9. I liked it, but the overblown last half hour or so almost completely ruined what came before. There, finally, it was revealed that Blomkamp couldn't help but succumb to predictable action that has zero to do with the narrative. Those issues and more all plague Chappie as well.It's sometime in the not-so distant future in (where else?) Johannesburg, South Africa where the police have been making use of police robots. They're created by Deon from weapons manufacturer Tetravaal. When one night he succeeds in creating true artificial intelligence (with consciousness and so on), he takes the idea to his boss, who like all movie bosses are about as helpful as one ply toilet paper, refuses his request. He then steals a broken down robot to do it himself. However, much to his surprise, a bunch of hoodlums kidnap him, because they owe a rival a couple of millions and need a robot to pull off a heist. Deon is thus forced to 'install' a 'consciousness' within the robot which will turn him into something like a baby, albeit a very intelligent one. Much to the gang leader's chagrin, the robot will need to be taught everything, language, morality and so on. The rest of the movie primarily shows how both Deon, the gang and the world influence Chappie.For a film called Chappie, it sure does take a damn long time for Chappie to make his first appearance. but when he does, the film almost risks becoming really interesting, but in true Blomkamp fashion, this turns the film into a rope tussle. On the one hand, you've got the interesting themes (consciousness, artificial intelligence, etc.) vying for attention and on the other you've got hammy acting, droning dubstep, boring action, sloooow-moooootion and dreadfully written characters all shouting 'look at me, look at me'. Not exactly a match made in heaven. To make matters worse, I can't decide whether or not the film even takes itself seriously which doesn't help matters during scenes that are obviously meant to be emotional.For some reason, Blomkamp's had his films graced with highly talented actors who basically have nothing to do. In Elysium, it was Jodie Foster who had the thankless role of the pragmatically evil corporate scumbag and now it's Sigourney Weaver, although her character's not really evil. You've also got Hugh Jackman as the frustrated arms developer who really REALLY wants his giant armed robots to be given the green light. Also, he has a penchant for externalizing his every thought: ""Where are you going? ""What the hell is going on?"" It all raises the question: why get these big names when you're giving them nothing to really do? By the way, spoiler alert, the Jackman character is basically completely insane. At first, you're like, 'okay he's the rival who wants his military robot approved.' But before you know it, he's threatening Deon in the workplace(!) and at film's end, he's remotely controlling his robot and ripping people in half. You'd think these kind of psychological issues would've put him in an insane asylum or something But the real bummer is how this film tries to be everything, like I said before. You'll be cringing during a montage featuring some of the worst dubstep you'll ever find yourself subjected to and moments later, it's grab-your-handkerchief time as some melodramatic plot twist is introduced, before the film again shifts into action overdrive riddled with an abusive amount of slo-mo. Just as bad guy Hippo spouts toward the end, ""I want everything!"", so does Blomkamp seem to want it all. He wants action, drama, humor, interesting sci-fi, the full package. There's only one problem: he's simply incapable of doing so and this fact reasserts itself in every overwrought second of this cinematic mess.Oh, and whoever decided that this film needed (what I can only describe as) high-pitched girly, Anime-styled dubstep can fall of a cliff along with the rest of the musical hacks that hack and saw their way through today's films.",Chappie

It has it's potential it looks great, but there are some weakness in script. It could use more potential to Chappies awaking awareness, but it passes it many times when it leans on humor. Chappie feels a little like Robocop, but in many ways it passes it's moral issues. It could be interesting to follow Chappie's moral issues against it's logic awareness and stupidity of human kind but Blokamp passes that too easily. Chappie is no way a bad movie. It is very visually and action scenes are very well executed. Johannesburg as a back ground looks brutally ill and inconsolable. In many ways Chappie is very entertaining even with it necessity. It is good to see Hugh Jackman as a bad guy at once. Dev Patel works well as a nerd who creates Chappie and Sigourney Weaver is great as her supporting role.

170,IndustriousAngel,Excellent if you consider it a B-movie,7,8 March 2015,"I hadn't read reviews but gathered that they were mixed (at best) ... I guess critics probably went into ""Chappie"" with wrong expectations. This is, despite the possible philosophical or even theological ramifications, first and foremost a B-movie. As such, it succeeds - FX are simply superb, the pace is fast, the script tight, we root for Chappie and the villain has it coming and gets it.Now, with the B-movie comes a certain silliness - the science and tech are dumbed down (not a real problem), and the characters are paper-thin, mostly just prototypes: the GANGSTA WITH THE GOLDEN HEART, the MAD SCIENTIST, the MOTHER, the CAPITALIST PIG, the VILLAIN ... and of course the misled hero. And if you've been following Blomkamp's long career through all of his two features, maybe we couldn't expect more, those are exactly the same cardboard characters stumbling through Districts 9 and E. And if you can accept this as a B-movie, this is not a real problem either.There are real problems however - that's why I give ""Chappie"" only 7/10 - but most of these have to do with casting. Dev Patel? He's a complete zero here, sorry. Sigourney Weaver? The ""working girl""-bitch she plays was sufferable in ""Paul"" because that was a comedy; here it's simply laughable. Hugh Jackman? I think the guy could play a nice villain, here he's wasted on his cardboard character and phones it in.

Visually stunning, thrilling, funny and profound, 'CHAPPiE' can easily be called a modern and uncompromisingly adult 'Short Circuit' but it goes far beyond that and tells a moral tale with confidence.It has all the ingredients to a seamless sci-fi thriller; good bankable actors, original pop culture, great storytelling and flawless special effects; and a soundtrack reminiscent of the best of sci-fi thanks to none other than Hans Zimmer, but its other notable strengths are not what you might expect.The film features Ninja and Yolandi from South African rap duo of legend Die Antwood, as characters Ninja and Yolandi (not a typo), and would you believe that they bring so much to this movie? It's not a full-on action blockbuster, not like 'Elysium' tried to be, but those same Blomkampisms regarding zany violence and salt of the earth humour come in large doses. The titular character is the main attraction as this robot experiencing consciousness experiences life from infancy to adolescence under the wing of criminals looking to use him for personal gain.Just when you think it's going to become your average tearjerker or action fest, it second guesses you and leaves your mind wide open.Blomkamp's greatest strength here is that 'CHAPPiE' is simpler than it threatens to be. It is an adult movie that appeals to your inner child and your id, but it is definitely a salute to classic sci-fi conventions and hopefully the beginning of a resurgence.Its only weakness for me was that Zimmer's soundtrack often drowned out the dialogue which I had to train my ear to because of the Afrikaans accents.I really want a sequel to this!",Chappie

Series of events lead him to getting abducted by a group of gangsters who believe that he can simply turn a switch and make the robots help them into robbing a bank.This all leads to him activating ""Chappie"", our main robot. Chappie learns from actions of who is around him. There are some comedic parts during these scenes as he acts like a gangster and starts to talk slang. The problem was two of the three gangsters were not the best of actors. Apparently they are part of a South African rap group.Throughout the film you start to feel for this robot and when the climax starts you notice that Chappie has changed the way these gangsters think.

175,rjsf96,'Chappie' Boasts Interesting Ideas But Is Ultimately A Familiar and Derivative Sci-Fi Adventure,5,9 March 2015,"Neill Blomkamp is a talented director. I say this statement without any hesitation whatsoever. He started his filmmaking career with the quirky and oddball 'District 9'. He followed it up with the equally entertaining and risky 'Elysium'. All of his ideas are slightly different and have a basis in science fiction. 'Chappie' follows the same basic principle. I must say that the trailer made me cry with emotion, joy and love. Sadly the film did not make me exhibit the same emotions.'Chappie' is the story of how Deon Wilson creates an artificial intelligence system which adopts the name of Chappie. This world is in the near future where crime is rampant and the police force is hard hitting with robots fighting villains. Wilson creates Chappie as part of his own personal project to show that computers can exhibit the same emotions as humans. If this sounds familiar it sadly is. The same themes can be found in 'Ex Machina', the upcoming 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' and the original 'Robocop' film to a certain extent. 'Ex Machina' was far more intelligent and Ultron in the 'Avengers' is already heading to dive deep into themes of computer consciousness that 'Chappie' only lightly touches upon. 'Chappie' becomes ultra-violent in its third act, but lacks the pin point accuracy with which 'Robocop' was able to satirise American culture and society.There are still fun and entertaining elements to the film, just not enough to warrant a two hour feature instead of a thirty minute short. The latter of which would have been more appropriate for this project. Dev Patel is as endearing and likable as ever as Deon Wilson. I always felt emotion for his character, so when Chappie comes into being, it is a terrible shame. He hangs out with thugs Ninja and Yolandi and proceeds to rob cars; in the films single greatest moment, but also kill people without understanding the consequences of his actions.Yolandi is kind and nurture's Chappie's artistic side of the brain, through getting him to interact with the world by painting it how he sees it. However, Ninja is without a doubt the single most annoying character to appear on screen since Jar Jar Binks. I never cared about him at all. He spends most of the second act with the robot and this is where Chappie's circuits short fuse. Ninja disillusions him, when Chappie realises that his batteries will eventually go dead. So Chappie involves himself in robberies so he can get enough cash to transmit his consciousness to another robot. With no Patel in sight the film loses its key emotion which is heart. 'Chappie' is in short bursts enjoyable to watch, but Ninja almost single handedly detracts from Chappie's undeniable charm.The villain who is played by Hugh Jackman believes artificial intelligence is too risky and decides to set his own machines up against Chappie in the film's climactic battle. This works because Blomkamp understands that we need to tell what is happening when an action scene takes place. In this sequence Jackman thrives, but when your film has me rooting for the bad guy, you know something went wrong.Obviously the film looks outstanding how could it not when 'District 9' and 'Elysium' where given the same treatment. The musical score by Hans Zimmer rocks! He is completely in his element as he loves everything to do with electronic sounds and it shows.There is just too much going against 'Chappie' to warrant paying the ticket price. It's pacing is completely off, as the middle act becomes boring and dull, we have seen all of the same elements on offer here happen again and again.Sigourney Weaver is given the role of mad chief executive of the company that Wilson works for. She delivers lines with little to no intensity and just glares at anyone who dares to approach her. If Neill Blomkamp's Alien sequel is already moving forward then hopefully he will find something useful to do with Weaver in the near future.I have no clue why, by the film is littered with Sony products! Maybe Chappie was made as an extended commercial for Sony, which would factor into how it is in urgent need of a heart and soul.I can't stay mad at 'Chappie' for too long. It was one of my most anticipated films of 2015. My excitement only heightened when I realised that Neill Blomkamp was attached to direct and that Sharlto Copley contributed to the voice and motion capture of Chappie. Think of it as a work of a talented director that became lost and misguided during the production process. Like David Fincher's 'Alien 3'. It will make it easier to let go of your heartbreak and still maintain faith for Blomkamp in the future.",Chappie

Id been avoiding this movie because Id heard Die Antword had made filming very difficult and it got messy. I try to keep an open mind but imagine your reaction if youd found out Violent Jay of ICP would be starring in a WWII drama. Thats not the end of the movies problems though. Its a lot of the classic ""why is this happening?"" ""because we need it to for the plot to move forward."" scenes and in the end whatever you expect is exactly what happens.

177,graham-harvey,A cool robot is in town!,8,28 August 2017,"This film has many aspects that I liked. The whole discussion about soul and consciousness and whether a robot could possess them, the idea that criminals might have positive and negative sides, the truths exposed of greedy motives for decisions made by individuals and company directors. Chappie starts as your run of the mill robot, but under training of a few questionable individuals, gets his groove on mid film, and then some serious hip robot moves are happening from there. I loved the sauntering swearing robot scenes. And the decisions about sacrifice for others or the greater good were fascinating too. A good film to see. Lots of coarse language, yet a great morality tale.",Chappie
178,vistheindian,Criminal WALL-E,6,10 March 2015,"Quickie Review:A new era has begun where a robotic police force patrols the city of Johannesburg. Their creator, Deon (Dev Patel) develops a program for consciousness and builds the first ever sentient robot Chappie (Sharlto Copley). However, Chappie is forcefully kept away from Deon by gangsters who want to use the robot to commit crimes. There are some big concepts here packaged in an action heavy movie. Visually and stylistically director Neill Blomkamp's flare is clearly present and well put together. Also Copley's acting is top notch in showing how Chappie grows and changes in the movie. And yet all those positives brought down simply because the main actors Ninja and Yo- Landi Visser are not good actors with too much time spent on them. Chappie is interesting, but I'd recommend holding off spending your money on it.Full Review:I loved District 9, the directorial debut of Neill Blomkamp. It was a gritty sci-fi with very relevant social commentary on racism and segregation. Even his next movie Elysium despite being a little underwhelming, I ended up liking it overall. So it's suffice to say I was looking forward to Chappie.There are quite a few things that I really liked about Chappie. The best of which is Sharlto Copley's performance as the titular robot. When he is first brought to life Chappie is practically a baby, completely new to the world. Like a child he is extremely curious and yet at the same time naive enough that he is easily molded by his guardians, which in his case are unfortunately two criminals. Whenever he is being manipulated by these people I felt bad for Chappie, I sympathized with him. So the fact that Copley got me to feel that way about a robot is definitely impressive. The theme of nature versus nurture is obvious here, but it is conveyed effectively. Visually this a great looking film, which shouldn't come as a surprise but still praiseworthy. The action scenes are explosive and gets your blood pumping. That's also thanks to the great original score by Hans Zimmer.The unfortunate thing is, most people like myself will leave the movie frustrated because of one mistake that Blomkamp makes. One day while listening to the band Die Antwoord of Ninja and Yo-Landi, he had the thought of what it'd be like if these two people were gangsters and raised a robot. Definitely a unique and interesting idea, but instead of hiring actual actors to bring that vision to life he hired the real band members as themselves. This was a critical mistake because they were horrible actors and just annoying to watch. I understand that I wasn't supposed to like these characters because they were practically child abusers with Chappie, but their over the top acting made me look forward to the scenes they weren't in. Then when the final climatic fight happens and these two characters are in peril, I didn't care one bit for their safety. That's a huge failure if I don't care for the well-being of the main characters.Chappie like previous Blomkamp movies have some relevant themes and concepts. However the execution of the whole vision is not always consistent mainly due to having the focus on two people that couldn't act. Sharlto Copley as Chappie redeems the movie from being a complete disaster, and for that reason I wouldn't mind recommending watching the movie through a video streaming service. As for cinema, this a matinée at best.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Chappie
179,jmvscotland,"Dreadful, atrocious rubbish",1,21 July 2015,"Very simply, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I believe that one should watch even the worst movies to the end in order to have the right either to criticize or to acclaim. I watched this one right through to that end and also to see just how awful it could get. The plot was paper thin, the main character Chappie was a PITA and all the other performances, including that by Sigourney Weaver (how did she ever allow herself to be associated with such utter merde?) were either awful or as close as makes no difference. A particular bugbear for me was the awful Zeth Efrikan accents all the way through this piece of trash. My advice? Believe the critics and avoid this one at all costs. How it rates so well on IMDb is a mystery to me.",Chappie
180,CowherPowerForever,"Don't laugh, I'm being cool.",5,16 March 2015,"Director/Writer Neill Blomkamp brings us another Sci-Fi thriller with his current outing called Chappie. While his previous two outings with District 9 and Elysium were good, Chappie simply doesn't live up to those previous films. The film is bogged down by a slow story that takes forever to developed, and characters that no one really cares about. The following is my review for Chappie.As I just mentioned Neill Blomkamp is both the writer and director of this film, and the film was also written by Terri Tatchell. He directed District 9, Elysium, and is now attached to direct the next Alien film. Tatchell is known for writing on District 9 as well. This is about a futuristic police force that is all computerized drones, thus eliminating our current human police force. Deon Wilson(Dev Patel) is the creator of this line of police force, but wants something more. He takes an idea to his boss Michelle Bradley(Sigourney Weaver) about working on his new idea for giving a test robot human characteristics. She doesn't go for the idea, but Vincent Moore(Hugh Jackman) who is creating his own police drone is after Deon and his plans. Meanwhile a gang of criminals who need money to pay off their bad guy decide to steal a drone from Deon. They kidnap Deon and force him to build his current idea for a new robot. The gang has other ideas for his use though. They train him to be gangster if you will to help them pull off a big job. Vincent however is onto them and the story picks up from there, and I won't spoil it. The story on the surface looks good, which is why I wanted to see it, but the film doesn't play out that well. The film suffers from too much boredom in the overall story buildup, that when the story really starts kicking, it is very much lackluster. At the heart the story means well telling a story about how some feel about robots overall. Blomkamp doesn't strike gold like with his past works, and this film is certainly his worst as of now.Neil Blomkamp directed the film as well which I mentioned above, and this is an area he excels more at during the course of the film. While his story is not good at all, the action scenes towards the end of the film look excellent. This film had a small budget, but those constraints don't really hurt the film in this department. The action is mainly to towards the end of the film, but there are some intense scenes, and the scenes look amazing as Blomkamp is well versed in making action Sci-fi films like this. The acting is generally good for the most part as well. Dev Patel and Hugh Jackman work very well together, really pulling that animosity off of each other. The gang members do a good job, but nothing groundbreaking. With some good directing and Blomkamp's good eye for acting, this department is one area of the film that is overall really good.The film was composed by legendary composer Hans Zimmer. Zimmer is well known for his recent works such as The Dark Knight trilogy, 12 Years a Slave, and Interstellar. While all or most of those scores from the films I just mention are legendary scores we won't be forgetting, this score he crafted for Chappie is certainly another great addition to his works. Literally from the moment the film started Zimmer's score cranks up and takes you into the film. The depth he adds to his works are nothing short of amazing, and the same can be said here. Fans of a good score should appreciate this score, and this score is certainly going to be one of the best from 2015.Overall the film is fairly average. I absolutely cannot advise anyone to spend money on this film at the theaters. If you enjoyed District 9 and Elysium, this should be a rental film for you if you already haven't seen it. While we get some great aspects to this film with the acting, directing and score, the bad story and how it plays out simply doesn't warrant anyone to spend ten or even five dollars on this film.5/10",Chappie
181,Equalizer16,CHAPPIE is a unique film with so much to offer the audience.,6,25 April 2015,"When the credits role, the film leaves you with certain thoughts and feelings. It is very rare when I leave the cinema that I feel speechless. There are so many films out there about the potential of artificial intelligence. But for the first time....this is something new.Of course, the main narrative of 'CHAPPIE' is of the experimentation of robots having the mind of a new born human, however I think the film itself is new creation. Putting the story to the side for the minute, the film contains huge masses of almost everything. The film may look to be a science fiction, action, drama, but this film has something the audience are not expecting. Action, comedy, violence, excitement, intensity, emotion, fun, pulse raising a gripping story, repelling story, interesting, disappointing (briefly), the list is endless. But together...UNIQUE. 'CHAPPIE' focuses on a future of artificial intelligence, and one man's work to create a machine to think for itself, and have capabilities beyond humanities. Although, after this the story changes a bit, on a different path to what the viewer is first thinking. On the other hand, this is the beginning of how the story goes a bit down but then comes back later with something so grabbing. The director Neil Blomcamp continuous to impact the viewer with something never seen before, as compared to his other works, District 9, and Elysium. Here he shows us the modern world of AI, and definitely tries to give the viewer a new perspective to ponder over of AI. However, as hinted earlier the film does present themes and moments that may draw the viewer's opinion away. But the film overlaps this again and again, so the viewer cannot make his mind up. I still don't know whether I liked the film. All I know is that it was most intriguing and a definite must see. The film to me is a 6/10, but is so much more than its trailer. I strongly recommend this to all those cinema fans, and to consider the narrative, but also the structure of the film itself. Because this film is unique, and is progress in finding my favourite film.",Chappie
182,jimlacy2003,"Entertaining, but very simple, and too much product placement",6,15 March 2015,"I liked this movie, it had a lot going for it. Pretty entertaining and the over-all production value was high. The special effects were great.A lot of it pretty original and felt fresh, but then the rest it fell pretty flat.It seems like they made this movie for the mildly smart range down to the dimwitted. They apparently decided to tip the scale away from technical realities, reason, and intellectualism towards the common mass-appeal side. It was too predictable and simplistic.A lot of it is stereotypical and unfortunately uses a lot of the typical cliché shortcuts. To much is taken for granted. You've already seen a lot of the same clichéd nonsense about technology and ""hackers"", from movies like ""Hackers 1995"", ""Independence Day 1996"", and any number of similar movies. They could have balanced it better; probably by being less obvious and more implicit. There are a lot of other movies that do this much better.Finally one star less for too much annoying product placement! It's obvious what studio produced this movie. They make sure you damn well know that they produced the laptops seen in the movie. The brand name is shoved in your face throughout the movie. And then you see a bunch of ""PlayStation 4"" several times implying that all people love them and that they are so powerful that they could be together into some kind of supper computer that could solve man's biggest problems.Again entertaining, probably worth the price of admission, it's just too bad they dulled it down so much and practically turned into one big commercial..",Chappie

184,ahegde3149,Not quite good considering its sci-fi from Blomkamp,4,19 June 2015,"I must admit Chappie was honestly disappointing. It had great potential to subtly touch upon its ideals like Blomkamp's earlier two films (Disctrict 9 and Elysium both good sci-fi films). But unfortunately Chappie is degraded by some of its ridiculous characters and acting (talking about you Ninja and Yolandi) plus the narrative was seldom coherent. I was kind of excited to see what role Hugh Jackman had, but again his character was seriously under- developed and felt like one of typical one-dimensional bad guys. Despite all that I will say, Chappie is okay on some level because of its pleasing central character Chappie, an AI Robot having a baby's mind at the beginning but learning very fast. It's enjoyable at the start with Chappie's curiosity about the world around , but later it becomes a drag and too clichéd. In the climax it all boils down to mundane and predictable action. The ending felt senseless and far from being realistic. Neill Blomkamp kind of continues with his District 9 comfort zone with his Jo'burg setting and similar visuals. Hans Zimmer's music I believe was huge positive and the only memorable thing about this film. Its enjoyable if you like mindless-transformers like action drama, the music and Chappie's character held me in there. But it was quite disappointing though as sci-fi film. Expected much better from Neill Blomkamp.RATING: [2/5]",Chappie
185,WasiReviews,The Most Over-loathed Movie By Critics for No Reason,8,31 October 2020,"When this came out I never heard a peep about it except for it was a bad AI film and I decided to check out this so called poor take on machines the same year it released. I agree the characters are kind of generic and aren't built up but the CGI man! That was good. The cinematography made this movie feel like South Africa every frame has a purpose a feel to it I can't explain, the ending was a shock for me and made no sense but I still loved it either way. Chappie had many comedic moments and the kind of dialogue I expected from Dev Patel and Hugh Jackman who delivered. The action was bada**, I don't want to get into spoilers but I will say this movie deals with the human consciousness. It doesn't have the best plot you'll ever see but it's manageable. It is still among the best among robot, action, sci-fi movies definitely check it out if your into that. If you don't like one of those genres (except action there's not a lot of it), then stay away.",Chappie
186,valen060,"My Equation: District 9 + I, Robot = Chappie",8,5 March 2015,"Upon seeing so much hype of Neill Blomkamp's latest project, Chappie, I had to see what his follow-up from past hits like District 9 and Elysium can do. When I did, the movie itself further left me puzzled, but kept me engaged in the action scenes. The idea of a robot who was originally programmed for serious community work with no sentient purposes seems to follow the trail left behind by past robot-based films like 'Wall-E,' 'I, Robot,' and notably 80s comedy 'Short Circuit.' Blomkamp film regular, Sharlto Copley certainly delivered such an amazing motion-capture performance as the innocent, yet gifted robot Chappie.Comparing Chappie to Johnny 5 in terms of witty humor is something that has been done before, but the action sequences began to remind me of the intense, anarchic moments shown in Blomkamp's District 9, which is kind of the recurring themes in his previous projects. 'Slumdog Millionaire' star Dev Patel plays inventor Deon who reprograms one of the decommissioned robots (along with the assistance of two individuals of South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord) leading to Chappie seeing them as his parental figures as well as him focusing on the concepts of compassion, existentialism, and even nonconformity. It now proves that Chappie can be much more than just an obedient robot, but can actually express himself in ways the average human cannot comprehend.The villain (played by Hugh Jackman) considers this sentient being a threat and plans to eradicate it in anyway possible, thus bringing Chappie and his human comrades to a full-scale rebellion against the oppressive tyrant and his forces.I found the film to be enjoyable and sometimes laughable because it reminded me of the themes in not just the humor of 'Short Circuit,' but a near-similar scenario shown in 'I, Robot' as well in terms of consciousness being tested. The movie does indeed demote Jackman's hero reputation from past movies as the villain Vincent Moore since the archetypes of his character here feel too cliché. Sigourney Weaver's role as CEO Michelle Bradley feels unclear on what side does she really condone, but I felt her character development could've stretched more than what is shown on screen. Since the movie's setting takes place once again in the derelict, yet prosperous areas of Johannesburg, South Africa, I can already tell that it comes from the same vein as District 9. Since Blomkamp admitted that he would helm the next 'Alien' film, only time will tell of what he really thinks about the critical outcome of Chappie's success.To conclude, whether they are misdeeds or not, Chappie is a likable robot who can pull off extraordinary things as any human (albeit even outlandish), maybe something better. The entire movie is nowhere near the equivalent of District 9 story-wise, but as Chappie quotes, ""I am consciousness. I am alive."" This further emphasizes that he is capable of thinking on his own and upon his understanding, it's human nature.",Chappie
187,jb07-660-944395,Chappie is crappy,1,26 June 2015,"After reading reviews that said negative reviewers were 'way off' with this one, I ended up trying to watch it.It is terrible.The script is woeful, creating 1 dimensional characters that reduce the ability of the actors to being unable to act. Not even the likes of Sigourney Weaver or Hugh Jackman can stop this drivel looking good. Why Hugh Jackman's character would be so dumb as to sell an obviously military robot designed to shoot down aircraft to the police is beyond belief. The police not wanting to buy the robot is then used as the reason his character goes bad. It is a $2 script with a multi million dollar budget and cast, and it shows.",Chappie
188,jonnithomas,It's a film for children,4,27 May 2015,If you view this as a film for children of about 8-10 years old then you will not expect too much. That will be good because you don't get too much.It's a film to watch for all the family. It's not clever or deep or thought provoking in any way.The characters are not solid or believable but the actors do the best that they can with a really awful script. The directing is OK but you can only do so much with what you are given.Don't expect robocop or short circuit as it isn't that good. Having said that children will enjoy it which is why I gave it a 4 and not lower.,Chappie
189,coljam21,Expected better,5,13 March 2015,My least favorite from Blomkamp so far. So Chappie is conceived with the intelligence/mind of a baby and he has to learn everything from scratch. OK fine I understand. What I don't understand is how this android with the artificial intelligence of a baby is able to put together a super computer and use a helmet he had never seen before to harness his consciousness. Huh? Now i'm really lost.The movie was OK but it dragged on too much with teaching Chappie different lessons in morality and criminality. That got boring quickly. The only cool part of the movie was when the moose appeared. It was reminiscent of the big robot in RoboCop but much cooler. I also liked the costumes that the main characters wore. Everything else was pretty much a snooze fest,Chappie
190,clarkmick33,FoK Chappie,5,29 May 2015,"""Fok"" get use to that word because it seems to be used every second word in the South African language. For those who don't know Fok=Fu*k. You end up after the movie saying ""Fok this"" and ""Fok that"". We get the leads guys are meant to be badass gangsters but really - this probably tallys up with South Park movie with the amount of times the F-bomb is used.Neil Bookamp as a director has some good sci-fi ideas (Loved District 9) but some how in Chappie the execution comes across as a little cheap and shoddy.Lets start with the positives - the robot (Chappie) was automated very realistically. Great camera work and believable use of FX.Now the negatives:1. Never cast your movie with musicians who have never acted before (i.e Die Antwoord). Seriously the guy (Ninja) was a bogan whose vocabulary consists of saying ""Fok"" and ""Mother Fokker"" and the lady(Yoolanda) came across as a weird pixie slut. Their acting was overdone and cheesy just a big distraction - lets not mention how they seemed to product place their band names and music wherever and whenever they could. 2. The whole security issue around the defence contractors - the Nerd guy, Jack Hughman, and almost everyone else seemed to get inside this defence contractor and use any software with unbelievable impunity. I mean you can find it harder to get into schools than these peps did to access ammunition and droid software. 3. The cast characterizations were all one dimensional - Nerdy guy - tells the robot all good things to do, Gangster guys - act tough, deal drugs, and think about heists, Tough guy - Jackman just wants to blow things up. - they really had no depth at all. 4. Chappies supposed A.I seems to comprehend things very fast at some times and then very slowly at others. He can figure out how to move consciousness from machines (very fast) yet he cant seem to figure out that throwing sharp things into people does not put them to sleep!? (you have to watch to understand)5. Looooooooooooooong time getting anywhere in the story. I started to get tired of hearing ""Fok"" and hearing that weird florescent pant wearing pixie slut talk, looking at my watch, eating some snacks,,,,,finally at the end there is some excitement and drama.Overall - I think there was a mis-cast just get rid of the Die Antwoord guys and focus one building some characters up and then this movie may have been decent. Fok this",Chappie
191,wrightiswright,"Nice one, Chaps.",7,23 July 2015,"This issue of how conscious machines are is one which has puzzled mankind for years, especially as we advance in technology at such a rapid rate. There are those who think we've gone too far, that we've created a Terminator style apocalyptic future where, due to our meddling with mother nature, the puppets will turn on their creators, and become the new masters of the planet. Then there are people who believe ALL life is precious, and mechs are only as evil as we make them... As long as we can teach those with artificial intelligence the difference between right and wrong, we have nothing to worry about. These pacifists would love Chappie.Given life by his creator, he starts off as innocent as a baby, mimicking other people's actions and curious about everything around him... Despite already being a full grown robot. Later, he will find himself involved in a tug-of-war, between his original programmer who wants him to life a peaceful, happy life, and a bunch of criminals who plan to use his unique skills in aiding them in carrying out a lucrative heist. One of the best elements of the film isn't just the emotional growth of Chappie, it's the subtle changes in the people who act as his unofficial caregivers... Even the roughest, toughest gangster of the bunch falls in love with him in the end. And, who wouldn't?Besides being a miracle of special effects (YOU'LL BELIEVE A ROBOT CAN THINK FOR ITSELF!!) There is also enough guns, explosions and knives to fill a dozen Rambo movies, so don't think just because the focus is on drama it stints on the action. The final sequences are especially full of mayhem, so don't look away or you may miss something important. The overarching plot doesn't carry with it quite the same level of finesse that the same director's District 9 did (man, I'd LOVE a sequel to that flick) but this is another example of the guy doing what do does best...

192,Amthermandes,Learn how to be gangsta with Chappie!,9,11 March 2015,"Chappie is one of those movies you see with friends for the laughs and finger-pointing moments of awesomeness. The story is that a young programmer has created a successful line of police robots, but wants to go further and more personal than is allowed by his weapons-crazed company. He runs into a small band of gangsters, and together help raise Chappie, a sentient robot with human behaviors and a human personality. Of course the gangsters want him to be gangsta, and Dean wants him to be, well, human. There's bad guys, conflicts, realizations, emotions, explosions, funny moments, cool moments, all you would expect from the director of District 9 and Elysium. It's a movie about the human condition, when you look at it closely, Chappie is a reflection of human life and its structure. So the movie can be deep, but it can also be highly entertaining on the surface. It's got humor and action and drama that most should find entertaining and yet thoughtful. It's got its flaws. Not many, and they are trivial. But don't let the film critics fool you, it's got a lot of wit and you find yourself getting attached to some of the characters, especially our new friend Chappie. Not to mention the duo from Die Antwoord is highly amusing, and add a unique flavor to the film, especially since they practically play themselves. Hard to ignore that bizarre and slightly disturbing Casper-looking tattoo on his right arm though.... If you've been a fan of Neill Blomkamp so far, you WON'T be disappointed. For others, it can still be a great sci-fi action flick.",Chappie
193,tjgoalie13,Really Unoriginal,5,6 May 2015,"Chappie's mildly entertaining, as at times it features a foul mouthed robot throwing a rubber chicken, but essentially it's unoriginal. The film feels like Elysium all over again and some of the robots are stolen right out of robocop (the moose). I wish the acting had been better but essentially the main characters that should have carried the film for pop stars with little acting ability. The film would make more sense if it were some kind of a sequel to Elysium, but it does have some positive aspects. The effects are seamless, what is CGI and what is practical effects is impossible to distinguish, the tone of the film and look in general is really good, and I like Hugh Jackman's character eve if we've seen it before. Essentially the point is if you don't care about originality then this movie will be a really good one, if you do don't bother.",Chappie

He speaks with a very irritating South African hoodlum accent. Did they think this would be cute? It's not endearing at all.As so many other reviewers have said, the rest of the movie is just a mishmash of shamelessly stolen sci-fi movie clichés and product placement.(Why on earth does this take place in South Africa? Everything else about the film suggests it should be in Los Angeles.) I'm one of the few people who *didn't* like District 9. I found it insulting to my intelligence.

In this case reviewers almost universally got this one wrong, while audience approval is justifiably high.First off, this director has greatness written all over his work. He understands how to construct a film from all its components - story, characters, visuals, sound, and effects. He tells unique stories that actually have something to say. He is unafraid to cast oddballs in leading roles, and may be the best director for metamorphosis type characters at work today. His characters change emotionally and physically - and the two work together hand in hand. While District 9 is still his best film, I do believe there will be other great movies guided by his hard work.Chappie (the robot) is the creation of an ambitious, idealistic scientist working for a profit at all cost company. Events unfold in a manner that provide a trial by fire education for Chappie, which includes trauma, humor, love, honor, and forgiveness. The films characters are well defined (why does every character in every film have to be a complex, gray area sort?) from nerd to bully to hero to villain. Special effects are outstanding, bringing life to inanimate objects, explosive action, and clarity of on screen action. This film is deceptively strait forward, but really ponders questions of identity, soul, economy, crime, violence, and redemption.I truly believe that the shortcomings of Elysium and Chappie can be found in a simple lack of time, research, and preproduction. District 9 was Blomkamp's baby in a well thought out world - with depth of vision and mind boggling effects considering the budget. His next two films simply do not have this level of preproduction, and it can be seen in the final product: they are shallow by comparison. But... I just don't see this as a bad thing - they are completed projects, and notches in the belt for this contemporary film maker. Keep making entertaining films!",Chappie
196,Anyanwu,Not happening,3,10 May 2015,"First, we must put it on the table. Chappie is racist using stereotypical affectations of culture to make him cute and cool. He chooses to emulate the speech patterns of someone who wants to do him the most harm. He wears gold chains, moves his body in this ""hip"", ""urban"", ""black"", ""street"", etc way. It just looks bad. I think the concept of transferring consciousness is really interesting and bodes more exploration. I would have liked it a lot more if the appropriations of Black culture were not used to express Chappie's mode of communication. It's just a very stereotypical method of conveying humanness. It was disappointing.",Chappie

Same team behind it, but this time Dev Patel (his big breakthrough was 'Slumdog Millionaire'), Hugh Jackman (excellent in the 'X-men' series) and Sigourney Weaver (who has been well known since the first 'Alien') were boosting the very capable cast further.It is a sad, fun, thoughtful, and well-performed, story about a police robot who is given a conscious. It is a great story, there is actually nothing to complain about, just enjoyment from first moment to the last.The film takes you on a ride, like nothing you've experienced before, from the very first second to the last, with no superfluous stuff, no side stories, just to the point, and immensely well done!",Chappie

199,DJRMewzique,Catering to the lowest common denominator,1,7 March 2015,"Disastrous. Juvenile. Insulting.Three words that perfectly describe the latest offering from Neill Blomkamp, three words that would not have been expected to describe a film directed by this man.Blomkamp is best known for the absolutely brilliant ""District 9,"" a reflection on apartheid, but also responsible for the almost equally fascinating ""Elysium,"" which was a sci-fi look at the ongoing 1% debate.So, expectations for his third feature, ""Chappie,"" were understandably considerably high.However, the expectations are sadly unfounded as this film does not even remotely live up to expectation. In fact, it doesn't live up to anything. At all.In short, ""Chappie"" is the story of a ""broken"" robot from a fleet of robot police now protecting Johannesburg, which gets rebooted by fully self-sufficient artificial intelligence installed by the developer of the police robots, Deon Wilson (Dev Patel, ""Slumdog Millionaire""). Having been ""kidnapped"" by a ridiculous gang of wannabe ""gangstas,"" played absolutely horrifically by members of South African rap group Die Antwoord (Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser), with absolutely no acting ability whatsoever, Chappie, which needs to learn from scratch like a baby, is ""raised"" by these bumbling idiots to help them pull off a huge heist.After screwing up a drug deal for Hippo, one of the few worthwhile characters in the film played with brilliant, anarchic, shirtless hotness by Brandon Auret, Ninja and Yolandi owe him $20 million. And they have a week to get it to him.And thus, this film then wants you to believe, without actually showing you how it is actually accomplished, that this robot named Chappie, in the hands of idiotic, failed gangsters and with limited input from the wasted Dev Patel, could go from zero and baby-like to an almost full-fledged, heist-worthy ""adult""in about a week. Because ""gangstas"" would have time for this.All the while, teaching him to ""act gangsta,"" making the film a complete joke while practically verging on racist gansgta clichésdiving head first into a pool of utter ridiculousness.With its amateur soundtrack, its ""gangsta"" stupidity, its horrific acting, complete lack of logical narrative and deflection of all its shortcomings through the use of explosions, this film truly caters to the absolute lowest common denominator.In fact, it expects its audience to be so truly uneducated, when Hippo speaks, the film features English subtitles. Um, Hippo speaks English.This film was so dumb, and assumed its audience would be so uneducated, they put English subtitles under a guy speaking English. The film, in all its stupidity, actually manages to directly insult the intelligence of its audience.So, where do big names Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver fit into this? Jackman plays Vincent Moore, a spoiled brat with a horrific haircut who designed a similar type of police robot which was deemed far too big and expensive to be used, so he devises a plan to knock out Wilson's robots so his will be implemented. Weaver merely plays Wilson and Moore's boss at the company which created these droids.Why they wanted to be involved in this film is beyond me.So, listen to me when I say, avoid this film at all costs. Unlike the strong, important political messages of his first two films, on his third outing, Blomkamp has achieved absolutely nothing but creating a film that wants to show an audience just what an epic failure looks like.If Chappie was humanity's last hope, may a god help us all.",Chappie

201,jakerocks,Where's the story?,1,17 September 2021,This movie rides mostly on the exuberance of the musical duo Die Antwoord as debut actors coming up with a lot of verbal and visual gibberish. If you have seen their videos you know they're great. But this movie is too violent and offensive to be a kids movie and too empty for grownups. There's very little story from the film writers that ties it all together. Zero character arc.What is hard to overlook as a fan of science fiction anime is how the bunny rabbit ears from a multitude of Japanese anime like Appleseed's cyborg character Briareos were blatantly copied and pasted onto Chappie in this movie. Chappie doesn't even have any special reason for having them other than as antennas and to evoke a cute puppy dog-like response in viewers. So it's disappointing to steal something so obvious just for looks and without adding much to his abilities as a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence based character.Final take? Boring. The lazy writing and unoriginal robot creation are only superficial problems. Hard pass.,Chappie

First, if you're going to base your story on the idea of sentient artificial intelligence, don't specifically set it in the present. Full AI is decades away, if it's even possible.

A rival robotics engineer hoping to replace the scouts with his steroidal variant. Assorted thugs, mugs, goons, and ne-er-do-wells. And one robot wakes up.After that, it all gets weird.The script is slick, the acting delightful, especially Dev Patel, who pretty much carries it for the human side despite Sigourney Weaver getting higher billing.

A movie doesn't need to be boring in order to stimulate discussions. Even Pinocchio can be a fine starting for a debate about consciousness and artificial life. I loved almost everything in this movie, but Hugh Jackman's character is not well designed. I understand the presence of an antagonist: humanoid self aware robots can be dangerous, actually, but in the movie Jackman plays a quite stupid villain who, even if he is a clever engineer, makes a lot of silly things, like turning off all the robot policemen. The director of the factory, Sigourney Weaver, takes also quite stupid decisions.

208,kieranbattams,Disappointing for Blomkamp.. but better than you're led to believe,7,20 March 2015,"Im going to start by saying that i love Neill Blomkamp's work. District 9 remains to be one of the best sci-fi movies of our time and i enjoyed Elysium a hell of a lot more than a lot of people did. When i saw the trailer for Chappie i was intrigued and it quickly became one of my most anticipated movies of the year. I will get this part out of the way now so i can focus on this movie alone for the duration of this review.. but for a Blomkamp movie yes this does disappoint. He has definitely lost a bit of his way since District 9, however this does not mean Chappie is a bad movie because i did end up enjoying it more than critics led me to believe. But it is definitely not the best sci-fi movie around and i think part of peoples problem with the movie is that it is getting compared to much to other movies when it is its own movie.. but yes Chappie does have some big flaws too.Like both of Blomkamp's earlier films he again sets Chappie in a South African slum, but we definitely get a different feel with this film. The film follows Yolandi and Ninja who play versions of themself and are known as the rap group Die Antwoord.. i didn't know who they were until i saw this film but i am kind of wondering why they were even cast and their annoyingly catchy music was played throughout the entire movie, so i wont bother trying to. Anyway, they steal a police robot who has been programmed with artificial intelligence by Deon (Dev Patel who does a great job) and decide to name him Chappie and train him to become a gangster that will help them to perform a heist in order to pay a ruthless drug lord. Hugh Jackman is also in the movie as the villain, but to be honest he is never given a huge deal to do and without him in the movie we still would have had virtually the same plot.. minus a few circumstances that i wont spoil. Sigourney Weaver is also in the film, and she does a fine job, but has next to nothing to do. It makes me wonder why these big names were cast in fairly small roles whilst Die Antwoord are main characters. Im not saying Yolandi and Ninja were terrible but they are far from the best actors and at the end of the day.. they are a rap group, plus by the sounds of the way Ninja acted on set they wont be getting another shot at it. (Also why does everything they own have a drawing of a penis on it).Onto the main positive though, Chappie himself is absolutely the best part of the film and he was played amazingly by Sharlto Copley who has really made a name for himself. When the human cast interacts with Chappie it is so believable and Copley's performance really makes the audience feel his emotions, he is definitely one of the best movie robots to date. Chappie is essentially a baby and to see him learn in this rough environment made for some really funny scenes and i did enjoy seeing Yolandi and Ninja take on the role of parents.. in fact Yolandi herself really did this quite well. Despite its flaws, Chappie has some real good scenes and the effects were definitely on top form, i cant fault anything about Chappie as a character. I feel the last 10 minutes or so were kind of thrown in and felt out of place and weird to see. Not gonna spoil what happens.. but i don't feel personally that what did happen was very believable. I will end by saying Chappie is a good movie.. but definitely not a great one, just one i thoroughly enjoyed. Now, if you will excuse me i need to drown out the sound of Die Antwoord's music because i don't want to be listening to them tomorrow.. i just don't.",Chappie
209,eismoc,Could have been much (much much) better,4,18 April 2018,"I am so sorry to see such a great story being messed up so much by few unprofessional scenes. I think that Hugh Jackman and few other actors have done what they're expected to do, but most scenes of the ""creator"", and the ""gang"", who had the major roles in this movie, have completely ruined the story, changing it from a serious, hard-core sci-fi movie, into a messy and cheap comedy. I would put ""Real Steel"" and ""Transformers"" in a level way above this one, although the drama and emotional development in the story of ""Chappie"" is better. Yet, thanks to the unprofessionality of few scenes, I saw the movie turned into a sequence of boring pictures. This is a movie that had the potential to be one of a kind, but it turned into a waste of .. almost everything.",Chappie
210,KIDOLOHKEN,Columbus' egg,8,2 October 2020,"If I could write such an interesting script, I'd be very happy to be a screenwriter. In the beginning it looked like a computer programmer was the main character and then gradually the robot became the main character. I thought the transition was brilliant and the process was very interesting. The robot is the protagonist, so it's hard to make the character, but it was really well written and realistic. Furthermore, not only the main character but also the supporting characters were well written. The way the balance between their good and bad attitudes was well drawn. This made the drama of the climax even more exciting. Since the robot is the main character, the casting was well controlled so that the other supporting characters would not spoil the main characters.
Movie scripts basically show what the main character has to do early on. But this script is not like that. We don't know where the protagonists are going until the middle of the story. Still, I enjoyed watching the process, each episode, because it was interesting. It would be good for the scriptwriter to realize how important it is to have interesting episodes.
If I had to say a drawback, I think it's possible for a robot of this type to change batteries or recharge its batteries. It was also hard to understand why they couldn't save their consciousness as data. But I didn't care much about the details because the whole story was well-drawn.
The director seems to be the type of person who spends a lot of time on the script. I hope he'll take his time to make another interesting film.",Chappie

212,russellingreviews,"Gangster robots, violence, bad hair choices and life's bigger questions",5,10 March 2015,"""I'm Consciousness. I'm alive."" - ChappieWalking into the cinema... Neill Blomkamp's District 9 was groundbreaking and unique, but he has struggled to create the same cinematic magic. The trailers alone have whispers of all the robot-centric films that have come before Chappie. Overall rating: 2 stars Cinematic rating: 2 stars Big question opportunities: 3.5 starsDirector Neil Blomkamp's vision of the future is crime-filled, violent and people make bad hair choices. In South Africa, the police force in Johannesburg has managed to bring down the crime rate with the assistance of a new robotic force. Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), the creator of this robotic army, develops a new programme for robots to become self aware. This robotic creator is a man before his time and must hide his new creation, Chappie. In the process of hiding his unique invention, the rejected robot is stolen by a small-time crime trio and manage to take advantage of his new found self-awareness, loyalty and innocence. They train him for a life of crime, but during the initiation process, the key forces of industry, crime and law enforcement are searching for Chappie. The goal of these forces is to exploit or destroy him. The little robot must learn quickly about the evils of the world, how to protect himself and all who are around him before his battery runs down. Neil Blomkamp attempts to deliver an original telling of the self-aware robot. Due to his upbringing in South Africa, Blomkamp paints a picture of society this is filled with racism and segregation. District 9 gave a fresh spin on the issues of racism and introduces a strong central character that grows through a external and internal metamorphosis. The character development in his first film made up for the plot holes and weaker story components. Chappie suffers from comparison to District 9 and similar stories of robots like Blade Runner, I,Robot, and Robocop, but provides some originality. Chappie differs from other robots, because he becomes a gangster with a South African accent, but that is where the originality ends. Sharlto Copley (District 9) is back in a lead role of a Blomkamp film, but only as the voice of the gangster robot. His presence cannot make up for all of the other poorly chosen characters. From the unappealing trinity of gangsters who 'raise' Chappie to Hugh Jackman (X-men) as the mulleted villain to Sigourney Weaver as the most incompetent CEO in cinematic history. They all lacked believability as either evil, humorous or endearing. If Blomkamp desired for the audience to dislike all of the human characters and only the robots are appealing, he succeeded. The dialogue was difficult to follow and the story was exceptionally disjointed. The only saving grace of the film was in the special effects. The line between actual actors and the CGI players was fascinating to consider and should receive some recognition. Even with the exceptional special effects, there is not much to bring life back to this overused storyline. If there is any salvation for this film, it would be in the consideration of life's bigger issues. The story opens the door to dialogue on creation, evolution, God, human nature, death and the 'blank slate' theory. The story was rich in opportunities to consider these topics, but the film was marred with excessive violence and language. If it is possible to get past these issues, there is a treasure trove of things to discuss. Besides the creator, Deon, most of the characters in this cinematic journey did not realise the potential of the gift they had been given in Chappie. The same could be said about the audience experience. If you choose to see it, take time to consider the golden opportunities that this poorly executed film provides afterwards. Leaving the cinema... ""You've taught us more than we could have ever imagined."" - Deon Wilson (The creator)At first, it was a 'seen it, done that' experience. I could list off a multitude of films that did a better job with this robotic story line. Then thinking about it, Chappie opens the door to many considerations. Don't miss out on the opportunity to stretch yourself and consider the questions that Chappie is asking. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does it mean to be human? (Genesis 1:27, 2:5-25) 2. Why are humans suspicious and violent? (Genesis 3, Matthew 15:19) 3. Can mankind create artificial conscience?

213,johnplocar,Is it so hard to have some fun with a mess of a movie?,7,9 January 2016,"""Chappie"": This was actually something I was really looking forward to and I'm such an optimist whenever it comes to most movies, maybe that's why I ended up liking ""Chappie"" when the word of mouth on it has been pretty bad. I have this weird love/hate relationship with this director though, I will say. With both ""District 9"" and ""Elysium"", they are somehow simultaneously extremely ambitious and have some real original ideas to them while also being extremely flawed; borrowing from things done before in films, as well as suffering from predictability, the same can be said for ""Chappie"". It is somehow a strange combination of ""Short Circuit 2"", when Johnny 5 joins the Los Locos gang, and the original RoboCop film; the director simply ran with that idea and had a real fun time with it. I thought that the characters, for the most part, are very likable. I was actually invested in the Chappie character, I wanted him to make it through with his ""family"". The action scenes were well choreographed, brutal, and definitely shot much better than ""Elysium"". There was a moment at the end where the film did lose me because it did seem like it was trying to promote a couple of their leads that have their own music career in Africa right now and that annoyed me a bit. Overall, I thought that this was a pretty fun science fiction flick with a true hard ""R"" rated tone. Unfortunately don't see a whole lot of that nowadays so I have to give the director some recognition for that at least.",Chappie

Since the director made that and Chappie but I got a little hesitant because it didn't get a good response on rotten tomatoes. The audience seemed to like it though and I thought it was good and had some potential. This pretty much has the same motif of giving machines thought and feeling. This time in the movie it takes place in the near future of South Africa. Where the police force uses these scout droids to help them with their work. The guy who made them, Dion, played by the Slumdog Millionaire kid and tries to give one of the scout droids thought and feeling. He also gets attacked by some criminals and they keep the robot in some abandoned warehouse. The criminals also give him the name Chappie since he's a friend. There also is the other guy, played by Hugh Jackman that wants to use his military robot for the police but it's too big and scary. Also looks more like a military robot instead of a police droids. There's also some twist and turns as well as some shocking moments too. I think the director was trying to hard for it to be like District 9 at times.",Chappie
216,a_sad_cow,An odd blend of Robocop and Short Circuit and,5,11 March 2015,"District 9 and Transcendence. Neither the acting nor the writing deserve more than a 5.0...seriously surprised it was 7.4 before I went to see it.The whole movie is one giant extended ad for whatever company seeks to sell robotic soldiers to whatever government will purchase them. South Africa is a prime target for both having a significant law enforcement gap while also having a relatively wealthy government.Primary marketing message: the manner in which the robots will act is nothing to fear. Primarily evidenced by the Scout program with no real explanation of their rules of engagement (or even why lethal weapons are necessary for expendable lifeless titanium soldiers) yet they have no issues that anyone is even remotely concerned about. The fluke of ""sentience"" results in an utterly mold-able personality which would provide no threat to a potential investor.The characters have their eccentricities which is fine, but it would certainly be worth watching anything to provide context for such eccentricities. How our bad guys got to where they are for instance. Or our other bad guy with his Moose program. Why does he care so much about verbal permission from one doubter who only serves to delay Chappie's trial until it is convenient for the film? Sigourney Weaver is great and all, but her character makes no sense.Then there's all the stupid little movieisms that add up to an annoyance. Why of all days does our inventor friend get carjacked on the one day he's stolen the guard key and all the relevant components? Why can't anyone duplicate or hack the guard key? Why does almost no one marvel at the first sentient robot? Why is the rest of the world so unconcerned with robotics advancements in Africa? Are they even further along? How can you ""back up"" a consciousness that you could only previously move? How does an AI consciousness manifest itself in the anthropomorphical brain position in an identical patter to humans?

So much for instilling good human emotions and judgment into Chappie.I saw the promos and wanted to see this movie as I enjoyed SHORT CIRCUIT and DISTRICT 9 and believed I would enjoy this too. This movie is nothing as enjoyable as those 2-movies. This is a complete mess and not entertaining. No other way to say it. I couldn't believe adults actually made this. The Australian lingo was very hard to understand and even they knew this as we see Sub-Titles when some of these characters spoke. The juvenile utterances of Chappie was cute for about 2-seconds then became annoying later on. Who writes this stuff? Ninja and his bad guys who kidnapped Dion let him go many times. Most of the movie had Chappie staying with the Ninja gang and this is where the movie dragged big time as the script had nothing to offer here. Chappie goes along with the heist because he believes he is doing good helping Ninja who tells Chappie people stole from him. Vincent (Hugh Jackman), who designed a Super-Droid, wants his own Droid to stop Chappie and it is here the battle between this Super-Droid and Chappie have at it. The CGI is exceptional, but the story had suffered so much previously we really didn't care which Droid would win. Sigourney Weaver as Michelle, the person in charge of all Droids, is wasted in here and am not sure why she was even in this movie, but am thinking she might have thought this was a ground-breaking movie with Droids being the policemen. Remember she starred in ALIEN, which was a ground-breaking movie. She should have read the rest of the script first before committing. There is a very clever twist later on that reminds us of DISTRICT 9. Where SHORT CIRCUIT was cute, funny and entertaining CHAPPIE is not. Go to Netflix or Amazon to locate SHORT CIRCUIT and you will see what I mean. Okay, there is a stupid chase scene in SHORT CIRCUIT, but still it is a good movie you will enjoy. This could have been good and enjoyable, but the script didn't allow it. Humor should have been used more, but it was like the Ninja bad guys did all the writing and the results weren't entertaining.

220,~AleXa~,"A brilliantly convoluted rip-off of I, Robot (2004) meets Robocop (1987)",4,26 July 2015,"Reviewed July 26th, 2015, 1st viewing (BR rental)The film presents a novel concept that we have seen done before in such variations as I, Robot and Robocop, and only remains 'unique' on one particular front. It is misleading in both its 'original' premise and exceptional cast, only serving to fail where it promised to lead. Most everything professed to be unique and innovative is quite overtly copied or modified from a prior sci-fi film in the same vein, namely Robocop (1987) and I, Robot (2004), a feat particularly distressing coming from Neill Blomkamp (writer/director) after producing such original pieces as District 9 (2009) and Elysium (2013). The worst part is that the filmmakers did so with little evidence of shame or remorse for their indiscretion.I am a bit perplexed as to the exact purpose of such character writing, with none of them following hard-fast archetypes—a choice that can be both good and bad. Deon Wilson (played by Dev Patel) is the Lead Researcher at Tetravaal, the company supplying the local police force with the new drone robots, referred to as Scouts. In addition to this breakthrough, he is working to create artificial intelligence. His rival, Vincent (Hugh Jackman), an ex-military type with a much-larger military-grade robot operated by a helmet, is so hell-bent on seeing his creation lead the police force, he somehow has clearance to access the program that runs the Scouts even though its an entirely different project that he neither possesses the expertise or prior experience to deal with. He effectively sabotages the Scouts, and requests the CEO (Sigourney Weaver) initiate his program as a countermeasure. The proverbial 'baddies' in the film are broken off into two factions, both not-so-coincidentally resembling early 90s-era cyberpunks akin to that of (you guessed it!)—Robocop (1987). The first is comprised of Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika, and the second is an entire gang led by Hippo, some razor-cut guy punk whose English sounds more like gibberish, so much so that it has to be captioned (another feigned attempt at humor I suppose?). Ninja's group decide the only way they can get out from under Hippo's boot is to kidnap Deon and force him to shut down all the Scouts with a 'remote' they in all their wisdom decide he must have since all technology works with remotes When Deon informs them it's not possible, the only thing that saves him is their discovery of his rejected robot in the van. When pressed, he decides to reveal to these thugs who were two seconds from murdering him all the intel they need to know regarding what he needs to do to test the A.I. program and the only way the drones can have their software modified. See anything wrong with this picture??Naturally, the plot holes abound, unraveling from start to finish. Tetravaal's unique unhackable design implemented for the Scouts is a nothing more than ONE unique key USB drive kept under 'lock-and-key' that apparently most members of the staff have access to? Furthermore, all common sense and logic beg the question—why exactly would an artificial intelligence be created as a 'blank slate' that had to be taught everything including language? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of artificial INTELLIGENCE? And then we're supposed to believe that he's taught language, how to drive, combat skills, et al, in the course of a few days?To add insult to injury, this revolutionary company that has created the world's most advanced robots and is on the verge of discovering sentient life apparently has the worst security protocols in history, allowing employees to come and go with their advanced tech and weapons as they please. And then when they find out Deon ran off the with USB key, he merely gets a phone call from security advising him to return it by night's end?! It's no wonder the company wound up in the tank. To add insult to injury, later on when they discover someone disabled all the Scouts remotely IN HOUSE, the police enter Tetravaal en force, and instead of locking the place down to interrogate anyone on the premises at that time of night, they just let Vincent walk right on by. I found myself struggling to wrap my brain around how criminals that had evaded a robotic police force could be so stupid, allowing their kidnap victim to leave after almost murdering him and stealing tech. On top of that, we're to believe that the man who just successfully created artificial intelligence would leave his 'newborn' creation in the hands of those thugs to teach it??The script itself seemed to pander to a certain core audience, leaving the majority of us with functional brains to feel belittled and under-appreciated. Despite the plethora of issues, the film brilliantly succeeded in some regard, allowing the audience to feel for Chappie as he was literally thrown into the cruel world. Both the practical and special effects were amazing, allowing you to view Chappie as a living being. The score was instrumental in lending gravity to the emotional scenes, however they were quickly forgotten by the horrid techno-punk tracks thrown into the mix at random, again feeling like a cheap ploy to market to the 16-25 age bracket. I cannot quite fathom how the brilliant mind that produced District 9 (2009) and Elysium (2013) could have concocted such a conglomeration of an artistic failure. I am wholly convinced this film's rating/positive reviews have been sustained by fans of the director, turning a blind eye to the obvious issues in remembrance of his previous work. Another user correctly described this as 'beautifully stupid'. Surely nonsensical and disappointment do not begin to cover it. My only conclusion is that the people who rated this 8/9/10s have already had their consciousness uploaded to their Chevy Volts and left their toasters to do the thinking3.5 out of 10.0",Chappie
221,jcallows,i'll buy that for a dollar,6,4 November 2015,"The reviews were accurate. This film was all over the place. Never mind the disregard of logic, the unrealistic bad guys, and ideas lifted from a certain Peter Weller movie, this film simply lacked focus. This film had promise and definitely could've been done better.On the plus side, there were some good action scenes and some great special effects. And the depiction of the computer interface was realistic. It used textual input and output, rather than that slick, far-fetched 3D graphics we saw in the Iron Man films or the recent Spider-Man films. Finally, there were some really funny scenes, albeit unintentional, but funny nevertheless.",Chappie
222,because-of-him,Utterly stupid...,1,22 June 2015,"An utterly stupid movie which appears to have been written by gang members who are utterly selfish and self-centered. The vocabulary is similar to gang speech which I am aware of as a former law enforcement officer in a liberal controlled city in the South. Visually, the CGI is well done, but the view is spoiled often whenever gang mannerisms become the main topic. Morality is missing or so weak that it is lost in the barrage of hate, narcissism, evil and profanity. And, the lessons taught offend everything that common sense stands for. Eventually, when the movie comes to TV and the profanity is edited out, you will be watching a mostly silent movie...ha!

Chappie is to Robocop was District 9 was to independence day... Kind of a similar topic, made through an entirely different lens. Complex. Android cops manufactured by an evil-capitalist corporation. But Blomkamp' vision brings the topic of an entirely artificial conscience and what it would mean to consider the rights of such beings, in a backdrop of gangsta style crime and not so petty thieves with heavy weaponry. It's still an action movie even though it gives a lot to reflect on.",Chappie

When a person tries to kill you three times and you escape, you call the cops that YOU MADE!!! You do not do what he did.

They always look awesome in the previews, and they inspire great conversations about what they COULD be. That being said, I always leave them wishing they had fulfilled a lot more of their potential. D9, Elysium, and now this. I actually picked Elysium over Pacific Rim, and I still regret that decision.Another thing, is that I am sick of Sharlto Copley in Blomkamp movies. It's as annoying as the Tim Burton - Johnny Depp allegiance. Even when it's just voice-acting, but ... he has a very recognizable voice.He does the same thing with flashing into fictional news footage to tell the story of his movies, so I felt like I was still watching D9. Not every movie needs to make me think that I am watching a documentary.He has amazing vision, but he is crap at story-telling. He REALLY needs to stop.

I read their lengthy reviews and even if all their ""cons"" to the movie were accurate it would still never get below a 7star rating.This movie was great. Critics always base their rating off tons of different things. Hey...Critics.... wake the F@#% up! This movie wasn't super artsy or so different that it was a piece for critic fan boys to drool over. This movie was awesome.Sorry Critics, did you want it to go by the same guidelines as iRobot, or terminator, or short circuit?

229,machrf,"If you like dystopian future movies, this is for you.",6,27 December 2020,"The crude, ugliness of the first half of the movie was too much for me. It goes to the extreme of ugliness, but I know some people who would love that. But what is amazing to me is by the end of the movie you start to feel for these vulgar people. Even the father who is a louse shows his good side at the end. I do not admire nor respect the characters in this movie, but it shows how what you think and see could have some redeeming values. Some can learn, some can improve, some can change. But the change is implied and will not be proven unless there is a Chappie II. I dont know if I want to find out since the values in this movie are so questionable. Yet, there is hope.
As much as I know Hugh Jackman's voice is not what it is in the Marvel movies, if this is his voice, I understand why they had him change it. He does not come across as powerful in this movie especially with the phrase ""Tits up,"" which made me laugh. I think the movie idea was good. I dont think they hit the mark with it due to the vulgarity and poor values, but they certainly improved the last 1/3 of the movie. It is the first time I've seen a good idea, not executed well, actually improve toward the last part of the movie. In that respect it was very refreshing. To be honest, I do look forward to a Chappie II",Chappie
230,james1844,A Movie that Fails to Deliver,3,10 March 2015,"Trailers can be a taste of things to come or (in the case of Chappie) a bad taste that you want to spit out and get your money back. The vulgar dialog was annoying to an extreme but worse yet was the countless times I couldn't understand much of the Brit slang and dribble. Then there's the storyline that was so ill conceived and often cartoonish while carrying an ""R"" rating. Hugh Jackman and Sigourny Weaver should be required to sit through this manure and explain how they justify such a badly scripted film. I don't usually trash a film unless it's so bad I feel the need to save others and warn them that this film deserves a warning to avid movie goers to avoid this and save your money.Final point here to share is the believability of the scientific scheme and plot of this Sci-Fi film. It just makes little if any sense. The viewer eventually begins to laugh at the unbelievability of the storyline. This film reminded me of a quality film of similar science fiction.

The quality of the acting is one problem (right from Dev Patel's first talking head appearance) and if you don't believe in the characters in a film then it's lost for sure. The central problem though is that the film doesn't engage the viewer with Chappie, and that's because it doesn't spend enough time watching its (sic) development. It has cursory, sickly sweet cutesy stuff which is squeezed in between grotesque and extreme violence - a horrible juxtaposition which just makes for uncomfortable viewing. And the script! 'Chappie, I am your maker....'. The stereotyped bling language is just a weak comic cover for there being no serious dialogue between characters. Really, more or less a waste of time.",Chappie

234,dutchs-1,"Engaging, fast moving, and complex tale",9,28 June 2015,"The trailers gave me the impression this would be some sort of saccharine ""Iron Giant"" film, where compassionate people shelter an intelligent robot from the police and military. It's not at all like that. There are three interlaced sub-plots. A programmer for a robotics company that builds police robots develops a program for true artificial intelligence. When he's refused permission to try it, he steals a robot slated for demolition and uploads his program. Meanwhile a criminal gang kidnaps the programmer to force him to divulge how to shut down the robots so they can pull off a heist to pay off a debt to an even more ruthless gang. After they learn the robots can't be shut down, they take the reprogrammed robot (Chappie) and start training him as an accomplice. In the third sub-plot, a rival programmer sabotages the police robots to launch his own robot, a human piloted beast that looks recycled from RoboCop.The criminals, especially the girl member, have a dash of humanity and humor. The girl especially treats Chappie compassionately. There are a few technical oddities. It seems silly that Chappie can be programmed for full human intelligence, but not language and real-world knowledge, so that he has to learn like a toddler. The most frustrating lack of closure is that the film opens with short interview bites from computer scientists astonished by Chappie, then the film flashes back to 18 months prior, but it never closes the loop by returning to the present. But on the whole, a complex, intelligent story with characters who engage the viewer. The South African accents can be tough to follow.",Chappie

Some I hate (Her, A.I.) some I love (Blade Runner, Battlestar remake, Wall-E). This one, I love. I didn't have an opinion about Neill Blomkamp. Didn't even know Hugh Jackman is in this movie so it was a pleasant surprise.I was emotionally moved and entertained. Chappie is one of - no, THE MOST action-packed YET emotionally-engaging and HEARTFUL movies I've watched in a while, no bored moments and no time for going into meta-analysis. Can't believe I cared about a clunky metalic wire-ly robot, haven't since the far-cuter Wall-E anyway. Dev Pattel is well cast, did the role total justice. Sigourney did her part with just the right note. Hugh succeeded in compressing his bigger-than-life self into an unglamorous (even unflattering) thug-in-cubicle-job role. Very noble of him, lending his superstar weight to this project. (showing Mr.BirdMan how a real-life hero gracefully bow out of superhero phase of his film role)In spite of the tension from start to end, people burst out laughing A LOT throughout. There were lots of humor, but nothing contrived, just Grade AAA seamless storytelling. And if the key characters act crazy, it is explained why, without being captain obvious. Dialogs and expositions, 99% SHOW vs tell, Mckee would be proud, not that it mattered against the hateful bigots of pro critics Borg contingent. I decided somewhere along 20 minutes in - I REALLY like this directorial voice. The technical bits: the story craft, the plotting, pacing, editing, art directing, effects, all superb and SEAMLESSLY EXECUTED. Zero complaint there. My only beef is as usual the theological stuff but I will not trash something this brilliant because it doesn't agree with my spiritual viewpoint. Side note on IRRELEVANCY OF RT CRITIC SCORE (and probably Academy Self-Awards) I never cared about Rotten Tomatos score but my other half love to check it after every movie. We both anticipated the critics will be hateful with this one because it features a non-American director and 2 non-American male leads! But we didn't expect the shamelessness level. At least the audience disagreed by a HUGE margin, and the audience WORLDWIDE will continue to disagree as the box office telly of Rest of The World come in. This movie is trashed due to PURE POLITICAL reason. DUH. There are some really tightly-wound-up, bitter ANALysts in the mainstream ""art"" critic scene, who have forgotten how to feel sentient, and lost touch with everything, obviously.Anyway, go watch it, just for entertainment. If you happen to be moved then it is a bonus. It will prove that you have a heart, and more sentient than the average Borgs who's tied into ""networked group mind"" opinions.Meanwhile I totally look forward to a sequel. 9/10. +1 just to annoy the art-haters.",Chappie
237,Scarefish,What if Jar Jar Binks was a ROBOT?!?,1,12 January 2018,"Neill Blomkamp created a masterpiece; a film that perfectly balanced visually stunning effects with a compelling plot and characters, and that film was District 9. Then came the shallow mess that was Elysium that while lacking a likeable protragonist still managed to be a treat to the eyes at the very least.Then came Chappie. I really wanted to like Chappie, a lot. Some of the best ideas are the simplest, and in spite of the negative reception I could see much potential in a twisted comedy action film about a good-willed robot being trained by scumbags. This isn't the case with this film. Many of the elements I had expected were in play, however the tone was relentlessly sinister and dour where a more levitous approach would have been vastly more interesting. The film feels too mean-spirited to be enjoyable.The gangsters Chappie finds himself involved with are beyond trashy in the worst kind of way, and upon realization that they would be a large portion of the next 2 hours of my life, I was filled with dread. Chappie isn't flawless himself - his benevolence going against any notion I have of ""realistic"" robots. Chappie is quite simply a human character placed in the husk of a robot, and once I got past that I soon found myself annoyed with the repetitive scenes of Chappie in peril and confusion, always responding with squawking and sulking, giving me that feeling I have when I'm being beaten over the head with a message, only it seems the message is missing.Hugh Jackman plays a one-dimensional baddie not unlike what you'd get in a Saturday morning cartoon. His only motivation is that his weapons were shafted in favor of the crime-fighting robots, so then he turns to terrorism I guess. I guess this is where that missing message is; mean people are bad, and you should just be a good person, and robots are people too.Everything in this film is simply surface level, when the only way it could have had a chance is by being deep - higher highs, lower lows, and stronger motivations.The worst part is I feel like the film ended right when the story was just getting started. There's a chance for something here, but this trilogy is otherwise dead on arrival.",Chappie

First off,Chappie is not better than District 9 but it is a lot better than Elysium. Don't listen to the critics, Chappie is an original idea with things in the movie that makes you think,it makes the movie feel special and very different. The acting is okay, no one stands out. The movie focuses on two criminals, Ninja(Ninja) and Yolandi(Yo-landi Visser). They are the ones who steal Chappie. Shartlo Copley who plays Chappie does an amazing job as always. Him and Neil Blomkamp are always great together.Deon Wilson(Dev Patel) plays Chappie's maker, he's good in it but not used as much.Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver are in the movie but they could of been used a lot more also like Dev Plael character.Vicent Moore(Hugh Jackman) is the main villain, and you wish they could explore more of him but he's there just because the movie needs a villain. He just feels out of place. Chappie is the only character who gets any development so when there's drama with other characters, you don't very feel for them. The action is done very well,similar to the same action as Elysium,which was one great thing about Elysium. Something I found very good was the score. It was by Hans Zimmer. They used a lot of music from the the two actors but that's okay. One thing I didn't very like was that, they could of explored more of what Chappie can do. Overall Chappie was a original, fun action movie. Don't listen to the Critics, go and see Chappie.",Chappie

Yolandi Visser was a real standout as ""Mommy,"" and the acting was strong on all fronts. Credit (again) to Neill Blomkamp as the director, he's definitely on a roll. Mr. Blomkamp excels in showing the many faces of South Africa, bringing the country alive in his work. Actually, when I think about it, this was a brilliant film, and on many levels!

240,fawn_jane,The Adventures of Gangsta Robot,7,9 March 2015,"This movie was not quite what I expected.The movie starts out hard to follow. Most of the characters have some unfamiliar accents that are hard to understand. The pacing of the action and dialogue is erratic. There are so many accidentally-on- purpose funny moments. Often it feels like an emotionally immature 12-year-old with ADHD directed it or wrote the screenplay. The way the characters act is odd and unrealistic. The way that the robotics company and its employees behave is like something a little kid would think up, someone who has no idea how the adult world works or what the consequences for actions typically are.At first it seems that there is not a single relatable or likable character in the movie, but by the end I warmed up a bit to them. When we first see the Die Anterwoord gang I assumed they would be some sideshow henchman type characters, when it dawned on me that they were the main characters it was with a bit of cringing internally. Seeing these people get to raise some state-of-the-art artificial consciousness/intelligence to act all gangster, even in just a movie kind of kills you inside. I mean, this movie is bound to turn a lot of people off with its whole grungy gangsta aesthetic.Usually a movie starts out strong, then runs out of gas eventually. This movie was different, it starts out weird but by the end I was looking forward to a sequel. The movie sets up an interesting backstory for some further action.Despite all my criticism, I like the movie. It was... unique. It's nice to see a movie that's not completely designed for the generic American palate. It has its moments (eventually) where it gets you thinking about the nature of robots and consciousness and god and soul.Ah yes, and the special effects are amazing. The CGI for Chappie is spot-on, I found myself wondering if they got someone really skinny to be in a robot suit or something, he looks utterly realistic in his animation, texture, the way he interacts with things, etc. This movie will satisfy the robot-lover in you.And so in conclusion, I'd suggest giving this movie a chance. It starts out slow, honestly partway through it I felt like walking out of the theatre, but I am glad I stuck around for the ending, it left me wanting to see more.",Chappie

Having said that though, District 9 being one of my most favorite recent sci-fi movies, and Neill Blomkamp I had high hopes and kept watching. I'm glad i did. Its not District 9 in terms of quality, but there IS a good story told here with a third act that wraps everything up nicely while still becoming memorable at the same time.

243,jpkwolf,"Chappie is funny, entertaining and emotional but not very deep.",9,22 April 2015,"If everything about Die Antwoord annoys you then you won't like Chappie because Chappie is partly a Die Antwoord movie. Mostly only in music score though and Ninja and Yo-Landi being characters of the film. They act as the dysfunctional family of our main character and sometimes bring in some comic relief.Chappie is our lovable hero who gets to face some of the worst sides of existence and how evil humans can be to each other. You quickly start to care for our protagonist and Sharlto Copley does great job as the voice of the character. The movie briefly tackles religious issues and existence in general but really only touches the surface of deeper subjects. I enjoyed those small touches but some people probably expected more on that regard.In the final scenes the movie gives us high class r-rated sci-fi action only the way Neill Blomkamp can offer. I don't remember any director except maybe James Cameron in his better days that brought such spectacle in this genre to the silver screen.In the end Chappie is entertaining, visually stylish, cool and funny film offering even some glimpses of depth here and there. I'm surprised by the mixed reaction of critics and viewers alike. I guess you can't please everyone. Blomkamp hasn't directed the same film twice yet. His films are visually similar and look great but gladly the stories have been different. I feel Elysium is his best action movie but it lacks in story. District 9 is his most original work and Chappie falls somewhere between those two movies but manages to also offer something new.",Chappie
244,SureCommaNot,Go watch District 9,5,20 September 2021,"District 9 is a 10/10, to me, so I recommend you go watch that one. With Chappie and Elysium both, it's Sharlto Copley who makes the film noteworthy and gives it some grit. Otherwise you have a pretty run-of-the-mill action/sci-fi.The biggest thing that took me out of this film was the odd choice of having people play themselves. Wouldn't it feel strange hearing Jackman's character referring to himself as ""Hugh Jackman,"" and wouldn't it make you scratch your head if he kept referring to his boss as ""Sigourney Weaver""? That's how I felt, seeing and hearing all the references to Die Antwoord, Ninja, and Yolandi. I enjoy their music, but why did they play themselves? Odd choice.And if the film's ending surprised you at all, I think it's safe to say you probably don't watch many movies. Go watch District 9. It's harsh, thought-provoking, harrowing, ugly, and beautiful.",Chappie
245,Netscape_Navigator,Chappie's accent made him sound like a total IDIOT,2,2 January 2016,"His voice, accent, and mannerisms makes him completely unlikable.It makes him seem like a complete and utter buffoon. An unintelligent clown, almost as cringe worthy as Jar Jar Binks. They intended for him to be cute and precocious in a child-like way, and failed miserably. He's annoying as hell and I lost all empathy and connection to the character. The fact that he had a muddled and unfocused character arc didn't help matters either.I can't think of too many examples of robots/AI in stories that have been given human qualities or the ability to speak, and NOT care about them. Usually they are endearing.",Chappie

And alas it is actually very good.Remember Short Circuit, and more recently I Robot, this film far surpasses these in every way. It has the various things that can make a gripping movie, action and violence/threat, emotion and memorable characters, a storyline that is done as credible as you'd imagine and well written, many humorous moments between the more serious scenes.Good acting in it, and when you can actually feel quite sorry/attached to a robot on a screen you're watching, you know the producers got it right.The film does bare minute similarities to District 9, but nothing wrong with a director paying homage to where they're from, especially as it makes a refreshing setting to many other movies. I can't really fault anything.Overall I'm happy I went to see it, and the 2 people I saw it with also loved it. I would recommend it.",Chappie
249,Gin-ster,"Strange, and inexplicably engaging",9,16 July 2015,"I have seldom given a movie a 9 but I'm giving it to this one because it is a ""bull's eye"" as far as what it is trying to do with one minor point which I'll get out of the way (and which stopped me from giving it a 10) - which is the terrible miscasting of Hugh Jackman. Otherwise, it is an excellent science fiction film, a human drama, and also deeply philosophical all while being two-dimensional and cartoon-like in its stereotypical characters - which, I realize, seems like a contradiction because it is, and is one of the reasons I found the film so puzzlingly engaging. Deep philosophical points are tossed off in passing, as when Chappie (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER) rebukes ""the Maker"" asking him, why did you make me to die? Since seeing the movie, when I hear kids say ""Mommy"" what comes to mind is Chappie's (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER) heart-rending ""Please don't die, Mommy."" And ""the Maker's"" corny aphorisms getting tossed back at him by Chappie are satirical gems. But I'm misrepresenting the film by dwelling on its ""philosophical"" aspects. It is also funny, light in tone, moves along swiftly, is unpredictable (contrary to some reviews) and the effects are beyond incredible as far as wringing so much expression out of a robot design that lacks human features. It is one strange movie, and it shouldn't ""work"" but somehow it does, in a memorable way.",Chappie

251,Zulfmanauthor,Chappie wants to live !,8,28 June 2015,"Neill Blomkamp's previous two movies have been brilliant sci-fi thrillers. The first being 'District 9', which is quite simply a genre classic and the other; 'Elysium' which was another well made atmospheric story better than the average sci-fi flick. So now we have 'Chappie', a film that bears many of the hallmarks of Blomkamp's previous work without ever reaching the same standard. The story focuses on a futuristic world where the South African government employ robots to fight crime. However when one of the robots is taken by a gang of thieves and installed with a programme to give it 'artificial intelligence', the results are remarkable. This is an action packed and emotional story with the cast doing a great job but the film suffers towards the end with one too many 'Hollywood' touches. As a movie about 'consciousness', it is not as intelligent as 'Ex Machina' which tackles a similar topic. Yet 'Chappie' is fun with moments of humour and great action, but don't expect another Neill Blompkamp classic! @zulfmanauthor",Chappie

I totally fail to understand why is has had such bad reviews.There is a strong feel of District 9 about it - and that was a great film, and if you liked that you will like this too.Yes, the bad guys are stupidly - stereotypically - bad, and the background story of promising young star being undermined by the jealousy of the older guy who has been pushed aside is hardly new, but its well done and I could point to dozens of ""better"" films which are fare more predictable.The core story, however, is very neatly done, with some originality, humour and feeling.

254,taz1004,Really stupid,3,18 August 2015,"This movie has so many holes that I cannot even cover them all. I love how movie makers think of Artificial Intelligence as Artificial Feeling. It was really ridiculous that the robot immediately started acting like a child as soon as it had AI. A machine will act like a child only if it's programmed to behave like one. Not just by giving it self awareness. It was also stupid that the movie tried to make heroes out of the stupid vicious criminals. And implanting the consciousness to new body to achieve immortality, this has been used in the movie The 6th day with Arnold Schwartzenegger. Implant memory to new cloned body to live forever. But is this real immortality? If your body die as soon as you transfer your consciousness, it may seem like immortality but what if your body doesn't die? And this clone with your memory is standing in front of you. Is that clone really you? It's just a copy. Overall, this movie tries to deal with few philosophical topics but at very elementary level. And just copied elements from many other movies that are far more interesting and just made it worse. Actings were horrible too.",Chappie

Night Shyamalan. Hopefully he ""chose"" it. Else it would simply mean he is as clueless as Night as to what a good movie makes, and equally in the inept director clan.All the problems with Elysium are repeated, and more. Visual details take top precedence, next comes action for action-sake  while plot, plausibility and character development is just given the throwaway ""whatever"" treatment. Even the visuals get tiresome after a while, with no plausible plot structure to hang them on.While on paper the concept has lots of promises, the movie product is but a string of pointless cliché scenes on and on, going from nowhere to worse and worse  without any thought to plausibility and meaningful plot and character development, pushed along with bland dialogue. Each scene is visually competent, but as a whole nothing much of interest.Even the ruddy Hugh Jackman could not save this dud despite his rare but earnest turn as one of the baddies. Dev Patel's usual annoying scurrying squirrel with nervous movements and blank looks (which is his de-facto cut-and-paste approach to so-called ""acting"" for all his movie roles, similar in vein to ego-tripper Shia LaBeouf) - makes the whole thing clownish and boringly stupid.It would be the two unknown actors who played ""mummy"" and ""daddy"" who actually did a good job - but given the exceedingly bad plot and script, there is little else they could do to lift this off the ground.I would approach Neill Blomkamp's next effort with extreme, extreme caution . especially having learned my lesson from the likes of Night Shyamalan . chappies who blast out once (and only once), then back to their diappies.",Chappie
256,Pulpthatsfiction,Another Disappointing Effort From Neil Blomkamp,5,9 March 2015,"Ever since the release of District 9, Neil Blomkamp has been trying to reluctant the success of that movie. After District 9 Neil made Elysium which was a disappointing film that was to similar to District. Know he has releases Chappie which again falls short to please.The films stars Dev Patel, Hugh Jackman, and Shalto Copley who plays Chappie. One of the few things great about the film is that Chappie is a great character to base this film on. Sadly Neil decides to make this a violent action film rather then really look at the character. It is the same with every character in his film that are interesting. He would rather focus on world building and action rather then focus on what could be really interesting, his characters.That being said the world building in this film is great. The first hour of this film is spent mostly on the world building but the story and the characters suffer for it. Even though the action in the film gets in the way if everything it was fun to watch. Neil has a great eye for action and he continues to show it with this song.To me one of the biggest problems of Neil Blomkamp's films is that his antagonist/villain character are just one dimensional and add nothing to the film other then to move the main character. All three of his films have had this same problem and the problem is getting worst and worst. Both Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver are great actors but they are given awful characters and Neil is no help in getting them a better performance.I hope one day Neil Blomkamp can make another film that is as good as District 9. I think he's biggest problem is that he keeps on trying to recreate the same film over and over when he should try something new. I think he should take a break from Sci-Fi and let a story in his head rather then just jumping to make it. His ideas need time to breath, I hope he's next film doesn't suffer from it.2/4 Stars",Chappie

Sigourney Weaver's role in the movie is little more than a cameo.In the final analysis, Chappie looks for all the world like a kindlier version of the ""Terminator"" robot, with special effects, especially the movements of Chappie, that are so real we forget he isn't a real person.",Chappie

There are too many scientific holes to make this a great science fiction. For instance, as a multi billion police maker company, Tetra Vaal looks more like a discount tele-sale company. Also, at least show there is a security in company, both human or system security. And, it was said they could not hack the robot, but that was actually he did to make Chappie.

262,seshasai-tris,Scrappie,5,16 March 2015,"I've decided to write a review after seeing those from Critics and film lovers. I'll try to set up a middle ground here.The film is neither awful as the critics say not outstanding as everyone tells. The sci-film is about how human consciousness acts and generates emotions in humans. This comes with a lot of baggage, as in, 1. How Dev Patel cannot program language (we know even SIRI talks) into a robot, but can write Terabytes of data file called consciousness. It was a good attempt to show the growth of a conscious being through a robot, but it comes with a ton of sins.2. The introduction, that starts as district 9, makes you feel you're in for a documentary but you are actually not. The director must have changed his script after going 15 minutes into the film.3. Misleading Trailer. The trailer shows cool action scenes with a thick plot of a A.I being against the humans which does not happen in proper manner. 4. Convoluted script. The director tries to enforce emotion towards Chappie. Do you empathize when some one kicks and beats a conscious robot, whose parts are easily attachable by rookies? If yes, this movie is a treat for you.so, the film is basically for bland people who are looking for some emotion in a titanium body. If you are looking for a good Action/Science fiction plot this one is not for you. No, this film does not have the cool district 9 kind of filming.

And then I really liked the trailer. Then, when the first reviews came out, I was afraid, that I was wrong with my anticipation - but in fact, Chappie even exceeded my expectations - in several ways.Yes - it is true, that Chappie shares quite a lot of parallels with District 9... but this isn't necessary a problem. District 9 was a brilliant movie - so is Chappie.And yes, it is true, that there are some holes in the story - from an extremely important programming key, which could be taken out of a factory, without any consequence... to a geek, which is first easily kidnapped, but then seems to easily overcome his fears.... Or a Chappie with a kid-like intellect cracking the mystery about consciousness...But what makes Chappie so great is, that it plays with stereotypes, without giving into them. Dumb criminals are given a lot of personality. And the ""robot"" is not necessary seen as victim. Let's face it: this movie isn't as beautiful as iRobot, or as emotional as AI - but it presses the right buttons.",Chappie
264,Hint523,Hollow and misguided but still intriguing,5,9 March 2015,"Despite seeing this film on opening night, I already had caught word that it could potentially be a disaster. I otherwise saw the movie completely blind, knowing only the loose concept and the director/writer Neill Blomkamp.Blomkamp captured lightning in a bottle in his 2009 debut feature, District 9, which remains one of the greatest modern science fiction movies in the way it serves as an allegory for the racial divide of South Africa, but also a high concept science fiction piece, not to mention a terrific action movie. Elysium, on the other hand (released in 2013), had an impressive concept but ended up as a rather hollow movie. Chappie unfortunately has more in common with the latter, primarily in that it never escapes the shadow of District 9. In so many elements, it feels like an attempt to recreate the wow-factor of that film.The first confusing element is whether or not the film is supposed to take place in the future or in an alternate present day. There isn't enough establishment of the world to verify either one. Chappie tells the story of a corporation's brilliant young genius (Dev Patel) going rogue and making his own type of robot that isn't the fighting machine it was intended to be. Chappie (Sharlto Copley) is born, and must learn the nuances of humanity through the underground culture of Johannesburg. What works well are the small moments, such as Chappie learning English and early communication. But for all of those, an equal number of them feel incredibly hokey. The supporting characters are absolutely ridiculous in two different ways; the two main characters are played by rappers Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser from the South African rave-rap group Die Antwoord. Neither one has previous acting experience, which makes for brutally uncomfortable performances until finally you get used to them. The rest of the cast consists of notable actors (Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver among others) who give their all toward undeveloped or misguided characters.For what it is worth, the film is unpredictable in many ways. Especially since I avoided trailers, the story took many directions I did not expect. I was intrigued through the lengthy runtime, but also made painfully aware of its cringe-worthy bad moments. Ultimately, the film is weighed down by how implausible some of the decisions are and how little the details are developed, much like Elysium before it. If that sounds interesting to you, then by all means go see it, but if you're looking for a well developed, quality project, you're going to have to wait for something else to be released.I find it interesting that this film is produced by Sony. For one thing, it means that you'll get more blatant product placement than any film outside the Transformers series. It also feels like the type of project that is a hit on paper, but is undeveloped and misguided in its execution. In the end however, I did enjoy the film, knowing it was flawed beyond belief but at least it didn't feel generic or bland. I hope that Blomkamp steps farther outside his safety net on the Alien franchise, which he is slated to direct next. If he takes the same approach as his last two films, it will similarly feel ambitiously interesting but hollow and misguided.",Chappie
265,Loveunderlaw,Chappie reminds me of a modernized & re-worked Short Circuit,5,28 April 2018,"I know the Short Circuit franchise was before many modern young people were even able to see it. But Johnny 5 was also a lethal robot designed for the military, not the police force. And he also dealt with evil people\bad situations too.Chappie is a good movie for youngsters maybe, but I just wasn't feeling it too much. Die Antwoord(Ninja & Yolandi) overacted IMO too.",Chappie
266,Critomaton,"Hey CHAPPiE Boom Boom, hit me with the Ching-ching",6,8 March 2015,"Alternate Title: District 5 is Alive! OK, it's official. Neill Blomkamp is really good with the special effects. And I'm sure he's done wonders for the South African tourism trade. But maybe he should take a step back from the big, lofty ideas for a while, because he's been having a bit of trouble with them lately. Now, don't get me wrong. I actually liked Chappie. Better than Elysium for sure but nowhere near the landmark movie that was District 9. In fact, while the parallels to Robocop and Short Circuit were obvious even from the trailers, I was surprised at how derivative of District 9 it felt (and not because of the Johannesburg setting - in fact JoBurg might be my favorite character in this latest film, that Vodacom tower is really ominous). The director manages to give very short shrift to all of the big ideas in this movie - artificial intelligence, the essence of consciousness, even nature vs. nurture. Which is weird, considering how long the movie is.Instead, each scene is sillier than the one before it. ""Maker"" Deon has the secret to artificial intelligence, if only he can drink enough Red Bull to compile ""terabytes"" of code. And, just like the lizard tail regeneration DNA splicing scene in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", the difference between complete failure and total success is just a few short keystrokes - no debugging necessary. And that's just for starters - after that it gets really preposterous.It's fun to see Hugh Jackman as a nasty, psychotic, homicidal, office backstabber (kind of the way it was fun to see Roger Moore run around with the Spice Girls in a double-decker bus a few decades ago) but it really doesn't help anyone who's trying to take the movie seriously. Apparently Mr. Blomkamp thinks it is edgy to have Hugh invite his enemy to church, genuflect when he hears that Chappie is sentient, and comment on how godless Chappie is while trying to blow the robot to smithereens. Probably the most disappointing and nonsensical aspect (apart from the fact that Chappie was for some reason programmed to act frightened by every new experience) is how quickly Chappie went from a wide-eyed, cartoon-watching innocent to an expert in neural networks and human consciousness. If the writers of this movie had anything interesting to say about the true differences between programming, knowledge acquisition, and intelligence, it must have ended up on the cutting room floor.Apart from the annoying repetition of a particularly obnoxious Die Antwoord song, I really liked the acting by both Yo-Landi Vi$$er and Ninja (confession: I knew I would like Yo-Landi's role no matter what, but I was surprised at how much I liked Ninja's acting as well). In fact, their performances are probably the only thing that kept me from being disappointed with the movie.The transformation of Ninja's character throughout the movie isn't quite as dramatic as Wikus's in District 9, more like the difference between Normal Wikus and the Wikus who spits up used motor oil. But what do you expect from a gangsta thug rapper? ZEF! Yeah, for some reason I keep wanting to say ZEF! And Yo-Landi is just as sweet as she could be - if nothing else, Chappie gets an extra 2 stars just for making me forget about the video for Cookie Thumper (I prefer Fatty Boom Boom anyway).I do like that Neill Blomkamp used subtitles in this movie, I just wish he'd use them for the people I can't understand (which in this movie, was mostly Chappie).Ironically, the most realistic part of the movie was the vicious inter-office politics (OK, even that was over the top too, but only by a little), including a CEO who makes every decision as a knee-jerk reaction based on bad advice from somebody who's obviously lying to her. That was totally believable. I guess it's actually kind of comforting to know that Christopher Nolan doesn't really have a compelling idea of what lies beyond the wormhole and Neill Blomkamp doesn't really have a compelling idea about the essence of human consciousness. At least their movies were kind of fun, especially because they practically beg not to be taken seriously. On the other hand, I'm really looking forward to seeing Sharlto Copley play the xenomorph in the next Alien movie.",Chappie

268,filmfanperspective,The best 'fan film' ever (***1/2),7,5 May 2015,"I admit that I fawn over Neill Blomkamp's gritty, real-time visual style, and his big ideas. I also don't shy away from his too-obvious social commentary, either. That being said, I was still prepared for an incomplete experience- after all, he had four years to bring us his District 9 follow-up in Elysium, and that offered little in the way of enjoyment, other than the idea. Chappie, is a slightly more developed film, on both the ideas and execution front. Even Hans Zimmer's Blade Runner-esque score works. Sure, it is something of a mess at times, has some unnecessary gore and two characters that cinema and the world can do without; but I liked the mess, especially as it plays as an earnest mess.Chappie (the robot) is an incredibly likable character, and never ventures into silly ""Johnny 5″ territory. His naiveté, eagerness to please, and hyperactive behavior embody an endearing and fascinating look at what a manufactured intelligence might actually do, how quickly it would develop, and what lengths it would go to understand itself and humanity. Chappie is almost literally thrown into the fire with humanity, and in the process gets a crash course in understanding us. That the robot can even function with the chaos surrounding it is remarkable, and Blomkamp frames his experience well. Also boosting the character is Chappie's design- his chassis is conducive to allowing for fluidity with the CGI, as well. Not once did I doubt that Chappie was a tangible, real being. Even the designs of the computer programs used to upload firmware, etc, are believable and grounded, unlike most tech films. The science and the science-fiction behind the A.I. ideas in Chappie are is better than anything films like Transcendence, and dare I say even Terminator 2, have to offer, which I suppose is more a commentary on how poor Transcendence is than the quality of Chappie. The film gives us (maybe a bit too obviously) clear examples of how humans can be so inventive and yet so destructive. I've come to the conclusion that Blomkamp may actually prefer robots and aliens to humans, or simply enjoys using them as a tool for self-reflection. In his dealings with supposed lesser beings, we see how his filmmaking is possibly a reflection of his own upbringing, and his way of covering social injustices or opinions. Is it overdone and a bit ham-handed? Possibly. If you're looking for that, you'll find it.It's no mistake the film invokes the term 'black sheep'; this film knows it is different, or an ""acquired taste"" if you will. Look beyond that to find the heart of it, and may just see it. As I see it, Chappie is simply the red-headed stepchild of Blade Runner. Obviously, I liked Chappie, and the glimpses of creativity we see from Blomkamp are such a wonderful breath of fresh air. I'm just a blogger, though. Most professional critics have lined up to swat at this film like a proverbial piñata. They want to hate this film, and from what I've read, many of them have. Many have resorted to lazy puns in describing the film, such as ""Chappie is a scrap heap of regrettable storytelling""*, or in multiple places 'crappy Chappie'. Sigh. In one breath, they'll praise the aforementioned Blade Runner because it's artsy, and in the next breath they'll decry this, the more direct film. I saw through the noise, and understood Blomkamp's intention. Am I giving him the benefit of the doubt because I want him to be good? Sure, but as my review for Elysium stated, I have no issue blasting him, either. I liked Chappie in spite of what I'd like to change about it.The sum of Chappie opinions show a clear critic/audience divide, and I think it warrants further examination. Chappie is the best ""fan film"" you'll ever see- made by a geek with an excellent eye and a nice budget. I'm a geek, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I gathered that Blomkamp isn't a master filmmaker, but there are certain parts of this film that spoke to the unrealized, undeveloped, yet creative young geek in me. Critics, on the other hand, lack the wherewithal to see this, and they refuse to respect geek material and/or culture. It's why superhero films and comics are sometimes loved, but usually loathed, and have blanket opinions on the quality, or even an acceptance of their existence, thrown on them. If The Dark Knight comes along, then of course it's a sheer miracle that it is good. It's a superhero, or simply a geek film, not just a film. I'll take a stand here and say that bias prevented others from enjoying the majority of Chappie– but it won't prevent me from recommending it.",Chappie
269,gelmcchristop,Pleasant to the soul and mind,9,5 August 2021,"""Chappie"" is the result of the lessons Blomkamp took from his first fan-favorite, District 9. The plot has brilliant, quick pace and comes to a smooth end, with lots of easy-to-follow action and surprisingly fulfilling character arcs. Specifically, the way the film focuses on action and character constantly refreshes the viewing experience, and eliminates any chance of discomfort or boredom from the audience's perspective. The overall story is rather chaotic (in a positive manner), with lots of stuff happening that draw sufficient attention.From a technical standpoint the film clearly excels. The directing is significantly less tiring yet equally exciting compared to District 9, and possibly one of the best among all action movies. The cinematography is a pleasant surprise, with interesting locations, eye-catching colors and on-point use of anamorphic lenses. The visual effects are expectably brilliant, special thanks to the producers who coordinated two hours of a robot fist bumping and hugging humans, and of course the animators and texture artists who made an incredible job piling realism onto Chappie.",Chappie

However, the ""R"" rating and the filthy language limited the success of the movie and the enormous income the movie would have made had children been included. I was most disappointed what appears from advertisements to be a good movie for the entire family but on arrival at the theater learned it was ""R"" rated. Shame on the writers and producers for adding the filthy language which was totally unnecessary and short-changing kids from seeing the movie!!!I saw the movie... will not return to see it again! Really, it is disgusting and sickening that Hollywood can't seem to do anything anymore but porn, filthy language, and gross murder scenes. Of course, the families that can't go and see their movies cuts into their pockets and the real loss is the money they would have made in movie goers!!

Its a sci-fi film , its an action film, its a comedy film and its a tearjerker. Actually, its all of them, without being categorized as any of them. Other reviewers have stated that its a Robocop/Short Circuit hybrid, so I won't add more of the same.The film is good, the robot is lovable, the acting is OK, but its the premise and location that bewilder me. South Africa! Why South Africa? It may be that the makers were keeping costs down.Best part... Chappie going 'Street'. The worst... MC Ninjas acting.This film is a must for anyone who isn't too cynical, its just a shame there is violence and strong language, as kids would have loved it.For me, 6 out of 10.",Chappie
273,Gorillaboi,"Great premise, but could have been executed better",7,6 March 2015,"Chappie had the potential to be a great movie. It flirts with the fascinating theme of A.I. and human evolution, and it does so in the company of fantastic graphics and CGI - some of which were purposefully given the fluttering effect reminiscent of the endoskeleton motions in the old Terminator. The robots were given a realistic, believable look/design - as opposed to the far-fetched futuristic feel of Sunny in I-Robot or Murphy in Robocop.However the journey of Chappie finding his own intelligence and going from an innocent child to a conflicted teen -- whilst interesting and enjoyable -- could have benefited from a slower, more detailed thoughtful pace. Instead Chappie rushes through these phases too quickly; harming character development and not allowing you to feel a stronger connection with him (like, for example, like you did with Caesar in Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes). The movie is unique and has a wonderful premise but, overall, It allows its shine to be taken away by creating an over-animated, cartoony take on gangs and crime. The movie would have benefited so much more through better casting and writing. But perhaps the worst sin of the movie, is the conclusion. At one point, as Chappie learns more about humans, it could have opted for a more daring result that paved the way for a sequel. Instead it plays it safe and gives, quite frankly, a laughable ending.So, in conclusion, it's a very enjoyable, unique movie that benefits from that same look and feel of District 9. But it doesn't blow you away. It ought to, but it doesn't. Neil Blomkamp fell off a few levels when he made the mediocre Elysium, and whilst Chappie is a right direction back towards his masterpiece of District 9, it's not enough to dispel the critics/doubters who feel he's a one-hit wonder.",Chappie
274,shadowyx12,"Despite the interesting concepts presented here, the story is just a mess.",6,11 March 2015,"SUMMARY: In the year 2016, weapons company Tetravaal makes a deal with the Johannesburg police force to supply them with state-of-the-art robots capable of taking down dangerous criminals. During an ambush, one of the robots is damaged by Hippo - a ruthless gangster. Meanwhile, Deon Wilson (the creator of the robots) is determined to test out his new A.I by implanting it into the damaged robot...QUICK REVIEW: After watching District 9, I jumped to the conclusion that Neill Blomkamp was going to be the next James Cameron. But after watching Chappie, I'm not so sure of that anymore.The story behind Chappie is surprisingly complex - yet slightly convoluted and a little too convenient in some parts (the ending ticked me off). I also had trouble relating to most of the characters (they were also underdeveloped); Vincent Moore (Jackman), Michelle Bradley (Weaver), and especially the three criminals (Ninja, Visser, Cantillo) would have certainly been stronger if we knew more about their backgrounds and why they're in their positions. However, I did feel that the cast did the best they could with the material given to them.Deon Wilson (Patel) on the other hand, is a much more identifiable character, but he also feels too one dimensional.If you ever do find the human character to be a bit much though, don't worry - Chappie saves the film! Sharlto Copley does a great job in bringing the robot to life. Seeing the robot go through its ordeals only made me sympathize with Chappie more.Another criticism I have for this film is its world building. Like... What in the world was Blomkamp trying to achieve with colourful looking GUNS? And why would the Johannesburg police force rely mainly on the robots to look after their city? Wouldn't they have been smart enough to have an equal mix of both humans and robots just in case anything went wrong with either side?The VFX and CGI is on a level of what you would typically expect from a Blomkamp film by now - unique with its own flare, and overall great.VERDICT: Chappie would have been great if Blomkamp didn't cram too many elements into the story. Expect more popcorn fun than intelligent fare. Rent/skip it.",Chappie
275,pachl,Overall the worst movie I have ever seen,1,9 April 2015,"I take no pleasure in writing a negative review. I'd much rather rave about a movie that pleasantly surprised me.In the movie, Tropic Thunder, the term ""full retard"" became a trendy catch-phrase. I don't want to sound like a whiny, semi-literate malcontent, but while sitting through this absolute bomb of a movie, the one recurring phrase that kept passing through my mind was, ""they went full retard.""Chappie, the robot, gains sentience. He can think for himself, though he starts out like a child that must be taught everything. This is the core of the movie. Clearly, the writers meant to create a sweet metaphor about the tribulations of growing up, but what they created was two hours of pure cinematic torture. The acting, plot, and action sequences were often cringe inducing, not to mention laughably illogical and ridiculous. I seriously can't imagine how anyone could enjoy this movie.Chappie is taught by Johannesburg gangsters, who talk about as authentically as Keanu Reeves accent in Dracula (read: abominably). This was one of the most irritating parts of the movie, but add to this the cartoonish, buffoonish characters and the whole thing was simply a misguided mess.After one hour I didn't think I could last till the end. I literally couldn't even sit still in my seat, but I toughed it out, hoping something at the end would happen to redeem the movie. Sadly, it did not.I won't even bother writing about the plot. It's full of holes. The acting is generally so absurd it goes beyond intentional satire. I pity the great actress Sigourney Weaver who somehow got roped into this mess.But most of all, I pity everyone who sat through this movie.",Chappie
276,Necroambulant,Peculiar But Worth Watching,8,6 June 2015,"Chappie is the modern version of what we would have gotten if someone had made the god awful decision to cast Vanilla Ice and Lil' Kim in Short Circuit...ignoring that neither of those two pop culture ""icons"" were available when Short Circuit was produced, and we can ignore that without any cognitive dissonance because we also know that there is absolutely no way anyone would have decided to do such a terribly stupid thing even if it was temporally possible.Die Antwoord being cast in this movie as themselves (albeit some sort of legitimate gangster iteration of themselves, listening to their own music in the process) was easily one of the dumbest decisions I have ever witnessed being implemented by a filmmaker. I can enjoy Die Antwoord in small doses as a sort of guilty pleasure that I don't feel the slightest bit guilty about; but there is literally no way I would ever consider them to be viable acting talents...though Yolandi does manage to display greater skill as an actress than I would have expected, but that isn't saying much, considering how little I expected of her.Beyond those two somehow finding their way into the movie, it was actually very poignant and not at all exclusively the gritty Short Circuit remake that I suspected it might be. Chappie is more likable and less irritating than Number 5, which doesn't take much because, no matter how much I still enjoy Short Circuit (mostly out of nostalgia), the movie was really just all around bad and stupid.Watching Chappie evolve through development of consciousness and identity from infancy through to adulthood is actually quite fascinating and terribly sad thanks to the gauntlet the poor thing is put through along the way. It explores topics of mortality, free will, and morality in a surprisingly interesting way, through the innocent eyes of Chappie.Depth and insight are undermined as the story suffers from a low brow thug sentimentality that is kind of humorous at times but ends up wearing out its welcome along the way. The largely Die Antwoord-infused soundtrack and the subpar acting by the same are not high points, and tend to reinforce the thug dynamic to an extent that is simply uninteresting. I keep finding myself coming back to those two as being the biggest problem with the movie.The rest of the cast, notably Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, and Dev Patel especially are almost enough to raise the overall caliber of the acting in the movie from the bargain basement outhouse quality Ninja and Yolandi create...but almost simply isn't good enough.Honestly, I might have been able to really enjoy this movie had it not been for the perplexing casting choices...but that alone was enough to ultimately ruin the movie.",Chappie
277,jojifrey,Does this movie really deserve a 28% in ROTTEN****S??,8,14 March 2015,"Saw the review of this movie a few days ago, brutally scored in Rottentoma***s for 28%. I used to rely on their rate-o-metre for any movie in the past, but when I read their meta-critics, somehow deep inside I know I didn't agree. So after watching the movie this morning with hub, I must say I'm glad I listened to my gut. The hell with the so called expert critics, a good movie is always a good movie.So the story revolves somewhere in Johannesburg again. Nostalgic of the District 9 scouting ground. What really made this movie alive are not Dev Patel or Hugh Jackman, or even Sigourney Weaver, nu-uh, just the 2 new comers : Ninja and Yolandi Visser -- and of course America and the good ole Sharlto Copley (personally, this guy is an awesome actor). The story is simple yet it has the vibrant entertaining spirit that is so thick of Blomkamp's style. Very reminiscent of District 9. The gore, meshed up scene by scene that were interwoven melodiously, it was a full-on entertaining piece. (And to read how most ""movie-experts"" were jumbled by the story I could just feel sorry that they didn't get the entertaining piece except by tearing apart a good movie.)Earlier scenes were somewhat paced by boring introduction of the weapon company, and we hit the boredom button at its peak when focusing to Dev Patel's character and his rivalry with Hugh Jackman. Jump to next scene where Yolandi, Ninja, and America were busy dealing with the mob boss and we were transported to the real deal.Their silly ideas and what follows to the abduction of Patel and Chappie were the ones that made the movie starting to flow non-stop to a next-level ending.A creation who creates his creator and transfer consciousness from one medium to another? And making so in a OH SO ELOQUENT movie? Does this movie really deserve a 28% in ROTTEN****S?? I don't think so.This is a very good movie, been long since I found an interesting movie these days. Way better than the ordinary common Hollywood pieces... oh wait, those stuff that most critics adored, no? Just saying.",Chappie

279,speedy-droid,"Original Idea, Great Story, Poor Ending, Mediocre Acting",8,27 June 2015,"There are so many good things -- things that I really like about Chappie. Unfortunately, some of the acting is just not up to par, and the film just seems ""unfinished""... as if the screenwriters got tired and just quickly whipped the last few pages of the script together as the last moment. Another few days in Editing would have greatly improved the film.The ending is just odd, and while it makes a few good points, it mostly abandons the main theme of the film, in my opinion. All of a sudden, it's all about the people, and Chappie's existence seems to be just an afterthought.The last time I saw a film that depicted A.I. as a powerful entity that literally began in a child-like state and had to learn everything from the ground up, was 4 decades ago, in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Watching a bona-fide killing machine that was specifically designed for police duties, just cower in the corner while learning the meaning of the words ""Daddy"" and ""Mommy,"" and playing with dolls... was just Unique. Not many films really present something truly refreshing and new these days.The acting itself is an odd twist. Sharlto Copley isn't even REALLY on the screen, but he acts circles around every other actor in the film. However, Dev Patel and Ninja also put in some very nice work. The real Heavyweights in the film, Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver, are mediocre at best. Of course they are not used to playing relatively minor roles, as they do in this film. Their energy is just not in their acting in Chappie, and their characters come across as ""plastic"" and unbelievable.The special effects in the film are not remarkable at all, with the exception of Chappie himself, which is a magnificent piece of performance capture and animation. Chappie's movements are so realistic that when I first saw the film, I kept trying to figure out how they fit a person inside the robot suit. I assumed that there was a tall, ultra-skinny person in there. I didn't find out until later that it was actually performance capture.The film definitely has its own strong answer to the ""Trading Places"" scenario. Chappie is 100% a product of his environment, not any kind of ""destiny"" or ""genetic predispositions.""While Chappie is certainly not a comedy, you will definitely want to pay attention during the sequence where Ninja takes Chappie out into the real world to steal cars. That is the most brilliant thing that I have seen in a long time. I was laughing so hard that I could hardly breathe.Seeing Chappie is definitely worth your time and money, although you'll be disappointed in some of the acting performances and the lack of some final polishing work by the film-makers.",Chappie
280,DrLex,"'Chappie' is like Die Antwoord: many will not like it, but deserves respect for daring to be what it is",8,16 June 2015,"I wasn't aware that 'Chappie' was directed by Blohkamp before I started watching it, but it soon became obvious even only a few minutes into the film. The style is quite similar to District 9. Anyone who liked D9, will probably like this as well.The film features Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser from the South African band 'Die Antwoord'. Both their music and video clips can best be described as 'weird'. I cannot say I really like the music, but I respect these people for daring to swim against the mainstream in the way they do. Their performance in this film is reminiscent of their clips, and for some strange reason it works.By all means do not watch 'Chappie' for a water-tight story that is completely plausible. The story has plot holes big enough for an airliner to fly through, but this is not the point. The film throws together cutting-edge CGI, some quite deep questions about society, AI and consciousness, the absurdity of Die Antwoord, art, tension, and plain all-out action, into a big explosive mix that is never dull, and not belittling of its audience by glaringly pointing out what one is supposed to feel about every character and story element.I am surprised at the poor rating this film receives at Rotten Tomatoes, which during its first years of existence I actually considered more reliable than IMDb for its overall ratings.

281,hydralien-40230,Die Antwoord,7,8 October 2021,"It's mostly a benefice of Die Antwoord crew - they're pretty much the main actors here, save Chappie. And that's surprisingly not bad, even though a bit cliched at times - they're very expressive and vivid characters, so the more they're on the screen the better.It's also story-wise quite a lot better than I anticipated - yes, there are expected scenes, but it all plays out quite different from what regular blockbuster expectations might be.From less positive impression, the city of Johannesburg is shown as an absolute rotten dumpster that could only be held together by a robotic force. Which might be true (I haven't been there), but I somehow doubt the value of displaying its citizens as a violent bloodthirsty mob.Another issue is with Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman - they're either unbelievably bland and almost unnoticeable (Weaver) or depicting a teenager high on amphetamine instead of an ex-military inventor (Jackman).Overall, an unexpectedly good story, at times painful to watch due to unnecessary violence towards the robot and the city, and due to poor acting from ""big"" actors, but well compensated but other characters.",Chappie
282,deltaforce7,"An infantile remix of ""robot"" movies with bad acting and bad plot",1,20 November 2016,"First, it is impossible not to notice that nearly EVERY positive reviewer of this movie NEVER reviewed anything else on IMDb and keeps complaining about ""too much criticism"". It so obvious that practically all of the positive reviews for ""Chappie"" are paid fakes some of whom published SEVERAL positive reviews under their names. This flick does not come anywhere close to ""District 9"". Same director - different results. ""Chappie"" is a touchy-feely movie for infantile teenagers. All the characters are very 2-dimentional and there is very little character development present. The dialogue, the acting, the plot are all just abhorrent. Technical aspects of this movie are awful. Mind-reading helmets work the same for both humans and droids (while droids obviously lack a biological brain). A droid has to use a keyboard - a HUD (human interface device) - in order to communicate with various comps. Anyone ever heard of Bluetooth? The Scouts got those moving antennae and other moving parts that have no other purpose but to make those droids capable of what exactly? That's right: of providing more of the simple emotional indicators to the infantile viewers. The sabotaged Scouts have their heads set on fire with sparks flying, but then it turns out that no serious damage comes to them. That's right: the infantile viewers would not recognize a more subtle way of disabling machines. Furthermore, why do those Scouts need to retain such human shape with the actual protruding heads being so vulnerable AND their ""CPUs"" located in that most vulnerable area??? The Scouts movements are waaay too human-like, but it is unclear how could this be achieved with all the artificial joints that would unavoidably have limited range of motion. Meanwhile, the Moose's shape was obviously stolen from the Robocop movies. Besides, being powered by two large jet engines, where does Moose stores all of its fuel? All its armor, legs, armaments, ammunition, the engines themselves - all this stuff would easily weight at 30-40 metric tons while not being aerodynamic at all. How much engine power and how much fuel (which also needs to be carried; more fuel = more weight) would be needed for such a non-aerodynamic monster to fly any distance whatsoever??? Then, a seemingly serious business establishment (it's management still keeps two of their head engineers in the common cubicles) does not seem to have any security and no network administrators, so the staff members come and go when they please, they take stuff away, bring stuff back,remove important control devices, develop and deploy highly destructive code - and there is no one who would notice all this rogue activity! An employee runs around the office with a pistol; then he attacks, threatens with a firearm, batters another employee in everyone's plain view, and he does not even get reprimanded only because his ""ammo magazine is empty"" and the assailant simply laugh is off? Really!!! Alright. And what about that gangster guy who fires a huge Russian-made RPG-7 from within a small room and survives the effects of the igniting booster?! Then, even more unbelievably, the HEAT rocket (an antitank munition!) capable of burning through armor of most modern battle tanks makes this nice little hole or a dent in a Scout's armor - from a distance of something like 5 yards! The rocket would not even arm so quickly and even if it armed, then its explosion would be highly destructive to anyone located within 20-30 yards of the impact area, and a target like the Scout would be burned all the way through and utterly destroyed.And then about the helmets again... An android-engineering company also just ""happens"" to be running a successful, safe, instantly effective human brain-reading project that allows droids and humans to start performing these endless switcheroos all over the place! This is not science fiction, people. And the rest of it is just as dumb. There are also all those overused, stuffy concepts there, such as ""Guns are bad"", ""people who display Christian rituals are all crazies"", ""all real good software engineers are from India"", etc. Really, I do not expect much from new movies nowadays. But this flick is just that - it is simply a bunch of badly rehashed clichés and technical stupidities with an overly heavy touches of tears squeezing. In order to be fair, there where two things I actually liked in ""Chappie"" -- how them gangstas were getting blown up to bits, and how the CEO lady ran out of her office in the middle of a disastrous situation while not forgetting her coat and purse!",Chappie

The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese, the logic of none of the characters makes any sense and the childishly superficial character traits are laughable. It's offensively dumb.All of this might work if there was somehow a good core to the movie, but sadly it doesn't have what it takes to become a true cult classic either. You can tell a story with stereotypes, sure. And perhaps the makers were just going for a movie that was zef. But none of that explains the mess that Chappie is in the end.If you want to put a movie on that offers nice visuals, robots running around and shooting and some Die Antwoord tracks, Chappie is for you.

289,AgentSauvage,Unexpectedly enjoyable and definitely worth watching,8,3 March 2019,"A film about almost but not quite indestructible Police Robots in an out-of-control Johannesburg, where one unit designated to be crushed is instead given consciousness and - needing to learn everything from the basics upwards - unfortunately gets taught how to behave by an interesting threesome of drug-dealing. gun-toting Gangstas, occasionally assisted by the scientist who created the Police Robots.
The concept is played out with style by a series of lesser known actors with two or three big names thrown into the melting pot. The end result is a surprisingly enjoyable drama - although it does also include gun fights, explosions, bad-guys and sadness.
Chappie himself will touch the viewer, even though he is a construct. The inter-play between the main characters could have been visualised better, but that would have made the film longer. At two hours the film is just about the right length and the viewers will each have his/her own ideas about how the story could have been developed, thus prompting discussion (isn't that really what films are meant to do - to create a situation where the viewer asks 'what could happen next'?)
The final 'solution' in the film is unusual and - although not entirely original - actually works.

Even ""Die Antwoord"" are acting in this movie!I really hoped the movie will explore Chappie's personality and understanding. Well, in some degree it did, but not enough for my taste. I wanted to see how they explore the brain of an AI once he grew into an adult, how creative the creators of the movie can get on that regard. But alas... I was disappointed. They only partially explored his ""childhood"", if you can call it like that. Still, this movie is pretty good. Sometimes it has some dull & boring scenes, but I think it's because of the cinematography- It was pretty boring. No interesting shots or whatever.

This was a bit of a different role for Hugh Jackman, while it was not his best performance he still performed well. Sigourney Weaver performed well in her role as well that was not that much of a challenge for her artistically.I was shocked to see Die Antwoord in a production such as Chappie, but neither were awful. I thought Yo-Landi left something to be desired with her performance in certain scenes, yet it did not take away too much from the movie as a entirety. I felt the best acting performance came from Dev Patel who delivered when he needed to do so and embraced his role. It was also nice seeing Jose Pablo Cantillo in this movie.The script itself in certain points did not make much sense, leaving me to question the logic behind a few scenes and plot development. Neill Blomkamp seemed to be at creative loss at times and forced certain developments that didn't make much sense near the beginning of the movie.However, portions of the dialogue do bring up a number of philosophical points about life, death, religion, and the meaning of life if you are able to catch them. I felt that aspect of the script was well done along with the comedy elements that were scattered throughout the film.The shooting of certain scenes also left something to be desired, but it was not bad enough to derail the movie completely. For those that have seen Distric 9, Chappie looks very similar to the earlier Blomkamp film. Overall I would say this is a movie worth watching, while I felt it could have been better it was still executed fairly well.True Score: 6.3",Chappie

293,klausming,An emotionally distressing exploration of artificial intelligence and notions of existence,9,3 December 2015,"Chappie is a satirical near-future science fiction drama about a damaged and discarded police robot who is reprogrammed to be self-aware. Abducted along with his creator, the robot begins his child-like existence with a group of South African crooks who name him Chappie and teach him how to be a gangster. An emotionally distressing film, Chappie's betrayal by his ""parents"" is astonishingly effective, as is the film's exploration of a number of social and cultural themes, not the least of which is the concept of being an outsider. Both Ninja and Yolandi's contributions as actors and musicians is substantial, if not mesmerizing. Blomkamp's ability to balance the film's action, comedy and drama along with his exploration of artificial intelligence and notions of existence is unsurpassed by other films in this genre. Inexplicably disliked by many critics, Chappie is a severely under appreciated and misunderstood movie that should be considered one of the best of the year.",Chappie
294,mpf101,What a mess,4,18 June 2016,"Blomkamp continues to develop as a cinematic master, and Patel and Jackman are excellent in their roles, but not even all that talent could save this misguided mess. The eponymous hero is at no point credible, moving like, well, a human who has been CGI'd. Worse, he is as cloyingly cutesy as the wish-I-could-forget-it hero of Short Circuit. I've known a lot of CEO's, and none would have made the decisions made by Weaver's character, a waste of her great talents. Most of the South African cast ranges between mediocre and horrifyingly incompetent. The score is crushingly bombastic. And the script has holes you could drive a convoy through (too many to list, and I don't want to write spoilers). Still, I don't feel like I wasted 2 hours. There were moments where Bomkamp creates magic. There are just way too few of them.",Chappie

The charming cuteness of chappie has you laughing and felling for the robot. The casting was majorly ok, but agree with others dieantwood was not the best casting, ninja was poor but yolandy was stronger. Overall this film has some good action and heartfelt moments and just a solid Friday night watch.",Chappie
296,PadmeAgnes,"A human story of exploration, love and survival",9,28 March 2015,"Chappie starts as an average action movie. Luckily I saw the trailer before going to the cinema and knew it was going to be more than just ""chasing"". I agree with my fellow reviewers that the metacritics are completely off. You can watch this movie as an average Sci-Fi action film; it will entertain you. There's plenty of shooting, plots and funny lines. You can also watch this movie with as much depth as you like. It has one of my favourite Star Trek Next Generation and philosophy Theme's: what makes / defines human? You will forget in some parts that Chappie is a robot. I thought it was very touching that the roughest of people still show the sophisticated ability to embrace a weaker being. The movie also made me reflect about office politics and corruption bred by a bad environment. Enough food for thought!It's great that Sigourney Weaver and Huge Jackman signed up for this movie. That will create a fan base for a movie so worth watching. Despite Mr Jackman's hilarious outfit, I so disliked the character he portraits. Dev Patel was his charming stereotype self. I only hope he will be cast for another type of role soon. Yolandi started stiffly but she transformed during the film that was perfect for her character. Sharlto Copley gave Chappie vulnerable and funny edge. I loved his ears, clever as they made the character so sweet. The movie has great music, special production design and I love the fact that they use authentic accents and not Americanized it. District 9 was a special Sci-fi movie. Chappie is even better: 9,5 movie - IGNORE the METACRITICS !",Chappie
297,patrickmmc,A Poor Retelling and Fusion of Short Circuit and Robo-Cop,2,20 June 2015,"Contrary to many who have left their opinion here, I am not a fan of Blomkamp films. However, I am a sci-fi fan and therefore try to give films like this one a fair opportunity to impress me.Aside from some big budget effects used in Blomkemp's films, each one, and especially Chappie, have the heart, soul and depth of a B-flick at best. What's most difficult about his films to digest is that all of the characters are barely likable and hardly engaging enough to gain interest. Add to that that all of his films depict a dark and grim future. And finally, Blonkamp puts the ""trash"" in ""Euro-Trash."" At the very least, I felt the District 9 and Elysium were pretty much original stories. On the other hand, Chappie was little more than a poor retelling and fusion of predecessors like Short Circuit and Robo-Cop and others. The premise was hardly original.Sadly, I knew what I was in for before I had seen the film based on the previews. Yet, I still wanted to give the film a chance. All I can say is that I'm glad I waited to view it on DVD. Unlike some of the predecessors this film rips off, I won't ever want to see it again.",Chappie
298,cmalpelli,Calm Down Haters!,8,30 January 2020,"So this not only applies to this movie but to the review of all movies, calm down and understand the premise, I'll expand on what I mean. So for some reason there's this group of ""critics"" that always seem to feel the need to hold every single movie to a Oscar worthy standard, so for those critics calm down. This movie delivered on just about every aspect based on its Sci-Fi presentation, this isn't E.T. or Close Encounters of the Third Kind but that's ok because it's not trying to be that kind of movie. Honestly I find the concept and creativity very spot on and the ending definitely left me wanting a sequel, which unfortunately due to the ""oh this isn't Titanic"" level critics, will never happen because Blomkamp was basically personally scarred at the box office reception of this film. I'm finding myself lately ignoring the ""mainstream critics"" because many have zero understanding of putting films in their proper category to be judged accordingly, constantly nit picking every single detail and trying to criticize the authenticity of the movies events being able to happen in reality, HELLO!!!!!! It's a Sci-Fi movie for a reason, it's supposed to be creative beyond actual reality that's the whole point, DUH!",Chappie

300,Steviereno,Quite Enjoyable,9,4 June 2015,"To begin with, I like Sci-Fi, so read this review with that in mind. The action was excellent and frequent, so anyone who doesn't like action at all won't like this. I have my limits on action, but this movie didn't exceed my capacity. I THINK that it was because the main characters wee allowed to show multiple sides - what in school we called ""rounded characters"". Chappie certainly was multi-faceted, as was the gang-banger who was Chappie's ""daddy"". Chappie's ""mommy"" showed different sides, a human side, after starting out as only a gang-banger.I thought this was going to be something like Millennium Man, but wow, was it not. At first I didn't like it that Chappie was 'signed up' with the bad guys - the gang-bangers. But it went in clever directions, almost with the entire story. The movie was fast-paced, and Chappie developed quickly and perhaps too fast to really follow - but that really helped keep the pace of the story moving.The resolution was very heart-warming, to me, but I won't give it away.Having Hugh Jackman as a flawed bad guy was a trip. A bit monomaniacal.I thoroughly enjoyed this flic. I easily could have given it a 10, but also perhaps an 8, so ended up at 9.The ending seems to have allowed for a sequel. If there is one, I will watch it and hope it is as good as the original. I am a Chappie fan now.",Chappie
301,Imaculata,Plot holes big enough to drive a Moose through,5,7 March 2015,"Chappie's plot relies entirely on the complete absence of any security (guards, cameras, monitoring) in the security firm that makes the Chappie security droids. A military firm mind you, of the future. Yes, unfortunately despite the incredible special effects, Chappie is one big exercise in idiot ball writing. Everything that happens in the movie relies on the complete incompetence of its characters, most importantly, absence of ANY security. Worse yet, the movie tries very hard to copy the movie Short Circuit, but fails to evoke the same emotions when it's titular character is mistreated. The characters are very unlikable, especially Chappie. The tone of the movie is inconsistent, ranging from childish to gritty and violent. And it just comes off as a Short Circuit knock off with better effects, but worse writing. The movie also reuses the same setting as District 9, which has now clearly outstayed its welcome. Sigourney Weaver is underused, and her character is badly written. She plays the CEO of a giant military security firm, that has no interest in a revolutionary new AI. If the makers of the movie were wondering when they lost their audience, that would be the moment.",Chappie

It would be much lower if it wasn't so beautifully shot, colorful, and uniquely stylish.I just watched this on Netflix, and it's one of those movies I'm so grateful I didn't pay to see in the theater, but wasn't terribly let down watching it on my couch over the course of 3 days.People complain about the acting by the South African rappers, but I didn't think they were any worse than Dev, Hugh, or Sigourney. And when good actors fall as flat as these performances did, you can typically blame the writing and/or directing.This screenplay was hard to swallow. The director gives the audience no credit as the plot is meticulously spelled out in large bold print. Unfathomable motivations drive main characters to behave in ways that only make sense on the back of a hastily scribbled napkin.

The plot line is linear and simplistic, acting are all round passable; and the only enjoyable part I found is the CG - which is fantastic.Neill Blomkamp has been on a downward slide ever since his groundbreaking ""District 9"", which combined the footage style with documentary style editing, giving it a very personable, realistic/surrealistic experience on current social commentary on illegal immigration and plights of refugees.This movie is devoid any of that. It has no depth, AI and consciousness were not explored or explained. It just happened to push an infantile plot line. Overall, not a movie you want to spend time on.",Chappie

With ZEF movement icons Ninja (Watkin Tudor Jones) and Yolandi Vi$$er from the superbly awesome and inspiring Die Antwoord playing themselves to front the whole films statement. CHAPPiE is full of entertaining characters, humor, action and drama while asking a lot of questions from the audience you cannot resist being touched. Reminding you of classics like Charles Dickens 1893 novel, Robocop, Short Circuit and District 9. Sharlto Copley deliverers an awesome CGI robotic motion capture performance as CHAPPiE, Signourey Weaver as the profit yearning robot manufacturing CEO Michelle Bradley with her employees Hugh Jackman playing the jealous Vincent Moore, and Slumdog Millionaire actor Dev Petel playing the honest and wanting to do good for the world Deon Wilson. CHAPPiE, named after South Africa's most popular chewing-gum, is an Artificial intelligence (AI) police robot that gains true consciousness and gets ""kidnapped"" by ZEF O.G's Ninja, Yolandi and Amerika. After Chappie gets damaged his creator Deon and his Mummy Yolandi treat and teach him like the innocent kid he is, but his Daddy Ninja and Amerika try and turn him into a ruthless, tough and cold killing thug. Leaving you with lots of laughs and heartaches along the action filled dramatic journey. Reject CHAPPiE is pure, like an infant, this Nr.1 Gangsta Robot from Jo'Burg is youthful, caring and emotional, full of feelings and who always wants well. You do really enlighten to CHAPPiE and cheer him on as he experiences life. Expressing to the audience how we all possibly are product's of society and environment: mutating into zombies of the controlling capitalistic society of greed, selfishness, fear, enormous stress and pressure. Leaving us with the thought that we all except very few are modern day slaves believing we live under freedom. It surely puts South Africa back on the map with it's violence and outlaw state, showing what has become and what cultures have grown from it's unpleasant Apartheid history.At times the film felt a bit slow and repeating itself a bit, especially during the second part of the film, but upped its game again in the final third. I would also of enjoyed more of insight to what CHAPPiE could do with his sensitive emotions, the culture and lifestyle of ZEF and it's characters such as Hippo, Ninja and Yolandi. But as a whole this is a film that portrays society in a black comedy entertaining way and we might just get that insight in a sequel?Who is the good guy?

306,dragonroars-57812,You think you're real?,9,19 November 2017,"A wonderful movie about humanity and what we define as existence. The movie is placed in 2016, South Africa as crime has increased a local weapons manufacturer replaces the human police enforcers with droids. However the lead designer of these droids is working on making sentient AI program. After being turned down by his supervisor, he proceeds on his own and his work abducted during a car jacking.Chappie has some comical real world elements, but is a very serious look at human nature. It shows there is no true line between what we call good and evil. It questions the meaning of existence and explores the definition of the soul. Most characters are all motivated by impending death, either physical or financial, and sometimes both. All the work on this film was done with excellent care to details. The dialog, the acting, the effects, and direction are all great work. My only complaint would be the blurb at the beginning of the film talking about events ahead of the movie was nonessential. If you skip to the CNN anchor talking, it would have been a 10/10. So 1 point for editing?Action packed and an ending that has you begging for a sequel.",Chappie
307,firstruleofmethclub,"An imperfect, yet underrated true-sci-fi gem",6,24 March 2015,"Neill Blomkamp's Chappie is getting absolutely lambasted by the critics. Not least of all by the ACM Crew, who I put a lot of stock in, Kristian Harloff particularly despised it, and I find myself almost always agreeing with him. In fact the only reason I ended up watching it was because the film I wanted to see (Kingsman) was having technical difficulties, and my only other options were Fireman Sam, Insurgent, Seventh Son, Tinkerbell, Unfinished Business or Fifty Shades of Grey which no no to all of that. But I'm actually pretty glad that it wound up that way. Because I really rather enjoyed Chappie. Plus it means I saw it on the big screen, which is definitely the way to do it (and besides, I can always just watch Kingsman tomorrow). Despite what critics say, Chappie was well worth the watch. For me at the very least. It borrows elements from RoboCop, Short Circuit and Blade Runner. And while it's true that each of those films is better at the individual aspects they represent than Chappie is, it still manages to blend them into rather a sweet, dark film, filled with Blomkamp's trademark directorial attributes and the Zef culture of South Africa. Sure Ninja and Yolandi are not A-grade actors, but they were a lot better than I thought they would be, and managed to essentially carry the bulk of the piece. There is some dialogue that is a little lacklustre, and the pseudo-science does rather drop the ball in the third act. But these are issues that make the film less good, none of these issues individually, or even combined, are actually bad enough to make the film bad itself. Sharlto Copley absolutely bloody nails it again, as Chappie, a role unlike any he's ever played again. His film roster is short at the moment, but if his work so far is anything to judge by, he'll be leading mainstream work in no time. And though Sigourney Weaver may have been under-utilised, we don't know what her other commitments were, and I'm sure we'll see enough of her when she works with Blomkamp again for their upcoming Aliens sequel. Hugh Jackman on the other hand makes a decent primary antagonist (and might I add, its lovely to see him join a genre film where he actually gets to play an Australian, complete with mullet and Strine slang!) I know that for most people, director Neill Blomkamp is one for three after this entry: With District 9 pretty universally beloved, and his second film Elysium pretty universally panned. And as far as those two go I agree. But I just can't find enough fault in Chappie to plant it anywhere other than firmly on the District 9 end of the spectrum. 65% -Gimly",Chappie
308,Adhogati,A fitting continuation of the District 9 finesse.,10,13 March 2015,"When I heard of Chappie and learnt that the movie featured the likes of Weaver and Jackman, I was honestly expecting a swashbuckling Hollywood visual extravaganza, and every last expectation of mine went away unmet, and I couldn't have been happier!It is easily among the most thought provoking science fiction movies to have come in the recent times. Describing the movie without revealing much would mean calling it a perfect mix of the sensibilities of Bicentennial Man, District 9, and Robot & Frank.It is spectacularly directed. To find faults in this movie would be like calling the contended gurgles of child a abomination because they do not compare to Bach.The critics were probably watching another movie in another dimension. Ignore them all and enjoy the movie. As a side note, not watching any trailers or reading any reviews of the movie before having watched the movie did me a world of good.

The story and plot didn't get me satisfied at all. And the movie itself is boring. The soundtrack playing in the movie was just ""OK"" to me. Acting was not very good either. It's just a waste of their time in acting for the movie. Hugh Jackman, while not the lead character, is really weak in his role. Sigourney Weaver and Dev Patel didn't do for me either. But Sharlto Copley who voices the robot Chappie seemed like he's the only one among the entire cast who showed their real talent, even if his was only voice acting. The good thing here is the focus on the robot Chappie who has a child- like mind trying to know how to do things. Still, the movie gets boring later on.

Chappie is created by a scientist at a company that produces police scouts to help keep crime at an all-time low. He is competing with a man who believes that there should be no A.I. because of their unpredictability. As this is happening, Chappie falls into the hands of some gangsters and is brought up and taught to be a criminal. Already the plot is too convoluted. The script in this movie is just a mess. Characters act paradoxically and all of the criminals are just crazy cartoons. Motivations are inconsistent and nobody is as smart as the movie wants you to think they are. There are numerous moments that leave you in disbelief because they just go in the most unbelievable directions. There are moments that ask the viewers to care for despicable people and it just doesn't work. On the other hand Chappie looks phenomenal. The special effects are top notch and look as real as possible. Chappie is a very sympathetic character and you feel for him and want him to succeed. There are some really cool concepts and moments, but all of them are misused and poorly handled. For every one thing that I love in this movie, I can think of two more that I hate. Even the ending was anticlimactic and didn't satisfy or answer any questions. There was so much potential in this film, and some of it was fully realized; it's just that so much more was terrible and it left me upset at all of the waste. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Chappie.",Chappie

Yes it's not a perfect film and it's not Neil Blomkamp's best film but I still enjoyed this film. I thought it was enjoyable, unique, and fun. What I recommend is not watching the trailers because you think it's going to be a story like Short Circuit or E.T. but it's not. That's a reason why people hated this film because they want it to be what they want not what Blonkamp wants. The acting was decent the only good actors in the film were Sharlto Copley and Dev Patel. Sigourney Weaver's character didn't serve a purpose in the film. If Blonkamp just wrote better his characters better this film would've been a lot better. Also the rap group that's in the film they were okay I think there should've been different actors for their part. The story was good overall and Blomkamp's direction is also good. The visuals in Chappie are amazing they look very real. Blomkamp said he was interested in making sequels of Chappie which I would see but it has to be something different that we haven't seen in a A.I film. I know that Blomkamp is going to make Alien 5 which is something that I'm excited for. I know it might not be better than Alien and Aliens but I think it will be better than all the other Alien films. So far Neil Blomkamp is 3 for 3 for me for the films that he made so far in his career and I think he has potential on becoming one of the next best directors in film making.",Chappie

Don't really know what people waited from this movie, but I don't care, not really.This movie offers in-depth characterization of every human being here on this planet. Chappie doesn't offer any super-hero types of actors, nor any awesome people. They have Ninja and Yo, they're more like junkie/alternative type of people. Chappie is a good willed dummy, with good heart, and main hero (Creator) is a random Indian guy, with normal attitude towards life.I really like how Blomkamp painted out the ""core"" of our society and this world, even in this movie. All of his movies are about how normal/standard/simple people react, how they act at extraordinary situations and at life-threatening situations. He has no heroes in his movies. Only normal people, real people, the same ones You meet in every day life.I really love the ""human"" part of Blomkamps movies. And as for Chappie, this movie left a strong impression in me, really strong one. It's all about dedication, fear, humanity, the true humanity, love, hatred, understanding emotions.And also, the effects and stuff around was superb. Hasn Zimmer took care of the OST and visual FX are the best You can get. When I saw District 9 in 2009, I was ultra-impressed by the visual FX in the movie, mostly the atmosphere the Blomkamps was able to capture within the scene(s). In Elysium he went a bit further, and here in Chappie he stroke platinum.I really suggest to all Elysium/District 9 fans to see this movie. If You liked those, there's no need for You to not like Chappie.When watching Blomkamps movies, You need to put away all the prejudice and cliché, he uses cliché situations a lot and also his stories are kind of predictable.

Positives:
Decent special effects. Interesting setting in Johanasburg. Adequate overall plot.
Negatives:
Tons of cigarette smoking. More blatant product placements by the tobacco companies which ruined yet another film.
Cartoonish costumes for the gangsters and gangs.
Cruddy background music.
Very poor acting by most of the cast. Dev Patel is the only one who rises above mediocre in the acting shown in this movie. He does pretty well. Otherwise, all the characters are flat, wooden, and predictably over-the-top or bland. Some big name stars who do not shine in their acting and sound like a first read. Very disappointed in that.
Blatant rip off from the original Robo-cop series of movies, but not done nearly as well as the Peter Weller films.
Felt emotionally manipulated by the story. I really didn't care about any of the characters by the end.

316,Victreebong,"Wall-E, White Rappers, Johannesburg...",8,16 March 2015,"Somehow it all mixes well! If the antics of Die Anterwoord drive you batty, like some sort of love children between Tank Girl and Sid Vicious, then you might be in for a cringe fest. But if you can suspend your overly judgmental attitudes toward counterculture children surviving in post-Apartheid South Africa raising a newfound prototype to overthrow a cartel, Chappie will delight even the most staunch anti-humanitarian perspectives.How? How else; by instilling the relatable human condition in the otherwise un-relatable. A robot. Is there any other way? This is no surprise to anyone. Blomkamp has done this twice now. The first was with alien ""Prawns"" in District 9, a film that re-invigorated the sci-fi genre 6 years ago and paved the way for future iterations of sci-fi meets social commentary hybrids. Instead of aliens living in isolated slums, Chappie the robot is an anti-riot cop robot that gains consciousness by the hand of his clean-cut hipster inventor, only to find out what the world has in store for anyone who's different. Sound familiar? Well, I've got news for you son; nothing's new under the Sun.Chappie (unit 22) is stolen during a hold up raid of property on a tech lab by a subordinate gang of a larger Johannesburg cartel regime.

317,Callum_Hofler,Utterly Non-Distinct,5,15 March 2015,"After the critical mutilation Chappie received upon initial release, I was perhaps prepared for something of a magnitude of bad that had not been witnessed within film since Trolls 2. But it turns out that Chappie is not all that terrible. Instead, it's something far less remarkable: average. Whilst Blomkamp injects a visual flair and intrepid charge into his work that is undeniable and utterly palpable from the beginning to the end (and leads me to provide a mixed sentiment, instead of a negative), he can't wholly rectify the abysmal and completely blatant thematic material, which spells only recurring concepts from his previous endeavors, both films of which achieved far more in terms of successful analogies on the current state of third-world poverty and discrimination. The environments are still as lively as ever, and the visual effects are virtually perfect, but these technicalities do not fully transform this into a positive experience. Match the lacking substance with an antagonist who is as boring as he is melodramatic (two concepts which don't seem to gel together on paper, but Hugh Jackman renders the comparison plausible to say the least) keeps Chappie from achieving anything more than decent. Plus, Yolandi Visser was absolutely terrible, though her fellow member of rap group Die Antwoord, Ninja, was actually pretty good.But Hans Zimmer... Jesus. Talk about a terrible score. Predictable methodology, themes which felt clichéd, an overbearing sentimentality and style which lacks intelligence and just provides thumping, simplistic beats, made more noticeable by their prominence in the sound mix. I knew the score was going to be terrible from the onset, but come on Blomkamp; Zimmer was never appropriate for this setting! Ryan Amon would've been a far better choice, and would have served as a great foundation to an ongoing collaboration.All the same, Chappie is indistinct. Its commentary on racism is as blatant as any metaphor I've seen this year (when the female lead tells Chappie about the story of a Black Sheep, I genuinely laughed) and it lacks a story which proves justly compelling nor original. But hey; it's technically sufficient, Dev Patel is decent and Sharlto Copley, as was expected, kicks it out of the park.",Chappie
318,stevehoyland,Short Circuit meets Robocop!,3,21 March 2017,"After enjoying the excellent ""District 9""(2009),I was hugely disappointed with ""Elysium""(2013),so I was pretty much up-In-the-air regarding Neill Blomkamps films prior to seeing this further offering from him. Sadly, there Is nothing here we haven't seen before. Little more than an updated remake of ""Short Circuit""(1986) the film nevertheless has It's moments,with plenty of action and explosions(If you like that kind of thing), although the plot Is rather unclear,and It certainly has more than It's share of ""silly science"". As well as the obvious Short Circuit similarities, the nasty executive with his own agenda makes some scenes seem as If they were lifted directly from the first (and quite brilliant for Its time) ""Robocop""(1987), even down to the almost Identical, over-the-top and extra-large Policing unit (called ""ED-209"" In Robocop), so similar In fact that I was surprised that It didn't end up on It's back, squealing and kicking Its legs In frustration and being unable to get back on Its feet! Indeed, take the aspects of the two aforementioned Movies from the plot and we wouldn't have much left! Explaining things, background story for example, seems low on the list In Blomkamps films, so much so that you're left scratching your head long after the end of his movies. Nevertheless, It's an entertaining film which, like Elysium, would no doubt be favoured more by the younger element, although with a (once again) 15 rating, younger children can't (legally)see It (at least, not at the Cinema)! Perhaps Blomkamp should consider, In future, removing some of the violence and bad language to bring down the age rating. Unoriginal and rather silly, but fun for teens.",Chappie
319,limoncella-641-42235,A hopefully tragic misstep in the career of an immensely talented director,4,6 March 2015,"I still remember vividly six years ago when District 9 first came on the scene and shocked the world. One of the first true Sci-fi masterpieces since the Millennium was here. Nobody had ever seen a movie like it before, and the fact that it came out of nowhere had everyone asking questions about Neill Blomkamp the director: ""who made this movie?"", ""where has this person been all this time"" and ""what will he do next?"".Blomkamps sophomore effort Elysium (2013) was made with the backing of a major studio, given a massive budget and featured A-lister Matt Damon in the lead. While Elysium is not the classic District 9 is, it's an enjoyable film well enough, with some fine action scenes and excellent visual effects, but despite the amazing technical direction the films script was a mess of lazy clichés and heavy handed social commentary, you cannot be at fault for calling Elysium a disappointment. Chappie represents and attempt to get back to those roots that flung Blomkamp into the spotlight in the first place. Much like D9, Chappie is set in Johannesburg, features Sharlto Copley in the lead, has a relatively modest production budget, and like D9 is a remake of a short film that Blomkamp made years ago.To call Blomkamp a master of visual effects is a pointlessly blatant statement, the man clearly knows what he's doing effects wise. Chappie himself and all the digital effects throughout are magnificent, you simply cannot tell where the seams are in this movie.The actions scenes are outstanding too, Blomkamp learned his lesson from Elysium and the shaky-cam is almost entirely gone. All the big explosive scenes are beautifully choreographed and make up for a lot of pacing problems with the film. But that is where most of the positive points with Chappie end, because for everything that works there's about 2 things that really don't.The biggest problem with the movie are the characters, despite Chappies name being the title and his face being plastered on every single piece of marketing for the film he simply doesn't work as a main character. Chappie doesn't appear until about 30 minutes into the film, and then he goes through a slow period of learning that takes up way too much of the second act of this film. The things he learns from his ""mommy and daddy"" are questionable acts of crime and degeneracy that make you not like the character, and towards the end of the film when Blomkamp lays on the Jesus metaphors really thick you don't understand entirely what Chappie is even trying to do or why. When you don't understand where the lead character in a movie is coming from there's a disconnect with the audience.The supporting characters are really what sink the movie however. Ninja is a disgusting human being that you don't want to root for, his attempts to turn Chappie into a ""Gangsta"" are childish and embarrassing, Yolandi brings no meat or intensity to her role, she is really out of her depth as an actress here, Blomkamp needs to learn from the mistake of casting these two that rappers don't always make good actors. Despite being in the film tonnes, Dev Patel leaves no impression, once he builds Chappie and hands him over to the crooks, he has almost no further bearing on the story, writing him out early instead of carrying his dead weight around would have been preferable. Sigourney Weaver is a really good actress in a thankless role that could have been played by anyone. Now, Hugh Jackman is the only character worth a damn, because he's the only person that makes sense as far as motives go, but he spends most of the movie making mean faces at Dev Patel, it's only right at the end that he gets to flex his muscles and do something.With a more consistent tone, a shorter run time and a complete overhaul of all its characters Chappie could have been one for the ages like District 9, but as it stands it's just kind of nothing. I still believe Blomkamp is a great filmmaker with lots of potential but he needs to get his act together and learn from his mistakes, especially if he's going to direct the next Alien movie.",Chappie
320,AStormOfSwords13,What were the haters smoking?,8,24 June 2015,"When the first trailers came for Chappie, I was really intrigued and wanted to see the movie. Then when it came out, it got trashed by critics. Almost 4 months later, I rent it from Redbox and watch it. Now that I've watched it, I've but one thing to ask: what were the people who hated this movie smoking and where can I get some?Chappie is basically 2015's District 9, directed by Neil Blomkamp and takes place in Johannesburg, Africa. The plots are similar enough; however, what separates Chappie from District 9 is that unlike District 9, which was a good movie but had a slow first 30 minutes, Chappie gets going right away and is a good movie. This means that what Chappie does is it does not hesitate to get on with the story while it sets up and therefore thinks quick on its feet. It might get confusing at first, but it's not too long before it clears up. When it clears up though, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It has funny scenes, emotional scenes, and they are used appropriately, never taking itself too seriously, but seriously enough to make it a meritable film.The character Chappie is a sentient robot that can think like a human, but at the same time is a child, so it must learn the basis of its surroundings. It isn't always easy however as during its first day of... school... its life is put in danger. But it is as Chappie develops and learns that I learn and begin to know just who Chappie really is, which is a learning soul who turns his teachers into his family who will defend that family at any cost. He never fully matures until almost the end of the film, but his intelligence works with the story this movie wants to tell, which makes Chappie a very interesting character.Dev Patel takes on the role of Chappie's maker, Deon. At some parts of the film we do not see Deon, but I'm okay with that since Chappie is the star of the show. But when he does show up on screen, I see an honest scientist who will do anything he can to help Chappie, even if it isn't always sufficient. I don't quite care for him as much as Chappie, but I do still root for him throughout the film.Hugh Jackman fills in the role of Vince, the villain, which was actually surprising at first, but I do feel he did a decent job as Vince, as well as being a villain. Of course, this isn't his first movie with robots because I remember him in the 2011 movie Real Steel, as well as X-Men: Days of Future Past if we want to count the Sentinels, but I do think he can take a role in a robot movie and make a character out of it, like he did here.Hans Zimmer does an amazing score as usual, though I will admit I didn't realize it was him until the end credits. But yes, the score really fit the mood of the movie in a way not many music composers can, especially during the movie's emotional scenes. Hans Zimmer is a music composer were not going to get many of in our lifetimes.All in all, a very honest movie that, while not all the characters are fleshed out, knows when and when not to be serious with itself, makes a star out of Chappie, has great music, and really makes watching a lot of emotional fun. So I ask again: what were the haters smoking?",Chappie

325,ghostjunk,Robot Gangsta #1 has serious heart.,10,9 March 2015,"Ignore what the critics are saying, because hidden behind this explosive sci-fi thriller is a touching, underrated story helmed by a powerful cast, with a beautiful film score by Hans Zimmer. Ironically, one of the most amazing stories about humanity I've ever seen was led by a gangster robot. What else can I say except I left the cinema in awe.A young scientist creates artificial intelligence and manages to bring one of his damaged police bots back to life, giving it the power to learn, love, and feel. Sadly, his plans quickly change when he's forced to share his creation with a gang of street punks who want it to help them commit a series of crimes. The gangsters quickly learn that turning this newly-created and childlike robot into a killing machine won't be so easy. This contrast creates some surprisingly funny moments filled with undeniable charm. However, things take a heartbreaking turn once Chappie begins losing his innocence as he's exposed to the dark side of humanity.Sharlto Copley returns as Blomkamp's main man and completely nails the motion capture acting to bring the lovable Chappie to life. However, this film's true secret weapons were Ninja and Yo-Landi Vi$$er from the South African rap group Die Antwoord. Both characters bring so much style and colour to the gritty setting, adding just the right amount of over-the-top originality the movie needed to pack that much more of a punch.I think this movie's biggest flaw is how unconventionally it portrays its themes through a mix of dark sci-fi violence and innocent family movie elements. This creates a movie that sabotages itself into getting judged unfairly and misunderstood by most. Strangely, its biggest flaw is also its biggest strength though! Everything about this movie screams anti-conformity and proudly supports individuality by bringing its audience into uncharted waters, evoking emotions that we wouldn't expect to experience and feel sympathy for characters we never thought we would. Viewers may compare Chappie to Robocop and Short Circuit, but this bot clearly makes this movie his own while pulling on all the right heartstrings and teaching us a few things about love along the way.In a nutshell, Blomkamp delivers a beautiful coming-of-age story that pushes the boundaries towards society's take on nature vs. nurture and ultimately challenges our views on what consciousness truly represents. Fueled by amazing special effects, interesting character development, and an intelligent use of symbolism towards life, this film falls nothing short of being a true cinematic masterpiece.",Chappie

328,facebook-688-234620,This movie got right what District 9 and Transformers couldn't,10,14 March 2015,"While some might not like ""die Antwoord universe"", for me it is a refreshing change from the American grind of the mill. With every detail that once was a nice detail blown out of proportion and overdone.This movie is a take on questions of Artificial Intelligence, human psychology and the will of a person to do go while you don't always have power over the outcome of your creation and intents.The pace of the movie is comfortable. With beautiful crystal clear CGI while it's not the main focus nor overwhelming constant action and sense of urgency. The nerd factor is high (realistic terminals and humorous throws for the awake geek). While the character development is very convincing with a right balance between the different personalities. The convergences in the movie are brilliantly done. While tension is smartly changed to humor or humaine moments.I personally did not anticipate the crew of ""Die Antwoord"" to put such a convincing acting performance and thought Yolandi would only bring gratuis sexy shots - but how was I wrong. This lady is not freakishly on a whole ""other level"" but can act conviningly as well while Ninja also brings a convincing father/gangster role in a ""dog eat dog"" world.In all, this movie will please the nerd, the action flick lover or the regular movie-goer. A few scenes might be slightly too graphic for children but they are less gorish as we've seen in the classic RoboCop. Otherwise this will really resonate very well with all other agegroups.For me this has been the most enjoyable and enthralling movie of the year so far.",Chappie

It was a great combination of RoboCop (original) and The Iron Giant, though it was more of it's own thing. It was very fun, had likable characters, funny, violent, intense, heartfelt and emotional.I actually cared for the robot. Like it's a scary robot but has the mind of a child, and is step by step learning about the world, and I think they captured that very well.One thing that bugged me is that it felt a tad longer than it needed to be. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it.Do not let it's appearance fool you. This is not a kids movie. It has brutal violence and F-bombs, and it involves the robot being used for crime purposes. In other words, it's rated R for a reason.I saw this as a dark and violent sci-fi fairy tale with a powerful message and I think critics were a bit hard on it. Also, I think it puts Spielberg's ""A.I."" to shame in which going into detail may spoil it.Overall, I loved Chappie and I highly recommend it to anyone who is into sci-fi.

But me, I would always prefer to re-watch the little N° 5 Robot for it's heartbreaking story, Robocop for it's deadly action and I, Robot for it's attempts of philosophic story telling.

I'll say there was sufficient delivery on the special effects, but the story was not extensive enough. One - there's no explanation as to why ""Ninja"" and his mates owe some master criminal millions of dollars; two - one minute Chappie's being bullied by thugs and the next we're to expect they're loving foster parents; and three - why would transferring one's ""consciousness"" to another being also carry their voice and accent over?

341,bsbulldogs,A poor sci-film set for the scrap heap.,1,17 March 2015,"I was going into this movie the other day expecting a quite decent sci-fi action movie with a bit of a story but the end result wasn't pretty. Some of the reasons why this is bad include every time the South African duo Die Antwoord was on screen, I had never heard of them before and never hope to hear of them again as I found their acting to be woeful, probably the worst I've bore witness too, the story being borderline ridiculous at times, the dialog was at times hard to understand and the whole gangsta talk really isn't my cup of tea in this sort of movie and hopefully last but not least, Dev Patel as a leading man. Patel, in my opinion, could improve as an actor after getting his lucky break in Slumdog Millionaire as it is now two below par roles in the one year, after the Second Best Marigold Hotel and is in definite need of improvement. One of the only positives I can glean from this mess of a movie is Hugh Jackman's performance as he tries his best in a villainous type role which I don't think I have seen from him before. Anyway, all involved must, and should be shaking their heads furiously at what they had done. This is the first Neill Blomkamp film I have watched and I will go back and watch his other two but if he keeps making movies like Chappie, his career will be over before it begins.

344,randolphpat,This movie might change your life...,9,18 October 2015,"Well, that might be a bit extreme, but this may in fact be one of the most misunderstood films I've ever seen. The evolution of Short Circuit meets Robocop is indeed complete. Beautifully stylistic, written and presented with heart and humor. In a near future Johannesburg an American corporation has sold it's drone police force to control a restless and impoverished population. Suggesting that South African governance is indeed a one trick pony. Gangsters have taken over the industrial apartheid palaces one ruled by a cruel white minority. As the film opens, it would appear that all that's really changed is the law and South Africa has fallen into chaos, necessitating and anything goes effort to reduce street crime. Sigourney Weaver plays the head of this imaginary company that manufactures and supports the robotic police force. But inside the company competing forces push for change. Dev Patel plays the engineering head who has successfully made his robots just human enough to be palatable, while Hugh Jackman has a much more militaristic super robot called the Moose he is trying to promote.The good engineer approaches his boss with a breakthrough that will make the new police drones actually have consciousnesses, he is shot down immediately. Undeterred he steals a robot slated for destruction and plans to use it to try his new program. His plans are immediately thwarted by gangsters who kidnap him, and his stolen robot with plans to use it to create a super gangsta. The engineer seizes the opportunity to conduct a real world experiment and activates his robot, one problem though, the robot is damaged and will only live for five days. The evil engineer Vincent Moore, (Jackman) has plans of his own, and tries to hijack Chappie, the newly conscious robot, for his own purposes.In order to really appreciate this film one must look past what initially appear to be some obvious flaws. Suspension of disbelief regarding many technical elements of the film and an understanding that a certain lack of subtlety, and nuance is required to support style elements and the breakneck pace, which allows the audience to really feel the chaos in the lives of the people live in this near future hell. This is done beautifully. In terms of artistic success by a science fiction vehicle it could be favorably compared to Blade Runner, and makes recent Matt Damon and Tom Cruise vehicles that attempt to the essentially tell the same or a similar story to this one look like complete failures.This film has heart, great characters, fantastic special effects, soundtrack, editing, and never slows down, or apologizes for it's breakneck pace. Chapie is a super rare example of what happens when the right team is given the right budget and the freedom to do whatever they want. Some people see this as a simplistic action movie, but if you open your mind, and your heart to a plucky little robot named Chappie, you might just find a masterpiece.",Chappie
345,Avid_Movie_Viewer,Entertaining BUT .. a modern cheesy Australian Robocop,1,13 August 2015,"Clearly Chappie is a modern day Robocop. They ripped off the story line. Weapons\Security maker that makes robots to police the streets. They copied the prototype police force. Robocop .. then they copied the overkill police response in the Moose robots .. Really? You know .. the one in the scene from Robocop that shoots the business geek to death during the That unimaginative?They tried to dress up the movie with the philosophical crap of ""What is consciousness"" (Ghost in the machine) .. ""We can transfer consciousness"" from one machine to another. Weak.That this movie is a 7 rating as of 8/13/15 is a joke.Jackman and Weaver must have been paid all of the $49 million budget because there was little creative thought put into this movie.",Chappie
346,fvwyk1-804-458094,"Two hours of ""Die Antwoord""",8,29 May 2015,"After all these years I am still not sure whether I love or hate ""Die Antwoord"". When I heard that they star in this new Neil Blomkamp film, Chappie, I was rather perplexed as I was not sure whether these guys could actually act, but they really pulled it off.There are some themes in Chappie that were quite cool, for example the notion that our ""consciousness"" could be stored and transferred to a robot.The only thing that bothers me is the fact that this film seems more about ""Die Antwoord"", than about Chappie or anyone else. If you know ""Die Antwoord' and have seen their music video's you will quickly realize that all the interesting artwork, graffiti, the costumes, the branding, the accents, the mullets, almost everything in the film has been used before by this sometimes refreshingly bizarre group.This just did not really feel like a Blomkamp production, but more like a homage to the group that brought us ""Enter the Ninja"". Patel, Copley (As Chappie), Jackman, Weaver and everyone else in this film, are all just bystanders as Ninja and Yolandi Visser steals all the thunder.Besides a few docu-style inserts, I could not really find Blomkamp in the film. It feels much more like the work of Ninja (Watkin Tudor Jones) who himself has been a tremendously creative South African director through the last few years, albeit that his focus has been mostly on music videos, bringing his interesting flare of the underground South African cult subculture called ""Zef"" to an international audience. ""Zef"" is extremely difficult to explain to someone who has not grown up in South Africa, but it is essentially magnifies and enlarges the sometimes laughable and alien practices of the lower middle income white and mixed race population, through music, clothing, tattoos and dance. ""Zef"" itself features strongly in Chappie. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Without giving too much away, I think Chappie will be one of those films that you either love, have strong mixed feelings about, or just don't get. Very much like Die Antwoord.",Chappie

Shmad reviews,10,7 March 2015,"I made this account for this movie review..I think it was a great movie, obviously it will take a while for a newborn to learn anything and that chappie wasn't going to be chappie as soon as you turn him on, he has to learn... but besides the fact it took a while for him to become an adult male in the film, he did become an adult faster than any human could possibly achieve..That is where the brilliance is.. and for him to download your HUMAN conscientiousness and transfer it to a robot means you will live for ever and that idea is brilliant...For you people condoning the film being low budget (cmon....) here is your answer..its obvious..The film is set in upscale areas where THE robots are built and the engineer's and the builder's neighborhood is upscale as well since they are paid well.. but also have scenes in dead beat areas where you can conduct illegal activity such as bringing a stolen robot and working on him and also being able to package and sell narcotics and also shoot guns without being found so you find abandoned dead beat buildings and conduct you illegal activities there...that answers all you guys question of ""why it was a lower budget movie"" I mean for cheeses sake the film is an amazing idea brought to you by an amazing director..

348,MediaPanther,"Replace the ""h"" with an ""r""",3,6 March 2015,"Some films land on the fringe of being great but Chappie falls just short of being bad. It's pretty bad. Driven with a lack of storyline, empathetic characters, but rampant with bad acting. There isn't much that's redeemable of the film. Likewise, there isn't much that calls a trip to the theater.The first half of Chappie follows Deon (Dev Patel) as he creates the sentient robot from which the film derives its name. He has engineered South Africa's answer to law enforcement. A league of crime fighting robots, the Scout, sport free-thinking artificial intelligence that rival it's human police counterparts. However, his real goal is to create a robot with consciousness that can speak different languages and appreciate art. He comes close to figuring out the equation when his path is complicated when some thugs capture him and force him to turn off all his police bots with a ""remote"". After some improbable happenstances Deon creates Chappie, which leads gangsters Yo- Landi, Ninja and Amerika to raise it like a child so that they can use him to perform heists. Somewhere in the story Deon also has a work nemesis (Hugh Jackman, The Fountain) that tries to promote his own robotic creation by undermining the productivity of the Scout. Everything is set to the backdrop of a tumultuous Johannesburg.A big problem with the film is a lack of storyline. The script allots ample screen time for audiences to understand and sympathize with Chappie but that task is never fully realized. So much time is spent on character development for one robot that everyone else is stripped down to one dimension. Society's dependency on technology is an interesting premise for a film but filmmaker Neil Blomkamp's flashy work never takes off.What Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell's (District 9) script lacks in brains it compensates with visual effects and explosions that are sadly squandered. Sharlto Copley's motion capture work and the visual effects team create a robot that is as clunky as the script. Chappie's movements and actions are played off for laughs but most of the time they miss the mark. With the robot taking up so much screen time it's also a shame that it's not engaging nor provides an empathetic connection with the audience. The first two acts suffer from the cardinal sin of movie making: boredom. When the story finally picks up and culminates in some exciting action scenes, it is marred with tasteless acts of violence. There's one fight scene between Chappie and Jackson that is not just gratuitous but will make the audience cringe with distaste.As an additional weight on the film, Chappie trudges along with an unconvincing protagonist, cartoonish characters and performances from rap rave group Die Antwoord that leave much to be desired. Members Ninja and Yolandi Visser essentially play exaggerated versions of themselves as gangsters. Their performances are uneven and in certain scenes, just plan unconvincing. Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) is fine in his role as the maker of artificial life but Jackson's villain character lacks more depth than the shallow side of a kiddie pool. These pitfalls are made even more glaring when the main character constantly teeters on annoying and fills the screen with antics that are plainly not entertaining.Running at two hours long, Chappie could have been compressed to a 20-minute short story. By the time the somewhat interesting idea of transferred consciousness is introduced, there isn't any time for the film to dig itself out of its many plot holes. This one's a pass.See more at: www.mediumraretv.org",Chappie
349,blossoms-733-387580,This is a review about the AI technology in the film,8,7 March 2015,"Neill Blomkamp does not disappoint. While I found ""Chappie"" to be less original and unexpected as ""District 9"" my $19 was well-spent at the IMAX theater tonight. I currently study computer science in graduate school and have a lurid fascination with anything related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, so this film was mandatory viewing for me. I am not a film critic and neither do I know much about what makes a film great (since I was convinced ""Interstellar"" was the top pick for best movie at the Oscars, but some movie about a washed up actor won instead), so I will limit my comments to just the science in this film.Unfortunately, much of the artificial intelligence technology in ""Chappie"" is still pure fiction. If you've watched this movie chances are you probably like technology and may be aware that back in 2013 a chatbot (a program that mimics a human being) named Eugene Goostman passed the Turing test by successfully fooling 30% of its human judges into believing that it is a 13 year-old autistic boy. This milestone in AI was predicted by Alan Turing in 1950. Although this is a very exciting development, the reality of AI technology is a far cry from the AI characters in movie like ""Her"" and ""Chappie"". The (arguably) good news is that terminator-style lethal killing machines like the police robots in this movie are close to becoming a reality (google ""UN killer robot ban""). But artificial intelligence (AI) that has the sensitive, emotional, and child-like behavior of Chappie will take decades to achieve if we can even get there that is.As artificial neural network research progresses we are indeed moving closer to producing more sentient AI programs that can learn, analyze, and reason with perfect, human-like intelligence. But I doubt it will ever have the emotional complexity of Chappie. Emotions are *extremely* complex--far more complicated than human logic. Programming AI that can work out the proofs for all the problems in ""Principia Mathematica"" is a cinch compared to programming it to emote Meryl Streep's full dramatic range in ""The Bridges of Madison County""--the latter is far, far more difficult. How do you program emotions? How do you program fearful behavior? Is it only when a robot encounters something unknown? How about fear learned from negative experiences? It's one thing to program a robot to solve ""1+1 = 2"", but programming it to timidly talk to someone who is repressing their anger is considerably more difficult. The robot will have to be able to read and interpret human emotions first before it can express its own emotions in a logical way.*** SPOILER BELOW *** The plot twist at the end of ""Chappie"" was very thought-provoking. Personally, I found the idea of ""transferring"" consciousness to be problematic. Ostensibly, this idea implies that the holy grail of humanity (immortality) is within reach (when Chappie successfully ""transferred"" his maker's consciousness from his body into another robot). But this notion of ""transferring consciousness""--the personality inside our brains--is flawed because even if it were possible it is only a copy of our consciousness-- much like a copy of your Word document saved into your flash drive. Even if this were possible, this new us is not our soul and not actually us. It is a copy of our personality before we died.Even creating something like a helmet that makes a copy of our personality is so far ahead technologically that I doubt if we'll ever get there. We do have machine learning (ML) algorithms that can help continuously improve a computer's ability of learn and make decisions. But to replicate human consciousness requires that we have a blueprint of someone's innate personality--their biologically inborn likes/dislikes, interests, hobbies, etc. The field of psychology is not so advanced at this time that we can fully understand all aspects of the human personality and all the things that make us tick. We would also need to devise a blueprint of this personality and install it into a robot and allow it to navigate through the world learning and experiencing through the filter of such a personality. AI technology is nowhere near this.",Chappie
350,ajd4,How could you not like this movie??,10,12 April 2016,"I've been wanting to see this for a while. I was going to pay $14 bucks on Amazon for it a few months ago but I went on IMDb user reviews and I saw a lot of dog ratings so I decided to wait. Finally, it comes on Showtime and I'm thrilled but cable is only giving it two stars. So, I'm telling the wife (who is staring mindlessly into her iPad as usual), thank god I didn't pay $14 bucks for this but I give it the shot. I go back I read some negative reviews, I don't like the characters so much at first and I read a review wherein the reviewer claims he doesn't care about any of the characters. Forget that man, within short order I am absorbed. How could you not like the ""mommy"" character? Even the other two scoundrel criminals are eventually redeemed. And the idea of downloading your consciousness, how far out is that? That may mean immortality in our life time. This flick is very cool. Cable gives that garbage Mad Max: Fury Road 4 starts and this 2? I think not. Fury Road was contrived nonsense. And, and I just paid $14 bucks for The Revenant ... What nonsense... That guy would have died, dead... No revenge for the ludicrous Revenant. I wanted to call Amazon and demand my money back. Chappie on the other hand, holds together, builds and then pays off. It has all the important elements for a great film: journey of the hero, coming of age, the scoundrel redeemed, rich symbolism and illusion, not to mention excellent science fiction ... Who said its the worst movie they have ever seen? Try the Winter Soldier ... I walked out on that ...",Chappie
351,andrewshieh0712,When the there is only one good guy in a movie and he's not even the main character...,5,8 August 2015,"To the people who enjoyed Chappie, sorry, but this movie is a huge disappointment to me. I'm not talking about the visual effects and I have no problem with what director Neill Blomkamp is good at, but Chappie has a weak and misleading narration which irritates me.First of all, the trailer was just extremely misleading. Before I watched this, according to how I learned from its trailer, the movie is mainly about the conflict between Dev Patel, the representation of robots with self-conscience, and Hugh Jackman, the main villain. However, from what I see from Chappie is Chappie hanging out with some gangsters and learning to steal and hurt people which the trailer should have tell us at the first place. The trailer didn't reveal even one information about Chappie getting raised by the gangsters!If I knew what the main direction of Chappie would head, I might not feel as disappointed, but still, I dislike this movie. I have no problem with the acting in the movie, but the characters are just so annoying and you just don't care about them. The movie wanted us to like Ninja and Yo-Landi and see them as the protagonist, but I can't stand them teaching Chappie how to curse and steal cars. What I was expecting is Chappie getting to learn from Dev Patel and how they would prove Jackman wrong. Instead, the main story is about the gangsters which I think it's completely unnecessary and gone to the wrong direction. It's just very hard for me to accept that there are 100 times more bad guys than there are good guys in the movie. *SPOILERS*I know many people who enjoy Chappie would say that Chappie has a deep message which many people neglected. I didn't, and I know it's about ""What is consciousness?"" But the third act and the ending of Chappie is just... a total rip-off from the Johnny Depp movie from last year, Transcendence. Even though Transcendence wasn't a good movie, it has a pretty cool concept and has potential. However, in the case that I watched Transcendence, I can't stand that Chappie uses the same concept from Transcendence. I'm not kidding, it really the same! It just left me speechless. Chappie could have been good; however, is just another good-looking, but unoriginal sci-fi, action movie with annoying and undeveloped characters (the cast, also, kind of wasted), and a misleading narration. I really wanted to like it but the characters are just very unlikable, and I really don't want the gangsters to be the main focus of the movie.",Chappie
352,immanuelwilliams1982,Chappie blew my CPU,10,21 March 2015,"After watching this movie I literally blew my computer trying to upload my brain into the hard-disk. I was just banging my head on the CPU screaming, ""get in there. get in there"". I mean who doesn't want their PC to be possessed by their own soul. So even if I'm dead and the PC is connected to the internet I can still chat with friends, hack into web-cams and still feel alive. From a Hindu or Buddhist perspective there is only one consciousness. There cannot be separate consciousness like mommy consciousness or daddy consciousness. Consciousness is single, it is one, and it transcends mind, matter, space, and time. Then why don't we experience all as one? It is only the mind that prevents us from experiencing all as one. It is our mind or our programming that makes us different or unique. Our programming is the sum total of our cognitive experiences. So practically we can simulate our own mind using a computer but that would be a separate entity from yourself. You are there only in your own body not in the computer or a robot.

353,okg-11122,The rating Doesn't mean anything,10,26 June 2015,"I feel like I have to clear something up, the rating doesn't mean anything it's the story is what matters.

But once they install the chip into chappie the harden criminals start to fall in love with chappie. The movie chappie is a funny and heart wrenching movie that has its funny moments to. It's is cute to see how the robot develops and how he acts in the human world, it's charming to see a big tough robot act like a baby. When I saw chappie get beat up, not treated with respect it made me feel sad it was like watching your own kid fall down but get Right back up and keep on fighting.This movie really does take you on an emotional roller coaster.I was surprised that near the ending where his ""mom"" dies I Shead a tear,by the wonderful happy ending I was crying.I admit there is a little of violence in the beginning and little bit in the end to, but don't let that stop you from watching the movie. it is a great movie to watch don't believe the rating, without the rating I am sure that more people would watch this movie and love it like I have.

354,RomeoKnight,I see a trend in Blomkamp's movies: down,7,23 December 2016,"But luckily not as quickly down as M. Night Shyamalan's movies. First the good stuff: action sequences are bad ass and gritty as we have accustomed by now in Blomkamp's movies. VFX, cinematography and soundtrack are all top notch as be expected. Die Antwoords are a spot on choice as antagonists and perform unexpectedly well. They basically hold the movie together. Also the bad guys are convincing.Then the not so good things. The movie is basically a mash up of Robocop and Short Circuit with not much intelligence added. We have this million times seen setup where we have a robot that starts getting human-like traits and has to deal with moral issues. Then we have a that mechwarrior-type bad robot with missile launchers and mini-guns ripped straight from Robocop. We have plot somewhere there to fill things up, although quite thin and unsurprising. Both great actors, Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver are completely wasted on this film and basically just execute colorlessly the tiny roles they have been given. Slumdog millionaire is only good and convincing acting Slumdog millionaire. In Chappie he is the ""creator"" and gets the most screen time which is unfortunate, since he is barely decent actor with minimal charisma and likability. Tech- stuff goes some times so ridiculous that its better to turn your brains off and try not to think about it (PS4 clusters, ""neural helmet"", copying human's consciousness to an USB stick,...). I gotta say, one hell of a company that Tetravaal. They are like 100 years ahead of anything else in the movie world.The biggest gripe I have is for the ending, which is exceptionally crappy: stretched and Hollywoodish happy. Also the message given that humanity is just ones and zeroes is pretty silly and downright depressing. They should have let the Chappie ""die"" and forget that mind transfer foolishness. Open ending would have been much better choice. Instead they chose to spoon feed all to get that happy ending for everyone. Other than that, still entertaining movie worth checking out.",Chappie
355,Navaf,"Blomkamp gets a misfit target audience flick, of what could have been great.",7,18 March 2015,"What could have been a really good movie, by Neill Blomkamp with a similar theme of the Joe Berg ghetto culture married in with the other, this time rather than Aliens an AI, takes the wrong turn of being much too comical at the same time infusing it with gore and violence. The comical aspect with a very vague explanation of sci-fi turns of the serious mature movie goers while the violence and gore makes the movie unsuitable for a certain younger audience. The main theme of a advance General AI gaining consciousness is very interesting and getting more and more relevant to our times as automated Drones and driver-less cars gets a legal go ahead, but as said before that theme wasn't explored to where the audience craved it.",Chappie
356,SConIrish,"In Chappie he tests the audiences patience, in spending an inordinate amount of time with a number of unlikable characters.",5,24 March 2015,"""A piece of intelligence and sentience that's clean and uncorrupted...a blank slate born into what I view as a hostile world,"" Neill Blomkamp.Robotics and AI intelligence in modern society are explored in a conceptually fascinating film that falls short of being a fully realised sci-fi action film or a profound examination of violence in the modern world. The film opens with a brief compact explanation of the history of robots and law enforcement, (300 murders a day have declined) before an exciting freeway car chase ends with one of the robots going off-line, in other words being shot through the heart with a massive gun by a gangster. The story takes place In the near future of 2016, law in Johannesburg is enforced by Police robots called 'scouts'. The genius behind the creation of the robots is head nerd Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) who works for the TetraVaal corporation run by Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver). Deon's wish is to extend the consciousness of the robots to be human, however his plans are discouraged by Bradley, and so he decides to steal the broken robot and infuse it with human characteristics. Deon's office nemesis Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman pumped in cargo shorts) wants to control the robots from a remote human centric location and will do everything in his power to stop the humanitarian ideology of Deon from taking over law enforcement. The other subplot involves Chappie being kidnapped for criminal purposes by desperadoes Ninji and Yolandi to carry out a heist. But first he must learn how to function in the hard environment of modern day Johannesburg. When Chappie starts speaking, memories of Short Circuit Johnny Number 5 come flooding back. As voiced by Sharlio Copley, Chappie is innocent, wide eyed and prone to influence from those around him. However this is not a PG 13 wish fulfillment fantasy, instead it's a hardcore ultra violent world reminiscent of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop with a lovable robot. The tone never quite gels. You have to admire Neill Blomkamp for his original approach to this type of material. His three films to date have focused on the under class as outsiders. District 9 a veiled commentary on apartheid, Elysium an exploration through the action sci fi genre of class and now with Chappie he explores the role of AI in our future world. Will it be used to empower or corrupt?In Chappie he tests the audiences patience, in spending an inordinate amount of time with a number of unlikable characters. Primarily Ninji and Yolandi as the surrogate parents, out to do more harm than good. In another life Ninji and Yolandi front the African Rap Rave band Die Antwoord. It's an interesting choice that leaves the audience grasping for a character to empathise with, apart from Chappie of course. In essentially a supporting role Jackman has a ball playing a menacing Aussie bad guy, who gets to spurt lines like ""frog in a sock"" and ""smart as a dunny rat"".",Chappie
357,Donnie_Quixotic,Good Chappie,8,14 November 2015,"After seeing ""District 9"" and absolutely loving it, Neil Blomkamp is a director I've lent a devoted following to. Unfortunately, due to the incessant negativity this film received by critics, I decided (wrongly) to give it a miss at the cinema.I caught it ""free on demand"" on cable the other day, and was kicking myself that I didn't give it my support at the cinema. It seems all of Blomkamp's films have underlying metaphysical, and sociopolitical themes and commentary to them. For me this gives his films far more gravitas than the other vacuous tripe Hollywood churns out.On the face of it, ""Chappie"" is a great action movie, with elements of ""Robocop,"" ""Short-Circuit,"" and ""Blade Runner,"" but it also ponders contemporary issues such as our increasing reliance on Artificial Intelligence and robots, corporate corruption, militarization of the police, and the negative influences on our easily impressionable youth. It was a movie about compassion, and the great loss society suffers when it can't save its children from poisonous familial and social environments. But it also had loads of awesomely directed action, and a good amount of humor.I'm definitely not saying Blomkamp is subtle or overly poetic in his approach or style in relaying his philosophical themes, but, for me, it's entertaining; close in thudding style to Paul Verhoeven.Overall ""Chappie"" is an extremely sweet movie with a ton of heart. I just hope it's lack of financial and critical success doesn't negatively affect Blomkamp's career, as I think he's an important filmmaker with a lot to say. And he says it within the framework of easily digestible and entertaining sci-fi action flicks, which I love.",Chappie
358,bschultz_the_pally,Grade: B-,6,1 May 2015,"Chappie is the third sci-fi blockbuster from auteur Neil Blomkamp. It is filled with many of the usual trademarks that resounded powerfully in District 9 and less so in Elysium, and is important to Blomkamp's career; after Elysium many audiences wondered whether Blomkamp was a one-hit wonder or not.Chappie tentatively answers that question. Right out of the gate, Chappie is a thrilling film, boasting great effects and an interesting concept revolving around artificial intelligence in the police state. And when the robot Chappie comes to life- though reminiscent of Short Circuit- the movie seems to have found a heart that not even District 9 had. It is rare to see such childlike tenderness in an R-rated science fiction actioner, but Chappie is animated beautifully and voiced by Blomkamp favorite Sharlto Copley.Through Chappie's eyes, we get to witness the cruelty and injustice of the world. In a heartbreaking scene, Chappie is practically torn limb-from-limb by a group of boys who only see the police symbol on Chappie's chest, realize he is a rejected prototype, and unleash their wrath for the police on him.Chappie is cared for by some of the best characters ever in a Blomkamp film, played by Die Antwoord group Yo-Landi and Ninja. Yolandi is tender and maternal while Ninja's heart has been hardened to the world through his experiences, and he plans to manipulate Chappie for his own personal gain. The duality of these characters and their effects on Chappie's behavior creates a dichotomy that is very true to life, breathing a familiar air of reality into a movie that is very out-there conceptually.Unfortunately, the other characters are lacking significantly. Dev Patel is rather one- dimensional as a nerdy young technician whose passion is to create an artificial intelligence that can make decisions all on its own. Sigourney Weaver is unable to make any decisions on her own and blindly believes everything she is told, rendering her character entirely useless to the plot of the film. Hugh Jackman is laughable as a khaki-shorts-wearing office bully who is obsessed with violence for no particular reason. He is not only unbelievable, but cringe-worthy. Never have I seen him perform so poorly.I cannot blame Hugh Jackman entirely for the poor performance however. Chappie, though it has a big heart, has no brain, and its very clear about halfway through the film. There's a touch too many montages of teaching Chappie to act ""gangster"", the saturation of Die Antwoord music becomes distracting, and the amount of undeveloped ideas all struggling to tie together by the film's end leads for an overlong climax. Like Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, there were many times I was expecting the film to end, but it just kept on going. Chappie is a mess structurally, overloading on science fiction concepts, and the characters lack motivation outside of the core three- Chappie and Die Antwoord. It's a shame because Chappie has wonderful effects and cinematography, and a good heart at its story.Unless you're a die-hard Blomkamp fan, you can pass on Chappie. It starts off fun and quite wonderful before descending into total mindlessness, and it's nothing new in the way of science fiction. Its story is full of many regurgitated ideas that are never fully fleshed out. Neil Blomkamp has great vision, but no direction, and I hope he can find a way to capture movie magic again like he did with District 9. He doesn't quite have it with Chappie. Grade: B-",Chappie

No. What bothered me the most is that you're typically supposed to enjoy the supporting characters surrounding the lead character - or at least sympathize with them in some way - but I just couldn't root for the imbecilic halfwits in this case, and it made me angry. Added to the fact the movie was pretty much a blatant cross between RoboCop and Short Circuit, and I felt like asking for my money back from the box office.It's pretty safe to assume that the alien in the forthcoming Aliens 2.5 movie that Blomkamp is tasked with will be played by Copley, wear Fubu sweatpants, have a gold chain, and do the ""gangsta sniff"" at its nose with its claw 500 times throughout the film. Good grief.",Chappie

366,prohibited-name-2256,Such a misunderstood movie!,8,28 June 2015,"I haven't written a review for IMDb for quite a while, but when I saw the nonsense some people come up with in their Chappie's reviews, I just had to!First of all, it is a Pixar kind of story with slightly older audience in mind as there is violence in moderate doses in it. With that frame of mind, expectations have to be adjusted. After all, you don't expect a complex romance in a horror movie for example, right? And yet people write all kinds of crap about how unrealistic this movie is!The story is very straightforward and somewhat naive, as is all the techy stuff, but this is how it's supposed to be! In the end, it's a very warm simple story with a surprising depth and emotion for what it is - and this is the best thing about the movie. Analyzing tech details and robot psychology in this kind of movie is like expecting fish in Finding Nemo to follow the exact habits real fish do and complain whenever you see discrepancies!Die Antwoord duo lacks acting skills, true, but they more than make up for it with the unique personality that they bring to the table. Very memorable characters. And again, there's so much self-parody light humor with all the ""gangsta"" stuff, yet people pick up on it thinking that it's serious by intent and therefore pathetic. Good lord.Don't get fooled by people who pretend to be critics yet even have no idea what tool to pick for the job. Original, lightweight and fun is what this movie is!",Chappie
367,Jacobhemphill96,"Excellent Sci-Fi picture, I don't get the harsh reviews",8,16 March 2015,"My expectations for Chappie were relatively high going in and the movie did not disappoint. As a huge science fiction fan, I loved this movie. The action was excellent, the characters were good, the setting was interesting and it was just an all around good film. The character of Chappie is in a way lovable. You don't want to see him die or hurt and you feel for him. He's just an all around lovable character. Dev Patel's Deon is a good character, he's sorta this mastermind who creates all the robots. Hugh Jackman as the villain works very well and he is such a bastard you just wanna see him get the hell kicked out of him which he does. Ninja and Yolandi were pretty much OK they were very hard to understand at times and i'm really not a fan of Die Antwoord but from what i saw from them they did OK.

I do not like the thugs. one who looks like an old man and trying to be young by talking and walking like he is 19. The woman who is trying to look like an Asian Barbie. The producers should have gotten kids to play the roles. The one who fits in the movie is the Latino guy. He is just himself. The character is a thug. The music is bad.

372,JayShermanStinksYoooooo1920,Poorly executed...,4,7 March 2015,"District 9 is a great movie. It kick started Neill Blomkamp's career as a movie director. His second effort, Elysium wasn't good. Chappie could be the movie that will ruin Blomkamp's career. I really wouldn't like that to happen since he's a young and creative filmmaker. Chappie was a movie with potential and I was really excited for it. Sadly, it was bad.The film is about a near future there much off the crimes in Johannesburg are taken care off by police droids. The story focuses mainly on Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), the creator off police droids who's currently working on a robot with the ability to think and feel. This is a very interesting concept that's quickly ruined when the robot (Chappie) is stolen by a gang that teaches him how to organize crimes instead of stopping them. This is where the movie should have taken another path, I really don't understand what Blomkamp was thinking.A movie that with a similar plot to films like Bicentennial Man and I Robot (two great films by the way) turns into a mess. The main character's week gets worse when his competitor Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) tries to take away everything that's important to him. What a poorly executed film this is. The idea is interesting although it isn't original, but the whole part with Chappie being raised by gangsters is just terrible. The movie did have some jokes that sadly didn't save it. Action fans should still have a great time though. This movie is full off guns. Sadly Chappie isn't clever in any way like District 9 and almost becomes Transformers in the last act. I really hope Neill Blomkamp can get his stuff together and make a great movie. Without Michael Bay explosions and poor character introductions.",Chappie
373,RCD1321,"3rd outing for Blomkamp, and it's just as bad as the others.",1,9 June 2015,"If the underlying plot for District 9 was a preachy message about immigration, and Elysium had the hidden meaning of ""Capitalism=bad"", then Chappie has the meaning of....? Seriously, it made no sense. What, that Hugh Jackman is the only good actor in this film? It felt like a 120 min commercial for the awful and unknown (for good reason) SA rap group ""Die Antwoord."" The plot is contrived, about a robot who becomes self-aware (except lord we needed Sara Conner to eliminate him!) and befriends a pair of thugs. Really, that's about it. It was barely watchable and it was only by sheer force that I was able to actually finish it. I guess you could say the underlying meaning was humanity is only skin deep? I don't know, honestly, because Blomkamp is that bad of a director. If I didn't like District 9, and I hated Elysium, then what comes after hate as this is the worst of the three? Seriously, this is a totally missable movie and thus proving that Blomkamp should just quit now, while he's still behind but not buried.",Chappie
374,DreadfulA,All that in a usb drive,5,20 September 2015,"I was looking forward to Chappie, because I liked District 9, and also Elysium was OK. From the beginning it was obvious, that Blomkamp has ran out of ideas. Cinematography was very similar to District 9, and the whole corporate bad guy/good guy setting was familiar from another movie. You might have guessed it already what I mean. Even the robot designs were ripoffs, ""Moose"" being the gargantuan ED-209 from Robocop with huge arsenal. Only difference was that Moose wasn't an autonomous robot, whereas Scouts and Chappie were pure AI.Talk about sophisticated AI, Chappie, even considering being ""a baby"", was incredibly stupid and didn't seem to have it's own mind and reasoning, until the very end where he still behaved illogical. He believed everything the bad guys told him, and didn't understand why those kids were carrying weapons and what could they do with them. Instead Chappie repeatedly asked why are they throwing things at him.Chappie's voice actor was unbelievably annoying. Didn't like the overuse of gangsta accent. Think he could have sounded more civilized and pronounced, even though he was ""educated"" under the influence of thugs. More robotic voice would have more suitable and believable. Now he sounded like a retard with that high pitched whining, reminding me of JarJar Binks.Die Antwoord was also quite annoying, mind alone that their music sucks, but also because the movie was overtly promoting their ""music"". Talk about commercial mind controlling that has been a subject in scifi for decades. Now I might believe it to be real.Don't even start me with the whole knifing thing. As if stabbing a living tissue wouldn't do any damage to a person. If Chappie knows he's a robot and made of metal and virtually unbreakable, a man made of flesh is just the opposite and should seem vulnerable in comparison.When scouts were out of the game, where were the police? I mean humans? There was quite an effective squad early in the movie fighting alongside the scouts. I guess they raised their hands and called it the day. Like ""f-this"". Nice.When Deon was shot, why didn't they drive to a nearest hospital but instead tried to save him by transferring his mind into a robot? Seems too far fetched. I would have probably wanted to die rather than live inside a robot body. Who knows. I still quite enjoyed the ending. I saw the twist coming, but welcomed it.The effects were quite incredible, but props like computers seemed dated. The scouts had a very simple motherboard (with usb port!) and a single micro chip designed to run the basic programming, but wouldn't a revolutionary, self-conscious AI need a supercomputer or quantum computer and loads of memory to run it effectively? Someone here mentioned, that the program code was being run in DOS, like in old 80's computers. For Example Linux today is a text-based user interface that has many versions of graphical user interfaces on top of it, but for everyday user text mode is pretty much optional and invisible. But when you compile you run it in text mode, like Deon did when he compiled the AI. In my opinion it was a refreshing detail compared to the usual Hollywood computer interface with all the flashy 3D and transparency effects which makes a system look poorly optimized and resource hungry. Although, Deon processed the code very quickly considering he used a cheapo laptop and mentioned earlier that he had terabytes of data to compile. Wow! Even better, when Chappie had to serial link those PS4s, I was laughing. They are probably still using Pentium processors in the ghetto. Poor Chappie.In the end I'm mainly puzzled by one thing: all that was in a usb drive. You would think a big corporation (or Deon) would use a more sophisticated technology than a physical, consumer class external drive. There weren't even a backup. What if it dies? That's it, then? Seems risky.Too bad we've come to this in sci-fi, where filmmakers use common technology and don't push the limits of our imagination. The famous GPS display in Robocop was back then far more impressive technology than usb drive is now, even though the display was just a plastic board with a blinking led-light in it.",Chappie

Following massive and unanimous favorable reviews of District 9 (deserved,it's a debut masterpiece) Neill couldn't handle the pressure or didn't have more talent and creativity to directing another masterpiece (or just a good movie) and the result was Elysium, a film with great special effects but insipid and unexciting. Getting to Chappie, a razzie worthy movie this director shows that is no Spielberg, Kubrick or Tarantino, he's just a great one movie director, hardly he will make another masterpiece and even good movies (maybe he can make one or two). I don't even want to write a lot about Chappie, the title is ridiculous, the voice of the robot is ridiculous,the bad guys (who turn good guys) are all stupid and infantile..Dev Patel is a failure as actor (he's just bad all the way in all movies), Sigourney is old and has almost a cameo,Hugh Jackman, not being great can be the less mediocre.

The writer did not know about the real possibilities of AI, what it showed it is not possible. The robot moves as a human, (man it may have motors, not legs) The message is wrong, there are not a clear division about good and bad, and bad is a good a good (It is this movie backed from drug dealers?) The plot it is complete ludicrous, (a gangster don't let a wiseness go -twice-) The plot is only a way to justify a ludicrous belief, that you can 'copy' conciseness, forgot complete all the tradition about soul, or any other ancient belief (any belief,except the one of Cyber Punk, that know nothing about science or history, but claim that they know how to rule the world- meaning, that it is a very adolescent message Shame that good actors participate in this kind of movie, a mix of Robocop (the first), and other great movie of science made 20 or 30 years ago.

And his parents (die antwoord) who try and teach him to help them in heists, and then there's his Indian creator who just wants him to paint and write poetry and so the film goes on until the robot and his creator, who ends up in a robot body run off into the horizon.Seriously this film could not be more ridiculous concept, I kept waiting and waiting, but no it kept it up until the end.Obviously this was meaningful to some viewers, but the only message that could be taken from this film is beware immature AI's.",Chappie

The acting form the members of ""Die Antwoord"" was pretty bad but didn't ruin the movie going experience at all.It was really cool to see how Chappie is affected by his interactions with different people.

It's a fairly well-made movie and a decent story, so I expect plenty of people will like it more than I did, but I thought it was a bit lacking in substance. I really liked district 9 and expected more. I know an hour and a half isn't much time, but it's development certainly felt rushed to me, even for a theme you've seen in sci-fi 100 times before (""What is consciousness? What is it to be human?"") Hugh Jackman is an odd choice as the protagonist (and seriously, what is that haircut?). The story is very oversimplified, the ending feels contrived, I'm not really sure why Sigourney Weaver is in this movie and Dev Patel was better in Slumdog Millionaire. Yolandi from Die Antwoord wasn't great, but better than I thought she'd be. Ninja wasn't as good, but did fine. Their compatriot was as good a stereotype as any (although the way they folded the band's images, logos and music into their characters was odd and distracting, especially to people who know them from it.)Overall, not what I wanted it to be, but some people loved it.

It just felt like a mess of illogical elements and plot holes not to mention how it can't decide in what it wants to be.Having watched Short Circuit as a kid, I saw many elements return in Chappie: a rather naive but friendly robot who becomes self-aware and his creator wants to protect and raise him. Yes, Short Circuit was a kids movie.And then comes the Robocop reference: police robot CHECK. Rival inventor who hates the police robot CHECK. Big corporation that only cares about money CHECK. Giant tank-on-legs robot that got turned down for being too big and violent: CHECK. Lots of violence, shooting and brutal deaths: CHECK.That is my main beef with the movie: it tries to be kids movie and an action movie for adults at the same time and it fails at creating a coherent result. The whole part where the punks kinda become the good guys doesn't really work either.What makes it worse, are the many many plot holes and flaws: - The punks kidnap him, get him to build a prototype robot with AI and then go ""bye bye, you're free to go. I'm sure you won't call the police on us!"". Yeah, I'm sure criminals love getting people they kidnapped go after showing him where they live ...The whole point of the movie was how they can't switch robots off so they needed the help of Chappie. Except Vincent (the inventor of that giant robot) DOES have a weapon (that uses EMP I assume) that turns off Chappie in no time. Why just not steal one of those then? heck, why are they trying to sell those big robots to the police when this would clearly be far better suited for the military?why does the movie say you need the master dongle to upgrade robots manually as protections only for them to show it's possible to do it wirelessly later in the movie? heck: why did it take THREE days for the company to realize the dongle was gone? And why isn't there better security at the company?why take Deon to the company instead of a hospital? He wasn't shot in a vital area so why let him die? It seems a lazy excuse to turn him into a robotThere's so many flaws that were introduced just to move the plot forward - and it wouldn't have taken that much work to fix those flaws either.In the end it's not a terrible movie - if you can switch off the critical part of your brain - but even if you do that, the movie is just too uneven, too big a mess of different ideas, to work.

The robot has a terrible cape coloured gangster accent, the gang members from Die Antwoord, look terrible and sound worse. Dev Patel is insanely boring, and Hugh Jackman worse. Sigourney Weaver looks bored and tired. Hell she was far more alive when running from Aliens than sitting in her office listening to Dev and the gang.

There isn't even a clear good or bad guy.In an age where Hollywood seems to be completely out of ideas this feels fresh and unique. I rather watch this than the lame superhero movies that Hollywood keeps churning out.What is really clever about Chappie is that you actually start to feel for the little robot. You see him grow as a person. The human actors don't steal the show. Chappie does!

As artificial as we like to pretend a self aware robot would be it is shown in this film to be nothing like what we would expect. its not on/off its on and on and so forth. like an avalanche of human emotions and values tested. we as humans have had 4 million years to come to terms with being self aware, Chappie had seconds and the impact was dramatic. how he strove forward and became the being he did is a journey of courage and if I can say humanity. he is us, the love, hate and remorse. I was deeply touched by this film, to the point now that I look to the day when I meet my first self aware artificial life form with some trepidation and angst. You can't hide from Chappie, you are either his friend or his enemy. he will decide because he will judge your actions not your CV or your face book page. so remember this, please watch this film, I don't care who you are watch this film today and be ready cause Chappie in some incarnation is coming and we as humans need to learn to be a little more human so we will know who we really are when those come that might just be our better.",Chappie

Let me just start by saying when this movie was announced I was stoked to see it, Then the following trailers got me even more excited, but before actually watching it because I was impatient to see it. I watched and read a couple of reviews about the film online, which actually kind of killed my excitement for the movie, lets just say they weren't too positive. So going into this film I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised.The CGI in this movie is amazing Chappie does 100% feel like a human character (yes I know he is a robot) but i genuinely felt for his character, you want him to succeed. The direction of the film is great the cinematography of the film is brilliant and honestly puts you in the city the events are taking place in.The only negative I felt in the film is the casting of Chappies Mom and Dad. At times they were tedious and could be aggravating but as the story moves on you do feel for the characters and the annoyance of them does fade away. 3 amazing actors support all this.

I genuinely felt sad for Chappie when this happened. Loved Hugh Jackman's character especially.The action: Nothing too special, but pretty great.

392,ivica83,"Not a masterpiece, but an entertaining blockbuster full of character",7,14 March 2015,"Chappie is a sci-fi action film set in Johannesburg, South Africa, that works really well despite some obvious flaws that many critics have really taken to heart. Let me explain.First, the milieu is authentic, and not just your generic Hollywood slums (see Elysium or Real Steel for the nearest comparison). The Zef design as implemented by Die Antwoord adds the film a ton of character and detail (pink-colored guns, mouth-watering graffiti), and the slang is so rich that certain characters need subtitles. Someone claimed that the film felt like a long video for Die Antwoord, and yes, in a sense it is, since their music is present throughout, and their characters are glorified, but I don't consider it a bad thing at all. Ninja and Yolandi Visser may not be great actors but they are fun and embody so much background influences (Aphex Twin tattoos, Tank Girl, kawaii, industrial punk, Lol from Shane Meadows' This Is England and Atari Teenage Riot, to name a few) that I would watch a film that is based on them alone just to see what it would look like. I mean, how many films are there in which a major character wear Pink Floyd shorts in it? And did I forget to say that some Die Antwoord portions are genuinely funny? Second, Chappie works. The special effects are seamless - his presence feels 100% physical throughout. Sharlto Copley's voice work is spot on as well, giving soul to the metal and wires, which is very important in order to buy Chappie as truly sentient. By the end of the film, one does not think of Chappie as a robot or someone's creation but as a being of its own. OK, the writing makes Chappie evolve faster than expected (growing from a baby to a scientist that can codify consciousness in matter of days might be too much) but the alternative would be to stretch the film's budget and runtime so this is pure trade-off. The idea is there: Chappie, mommy, daddy, the Maker, and the Evil World in which dog eats dog.Third, the AI and the codification of consciousness make the film relevant as we close in on as a humankind to the point where AI will be a reality. This film takes on this idea as a neat sublimation of previous films (including recent endeavors such as Transcendence), and pulls it forward towards a vision of future society in which mankind could go on to exist forever in a non-organic form while keeping the capability to reproduce by creating new AIs in their own image. I like that - a continuation of this particular story could be interesting.Fourth, the action parts of the film are a blast. Hugh Jackman as the main villain sells the character in every scene he is in. His character might be a single-note one, as some have complained, but in the end you really root for Chappie when he breaks every bone in Hugh's body.And yes, Chappie is a flawed film: 1. It seems to be too easy to abuse the security key and too hard for the Maker to take it back from Chappie in the early portion of the film; 2. Weaver's character makes no sense at all when she rejects AI (so what if they sell weapons? diversification and more patents NEVER hurt anyone) or allows the Moose to be used (it should be ILLEGAL to use it without proper council authority). But so what? Chappie is a genre film, which means that the ideas themselves are more important than certain aspects of traditional story-telling. Ultimately, there are so many things, big and small, that cover for these flaws.To conclude, Neill Blomkamp was always going to have problems to get out of the shadow of District 9. But he continued to make sci-fi action films with heavy doses of cyberpunk and in this sense, he should be appreciated for the torch-bearer he is. And Chappie is a strong argument in his favor.",Chappie
393,terryshilo,I really thought it might get better,2,28 July 2015,"There was great atmosphere, talent, CGI and graphics in general. The story could have made sense, it did not. I think the best acting was Dev Patel and the actor that bought ""Chappie"" alive. High ratings and fairly positive IMDb user reviews.. what could be wrong. The ENTIRETY of the media this is stored on. Majorly disappointed. Overall I trust IMDd contributors and am not usually led astray. I must be missing something to be so at odds with the majority here. Why the level of celebrity was utilized in such a shockingly bad venture must certainly have been done for the respect they had with a ranking executive, simply for the paycheck or a favor they owed the producer/director for a past job they've been chosen for. If not, I have no idea why they chose this script/project. Chappie isn't a film that a majority of parents would allow for very young audience due to violence, language and it's visual reference to language throughout. It's somewhat limited to an older teen to twenty something audience and this might be why I didn't find it worth the two hours I watched it. Though it does have some comedic value, it's not a comedic film. I have become ever more interested in Sci Fi and this tag might have been what pulled me in. The genre is certainly enjoying a high point lately continuing on the large screen as well as extremely good programming on the small screen.",Chappie

395,lainemoeke,Thee worst movie I've ever seen Jackman in and Weaver,1,17 May 2015,What the hell am I missing...this is the worst movie I've seen in a long while...good actors but a 'b' grade movie at best...couldn't watch it past 38 minutes it was that bad!! Did they get paid big bucks to make a bad movie...this can only be the reason for this trash. I will definitely think twice before I ever watch a movie with Jackman and Weaver in it again! My advice for people out there don't waste your money going to see it because you will just be asking for it back by the end of it or by the first 30 mins. Such a huge disappointment.

It looks and feels like a family movie for most of it, except that it makes you feel awful all the time because everything is going wrong. At least give me half a movie of happy times so I feel good for a while before you crush my heart or something. And then suddenly violence explodes across the screen... So I guess it's not a family movie? Which means it's even worse than I thought because if it's not that then what was it trying to be? Not enough Sci-fy or action or violence or feel-good to be anything... And simply not good enough to simply ""be"". Haven been so puzzled about a movie in a long time. I can't say in all fairness that it's bad... but at the same time I think it's a mess.",Chappie
397,samlynn12,Funny and Emotional,9,9 April 2015,"I really enjoyed this film. I had been excited about seeing it since I first saw the trailer, but was concerned it would not live up to my expectations after seeing some harsh reviews on it. I was extremely pleased to find these ungrounded (in my opinion). AI is something that interests me greatly, and I found the way that it was dealt with here was fantastic. It portrayed brilliantly both how unprepared humanity is for another form of significant intelligence in our lives, but also how it doesn't have to be the terrifying thing that many people believe it could become, if tackled with an open mind. The portrayal of Chappie made him seem extremely 'human', and the actors around him also produced stand-out performances. The film also showed the dangers of not properly controlling how AI is introduced into society (if and when it is discovered), and the vulnerability of the beings that we are bringing into the world to outside influences. The 'childhood' scenes with Chappie were definitely my favourite, as they brilliantly showcased this. I did not know that Die Antwoord were in the film (I actually didn't know who they were outside of 'those people who did Enter the Ninja'), so perhaps went in with more of an open mind than people who appeared to have judged the film just because they were in it. I loved their characters. They are both funny and terrifyingly weird at times, and I this really made the film the enjoyable experience it was, for me at least. I can see how some people may not have liked them in the movie however, especially if they dislike their music. If you are into your sci-fi, this definitely deserves a watch, as it is an interesting, and hugely entertaining, take on AI and what it could do to the world.",Chappie

399,tine-bresan,World stupidest AI robot,5,3 June 2015,"This movie didn't left me with bad feeling, but not a good one also. Movie had just too many plot holes, lack of common sense and logic, inconsistent acting etc.Main actors weren't horrible but they surely lack acting skills. Especially the main guy (Ninja). At the beginning he was some selfish psycho and in the end he was like prepared to die for others. He was just too inconsistent with acting and it disturbed me.The main female actor (Yolanda or something) was better but still not impressed.The biggest problem to me was the robot itself. I understand that Chappie was learning like a child and maybe because he got that accent, but he was just one stupid robot. He learned to read and speak very fast, but after that his progress stopped. He could get all the information about everything from internet in seconds (and he did at one point) but he was just as stupid. Even the way he talked was of someone of young age with poor English skills. His maker told him to not do anything illegal but the believed that he can put people to sleep with throwing knives at them? That's just incredibly stupid for a robot who can learn at great speed. Just too many things wrong with him for me to be able to like him.The main character (the Chappie maker) is also not without its flaws. He's so smart that he programmed some stupid home robots. He worked at some company where he was responsible for its success and profit. But he worked in a cube like every other losers. That company didn't do anything else than sell his robots. And employees were apparently able to leave work at any time without telling anyone. They could just sit up and go and nobody said anything. I see why some people love this move, but it's too flawed to be a great movie. If you like watching realistic movies with consistent plot and acting, this isn't for you.",Chappie

The writing was not terrible, but not amazing. The story line, per the substory, was bland. The main story was great.I think my issue is that critics have no clue. The focus on a movie's short comings, finding things to critique rather than giving it an unbiased once through, then a 2nd view for reviewI suppose that is why critics have it at a 4.1 and normal people, such as you and I, have it at a 7.2Critics just have no clue. I understand Ninja and Yolandi..were NOT the best choices for support characters and Yolandi's voice is....like nails on chalk board and Ninja's over-acting makes you want to face palm at times, HOWEVER, that seems to be what critics are focusing on. Those 2 and the sub story.That's too bad, really. The movie was great and well worth the watch and rewatch.I gave it an 7 BECAUSE of the 3 issues mentioned above. Poor sub plot, over acting and a voice to stab your eyes out over. The other positive 7 aspects comes from the writing as well as the acting on Sharllto, the main story line progression and the fact the movie was not rushed, where any other directed would have tried to cram more in.It surpasses Avengers 2 in entertainment.",Chappie

Chappie even have 3 parents and formed bonds with them which later will make the audience cry when in the end the ""mama"" was shoot (albeit resurrected later in robotic form). I rolled my eyes when Chappie said ""Why human do this?"" *chuckled* Dear Chappie, your consciousness is human; you talk and walk like human and you are even dumber than human.

I can live with a half-hearted story, I can bear boring characters that act without logic to a certain degree, but what was served in Chappie was way past anything acceptable. I read some of the newer reviews here, and there are an awful lot that say the same thing: don't let the bad reviews fool you, it is *much* better than they say. I can only draw one conclusion from this: that a lot of real people told their real opinion of this crap, and the studio thought: oh well, we can't let that stand like this - let's get some good reviews up on the net. And the PR machinery was set in motion. If you are burdened with an IQ over 90, you will be painfully underwhelmed by the absence of any inner logic to this movie. Everybody, and especially Crappie, is acting totally unbelievable. The story is such a sorry mess of unrelated pieces of plot, thrown together without any regard to human dignity, it really is tough to explain.

It feels that the movie was made for 14-year old, for audience that wouldn't question any episode. It's totally fine to make silly movies, but you cannot do it half-way – then it's neither serious, nor hilarious. ""Chappie"" is half-silly, half-realistic, making it very boring.

Other themes include corporate greed, and the question of sentience. What would life look like with more AI? Are we creeping into a reality of having more convenience using robotics?

When given a worthless, heartless and useless script, even good actors can fail miserably in getting the audience to feel for them and connect with the movie. Name me a movie where Jackman was as wasted as this? The lead actors were one-dimensional and wasted in their roles, and the South African actors themselves felt like parodies, the acting was so over the top and laughable.Don't even get me started on Shitelo Copley. This man has, in my view, ruined every movie he's been in after District 9, bar 'The A Team', which isn't saying much. He's taken it to new heights in this flick, ruining a movie without actually being seen in the thing! His over the top, manic, whining, thick as mud South African accent had me cringing throughout. In all honesty, I was thinking if I'd made Chappie the robot, I would have taken my flash drive and put Revo uninstaller on it for a one time hard-drive scrubbing mission.Wow, so bad you'd probably have to be under 15 (either age or IQ, take your pick)to rate it higher than 5.

Robots just hangin around spare. Spare parts easily accessible and only one key on usb to control all the robots and when it goes walkies with the developer no one bats an eyelid!I read of on set troubles between bloomkamp and ninja. Possibly this is what led to such an outrageously bad film. Perhaps he just gave up and threw it together to get it out of the way. Who knows.

I'll admit, perhaps my high expectations have somewhat clouded my opinion of Chappie because District 9 set the bar so high. However, that doesn't change the fact that I had to watch Chappie in bits and pieces over the course of 2 weeks because every time I decided to give it another chance, within a few minutes there was a scene which was so implausible, or badly written, or poorly acted that I was forced to hit the stop button again. That pattern continued for the first 1 hour 30 minutes, playing a few minutes, stopping, then resuming a few days later. The first three quarters are just littered with problems, including mediocre acting, implausible scenarios, poor scripting and questionable casting. The robot CGI is excellent though from start to finish. But I was relieved to find that there came a point when the movie actually improved significantly. The last 30 minutes we have a pick up of pace and the show closes very well indeed so overall it was worth persisting and finally reaching the end (although I did ask myself several times whether I would ever get there).

413,Everything_PopCulture,The most underrated film in a long time. CHAPPiE is incredible,8,12 March 2015,"CHAPPiE is perhaps the most underrated film in the last few years. Rotten Tomatoes says that the film has a roughly (often changing) 28%-30% approval rating. Metacritic gives it a 40/100 and Roger Ebbert gave it a 1/4 stars.......DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE CRITICS as they obviously cannot see brilliance when it is shown in the cinema right in front of their eyes. Let's begin this positive review of the incredible film that is CHAPPiE. Starting with.The Story CHAPPiE is set in Johannesburg where the police force there have resorted to buying robots that can combat the threat of illegal activity in the city. When one robot is seemingly destroyed, creator of the robots, Deon, takes the robot home and imports an AI program into it (which he has been working on for years) and it creates Chappie! Suddenly Chappie falls into the hands of criminals who try to teach Chappie how to be 'bad' in order for the criminals to pay back their boss while Beon struggles to teach Chappie to be good.The story in this film is pretty basic, but when you break it down to all its themes, motivations, symbolism, politics and character development, it is incredible. The tale of Chappie struggling to differentiate the good from the bad in the world is done so brilliantly and overall the story is fun to watch.The characters. I'm not going to talk about all the characters, but I will talk about the three that hit me the most. Chappie, Deon (Dav Patel) and Yolandi (played by and named after the African rapper).Chappie is an incredible character. We are instantly pulled into his story as he comes to life and doesn't know who he is or what's going on. He is in a sense a baby, new to the world. His journey of learning is beautiful as you dwell closer to him as a character every time he learns something knew and dread what he could do when he learns something bad. Sharlto Copley's performance is fantastic, offering an emotional aspect to a non human element. Dav Patel brilliantly portrayed Deon as the engineer who is trying to lead Chappie on a good path but is ultimately caught between the games of the criminals trying to persuade Chappie to do bad. Yolandi was a surprise character. For a new actress, she did very well at bringing out Chappie's motherly figure. I'll not say more, just go to the cinemas and see the performance for yourself.Themes and PoliticsThe overall themes in this film are so cleverly hidden in the entire story that you walk out knowing that you witnessed genius. The knowledge of good and evil, the journey of a child growing up, sacrifice, heroism, the ultimate realisation that sometimes in order to do good you might need to do something bad. The themes in this film, as to be expected from Neill Blomkamp, were carefully and wonderfully placed.The Direction and CinematographyCritics obviously don't recognise a brilliant director when he's obviously there. Neill Blomkamp is THE biggest new director (by new I mean his career is only kicking off). The direction in this film was great, with Neill effectively bringing out the all in the actors. The cinematography was brilliant as well, with cinematic and rich shots that leave you glued to the screen. With three films now under his belt, all of which I love, Neill is a brilliant director who should definitely get the chance to make so much more. Needless to say I am super keen for his ALIEN film.ConclusionCHAPPiE is a rich film, incredible to say the least and not to mention HIGHLY ORIGINAL (which leads me to believe critics no longer like original films). While District 9 is still my favourite of Blomkamp's films, CHAPPiE easily comes in at second, beating Elysium which I really loved. The performances were great, the direction was superb and overall this is an incredibly UNDERRATED FILM!!!!!!! Go and see CHAPPiE and know that this film deserved so much more than what the so called critics gave it. CHAPPiE is the reason why I go to the cinemas.PS. The setup for CHAPPiE sequels is REALLY AWESOME!!!! I hope we get another CHAPPiE!",Chappie
414,TheLastBaronW,Blomkamp's Best By Far,10,12 March 2015,"What's not to like? Probably much of the unwarranted (mainly American) criticism of this film is because it is a) too intelligent for many people (mostly Americans), b) has an innate and sophisticated sense of humor that is way above the heads of many, and c) it is shot in South Africa (which most Americans cannot relate to). Hugh Jackman as an evil villain is well-cast, as is Dev Patel as the successful inventor of a series of titanium-clad police robots designed to face South Africa's truly brutal crime scene. Sigourney Weaver is the ""tough broad"" CEO of the company producing the robots. All is right in the world, the robots are a success until Dev Patel develops software to make a sentient robot and Hugh Jackman, driven by jealousy because his gigantic annihilator prototype killing- machine (which looks very much like a tarted up copy of the giant killer droid in 1987's RoboCop) is not being pursued by the company. Jackman's character implants a virus into the working droids, they shut down, violence ensues.Leading up to Jackman's truly villainous actions, desperate to try his software that makes robots sentient, Dev Patel steals a robot due for destruction to upload his program to as a test. Before he can get to it, both he and the test robot are kidnapped by some wonderfully comical gangsters looking for the ""remote controls"" to shut off all the police bots.Patel is forced to upload his program to the test robot, No. 22 played wonderfully by Sharlto Copley; it works and the robot begins to ""grow up"" - first as a baby in some comical scenes, then to adulthood. Along the way, Patel gives him a sort of moral code. The criminals who have kidnapped the robot go to very comical measures to overcome these new morals with some wonderful trickery and some truly marvelous dialog and scenes.Suffice it to say that in the end, the good guys win. Plenty of shoot-em-up scenes, brutal blood and guts moments, violence, but not all of it is completely gratuitous, especially if you know South Africa or have lived there (as I have) and know how nasty and truly evil criminals there can be. (They can easily match the most brutal the USA has ever seen or has to offer).Are there plot holes? A few minor inconsistencies, but no major ones. The graphics are excellent, the sense of humor is evident throughout, and some of the performances are truly memorable. Sigourney Weaver's hysterical head-over-heels exit from her robot manufacturing plant in the face of total catastrophe is comical in the extreme.Even though there is a lot of violence which may be why some are panning this marvelous romp, it is a story with a wonderful moral ending (good triumphs over evil) and some really excellent entertainment along the way. Go see it! Let yourself like it, enjoy the ride and if you have a working brain, you'll love this film!",Chappie
415,omnimog,The Black Sheep,4,3 March 2015,"Many people have some unconditional love for certain directors. Well, so do I. But that doesn't mean that it should be near completely impossible to approach new material from said director on a somewhat critical level. District 9 was one of my favorite film released after 2000, and still is . I just saw a screening of Chappie in Oslo yesterday, and, I'm sorry to say though, but Chappie was literally the stupidest film that I've seen since the 80s. I get the analogies to real-world politics and current situations in Blomkamps movies, and I admire him for trying to incorporate just that. It worked slick as hell in District 9, failed a bit flat in Elysium. But in Chappie, there really is no end to the logical flaws, extremely underdeveloped characters, rushed, fairytale of an excuse of a storyline to push events in the movie forward etc. I study anthropology myself, and the questions of ethics, racial/social discrimination and problematization of basic human nature that Blomkamp raises are always very intriguing to me. Unfortunately nothing works out in those areas in Chappie.The relationships that Chappie himself develop with the other characters was quite interesting, but the movie played out more unbelievable than any Dolph Lundgren flick from the 80s. I admit that it could be me failing to see the tongue-in-cheek action-homage here. And I should note that a lot of people in the cinema applauded at the end. But it should also be noted that a lot of the people in the cinema had quite a few beers, I suppose. I had great expectations on the philosophical questions to be raised in Asimov's spirit, and looked forward to a few laughs, and some great action in between. I had a few laughs for sure, but besides that, I thought it was genuinely bad, if not abysmal.",Chappie

The notion of AI they try to pass off here is sort of what you might expect if you asked a 5-year old to describe how it might work.

417,ahbindare,Sad portrayal of a a Sci-Fi Robot.,4,18 March 2015,"I am a fan of District 9, but this movie was so far from what was implied by the Movie Trailers, I wasn't sure I was in the right theater. True, it was an afternoon showing, but there was a total of only six people in the audience (I think a couple of these were Theater Employees) this should have been a clue. There were too many absurd and ""over the top"" action scenes, Combined with a very loud and distracting ""Rap"" soundtrack and it's Rambo VS. The Alien frenzy. On the up-side, there was a story line that seemed to have some early promise, but was quickly overshadowed by CHAPPIE, the floppy eared Lego/Stitch styled Robocop, and its band of, well, lunatics that didn't portray any common sense. Actor Dev Patel played a good role and added the only quality to this sad and somewhat comedic film. The camera work and CGI were good, but couldn't really do much to lift this film above a ""B"" movie at best. In my opinion this movie escalates ""WALL-E"" to near greatness in comparison.",Chappie
418,mollyjatkinson,It's Okay,6,14 March 2015,"This movie is okay. It is not nearly as bad as some of the reviews I have read in the papers and weekly magazines (or online movie reviews by critics) but it is also not as good as some of the glowing reviews I have been reading here on IMDb, written by ""real people"" who've seen the film.Chappie is about a robot (in the future, robots are used to fight crime) who is being raised in South Africa by a gang. The robot of course becomes sentient and has to figure out what kind of robot it's going to be.There's a lot of big screen action, some comic relief, and it's got the touching robot/human/emotional turmoil moments you would expect but it actually pulls off a lot of the heartfelt moments. It's worth seeing but for robot/crime movies I prefer RoboCop and for heartwarming robot/alien movies I think District 9 was much better.",Chappie
419,AmbushBug26,"Emotional, Entertaining, but has it's Flaws",8,13 March 2015,"I'm honestly shocked how much the critics just seemed to hate this film. It's a far better improvement over Elysium and even though District 9 had the better story, I felt that Chappie was a far more emotional film. I'll admit, I shed a manly tear for that robot. Something I didn't even do for the aliens in District 9.I don't think I'd call the film original, cause a lot of what the film does has been done before. But at least the film does try to do those things well. You can certainly feel that Neill Blomkamp tried his hardest to make this a good film, he didn't set out to be cheap or just rob people of their money. An A for Effort has to be awarded in that aspect.Sharlto Copley pretty much carries this film when it comes to the actors. He captures the childlike innocence and utilizes the motion capture almost to perfection. Chappie's purity and the emotional struggle of discovering and observing the pros and cons of being alive make him an engaging and likable character.Too bad the rest of the cast wasn't like that. Hugh Jackman is pretty standard as the bad guy, although his final pounding from Chappie was certainly a satisfactory experience. So if it was fun watching the hero beat him to near death, he must have done something right to make us hate the character. Dev Patel is okay, but doesn't do much outside of act as the father fighting for custody of his own creation. Sigourney Weaver has only two scenes, she's pretty much only in the film because it's a science fiction film.This is also the acting debut of Ninja and Yolandi Visser. Yolandi does an okay job as the mother figure, and she's cute enough that you don't mind watching her. But Ninja was just mediocre. He wasn't likable, his character was more annoying than entertaining and the only time I liked him was when the film made fun of him by having Chappie act like him by ""being cool"". I get that Chappie's ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" is supposed to act as the angel and devil on his shoulder throughout the film, and comment on human upbringing. But I felt they could have done that with better actors and characters.On the whole, I enjoyed the film. It was sad, it was funny, it was action packed, the special effects were fantastic for a low budget. It doesn't really do anything new and with the exception of Chappie, there isn't really any other engaging characters to follow. But the film does at least attempt to be something more.8 out of 10.",Chappie
420,TDeMona,A missed opportunity,4,13 March 2015,"It's astonishing, how so many good, workable and clever ideas, interesting moments and a huge number of well done scenes can, in the end, amount to such an infantile and meaningless whole.Let's start with the good bits: Our main characters are just the kind of people I happen to like - even though if these mister and madame from Die Antwood -musical group aren't exactly natural born actors. But they portray immoral bastards, whose doings are still a pleasure to follow. Even their character arcs are not quite so boring and immediately obvious as some of the other characters'.Especially this young Yo-Land is favorable to the eye with her bizarre hair cuts and clothes. Maybe this is part of some South-African exoticness. The whole Johannesburgian underworld - over the top even as it is here portrayed - is a rather virginal element for filmmakers to use.Also, as per typical to the director, the movie is a visual feast. Even though I support practical effects, it is a clever work of art when you honestly can't differentiate between existing props and a computer generated simulation. Also visual story telling and the over all design of this in all it's pop artsy visual misery is a lovely thing to see, indeed.About the other actors: Hugh Jackman is for once in a not-quite-so-horrible film, and fits well into a role of a complete prick. I wouldn't protest of seeing him again portraying a complete bastard. The creator of the robotic A.I is a rather uninteresting dweeb, who has immediately all the symptoms of a god complex kicking inside his skull. Not that those really amount to much in the end. Sigorney Weaver plays the big shoe in a technology company, but her character is forgotten long before the end. It is still pleasurable to see her in a role, that isn't completely based on the premise of ""Remember, I was in that Alien movie once upon a time, wink wink"".Then to the stupid stuff. Why, oh why in the name of Jesus Christ's white testicle does every movie featuring a moral choice need to take the whole point away from itself with the most over used, idiotic, annoying and predictable way possible - by making the morally neutral source promise it won't kill people? God be damned, when I go to see an R-rated movie about robots, I expect to see people made into minced meat.Those moronic, down right retarded moral quandaries that our technological protagonist is left with are just as glued on and annoying as can be imagined. And seen billions of times made as many times better. In terms of action, this movie is as PG-13 as is humanly possible.The film is rated R because couple of swear words used a bunch of times and some characters smoke. That's it. And as good things as both of those are, and as pleasurable it is to see Yo-Landi suck on a big cigar, I think it tells you more about the sadness of our times than it does of the movie being ""daring"", that that is what gives it the R-rating.And when they have no guts to show people being splotched, they stole ED-209 straight from RoboCop to fight our main robot. This is as interesting and captivating as me sitting in the floor of my room banging two TransFormers -action figures together for 90 minutes.Where are the exploding innards? Where the chopped, gutted and mutilated pedestrians? Showing those was no problem in Distric 9, the earlier work of our director. This movie would have given ample opportunity to play a little, and imagine the real moral choices our main character would have to make, when he would have already done some real damage without really thinking about it.The main point is, the R-rating in a movie such as this amounts to false advertising, that someone should rightly be sued over.As said, the movie still has good ideas to spare. Seeing Chappie grow and learn is often funny and interesting. But even this would require some real resolution instead of obvious platitudes. Transhumanism is glossed over, yet no stance about it is taken.Plot holes are big enough to drive an oil tanker through, and the whole film ends in a imaginative brain fart. Those things could easily be excused, since they fit a sort of comic book -like, ""who cares"" -fun making. Or a Troma -film. But then you would need to also have guts to go balls-to-the-walls. You can't have your cake and eat it too: either make a genially cerebral, well thought out movie with something to say, or give us our primal human carnage. Now we live in an exploitation movie without any exploitative elements.I still wish this movie makes even some money, so that some day we might get a real, R-rated, big budget action adventure movie. The director Neil Blomkamp has obvious talent and vision, now is his time to gather his testicles from her mothers coin purse and get to work. Realzies, this time.",Chappie

422,visforhendrix23,'Chappie' finds beating heart in artificial intelligence,8,5 March 2015,"'Chappie' is a feature length Die Antwoord music video, and that's not a bad thing. The South African rap-rave group star as alternate reality version of themselves in director Neill Blomkamp's third feature, and influence nearly every aspect of the film's production. Their songs blast through the movie, they tattoo the robot Chappie with various spray-painted images from their discography, and etch illustrations in the background of numerous locations. The casting choice is a risk that Sony remarkably allowed – casting two musicians with relatively scant prior acting experience in a big-budget blockbuster. It's these chances that makes 'Chappie' so special. It's a 21st century retelling of the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz, if the Tin Man was hip with current slang and wrote hilarious posts from a twitter account. The film opens in the slums of Johannesburg setting that Blomkamp previously utilized in his previous movies 'District 9' and 'Elysium'. The crime rate has plummeted since the police department deployed armed robots called Scouts. We follow the Scouts creator Deon (Dev Patel), a Red Bull chugging scientists who lives in a house cluttered with small android helpers, the interior of his home recalling the talking furniture in an episode of 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse'. After an insomniac night of research, Deon discovers the secrets to artificial intelligence, and delivers his findings to the company who manufactures the droids. His boss Michelle (Sigourney Weaver) rejects his proposals, and Deon sneaks out a damaged Scout without permission for experimentation. A radical competing engineer and former soldier Vincent (Hugh Jackman, sporting questionably high cargo shorts) campaigns for overkill security measures in the Moose, a murderous tank of a weapon operated by remote control. The creation is rejected, and a scorned Vincent is intent on sabotaging Deon. The robot is intercepted by Yo-Landi Visser and Ninja of Die Antwoord, who give him the name Chappie and train him for a heist to pay off a debt to a maniacal thug. Sharlto Copley performs the motion capture to perfection. Credit must be paid to the visual effects department, who detail Chappie's movements from naïve infancy to swaggering gangster outlaw. 'Chappie' journeys down paths reserved for ambitious independent and foreign films, resolving in an outlandish ending that leaves the possibility for a reported trilogy.",Chappie
423,iamXori,Surprisingly better than I expected.,7,9 September 2021,"So basically, I've nothing interesting to watch with, so I decided to watch Chappie instead since it came on cable TV. Well, looks like I got another surprisingly fun and amazing movie, again.First of all, this movie was not perfect, that's for sure. There are still a lot of things that can be improved, and some things that are just that bad. The ending gets me mixed response. For me, the ending for this movie feels so weird, even though it is the most happy and beautiful ending imaginable this movie ever got. But still, it's just, doesn't fit for some reason. There are many huge plot holes throughout the whole movie that while not very noticeable, but it will be very obvious if you know and think about it. The execution as a whole are pretty sloppy to be honest. It's like they rushed and the writers tries to fit a massive plot into 1 and a half hour movie, and it's a little bit noticeable that they rushed it pretty much. Pretty much the same case as ""perfect on paper, but not as expected on screen"". This movie needs atleast one sequel so that all the questions can be answered and many things can be explained slowly, but I guess it won't happened any time soon due to it's box office failure.However, there are still good things that needs to be note here. The plot, while it's not phenomenal, it's still great on it's own. A robot that can feel anything raised by the gangsters instead of the maker himself? Well, still makes sense to me. The main characters are pretty good, especially Chappie. Hugh Jackman did a great work portraying the bad guy that I forgot the name about. He is a bad guy, so bad that I really satisfied when he got killed by Chappie. Well he is not that dead actually. Few of the characters that is one-dimensional and pretty mediocre are valid for me. The VFX are wonderful to see. The movie has it's funny moments too. The moment when Chappie tries to steal ""daddy"" cars, yeah that's seriously hillarious.About the undeserved brutal reviews this movie got. I don't get why many people hate this movie so much, especially those brainless critics. Well, this movie is not like 'the best movie of the year' type, it's still not perfect like most of the blockbusters are. But it is a great movie and entertaining in my opinion, and I have fun watching it, which is a good sign. So, to conclude, if you want to watch this, go ahead. Atleast try to watch this for once.",Chappie

425,paul-heys-im,There's A New Guy In Town...His Name's Chappie,7,8 April 2016,"Chappie is a film that rewards multiple viewings. On the first occasion I saw it, I felt it was a step backward for director, Neill Blomkamp. But upon second viewing, I enjoyed it a whole lot more, and by the third time I saw it, I honestly feel it is a good film, and cannot understand the negative reviews. The film is a sort of mash up between Robocop and Short Circuit. I love both those films so this film was right up my ally. It deals with the same themes Robocop and S.C dealt with, back in their time. But with a modern twist. It's difficult to review this film without giving away the plot, but, what's most important is that, if you liked Blomkamp's previous films, District 9 and Elysium, then you should give Chappie a chance, too, as it's very similar in style and tone. After a few viewings, it really does grow on you. It's not the best film ever, by a long shot, but it's also far from being the worst, Promethues gets that accolade. The cast is great, Hugh Jackman gives a suitably creepy performance as an ex mercenary turned robot designer. As always, the star of the show, is Sharlto Copley who is the voice of Chappie, this time around. Chappie's dialogue is often funny, and considering he's a robot, elicits emotion from the audience. Sharlto is technically never on screen, but even so, he knocks it out of the park. Sigourney Weaver chews the scenery but is the least effective actor in this film. She's still great though. The CGI is perfect. The robots look real. And they interact on screen, very well. I know they will have used mocap suits and such but it's still very rare to get a film that does the CGI well, this one does. Suitably impressive is the Moose (the new Ed 209)and the fight scene between Chappie and the Moose is the highlight of the film. I could spend hours talking about how layered the film is, how well it deals with the themes of A.I, and humanity, and mortality etc, but instead of wasting your time telling you how great the film is, I will just tell you to go and rent it or buy it on DVD/Blu Ray. If you like robots, sci fi, or just enjoy a well written, well paced, well acted film, that touches on a wealth of important themes, then you'll like Chappie. Ignore the haters, this film is the best film of 2015 by far. It just takes a few viewings for it to find it's niche.",Chappie

Robots in the future aren't going to be using cheap voice synthesiser chips from the 1980s. Let that old trope die a natural death, please. It looks vaguely humanoid, so let's assume it will behave like a baby human. That's just dumb, trying to engage with a stupid audience.Sigourney Weaver turned up for a morning's filming to give us a character that went nowhere.Chappie could have been so much better. There's no doubt Blomkamp can handle visuals well, but his writing isn't great, and is starting to get quite repetitive.Will his next movie contain multiple implausible psychopaths and shoot-outs, I wonder, as these seem to be common themes with his writing.",Chappie

Though this film is fun, i can also be really sad. Since Chappie is just an extremely intelligent curious baby. He doesn't think there's any evil in the world so it really hits hard with some animal abuse themes when some teenage boys throw rocks at him, cut off his arm and set him on fire.This film is absolutely visually stunning. Chappie is some of the best motion capture work i've seen since Avatar. The studio really nailed it with the cg on this one. It gives me headaches just thinking about how they put those chains on a real person in a motion capture suit and somehow making it look real. Hats off to the cg studio.",Chappie
430,wpedmonson,It will not end up a classic merely because of its odd lack of depth in covering a common philosophical questions with a not so original depiction,4,7 March 2015,"The story is of a future not too far from now where in South Africa crime becomes nearly unbearable for an average police department to handle, so one company comes in with a talented young engineer (Dev Patel) who designs a set of robots that operate as an (almost) artificially intelligent set of police robots. Nothing new there. The interesting part of the plot comes when he creates the ""program"" for consciousness and self-awareness and puts it into one of the robots that was recently damaged from a firefight. The program of course works, however he's captured along with the robot by criminals who have come to hate these police robots, but get the idea to kidnap the guy who made the machines in order to gain an advantage against them. The problem is that the consciousness program he applies to the robot isn't one where you merely give orders and they do it, the change is that the robot now is basically like a child growing up and must be taught, and the criminals are now put in the position to ""raise"" Chappie to do what they want him to do, with mixed results. The strong point is the topic, and particularly the psychology of the self-aware robot. He's a child with ""parents"" in a sense who don't really want him and everyone else seems to put an agenda on the robot without recognizing his personhood (in varying degrees), thus objectifying him. These scenes are powerful and worth seeing. I found myself moved by the interaction of the criminal ""mother and father"" with Chappie. The father doesn't want him around and treats him poorly while the mother takes on a caregiver role but ""parents"" him with endearing ignorance of what's best for him. There's a natural adoption that happens from all sides, and there's a clear power to the depiction of Chappie's innocence and trust, especially after we see it broken like it was inevitably going to be. And most interesting are the scenes with the engineer, the ""maker"", and Chappie. He has a special love for Chappie that the robot senses and knows, and there are a few good scenes where they talk about that, loving and accepting love from his maker, that carry some weight. In a way the movie takes on big questions, creates characters, puts them together, and it does a decent job of showing us ourselves and the existential questions we carry. Hugh Jackman is possibly the most painful to watch and the most pigeon-holed of them all because of his obvious negative portrayal of ""right-wing religionists"" that reminded me of the villains in James Cameron's Avatar (2009) though in that portrayal there wasn't as much religious reference. It's like a stereotypical hawkish conservative that many on the left think is lying dormant in every person registered with the Republican Party. And they must do all they can to fight against them in order to prevent the destruction of society by the threat of imposed theocracy from the right. Another familiar trope is the often seen false dichotomy of the close-minded religious ideologue vs. the open-minded scientific one that dominates many conversations about religious and political discussion without examination. Jackman plays foil to the engineer (Patel) as this fanatical, militaristic, religious, narrow-minded beefcake that randomly references church and makes the sign of the cross here and there, and seems to cause all the problems due to his wrong-headedness. Religious symbolism exists in the movie, but watching it as a faithful Catholic is painful due to its ostensible attempt at being fair about it. The protagonists are not religious and this doesn't feel like a unintentional move on the writer's part. Several characters make the sign of the cross (male criminal who adopts Chappie genuflects before his rifle right as he's about to go on a heist, which to some extent I appreciate for its honesty because that's really what he worships) and it raises the nuisance of religious symbology without the next step of thinking on where those signs came from. Does it make sense that what the cross represents, a sign of sacrifice, love, and selflessness be done by a criminal to his rifle? Not really, which isn't exactly a thing that happens only in movies. The cross is used in all sorts of odd and perverse ways in movies and in real life. What come across though is a kind of lazy way of saying that this is what he worships while it could've been said in a much more indirect and clever way to say that we idolize things of this world over God. And as far as graphic violence and nudity, there's plenty of violence( and one very violent and graphic scene) but for the most part it's fairly tame compared to movies that want to show utterly depraved individuals that has become a kind of one-upmanship among filmmakers to make the darkest possible villiains (and heroes for that matter). The criminal couple, Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser are a South African couple that got started as a rap group and moved to the screen, and do a pretty good job of it. I was sold on the authenticity of their role in the film, and I loved the style they brought to the movie that felt like a Blade Runner and late 80s neon chic mashup. Their ""home"" was fascinating and great to watch, giving Chappie's ""nativity"" a genuine feel that worked. In the end, the movie doesn't deliver much more than a fun one-time viewing. It will not end up a classic merely because of its odd lack of depth in covering a common philosophical questions with a not so original depiction. The depiction of human development and depravity, as well as our relationship to our Maker are worth seeing, and fill in the gaps from an otherwise weak movie.",Chappie
431,andrew-659-152933,Pinocchio with an assault rifle,6,17 March 2015,"Chappie is the story of a reject police droid given consciousness by a brilliant but foolish cybernetics engineer working for an arms manufacturer that uses the honour system in place of internal security. In an improbably series of events the fast-learning droid with the mind of a child falls into the hands of a gang of drug dealing mature age arts students with a penchant for graffiti and pastel colours. Before long Chappie is at the centre of office politics turned urban warfare but manages to harness the power of product placement to make a breakthrough in the nature of consciousness, mind transference and resurrection. Chappie remains completely untroubled by the weighty implications of such matters instead preferring to leave room for a sequel.Ultimately it's good fun as long as you fight the urge to think about it.Looking back at his movies it's clear that Blomkamp is mostly interested in telling stories driven by emotion and visual impact. He's quite happy to shed logic and take any shortcuts to do this. This isn't that evident in District 9 but it makes Elysium and Chappie harder to swallow. The gritty settings look realistic but the plots don't. Once you give up on trying to have them make sense and think of them as fairy tales they're easier to enjoy. Certainly Chappie is more Pinocchio than Robocop.",Chappie

Director Blomkamp does not disappoint with another ""in your face , humans suck, the world sucks, life is ugly, spark of hope in the universe"" action drama suspense film. Hugh Hackman is brilliant as a departure from his usual bad boy hero or big softy tough guy. You will hate his freaking guts in this movie. The South African cast is phenomenal and the set is as good as District 9. The score was composed by Hans Zimmer. It is another gut busting score that will submerge you into the dirty nasty hopeless world of CHAPPiE.

Underneath the bullets and explosions is a solid story of the meaning of what life is and what it means.

435,joekanuck,Meh...,5,16 March 2015,"First, Chappie doesn't come close to breaking any new ground. It was the boring stepchild of Short Circuit and Robocop... both of which were infinitely better movies... better directing, acting and dialogue. The good; Chappie looked as real as any of the actors. The bad; Chappie was the best actor. If one or two actors are mediocre, I lay the blame on the actors. When all of the actors give wooden yet, ironically overacted performances, I blame the director...in this case, partly for his directing and partly for his odd casting choices and in this case, definitely for the dialogue. Even Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman, both of whom I usually like, struggled to fit into their roles. In the end, it almost looked like Neil Blomkamp was trying to make a sequel to the very good District 9, using earth bound robots instead of space faring aliens, but try as he might, he missed every mark he aimed at. I think he spent way too much time on the cgi and not nearly enough writing appropriate dialogue and directing the humans. This movie is exactly a 5... you will probably stick around until the end but you'll regret paying full price for it.

Just as amazing as the set pieces and the design of this world is, it lacks the same amount or even more in emotion, character development and connectivity, and all around story. the first twenty minutes or so you really connect with chappie, essentially he is a toddler and there is a scene where you really feel for him. they really capture this feeling of a lost kid and it was sad to watch this innocent being subjected to what life and survival is. This to me was the peak of emotional Connectivity with Any of the characters, I think the relationship between his maker, his. ""mom"" and his ""dad"" lacked a layer that made me end up not really caring about any of them. I think the tone of this film came off cartoony and its attempts at humour just didn't work. for example, while chappie's mom is reading a story to him about a black sheep the crowd in the theater was laughing like it was funny, while it is charming I honestly think this scene is meant to show a relationship between a mother and son, a mother explaining to her son why he's different than everyone else at that. All these relationships in the end are forgotten and I was just left thinking I should feel more for this character by the end of the film. This film really lacks a villain also, Hugh Jackman's character really does not serve a purpose I didn't care about this character in the end, all though they tried to display a man trying to better mankind, one of my favorite attributes of a villain, this character really was nothing more than a mustache twirling villain in the end. one positive about this film and a concept I really think Blomkamp really wanted to get across was the idea of consciousness and what makes us human. fear, love, relationships, these are the things that make up a soul, these are the things that make us who we are. I think if he had focused more on these concepts this could have been an awesome film, he hit the nail on the head the first 20-30 minutes then it just fell apart for me after that. I'm gonna give chappie a 5.5 out of 10. This was not a terrible movie but I was hoping for more. if your a fan of Elysium or district 9 I would recommend Chappie. If you are a fan of science fiction I would recommend this also. Thanks for reading!",Chappie
437,drskytower-13161,Ruined by a gangsta rap band I've never heard of...,2,16 February 2020,"I tried to like this movie, because it reminded me of Short Circuit, another military/war machine/police-robot-with-sentience plot line. Chappie's like Johnny Five, naive and innocent and charming, and Sharlto Copley's South African accent is hilarious coming out of that robot. The actor's mannerisms and quirks are in him too so instead of seeing a robot I see Sharlto Copley playing as the robot. The CGI is great! It beautifully captures the actor's movements and portrays them perfectly to the CGI robot. It's just about as good as Andy Sirkis/Gollum's animation!But this is ruined by that gangsta rap South African band... the way they're portrayed it's as though viewers the world over are expected to ""just know"" who these weirdo's are. The only thing I've learned is that they cannot act. They look like feral mutts... they look weird, talk weird, commit a bunch of crimes that epic fail badly until Chappie comes along... if they really are supposed to be gangstas they are the most inept gangstas on Earth. Turning an assault rifle sideways while you fire it does not make you a badass gangsta... it just makes you miss your target with pretty much the same ineptitude of the average Imperial Stormtrooper. Sigh.These lowlife weirdo wannabe's teach the robot how to beat up, stab and shoot people and we the audience is supposed to find this cute and charming. The plot is all over the place. Hugh Jackman builds a BFG killer robot and Chappie beats up Wolverine (yeah... right!). Lucky for him Wolverine has a beer gut, wears a too-small safari outfit and is out of shape. The haphazard plot, bad pacing and unlikable characters just turns this movie into a complete mess. I was so disappointed with its outcome!Chappie is overshadowed by that wannabe gangsta band... they get too much dialogue, too much screen time, too much action scenes and their motivation is beyond a joke. If they were removed and replaced with more sympathetic characters this movie would've worked.",Chappie
438,Ryoma-Nagare,A Flawed but visually stunning TransHumanism Picture,8,14 March 2015,"Got to watch this movie one week after its premier, cinema was empty, a shame because the movie might be flawed but was indeed interesting. Structured like a pixar movie, charting the development and coming of age of our robotic hero, will cause you cognitive dissonance. It will push your cutesy buttons and then rip them apart with a cold steel claw. You won't know how to feel, when CHAPPiE played wonderfully by Charito Copley, does some unmentionable things with the innocence of a child soldier, that knows that killing is bad, but wants to keep loyal.Visually Stunning the movie cost 49,000,000 usd, money well spent. Dev Patel was insufferable, and his character certainly hurts the movie. but the greatest problem is that there are basic structure errors in its narrative. Chapie is at times rebellious teenager, then goes back to innocent child. then goes into killer machine monster, then goes back to innocence, or teenager.Certainly try and watch it, because at least is fresh and earnest, certainly will put off hardcore violence fans with its cutesy moments, but if you are feeling tender be careful of the extreme violence.8/10 for me will still get it in bluray when it comes out.",Chappie
439,alainavalentine,Love at first watch,10,13 September 2021,I'm only reviewing this now after seeing it god only knows how many times. I saw it 3 times in theatres! I enjoy it every time I watch it.This movie has a depth that I wasn't expecting that shows through in Chappie's development and learning about life from start to finish. The cast is excellent.I hqppen to love South African culture and also Die Antwoord so a chance for me to see more of them and more of those beautiful South African accents was a joy. The soundtrack is full of their music and I would have bern VERY upset if it wasn't.The ending is awesome and a sequel would be much appreciated!,Chappie

Silly yes!, For Kids Yes, but please don't get distracted by the trailers, there is little action in this movie. I have no idea how could anyone give this movie more than 6 Stars out of 10. Hugh Jackman was seen in movie for like 5 minutes in the first 70 minutes. Then we got so irritated, we left. I agree i did not see the ending for this movie, but the movie kept on getting worst minute after minute testing our patience, making us believe that from that point the expectations can't go up. Please do not pay for this movie, and for gods sake don't go in IMAX to watch it. Such a waste of money.",Chappie
442,imdbisforme,I Cut Onions Throughout the Film,8,18 March 2018,"I saw this in the cinema and loved it. I recently purchased the DVD to watch again and it made me realise what a sappy person I've become in those 3 years. I had way too much pathos for the childlike kill bot, Chappie. Chappie (the film) highlights just how corrupt, self serving and downright cruel humans can be. The titanium bubba really wasn't shown much love throughout the film. So why watch it? Because Chappie is such an endearing, likeable character and his character arc is fascinating to watch; you get to see Hugh Jackman play a mullet wearing bully-boy who bandies about Australian idioms (which, as an Australian, we really don't say) with aplomb; robots- killer robots everywhere!I feel like if you've seen any of Neill Blomkamp's films you know what to expect. High tech, abused innocents and psychotic villains. It's just with Chappie, some of the psychotic villains show more compassion than those on the side of ""good"". I know why this film divides viewers. The acting isn't slick (but for me it adds to the realism) and the story isn't the most cohesive or believable- but hey- it's escapist sci-fi- not a bio-pic!Watch Chappie. It's a dystopian Aesop fable with heart. That we should all be as honest and decent as that flicky-eared assassin.",Chappie
443,landingwiz,On a Whole... A Fun Movie That Brings the LOL's,7,5 March 2015,"Just watched Chappie today, and before that I was reading a lot of negative reviews online.Well, I'm happy to say it's better than I expected and some of them 'critics' didn't seem to get it. One critic even said the movie was full of unlikable characters.He must be kidding, or unlikable himself. I found so many of the characters lovely each in their own way, from Chappie to ""the gang"" that raised him, and even his maker Deon.The acting was good all around, and even though there were parts that were awkwardly laughable (bedroom scene etc), I believe the director meant for them to be this way. Those who didn't get those parts would've probably found them cringe-worthy. Too bad for them though, because for those of us in the cinema who got it, these scenes brought the LOLs.The music was top-notch and what I felt carried the show. Not surprising since it was done by Hans Zimmer.If there are any cons, I would say that the movie did not reach its fullest potential when it could have - it was well headed in that direction. We're talking about Inception, Interstellar, Nolan'ish mind-blowing. However, it stopped short of reaching that level of awesomeness. I honestly think Nolan could have one-up and pulled it off in spectacular fashion.Still, Chappie is highly enjoyable and definitely worth catching in the cinema. Don't expect a serious dead-on-point movie like District 9, but a fun loving one that might warm your heart and put a smile on your face.",Chappie
444,keith-blowes,Awful,3,11 March 2015,"Don't bother. Watch Short Circuit instead. The plot is so thin you can see whats about to happen through the sheet, the subtitles are a joke, Chappie is annoying, The fight scenes aren't representative of anything resembling reality, I could not spot the oppression at all and there was only one character who seemed to think that giving life to a robot was a bad idea.There is never any doubt over who will and will not survive, the premise of copying someone's soul is horrendous (16 PS4's or a normal memory stick.......)Was dull, boring and ultimately I hated it",Chappie
445,bowmiyaofficial,"Wow. I LOVED this movie! I loved the story, I loved the cast, I loved the robots. It had me captivated from start to finish.",9,9 March 2015,"Chappie a no ordinary robot. Not only can he walk, talk, shoot, destroy and serve a purpose of law and order like his fellow species, Chappie has another form of intelligence. Chappie has the ability to ""feel"", he has emotion, he has a conscience. We witness Chappie from birth so it is a humorous yet endearing insight into behavioural psychology and parenthood. I was so intrigued at how Chappie's lovable personality developed as well as his advanced intelligence to code ""conscience"".Clearly fictional but it made me believe that we are not far off from a world of robots and if that was the case, it would be a better place with robots like Chappie! I award three arrows without a doubt!",Chappie

Sure;y they won't use the robot to (wild guess here) commit crimes! Wow, and this guy was supposed to be a ""genius"".Then we have the robbers. Oh look, now we are the good guys! Don't think badly of us even though we are all violent criminals! Root for us!

And not just the City, And highest paid actor but also parts of the story how someone is put in a position where he does not know or understand anything around him. But all in all it is a great movie. With a good ending, Although I find that the M.O.O.S.E which Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) tries to promote is a great waste of time. Since the only need for human controlled robots is a step backward from AI robots which can still be remotely controlled by humans except they don't need to control it action by action but only the key commands need to be given. And if the only reason you work in a company is to do a doomed project which has no hope of being mass produced since it is behind the technology which is already being produced. Either tell the guy to begin a new project or fire him. Stop giving him false hope till he does the crazy things like in the movie. But it is still a good movie which you should watch.",Chappie

449,Proactivity,"Extended music video for obscure SA rap group, with robots",4,13 March 2015,"You may (or may not) have heard of a South African rap group called Die Antwoord. The video for their song 'Enter the Ninja' did the rounds on internet around 2009, but since then they haven't they haven't troubled the mainstream music scene too much.If you are familiar with them, this movie will also feel familiar. It stars the two remaining members of Die Antwoord complete with their Die Antwoord stage names as their character names, it's set in Die Antwoord's home of South Africa, has Die Antwoord counter- culture stylisation throughout, and the soundtrack consists predominately of tracks by One Direction. Sorry - Die Antwoord.The whole movie is a Die Antwoord vanity project. It looks like 'Ninja' and 'Yolandi' rang up Neill Blomkamp and said ""hey - can we remake District 9 but with us as the lead characters?"". Sadly it's nowhere near as inventive or well executed as District 9 or Elysium.'Chappie' is a side project for his creator who works for a robot company, whose AI robots have been widely adopted by the police force. One of his colleagues has his his own bigger but less refined robot which hasn't been adopted by the police, and isn't finished because the threat detection system doesn't work. At no point does anyone, including the manager for both projects point out that they already have a functioning threat detection system in the fleet of autonomous robot police that they produce! Apparently in this company, innovations are owned by individual employees, who say ""ner ner, I'm not sharing"" rather than working together. This contrived plot hole breeds simmering resentment, in me and Hugh Wolverine.Chappie himself starts off as endearing and child-like. Instead of adding character depth by following his progress from fish out of water to pseudo-sentient life-form, he becomes the butt of a single running joke as they transform him into a pimped up rap gangsta.As Chappie doesn't have enough depth to sustain the whole film, the story becomes about the jealousy of the disgruntled Hugh Jackman, and descends into a grudge fight that's telegraphed from the start. From that point, you may as well be watching Iron Man. You may wish you were.",Chappie

I had no idea where the movie was going (that was a good thing).It has humor, and i was laughing quite a bit.
The movie has action, some drama, and also philosophical ideas about what life and consciousness actually is.
Hugh Jackman did a great job as a frustrated engineer!Also, the movements of Chappie were well done.

452,Bitoque,Don't be fooled!,2,7 March 2015,"I'm writing this as an admirer of District 9 and good cinema!Unfortunately, Chappie is neither. The film was actually so bad, that it became involuntary funny at points. The story is basically about ""what happens if you mix the 2 scripts of Short Circuit and Robocop, throw in Yolandi and Ninja from the group Die Antwoord and then turn it into one of the most misguided films of the last 5 years""...or even more. The story is so thin, it should have been made into a short film and maybe it wouldn't have felt as forced. The characters are ALL 2 dimensional, besides Yolandi and Ninja who just play their stage characters anyway. The only actor actually trying is Hugh Jackman, but even he is helpless against sloppy writing. The film has some funny parts, a lot of involuntary funny parts - basically every time Chappie opens his mouth - and the worst character in the whole film is played by Dev Patel. He seems to be the protagonist at first, then gets written out of the script, just to return at the end. His lines to Chappie are by far some of the worst/ funniest lines of dialog in ANY film. For the first 5-10 mins. the film actually felt, as if it was going somewhere - besides the blatant Robocop rip-off, including a 1:1 replica of ED209 - is this still a reference or did they just not give a damnß - but then it was obvious that this patient couldn't be helped. And I think its here that lies my harshest criticism - they didn't even try this time. When reading the script, someone must have said: ""this is bad"". During filming, someone must have involuntarily laughed at the dialog - but even if both of this didn't happen: someone in the editing room must have told Bloomkamp that this is just really, really bad filmmaking. But they released it anyway, as if they thought, they'll eat anything nowadays. Well, the cinema in Berlin on a Friday night was not even half full - which is very bad, considering the film just started this week. Apparently you can fool some people some of the time,... I only give it 2 stars, as I did laugh a lot at this mess and therefore wasn't bored - but we all felt a little more stupid coming out of the screening. Again, as Bloomkamp did make the brilliant District 9 a few years ago, there might still be hope that maybe one of these days he'll get it right again - but that's what we kept saying about M. Night Shyamalan, right?",Chappie
453,sansupercool,text saying copying consciousness should be moving consciousness,9,31 May 2015,"Nice movie, worth watching and its more than entertainment . Whenever shown copying consciousness, it should be moving consciousness since it was a data file.Now that it was shown copying it means they left a copy of Mom, Maker, and Chappie somewhere to create multiple copies.Also when they transfer consciousness with filename named like that what difference would it make, it could be any file name or format, instead it should have been some filename not easy to trace what it may contain. naming a file like that is invitation to curious eyes to seek in whats in it.",Chappie
454,witneyl,So disappointing,1,13 July 2015,"I am sad to say that this was movie scores the worst movie I watched in 2015! Not even sure where to begin. The story had a potential, but it just was not wrapped properly. Reminds of Robocop so much, it makes this movie a total drag to watch. Although both Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman are great actors, nothing could save this movie, not even their great performance, which was the only thing that wasn't hurting! The rest of the cast is absolutely dreadful. Whoever wrote the lines did not really put any heart, or brain for that matter into the lines. And even worse the actors delivered these awful lines in a horrific manner. The two rappers, well, sorry, but they cannot act or sing for that matter. So basically it is just one huge disappointment of a movie 2 hours I lost and truly sorry I spent it on this movie",Chappie
455,silentbogo-1337,Simply put - it is beautifully stupid,3,20 May 2015,"I believe this movie only solidifies my concrete statement that 21st century is an age of pointless cinema. Most of the plot in Chappie either fails to follow common human logic, or completely breaks it. This is a modern trend of over- dramatizing the events by making ""shit happen"" in the literal meaning of this phrase.It all starts in a not-too distant future with an international corporation, based in SAR, which solved the problem of rising crime wave by introducing almost all-robotic police force.Then few things just happen:The lead researcher makes a breakthrough in AI development and asks company CEO to give him a broken robot for experiments. She ""politely"" refuses and desperate doc risks his impressive paycheck and reputation by stealing this piece of junk off the scrapyard.The rival former-military engineer fails to sell his combat machine (which for some reason looks like robot-chicken from robocop) and after another budget cut risks his not-so-impressive paycheck, but more solid reputation as pioneer in neural interfaces, to sabotage the whole ""scout"" operation and start a nationwide crime spreeA local gang with looks of early 90s inspired cyberpunk movies get into conflict situation with another dude. In order to solve this problem they need to find 20.000.000 moneys, so the only logical solution is to find a robot-maker and get a hypothetical OFF-switch, so it will be easier to do whatever crimes they've planned with their pumpkin heads.They bust the doctor, while he was driving a van with a stolen robot. After successful installation of new software they get a semi-intelligent gansta-ninja robot filled with curiosity, deep understanding of neural interfaces and human consciousness, but lacking the basic knowledge of trauma, pain and death (even with internet connection).The end result: all robots are broken, everyone is dead. After lots of shooting and the final boss battle Chappie revives the doctor and his mama as robots. Credits start rolling, so are my strained eyes...Gave it 3/10 for visuals. Everything else sucks. All the aspects of the movie that fans claim to be unique and innovative have been meticulously copied from many other(even recent) sci-fi titles with no sign of shame or remorse.",Chappie
456,Kirk09,This film will have the same fate as Blade Runner,10,14 March 2015,"In regards of all the bad buzz around this misunderstood film, in my opinion, this film will become a classic in several years and will be rediscovered when hitting Blu Ray market. I cannot find a logical explanation for this weak performance at BO other than bad marketing strategy from Sony Pictures who did not target a particular audience, giving the wrong impression that Chappie was a reboot of Short Circuit (which was not of course). This is definitely a punk science-fiction fairytale for adult and not a feel good movie for kids. I really think that Chappie will gain respect along the years. The same fate happened in 1982 when Blade Runner hit the theaters. I remember seeing it and disliking it (unklike Chappie which I liked instantly) a lot. But with the years and multiple viewing, people started to get the Genius in the film. Same thing with Kubrick's movies. Every time critics dismissed his films and every time they became classics on the long run. Take a look at his last film, eyes wide shut which actually is in the process of becoming a classic. This film had been scrapped by critics at the time. I cannot think of another fate for this marvelous tale that is Chappie.",Chappie
457,scasey,"I've seen it twice now, and it was even more affecting the second time",8,25 January 2016,"The first time I watched it I missed the first 10 minutes, and halfway through I really didn't know what I was watching. Sci-fi? Action? Comedy? By the end I knew that it had affected me, hugely, permanently. And that it was a masterpiece. Not in the cold way that say, Apocalypse Now presents itself as a masterpiece. I mean in its utter humanity. It's so open to giving that it doesn't care at any point if its (invisible to me, anyway) flaws are exposed. It bravely expresses itself even if it ""could"" be taken differently than intended, and easily ridiculed by those indifferent to it. Just like the lead actors themselves and the characters they play - they're beyond committed here. Some of the characters undergo a transformation in the movie, some are a gift to humankind from the get go. I haven't been able to get out my head the quality and emotional depth of the performance from the person who plays Mommy. On my second viewing I knew who the new-to-me two leads were, those after the well-known Dev Patel and Sharlto Copley. Throughout that second viewing some of the set design and a bit of the costumes used sometimes were there and could have reminded me who those two people were, and taken me out of the movie. And it didn't matter at all, even if I saw it it didn't distract me from the movie. Thinking of all the bad reviews this movie gets, I was going to say something mildly critical about the associated reviewers, but Chappie wouldn't do that, so I won't, either.",Chappie
458,betterthenyou,Every SCI-FI cliché,3,15 March 2015,"We start off the film with Vincent Moore portrayed by Hugh Jackman and his attention seeking mullet in an interview with them discussing Artificial Intelligence and how it can be too unpredictable but when we see the efficient heartless robots acting very effectively against the Criminals you immediately think the movie is going to take the side with the moral dilemma of how machines need to be without human emotions in order to best serve humanity as was clearly demonstrated within the first 15 minutes of the film.The machines without artificial intelligence act with clarity turning the police force into a lazy obsolete institution and since the criminals are running scared as is very clear within the first few scenes with Chappie's interactions with the criminals that they are in dread of these machines meaning the machines are the true alternative to the police so the question arises why changes a system that isn't broken? After the Interview the begrudged Hugh Jackman begins to show contempt for Dean Wilson portrayed by Dev Patel when in a conversation with Michelle Bradley portrayed by the Sci Fi queen herself Sigourney Weaver who was more or less in this picture to give credence to the notion that this is a Science fiction film and she only turned up to say a few lines so she is practically nothing more than a Sci-Fi token from a former era when the title Science Fiction actually meant something instead of the usual storyboard CGI/noise fest we get today.Once our hero Deon Wilson portrayed by the poorly talented and miscast Dev Patel discovers the solution to the perfect Artificial intelligence and therefore 'consciousness' which I use lightly which will become apparent for anyone who has seen this film. Dean Wilson then transfers Chappie's consciousness on a broken Robot once he has been turned down by Sci-Fi's beloved Ripley due to the half imagined excuse of, ""insurance and red tape...you know how it is"" I don't think the writers were even trying with that line or even cared.Dean Wilson kidnaps the badly damaged robot and takes it out for a spin to who knows where. Ninja portrayed by Ninja comes up with an idea to help Yo-Landi portrayed by Yolandi (not very creative names) to escape and pay 'The King'/'Hippo' portrayed by Brandon Auret who I have to add was a lot of fun watching. Ninja thinks of a plan to turn off robots with a Remote Control and that becomes the motivation and exposition to their role within the movie because why not? Ninja and the gang kidnap Dean Wilson and force him to switch off the robots but if they watched TV which they clearly have they would know that the robots could not be switched off as it says in the News Report within the first minute of the film. They then come up with the second best thing of getting the robot to do the heist for them to which the Robot starts out at the intelligence of an Infant and grows and prospers into the endearing personality of a street thug who commits crimes and kills people within an inch of their life.The story goes back and forth between them teaching a 5 years old how to say one word after another and by the way that is exactly as exciting as it sounds to Hugh Jackman getting more embittered with each scene and Wall-e/Chappie learning how to stab people and kill...I mean put them to sleep because they are tired from a long day of watching the grindingly slow scenes within the film.After a very long list of sub plots from Hugh Jackman stealing a chip that leads nowhere to switching off the Robot Armed Forces in effect and Crappie discovering what 'real life' is like and how dangerous it is. The climax draws to a close with Hugh Jackman making things hell on earth to such an extent Ripley finally decides to give the orders to destroy Chappie with the 'Armageddon' machine that gets destroyed with one sticky grenade and blinded with 2 bullets, Hippo comes looking for Ninja and the gang which leads to the ultimate climax with Hugh Jackman's machine getting destroyed and then Hugh Jackman and the very 'unforgettable' and 'important' Yankie (Amerika) gets ripped in two and without any slow motion or another word spoken by any other of his friends at all for the rest of the film he is gone and that's that I suppose. You'll always be in our dreams 'extra' character.Everyone one of the Ninja gang dies except for Loving father(sarcasm). Mother and the creator gets their minds transferred into robots and they all live happily ever after ending the film with some Anima song.The moral of the Story? No idea. If you're a bad person doing bad things good things will happen and you will have loads of fun doing it.The message of the story? No Idea. We should all become robots? Was this film any good or rememberable? not really.Is this film worth seeing? Not really. If you've seen the 1980's Sci-Fi films you've seen this story told better.The film is clearly reminiscent of Number 5 from Short Circuit just without the quality.",Chappie

Thanks.....I was really looking forward to this movie coming out. I am both a huge fan of Neill Blomkamp and of Die Antwoord as well (much to my daughters disgust!) so had real high hopes for this film.Then, unfortunately, I watched the film. I am a little bit stuck here because there are parts of the film I really like, especially the Peter Weller voice on the scouts, and the filming and the visuals are all top notch. My problem is with the characters and I will explain why.Sigourney Weaver - Did nothing in the few scenes she was in. Amazing actress given NOTHING to do in this film, and I know it was a sweetener for her to be in his next movie but what a waste in the end.Dev Patel - Very good actor who will get better with age, but does anyone else think that the geek character was a bit OTT? He is working for an arms company, and can just help himself to stuff. He can not only crack an AI problem on his home computer, but then at the same time, steal a robot with no-one questioning him or searching his vehicle, letting himself in to a secure compound to steal the one and only security key, getting kidnapped by the criminals and then AFTER they let him go and DON'T kill him, he is then able to come and go as he pleases without anyone noticing. Does he not have a clock in card like millions of other employees. Surely someone must have noticed him coming back and forth and not being at his desk.Hugh Jackman - What was he meant to be? Disgruntled employee or comic book villain as he didn't really get to be either. As for the easy manipulation of Sigourney Weaver, that was rubbish and the finale in The Moose, his robot was simply crap. A flying ED209 rip- off that got its metal butt handed to it on a plate in about 3 minutes. Unshielded cameras? Please!!Die Antwoord - What on earth possessed the director to hire these 2? Ninja was rubbish throughout the film and his total lack of acting skills was evident at all times. Yo-Landi was a bit more believable and had some sincere moments in the film. What irks me most is that the whole movie seemed to be a massive Die Antwoord music video. Zef was plastered everywhere. At every opportunity was there a music track of theirs playing in the background and at one point the camera even zoomed in on Ninja wearing a Die Antwoord vest. I didn't even realise there was a Hans Zimmer soundtrack till the end titles. I know they where all chums before the movie and had a massive falling out because of behaviour on set but someone must have thought that this may be a BAD idea...Chappie himself - The VFX of Chappie is amazing and the mo-cap performance of Sharlto Copley is outstanding and adds gravitas to the film. This is one of the redeeming features for me although I did find the whole Gangsta robot persona quite childish, and as for the use of PlayStation's and a couple of household fans to make a super Neural Net transfer computer, WTF.....Overall was let down by Chappie. I think the director needs to really go away and work his quite amazing talent on Alien and try and do something away from the South Africa that he obviously has affinity for, but I think he gets lost in the process. You never know, if his take on Alien next year is as good as we all hope it will be, he might have a genuine shot at making the Halo movie we all want.",Chappie
460,darragh608,Neill Blomkamp is a visionary and Chappie will get it's credit someday!,10,20 June 2015,"I rarely write reviews but this film has been dismissed by too many. It's original, exciting, reflective, funny and interesting. It's visually unique and the level of design is of higher caliber than anything else around. I'm a Science fiction fan and my favourite Sci- Fi's are: 1.Alien 2.Blade Runner 3.The Thing(1982) 4.Stalker(1979) 5.Donnie Darko Chappie is an evolution of District 9 and Elysium. It's a blend of ideas of Robocop, Blade Runner and something organic. It explores consciousness and ideas of morality. It's really cool and extremely funny. Ridley Scott didn't give Blompkamp his blessing to make another Alien for no reason. Cult classic, wait and see;) Indestructible gangster number one #CHAPPiE",Chappie
461,garvitnangia,A new touch and angle to AI! LOVED IT!!!,7,15 June 2015,"Neill, the maker of Chappie introduced a new spark and life not only in the script but also in the character. Throughout the film you are confused and want to help Chappie as he is a sweet child like character who is trying to learn new things. This is all together a different take and after delivering District 9 & Elysium this is a new, refreshing and interesting look to the AI technology. Sometimes movies does get over the top, but its a fiction and we can give cinematic liberty to the makers. A good touch making the robot almost human and keeping all the characters alive will definitely give chance for the second part. The thrill and flow of the story is fine but it is the character Chappie which or I should say who keeps you interested in the film. Overall!! A nice film and one should enjoy it. Just keep in mind what if this Chappie comes in real life, you will love it more. Hats off to the makers.!!!!",Chappie
462,kurtsinteff,Neill Blomkamp has done it...or has he?,7,7 March 2015,"To start, Neill Blomkamp is a fantastic director. But this movie could have been better than it was. This movie is about a program of robot police officers is unveiled in Johannesburg. The creator of the project, Deon Wilson has a project that he wants to test. Through a series of events he ends up creating this sentient being for two gangsters. This movie's theme has to deal with humanity being manipulators and being afraid of the unknown. The movie takes these topics and explains them extremely well. There is a scene where Chappie is dropped off in the middle of a bunch of street thugs. They begin to attack Chappie even though he has done no wrong to them. This scene captures the whole humans are afraid of the unknown and different. But this movie has a lot wrong with it as well. For example the movie focuses on the two gangsters and tries to make you feel bad for them by the end, even know they are completely unlikable characters. Also, I won't go into detail about the ending, but there was a point where the movie could of ended and it would have been great. But the movie continues for another scene or two and I feel it brought the ending down a bit. But, in the end this movie was another okay Neill Blomkamp movie with a story that was good but could have easily been better than it was. I give it a 7/10.",Chappie
463,frellebay-29-238690,"Not the Worst, but ...",5,9 April 2015,"I have to wonder if I'm overlooking something. Normally, the ratings here on IMDb are half way accurate for my viewing tastes. This film was definitely an exception. How it got a rating of 7+, I'll never know. Now, it doesn't rate in the worst film category, but there are enough flaws in it, both in acting and direction, that to me would keep it from being listed as anything other than mediocre. I'm not going to rehash the good and bad points. Those have been more than covered by the other reviewers here. In a way I got lucky by waiting until it hit the discount theater. I only paid $2.75 to see it, so I didn't feel utterly cheated. On reflection though, even that might have been too much. If you just need something to watch, and it doesn't cost you anything, I'd say go for it. At least under those conditions if you can't bring yourself to sit through the whole thing, all you lose is a little bit of time.",Chappie
464,tristanh-24900,A pleasant and intriguing watch,7,9 March 2018,"I was already familiar with some of Neil Blomkamp's work, namely District 9. Viewers of that film will recognize his style in the use of TV newsbits (featuring a very real Anderson Cooper segment) and documentary-style filmmaking to drive his point home. Yet what makes this film a standout is the way in which it portrays AI, making the experience seem almost relatable to that of fathering a baby. While the movie does take a few predictable turns, and the climax is stretched-out beyond belief, it is a decent piece of work and one that took me by surprise at a few moments. The amount of emotions the film conveys are surprising, given that the main character is supposed to be a robot, but we come to love and care for him nonetheless through his struggles in the slum. The actors do a terrific job of harnessing these emotions, and conveying all the ethical quandaries that one would have creating AI, but also raising a child. Dev Patel, as always, is fantastic. Hugh Jackman does a wonderful job of making an otherwise-unbelievable villain slightly more human, but the real spotlight goes to Ninja (south-african rapper who portrays a fictionalized version of himself in this film) and Yolandi Visser as Chappie's ""parents"", namely the thugs who try to give him an education. Their evolution as characters, particularly Ninja's, is fun to watch throughout the entire movie, and provides a redeeming storyline parallel to Chappie's own. Finally, Sharlto Copley steals the show as the title character, even if his role is essentially a voice one, by making us believe that Chappie's angsts are very real, and that yes, robots can have a soul. I must say Chappie's literal evolution as a character was pleasant to watch, and, while the action at the end was a bit overkill, it helped make this is a very decent film. While this movie helps to open a conversation about AI, don't trust this film to venture too far into it. Instead expect a fun, decent and intriguing sci-fi movie with a premise not-all-that unbelievable.",Chappie
465,freakspeely-74190,Not quite District 9 but well worth a watch,7,11 May 2020,"SPOILERS! -Another grouse film by Neill Blomkamp with Sharlto Comply proving again that he can move a viewer with a comedic performance. While I found the Ninja character terribly unlikable, even @ the end I did find myself invested, & saddened by the fate of his partners Yo-landi & Yankie (more so Yo-landi than Yankie).
I genuinely found myself caught up in the tension & suspence of a couple of the climactic moments.
While Hugh Jack man's stock villain is quite bland, Dev Patel's acting is believable, even if his characters actions are a bit frustrating @ times.
Exploring the idea of ""The Maker"" building a being ""just to die"" gives this bubblegum action movie a little more depth, giving the thoughtful viewer a chance for existentialist musing.
While certainly not a perfect film, largly borrowing the aesthetic of the superior 'District 9', Chappie is a very entertaining, turn your brain off film maintained my interest for the full runtime. I was surprised to see that the film was actually 2 hours long, the time flew by. Definately worth the investment.",Chappie

467,wdter,don't miss this film it's a gem,8,17 May 2015,"a genuinely underrated spectacular film, that is at it's heart the true spiritual successor to Blomkamp's classic debut full length feature District 9. After asking and answering the question of what is humanity in D9, Blomkamp now asks, equally succinctly, how precious is that humanity? He then precedes to give his answer to that question with bad ass robots and explosions and gangsters and gunfights and innocence and betrayal and love. Watch it, its well smart.more text to fill the the ten line minimum. why do i need to write at least ten lines? it's not like I want to fill my copy with loads of plot spoilers, i just want to tell people i saw a really good film that made me cry in one part that might fly under their radar. well i think i need a couple more lines of text so i may just wobble on about how much i now do not want to live in south Africa. seriously south Africa, i know that Blomkamp is one of your favourite sons (or should be at any rate) but you want him to make films somewhere else. he makes your country and your citizens look absolutely terrifying",Chappie
468,tyou32,These 7-10 star reviews are as fictional/unbelievable as the movie.,3,14 May 2015,"I can't believe all these 7-10 star reviews! Do they work for Blomkamp or something? Chappie started off pretty good. But it didn't take long for it to fall apart. Plot holes, disbelievable characters, and illogical decisions made by those characters abound. There are just too many to forgive. The gang's behavior is completely irrational...even for mindless thugs. They let Deon come and go to and from their hideout more than once when he could've easily ratted them out, especially if he'd been busted by his company. They just leaves Chappie alone in an unknown part of town to ""toughen him up."" In a logical world, he'd have wandered off, been picked up by authorities, Deon, or the company. And they'd have lost their great advantage in their upcoming ""heist"". No one's that stupid. For most of the movie, Daddy's character is a desperate souless, self-centered, mindless thug. But at the end, he's portrayed as a selfless loving, sensitive hero. So he's one of the good guys now??? Give me a break...This all-powerful Guard Key - I get that Deon couldn't retrieve it when Chappie was first activated, but he came back and could EASILY have retrieved it then. Also, if it's so one-of-a-kind, vital-to-company- operations and all-powerful, how on Earth is it not missed and under better guard???The riotous behavior of the public after the robots go down is totally unrealistic. Does Blomkamp want us to believe that without the police keeping us all in line, we human beings are nothing but a bunch of maniacs?And what's with Jackman (I don't remember his uninteresting character's name) and Daddy's characters making the sign of the cross before going into battle? Give me a break...Chappie is 100% uneducated. He believes that knife stabbings only induces sleep, he's only read one children's book. But somehow he has the technical expertise to operate, interface and use a neural helmet to upload a consciousness into computer hardware...which, I must ask, arrived at the gang's hideout HOW??? Give me yet another break.But the worst thing about this movie is that none of the characters are very likable, most of them not in the slightest. Even the ""good guys"", Chappie and Deon, are so inconsistent and disbelievable that it's difficult to root for them. The list goes on and on. This movie is terrible. How did the same guy who made District 9 make this jumbled disaster? 3 stars for the action scenes and FX. If you want to see a MUCH better movie about the problems, questions, risks and mysteries of humanity and Artificial Intelligence, check out Ex Machina.",Chappie
469,munirshan4,Chappie The Crappie,4,8 January 2016,"I saw the high rating on IMDb and gave this movie a shot. The trailer looked decent and reminded me of good action scenes in District 9. I wanted to leave while watching the movie so many times. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Chappie, the crappie, the robot, gains sentience. He can think for himself, though he starts out like a child that must be taught everything. This is the core of the movie. Clearly, the writers meant to create a sweet metaphor about the tribulations of growing up, but what they created was two hours of pure cinematic torture. The acting, plot, and action sequences were often cringe inducing, not to mention laughably illogical and ridiculous. I seriously can't imagine how anyone could enjoy this movie. The consciousness BS is also disturbingly shallow, but enough said. Some people watch sci-fi films for the CGI and special effects, instead of the ideas. If you're one of them, you may like this trash. Otherwise, stay away. Shame on you Neill Blomkamp. You let us down in many ways. Minus many stars for wasting, insulting exceptional talent. 4/10 only for amazing production values and CGI. Everything else is garbage, including the choice to have Chappie's AI ""learn"" in a totally absurd manner.",Chappie
470,franklinlapaz,the best of Neill so far in 2015 or the best film I've seen in 2015,10,6 March 2015,"I just finished watching this feature film in Clifton, New Jersey at an IMAX theater and I have to say it was so epic that it left some people crying because the main protagonist had so much passion and courage to think and to fight like a human being child. The tickets costs came out to $17.62 and was so worth it and I don't regret wasting my money into this film. I'm so happy that more movies like this is being produced this year and bringing back modern sic-fi features. Neill Blomkamp did an amazing job as a director and a screenwriter. When I saw Hans Zimmer at the end of the credits as a music composer, I was shocked, I said to myself, the soundtrack on this film was phenomenal. This film is the best hands down of the year, so far, even if it is still March, lol. I can't wait for another Neill Blomkamp film to be produced in the near future.",Chappie
471,goldencut,Questions are good,9,9 November 2015,"Like most good movies this one divides and polarizes the audience - it's often either 2/10 or 9/10. I think conservative viewers, those who like to like things they recognize and know give the film a low score, those who seek new perspectives to familiar but important issues give it a high score. Looking at the reviews and forum I couldn't find any substantiated complaints from those who gave it a low score, mostly it boiled down to that they couldn't categorize it, they felt it was alien, foreign etc. It seems these people can't take strong, aggressive foreign film that KIND of looks like a familiar Hollywood big budget action sci-fi but is not - it takes odd turns, untypical cast choices, familiar actors in strange roles and in story good guys aren't clean-cut good and likable and bad guys disgusting and just 'evil' ie maybe too realistic for their taste. Question of AI has been lately overused in films but it was just a small part of this film, not the central theme, IMO. To me the main theme was the duality of the world and human condition - we bring new, innocent, good beings to this world but the world is actually ugly and violent. We create life, children, because we feel the need and we can, but we don't think how much pain actually the child can and must go through in this world, and often we actually are the cause of the pain. It's the question - do I raise my child to be a good person or a ""survivor"", and what's the best way to actually do this, without damaging the child but also preparing it for life? By making my child ""tough"", a ""survivor"" I'm actually making this world a harsher, tougher place because the world, the reality stems from the norms and values of our children - the tougher we make our kids the tougher the world gets. We are taught that we must respect our parents as they gave us life, but there's also the responsibility of parents for bringing us to this world, this realm of pain, and to care for us and prepare us for it. There's also the question of taking responsibility for one's life and decisions at some point, when one becomes aware of this. Learning and choosing. Some others too.. I don't think anyone complained about technical aspects of this film - it was just stunning. I don't know what was CGI and what was not, it was so good that I totally forgot that Chappie wasn't actually real and was often probably CGI. CGI was so good it actually did its job - it let the story through and wasn't there on the pedestal to be amazed at like in so many big Hollywood productions. If you like sci-fi and action, but also want a film to ask some bigger, philosophical questions, and you are bored with overproduced and formulaic Hollywood stuff then this just might be a film for you.",Chappie
472,thempk,Watch Number 5 Lives instead (all of them),5,8 March 2015,"Everyone has a different taste and as such reviews need to be taken with a huge grain of salt. However, getting some insight into reviews before going to the movies is something I should do even more often as Chappie was in my opinion a big let down.The Good:-Outstanding visual effects ...and that's itThe Bad-Acting: really god awful, boring acting - I blame the script and their really lame/boring conversations. There was no tension at all, everything was flat -Plot: predictable to the very end, including who would die and who wouldn't (no spoilers here)Overall: I like the general idea of AI getting a life of their own and - for that matter - grasping the question what existence really means. However that last part, as philosophical as it should be, did not get a real impact on the movie. The movie itself seems to struggle strongly on what it really wants to be: drama? Action? Scifi? Only really good ones mix these together in a great movie that builds tension to the climaxing end - Chappie does not.Instead it flicks back and forth, shows as ""Techno Vikings"" and their ""Mad Max"" inspired crews ready to go all medieval on everything to make a buck - while a tiny other crew suddenly has a change of heart and become sorta heroes...after having shot, maimed, killed countless other human beings for money.Do NOT compare Chappie with District 9 - if at all take the flopped ""AI"" and add ""Number 5 lives"" - the latter is actually a lot better and worth watching instead of this piece of rusty crap.",Chappie
473,halldavidh,Mediocre film...Horrible ending!!!,5,7 March 2015,First off id like to state that this film was marketed entirely wrong. Up until the rating was released earlier this week i was convinced it was a kids film and im aware that many other people were as well. However i put that behind me and figured it may be better with a 15 rating...i was completely wrong. The movie was drawn out and badly scripted. Even with a 15 rating it still felt like a kids film with little violence and lots of childish attempts at humor. The only light at the end of the tunnel was Hugh Jackmans Performance as he played a great villain. The movie was bad...until the ending came. I wont spoil it for anyone but it was completely dire and utterly stupid. I really wouldn't recommend this film. I haven't seen any of Neil Blomkamps previous work but i certainly wont be going to any of his future films.,Chappie
474,jedilr,Don't watch the misleading trailers before watching the movie,10,28 March 2015,"This movie is not about saving the world or humanity, nor is it about a robot learning moral principles from a TV. It's more about what it is to be a conscious being among humans when one is not human itself. Blomkamp does an amazing job developing his characters and it's hard to not feel compassion for Chappie as he is dropped into the most unlikely place to grow up. He goes from being an uncertain child to a relatable hero, capable of making the tough, but right choice in face of danger.I think it is getting many bad reviews because many of the synopses and trailers that are used to market this movie make it look like a classic running-away-from-the-bad-villain-until-facing-him-in-the-end movie, but it's misleading. Instead you get deep subjects like existentialism, greed, vanity and fear which are mixed with entertaining and funny gangsterism and that really makes this movie.I gave this movie 10 out of 10, because this movie made me feel, think and laugh - it entertained me for the buck.",Chappie

So watch that instead. This film adds nothing. Characters are paper thin. It's story-driven but with a weak story. The bits about AI and Chappie getting his own consciousness isn't explored enough for it to be interesting.The music is good. It's Die Antwoord. So you can't go wrong there. It's pretty.

Chappie is a bumper car, not a porsche or a ferrari but why all the hate because of this. I know the 'R' rating limited the appeal as a family movie. Never the less the child in me still enjoyed being tricked into responding emotionally to Chappies awakening conciseness and dilemmas. When other characters are mean to Chappie it is actually emotionally effecting. So something in the film making process is well done or the movie would not have been able to generate this connection. Sorry 'haters' but I thought that the movie was fun. If you like Sci- Fi, Tolkien etc and your not an intellectual snob whose standards are way too high for everybody else meet then; if you have not lost the ability to experience child like joy and emotional responses, if you still have the ability to identify with innocence under threat, then I think you will enjoy it.",Chappie
481,meltdownmonk,Way better than I expected,9,28 November 2016,"I've been watching sci-fi movies since i was very young, and when i first saw the trailer for this, I expected it to be great. I waited to see reviews before checking it out, and the reviews were so harsh and bad, I skipped it completely. So, it's 2016 when I'm writing this review. Actually it's the year that Robots were deployed in the film. Anderson Cooper cameo. Awesome, still relevant! I looked at the metacritic and IMDb reviews, and knew something was off when the user rating and critic rating had such a huge discrepancy. It didn't totally miss it's audience. I really enjoyed District 9, though I did feel Elysium was not as strong. I was expecting Chappie to be much worse, but surprisingly, it was not. It felt like a South African spin on RoboCop, with some Transcendence (with better acting and special effects and and, pretty much everything about this movie is better than Transcendence). Complete with the dystopian/dark but still familiar contemporary society. Over the top gangs and villains, robot designs, some gore and plenty of violence. Lots of outdoor action scenes around cars, which seems to be something Neil Blomkamp likes to do. I felt like I was watching a tribute to RoboCop. I also felt like there was some Short Circuit in there.The Special effects were pretty incredible, and real enough to seamless fit in, and also cool enough to amaze and stand out when it needed to. The concept of a very fast learning child played out fairly well. As a parent, I've watched my son learn and pick up on language, facial expressions and phrases very quickly, and this aspect of Chappie's education really hit home for me. The connection between how his body feels and how human like he is though did require some suspension of disbelief. The little details: interfaces, computer tech, weapons, costumes, all great. 20 million heist gone wrong (at the beginning), language and accent mimicking, body language..Still some product placement (see, Windows, Vodafone, Sony VIAO, Playstation 4 (in a cluster!!), 2 of the lead actors are in a musical group... and plenty of cars.. The storytelling: never really an exposition, but all natural go with the flow story, although fairly fast paced, so the plot moved fast, and skipped over some of the plot-lines that would probably take longer to develop in the real world, and unfortunately this was noticeable. Hugh Jackman played a very angry and frustrated character, who descends into a bit of a mad rage, but I can imagine it being all pent up.Deon, very motivated, with vision, and challenges any naysayer (this trait he passes on to Chappie). Ninja, Amerika and Yo-landi - ridiculously poor influences on Chappie, who is a very fast learner, incredible intelligent, but very impressionable, and naive. This movie had Maker and Existence themes, Death, Human interaction and influence. The weakness of corporations (insider threats).

Really??? Ughhh! The over-sized creature makes its appearance several times throughout the movie, and each time I just had to look away.It was hilarious when Yolandi and the others are teaching Chappie how to speak and Yolandi keeps saying, ""Rat ... Rat ... Rattt...!!"" The scene was ridiculous and gross. Yes, Chappie learned that word all too well. For this and other reasons (well documented by other reviewers) I can only give a 1 Star rating.",Chappie

486,logadof,Where is my mind?,2,10 July 2015,"Where is my mind? I ask, when so many give this movie a positive review. Its truly amazing that a movie this bad can have this many good words said about it.I don't have a big issue with plots with holes as big the milky way. Neither have I problems with the product placement that's probably paid for the entire flick. What I DO have problems with is that every single character in a movie is completely illogical and I start to wonder if they are supposed to be humans or there is another layer to this movie that my mind can't comprehend. The characters are either plain stupid, illogical or have a mild case of schizophrenia (some characters have all three traits).Some examplesYo-Landi - Gangster that suddenly is not a gangster but a sweet girl and a mother figure, with no tendencies of violence and no trace of her hard street life living. Vincent - Ready to burn down an entire city to test a toy, without so much as an explanation. Deon - Why should i prove Vincent have set the world on fire, I can go and be useless someplace else instead. I only invented AI so i'm not smart enough to just go to the boss with proof and end this miserable movie. Ninja - Goes from human waste to hero without a single explanation. Michelle - The first AI is probably not worth any money. I make guns. Chist... said nobody ever.So why do i rate the movie a 4/10, the action is OK, the CGI is OK, and the music is excellent.I like Blomkamp's other movies, but this is not worth anyones time. Go see Mad Max: Fury Road instead. Thats a completely insane movie where every character(and prop) does make sense, in opposite to this! Or why not Short Circuit from 1986?",Chappie
487,tipoole,Good production value and talented actors wasted on B-category screenplay,4,25 April 2020,"Having just seen it for the first time, i wonder why did i bother.The only explanation that comes to mind for the existence of this movie is that at the moment it was made, Neill owed a considerable amount of money to either Tudor, Anri (ninja/yo-landi) or someone from their entourage and decided to take a plunge in his career to pay off his debt by making a Die Antwoord movie (cause thats what this actually is). if that would be the case, i find it mind-boggling that he got such a reasonable cast to get on board with this. Actually i wonder how they got on board anyway.
theres not much to say about the movie itself, the first 15-20 minutes seemed to promise another Neill Blomkamp blockbuster with ninja/yo-landi playing off their stage personas as best as they can (not much to expect there either), after-which it turns pretty fast into a cringe-fest by means of high-jacking what at first seemed to be an action packed Elysium sister/cousin and turning it into a childrens coming of age story/a promotional film for Die Antwoord.
the good - Sharlto Copleys performance
the bad - Die Antwoord/scriptBTW how is it that this gets 6.8 with some 10/10 reviews and Elysium gets 6.6?",Chappie
488,twiggy120,Stop reading this review and watch the film.,8,9 March 2015,"I'm not giving it a 9/10 to compensate for the negative reviews. That would make me a bad man and Chappie would not like that. If you removed the blood, violence, swearing and explosions this would be a successful Disney film that adults would make excuses to go and see. One of the Metacritic clicks, Roger Moore, gave this film 25 (out of 100) his excuse is that ""Chappie is a childish blend of the cute robot goofiness of ""Short Circuit,"" and the bloody-minded mayhem of ""Robocop."""" That is exactly why this film was great to watch. Surreal and violent, beautiful and funny. I'm not going to give away any plot details, this film benefits from an empty mind and the reason why it's not a 10/10The trailers will only give you an idea of who is acting in the film and what it looks like.

489,hollyholly,Failed by plot,4,12 February 2017,"Wow just watched Chappie, it looked AMAZING, pretty good dialogue, great FX, cool to see Ninja and Yolandi on the big screen, but what about that plot?? It was retarded, Short Circuit deals way better with similar themes and that's a blinking kids movie. OK Chappie started well but then all this mummy/daddy bollix got annoying. Instead of wasting so much time faffing, Jackman and Weaver could have been given space to make their characters less one- dimensional. By the end I didn't really care any more, as mentioned here on the message boards (RiP) it for sure would have been easier to hack a power source than transfer bodies.

The beginning had possibilities, but it went all down hill after that. I couldn't connect to the characters, nor was the story line very good and the movie dragged. It didn't hold my interest and in the end it felt like I watched a cheap elaborate video game for some kids. The language was horrible with the F bomb thrown throughout, even in the music at the end. What a huge waste of time and money. When are they ever going to make a GOOD Sci-Fi film that comes across as believable and holds your imagination?????

493,dylanr2015,A movie with potential....but it's up as a failure.,3,31 July 2015,"The movie reminds me a lot of the movie I, Robot with Will Smith. But it's far from being even close to that quality of movie. I would show that movie to some teens though. Chappie is not for anybody under 18-20. I loved the idea of Artificial Intelligence movies. I want to see more. They basically made Chappie into a thug though. His learning process as a true A.I. robot makes zero sense. He goes from being a child to having a complex mind within 3-4 days. A.I. does learn but that pace is illogical. Making him a child for 95% of the movie. Then suddenly in the last 30 minutes he's Einstein smart learning how to upload the internet to his brain basically. Second the thug characters make this movie worse. The story line of Hippo, Yo-landi, Yankie, and Ninja among all the others just bring this movie down. The plot of Chappie, his creator and the creator of the whole U.I. program Deon Wilson and the villainous character played by Hugh Jackman, Vincent Moore. Vincent Moore basically had created his own program of these giant two legged robots which are run by humans controlling them with these helmets that link to their minds. The only confusing part is they are run by human mind but he still has to sit in this chair and have this giant joystick to control his robots. If they lest the stupidity of the Gangsters and left it to Vincent Moore and his robot vs Deon Wilson and his robot army and Chappie this movie would be one of the best of all time. Yo-landi is just creepy and can't act period, Ninja just can't act and looks like an idiot through the whole movie. They make Ninja look smart by how he controls Chappie but at other times they make him look idiotic which again is illogical. Then Hippo is just an angry meathead. I don't see anything good coming from these three characters and their posse in the whole movie.",Chappie
494,andrednz,The problem with having expectations,7,11 July 2015,"LOTS OF SPOILER HERE. I'M SERIOUS.The plot. I expected more from the plot. It's a Swiss cheese...The company is filled with cameras, but with no security department... Therefore Sigourney Weaver has no clue whatsoever of what goes under her nose. And the feeling you get is that she went out of the city on business, because she only gets back at the end of the movie.Wolverine puts a gun against Slumdog Millionaire's face and none of their coworkers denounces the incident to their superiors (not to mention that everybody is OK with a guy carrying a gun in an office).Chappie is cool from the beginning about being a robot. Self awareness is really not an important issue to him (until he gets a Molotov cocktail on his back and, later, checks for damage). Chappie's learning progress must have caused lots of laughs to AI, robotics and pedagogy students.Chappie is stolen from Slumdog by Die Antwoord but nobody in the company misses the device. And neither carrying piled dead bodies nor uranium inside the van would matter to the security cabin men from the company.Chappie drains Wikipedia when he goes online before assaulting the armored car, but he still has no clue of what happens to the security men stabbed and hit by shurikens. Or about what and why is that red liquid oozing from their bodies.Wolverine finally brings ED 209 from Robocop back to life. You expect the bulky robot to go berserk and destroy the walls to get out of the building, but it takes of through a whole in the ceiling like a feather weight fairy.Consciousness transfer: Cool!Consciousness transfer helmet's electrodes (made for humans) working on Chappie's head: Not cool! It could have been a way better movie if the director had paid attention to these details IMHO. The premise is great, Chappie's CGI is flawlessly fantastic.

This south African director is back again with the movie chappie. The movie starts of very slowly. First half of the movie is pretty slow and kind of boring. Overall the movie was enjoyable but the movie is nothing new. We have seen that plot before. But the director managed to surprise me through out the movie. Very cleverly made movie but the plot is weak. It has its moments.but i am not a big fan of sci movie. Movie is really dumb in few parts. Ending of the movie is really good and innovative. It was like last minute header from Ramos. Hugh Jackman hasn't been utilised to the fullest. He was actually not required for this movie. Dev Patel was very ordinary. Other characters are not professional I think. Chappie's voice is good. This movie scores 66/100 for me. Thanks for the innovative ending.Watch it if you have nothing else to do.,Chappie
497,darkrai426,Severely underrated,8,30 June 2015,"I had mixed feelings when it came to Neill Blomkamp's third film before I even saw it. On one hand the concept and story, while far from original, looked very interesting in terms of execution, not to mention I liked the designs for the robots. On the other, however, the reviews made me hesitant. Were the trailers lying to me, and the audience and critics are right when they say this is a terrible movie? Or should I ignore both and watch it anyway to form my own opinion? In the end, I went with the latter and watched the movie on my own, and what did I think? I think that Chappie is the most underrated film of 2015, that's what. The special effects, set pieces, and the action sequences are amazing, and not once did I see pathetic CGI. Whenever Chappie, or the other robots were on screen, they were real. I saw real-life robotics wondering the streets of Johannesburg, South Africa, that's how convincing the effects are. With such a low budget, I'm still wondering how Mr. Blomkamp pulled this off. The acting should also get a mention. Dev Patel is great as Deon Wilson, the engineer that brings Chappie to life, as well as Hugh Jackman as the vile Vincent Moore. I have heard many criticize Mr. Jackman's villainous role, and while I admit there wasn't much to the character other then being a jealous religious ex-solider that desperately wants his own machine, MOOSE, to get attention, I thought Mr. Jackman really nailed this dark personality. He should play villains more often. Now here is one of many of the big criticisms this movie gets: the gangsters, Ninja and Yo-Landi, aka Chappie's surrogate parents. Everyone complained that casting the leads of the South African rap band, Die Antwoord, as the main characters was the biggest low point of the film, and that Ninja and Yo-Landi were absolutely terrible and unlikable as actors and characters. I'm here to say, they are overly harsh on these two. I've seen band members play in certain movies, and their acting was terrible, that is not the case here. The acting of the Die Antwoord members was nowhere near terrible, and their characters, while extremely dangerous, had redeeming qualities. Well, maybe not so much with Ninja, I'll get to him later. Either way, I had no problem with their characters.Finally, it's time to talk about Chappie himself. Chappie is easily the best character in the entire movie, and is more then worthy enough to have his own throne amongst the Terminator, R2D2, C3-PO, The Iron Giant, and the more recent Baymax and Ultron, as one of the most memorable robot characters in cinema history. Sharlto Copley has once against proved himself to be an amazing actor, and this is quite possibly his best role yet. From the beginning, Chappie's personality resembles that of a child's, making many audience members laugh and go ""aww"" in the process, and from there he develops both into a bad ass, and a strong character. From my gloating, you'd think that Chappie is Neill Blomkamp's best movie yet, and is perfect in every way, but sadly that is not the case. All films have flaws and gaping plot holes, and this one is no different. Going back to Ninja's character, he is easily the least likable of the Die Antwoord duo. While Yo-Landi is very kind and motherly towards Chappie, showing him the good in the world, Ninja would rather use Chappie as a weapon, which leads to him abusing the child-like robot, and showing him the darkness the world by having a bunch of gangsters group together and beat him up. At one point in the film he does start to care more for Chappie, leading his character to be slightly more likable, but for me it was a little too late. The film touches one many ideas surrounding consciousness and having a soul, and while these ideas are fascinating to think about, the way it is played out might turn people off, especially towards the ending.*Spoilers* While I love how Chappie was able to transfer Deon's consciousness into a robot's to save his life, they didn't need to go so far as to save Yo-Landi as well, which I thought was a little far-fetched. To me, if they stuck with saving only Deon, the ending would have been a little stronger and more awe-inspiring. *Spoilers over*I would also like to add that there is rap music that plays throughout the film, and for me it can get pretty annoying at times. Then again, I'm not a fan of gangsters and rap music, so this could be why it gets on my nerves, and it is not a fault in the movie. Overall, Chappie is an extremely underrated film, and is one of the best of 2015 so far. I think the main reason why many dislike it is because they went into the movie with an entirely different story on mind, only to be disappointed when they found it was something else entirely. They should give it another chance with an open mind, maybe then they'll see that Chappie is nowhere near bad. 8/10",Chappie
498,bLINDINZI,Why would you bother,4,9 March 2015,"This film is just about OK to watch if you have nothing else to see. The plot is thin, the characters inconsistent and totally unbelievable, turning from bad guys, to good guys, and back again, loads of slow-mo violence, bullets piercing bodies and more explosive special effects than you can shake a stick at. That said some of the characterisations are a tad above the norm with the everywhere man Dev Patel being perhaps the low point on that score. Some of the other characters if characters is the right word in a film that bordered on the cartoon at some points, being so outrageous in their behaviour as to make you hope they get what is surely coming to them and for most of them, it did usually in a hail of bullets. All of that aside this film was I suggest never meant to be serious, and was intended to be the first in perhaps a franchise of many more.The film left it wide open for a Chappie Two with all of the main characters morphing at the end into something new. The big question is whether you could be bothered to see a sequel, in my case I think not, even though this film was one step beyond being a very funny film indeed, leaving me not quite sure if I loved it or hated it!",Chappie
499,Internetghost,An obnoxious and irritating movie to watch.,3,31 July 2015,"To get this out of the way I went in with no idea what this movie was about, I didn't watch a single trailer, read a synopsis or watch any previous Neill Blomkamp so I went in with an open mind and I still didn't care for this movie. The concept is interesting, a robot that begins to think and feel for himself is a great opportunity to ask questions about humanity and consciousness, unfortunately this movie didn't understand what to do with it's potential. None of the characters felt like actual characters that grow and develop, everyone felt like a convenient plot device walking in to say expository dialogue or move the plot forward, the gangster characters were so annoying that I was actually cheering to see them die. The pacing and story structure is incredibly awkward and doesn't have a good flow from beginning to end, it doesn't have a good understanding of it's themes and therefore they feel undeveloped, the characters are always in contrived situations and are not well developed as an ensemble, besides Chappie not a single character feels like a protagonist or antagonist, I even liked Hugh Jackman's character and he was supposed to be the villain I guess, also Sigourney Weaver is severely underused in the film. In short Chappie is pretty Crappie. My Grade: D+",Chappie
500,adamduhaf,"Just like life itself: weird, exciting, sad, funny - and real.",9,22 March 2015,"I haven't written any movie reviews yet, since I usually find that there are many great opinions on different titles from fellow cinema goers. However, in this case I felt like the general reception of the title wasn't what it deserved, although it's a great movie. I like Mr. Blomkamp's work. I see a distinct difference between his directing and Hollywood movies in general: the latter usually try to duplicate reality, which is impossible, and ends up in an artificial feel to them. Blomkamp shows you parts of reality, so it works without trying too hard. He also touches on some very real and current (or soon to be expected) problems of humanity. Blomkamp's movies don't try too hard, yet they are very effective in sucking you into their world, making you feel those bits and pieces of the real one. His movies are honest and real, and that's why they work. That is how good science fiction works in my humble opinion. This is the very same reason why I think Chappie is a great movie. Blomkamp's sci-fi genius is written all over it, yet it's not shoved into your face, technology and sci-fi elements serve as a tool to tell a story. And that story is as real as it is sci-fi: Chappie is a very entertaining movie, oftentimes even funny, it's very unique and weird in the best sense of the word, but sometimes it also shows you a more serious face, just like life itself. It's not l'art pour l'art artism"", it's subtle, but it's definitely there, and if you are willing to think about it, it will move you. Chappie's story shows us a problem, which we may very well encounter in the next decades, and also shows a mirror to humanity itself.I really loved Chappie's character, it was a moving display of how we can create beautiful things, and showed us the better side of our species. On the other hand, it also showed us how people usually are: there are some who love Chappie and care for him, but generally people behave like they mostly do – selfish, evil, cowardly and violent, always finding a way for destruction. Chappie faces the problems which every good person has to in this world of ours, he's asking the same naive, benign questions as a child asks the world, and this is why it's so moving.Chappie is a very likable movie, which entertains you while making you ask serious questions in the same time. Some people will frown upon minor details like why isn't he reloading?"" , this twist is cheesy"" or this character should be dead by now"" and so on, but I can only feel sorry for those people who can't enjoy themselves and see the picture as a whole, focusing on the really important things: the story, the feelings and your overall enjoyment. I do believe you should watch Chappie. You'll be excited, you will laugh, you'll be sad, you will feel relieved and you will ask questions every person should about life. Be conscious.

Just few seconds of data transfer and a broken junk trash turns into an AI robot. I mean.. seriously??

Plot summary- This is a story about Deon an engineer who has created robots for acquiring the purpose for reducing crimes but he turned out to create a robot of his own with emotions amidst a series of mishaps. But certain events causes the robot to realize his origin, the fundamentals of consciousness, the durability of his own existence leading to Deon taking measures including one that had a drastic impact on him as well.5. Events- Certain points in the movie are quite emotional and mesmerizing including when the robot recognizes certain things initially, including the chase scene where Moose removes the guard key from the robot's system6. Film making- Dev Patel did complete justice to the character, the robot's childish voice is quite commendable. Overall a complete package7. Potential viewers- All those who are into robotics, Sci-fi-people can very much coordinate on such levels8. Verdict- A go-go!! Certain points in the movie are quite nice such as the concept of consciousness and the transfer of emotions in robot is quite a fact to come across, rest assured it's a total entertainer.",Chappie

You have the famous Alien star Sigourney Weaver attempting to play another leader role (being bossy doesn't make anyone a leader). The robotics special effects were about the only good thing about the movie. The plot sucked, and the actors were worse. With Hugh being the bad guy in this one(a different role for him), and he only done that in one other movie I can think of (The Prestige). And the thing I thought as really stupid was a robot being given AI from a 1T external drive, is that the limit of consciousness 1T? Of yes and the idea of someone learning morals and ethics from drug dealing car stealing gang members!!

505,o_pekdemir,Awesome movie - Ignore the haters!,10,3 August 2015,"First thing to say about Chappie after reading some of the idiotic (negative) reviews here at IMDb: Please watch it, no matter what the critics say about it. Movies (just like books, music and any other art) are very subjective matters and some people just ""don't get it"".The movie is extremely well done on almost every thinkable level of film making. Acting, photography, camera work, CGI, music and story telling is all very decent and rock solid.Chappies story itself feels like a witty, heart-warming children's tale, tuned up and rewritten for (intelligent) adult audiences. What's probably causing some of the negative reviews might be the violent, unpleasant environment, the movie is placed in. Just as in District 9, the whole surrounding world of Chappie is a cold and merciless place. So that's most likely one of the things, that could be pissing off some touchy viewers (just as District 9 did back in 2009).As for all those douche-bag reviewers complaining about the ""unrealistic"" accents of the main actors Yolandi and Ninja: These two brilliant people actually ARE from south Africa. More than that: They are also part of a popular rap-rave-band called ""Die Antwoord"" - well known for their slightly disturbing visual appearances and music videos. And I think they delivered a really awesome acting job in Chappie. Wish they would be casted for more movies in the future.I could dive deeper into a lot of topics, why I think that Chappie is a great movie. But I think it's just easier to let you experience it for yourself.But I would really like to add this: I've just read another moronic review, where someone is complaining about the computers in the movie and that they're ""old"" and using ""dos"" and so on. IMHO this movie is one of the very rare pieces of film, where computer technology is shown the way it actually really looks like in real life. Sure, to someone whose knowledge of computers is limited to printing a letter using MS Word, a UNIX text console might look like ancient technology. Everyone else should know better than that.To cut it short: Chappie is sweet, cool, clever, witty, violent, entertaining, very well done and a movie that will - or at least should - make you start thinking about what it means to be alive.Strongly recommended!",Chappie
506,fotografasea,Just an annoying movie,5,16 May 2015,"I had big hopes for this movie. I loved District 9 and Elysium was not bad. I was prepared mentally by my favorite movie critics that it won't be a movie most people will enjoy. So, the movie started. After 10 minutes I wanted all characters to be dead... except Chappie. After 30 minutes I wanted Chappie dead too. I heard and read that some people thought he is the most human like robot ever, cute, funny and etc. He was the opposite. Then he got the ascent and started acting like Ninja (most hated character) I was ready to stop watching. Then two characters in the movie did the cross sign before doing something the movie jumped a shark for me. All the characters are like from a music video clip and director forgot that after some scenes all of that has to combined into a movie. DIE ANTWOORD destroyed this movie... I know that they inspired the director but that was a mistake to have them there since both of them can't act, their are good at parody, being sexy or interesting for 2-3 minutes and thats it. Also this movie feel rushed at moments, as if they are skipping something that is not important, as if it's again, a music video where you have a limit time to tell a story and sacrifice some details. Basically all the ""evil"" characters are just detailed from the outside, but no real attention of who they are inside. Maybe ""The maker"" has some deeper background story but thats only pushing it. To sum up - this movie is annoying, rushed, shallow, dumb and full of slow camera shots at the second act. The quality itself is nice to look at though that why I gave it a 5",Chappie

Why should the robot think like a child...come on...after all these years you still can't imagine anything different from what a human thinks, how a human looks, how a human acts...!

I hate haters, they think they are so much better the the average joe like me. But this time, they will not be able to bring down that movie since it already have a score of 7.

509,wrbones,Very Disappointing Film on Many Levels,5,15 March 2015,"I had high hopes for this film but it met very few of my expectations. The basic premise is hugely intriguing but the story they tell is very poorly executed. For some reason, they decide that it will all take place over just a few days, when it would have worked so much better if the time frame had been stretched to weeks or even months. There are just too many unexplained leaps, almost as if they had cut an hour out of it to make it fit into schedules or something. Too many things happen that don't follow what we've already seen and have no logical explanation.Then there's is the script itself. It's terrible and makes some very fine actors look pretty bad. Hugh Jackman's character is simply absurd and we have little or not sympathy for anyone in the film, except Chappie itself. Maybe that's intentional but it could have been done in a less heavy-handed way, as could much of the emotional manipulation in the film.Too much of the film feels ""borrowed"" from other films. The robot nemesis looks almost exactly like ED-209 from Robocop, the gangster hide-out is straight out of Robocop 2 and the big gangster looks and feels like he's straight out of Mad Max. Even Chappie feels too much like ""No. 5"" from Short Circuit, which is totally at odds with the extreme violence portrayed in certain parts of the movie.The science is also very poor. There are several convoluted series of actions that are invented to drive the story that don't make sense. The most obvious (and the only one I can think of that won't involve a spoiler) is why Chappie would begin life like a scared animal if his programming was derived from the existing police robots. Surely he would ""emerge"" as another police robot and grow from there? It wouldn't have hurt the story but it would have made more sense.The CGI is the standout feature of this film. It is brilliant and totally seamless. You instantly accept Chappie as another character without question.So one point off for each of the following - poor story, bad script, bad acting, too derivative and poor science/logic. The bottom line is that if it comes onto TV, it's worth wasting a couple of hours on but I don't think it is worth paying money to see it.",Chappie
510,rasta-guy2,"I usually don't write reviews, but this just wasn't good.",4,7 April 2015,"First off, i'm going to go ahead and say it: I love Yolandi and Ninja, Die Antwoord are one of the reasons I was ALL ABOUT seeing this movie. The effects were awesome, honestly the robots looked completely real. The summary follows as- In the near future you have an incredibly capable robot police force in Southern Africa. One of them goes down. An engineer has been working on a program for artificial intelligence and takes his chance with this robot. Everything about it was amazing!... Now let's get into what precisely is wrong with this film. The robot wakes up- Ninja, Yolandi, America, and I think his name is Deo (the maker are staring at him), he acts like a scared puppy and cowers behind a table- That was cool. Ninja decidedly cannot stop pointing his gun at this machine all the while telling him to do ""Supa gangster stuff"" (He still can't speak English) and Yolandi is behaving like his mother. He learns the English language in I bs you not A DAY. In a shorter amount of time he learns how to transfer robot AND human consciousness into machines.... Right after that? He's tricked into a massive robbery under the premise that murdering people is just making them go ""to sleep"". His language comprehension after about 6 days (he learned to speak English in a day and mastered code in less than that) is about that of a 2-3 year old with words like ""Hurties"" and ""Mommies"". All and all? These were just poorly written parts in a high budgeted poorly written movie. It was all basically just Yolandi, you act motherly, America and Ninja? You run around scaring the hell out of him and waving your guns, play some Die Antwoord music so that people who recognize the cameo can stool in their pants, and let's bomb this.I struggled not to walk out of the theater.Not saying ""Don't go see it"", just prepare for A movie characters and acting with a B movie script... and plot...",Chappie
511,Ivan-the-terrible94,Underrated and a must-see,7,28 July 2015,"First of all l feel l should start by saying l am not a fan of director Neill Blomkamp. l thought District 9 was a horribly directed snooze-fest and l still stand by my opinion on that. I ever got around to watching Elysium even after a lot of glorifying recommendations from everybody including my mother, who'd seen it on HBO and claimed it was ""fantastic""I decided to check Chappie out despite the bad reviews that l read simply because l'm a sucker for AI movies (also Hugh FREAKING Jackman). I'm happy to report I was pleasantly surprised by this solid thought provoking film. Now that being said the film has it's downsides. The direction and camera work were unremarkable and uninspired as expected from Blomkamp. quite a lot of unnecessary camera shake combined with a ridiculous amount of cuts.The film however does not suffer too much from this as the story pulls you in immediately. Furthermore Discount Lady Gaga and Discount Chester Benington are among the most annoying characters put to film and l suspect the reason why so many people disliked Chappie. Even though they hardly appeared in the trailer or any promotional material they are very much in the spotlight the whole time. That being said they either grew on me at some point or l just developed some sort of tolerance for their annoyance. The reason for putting up with all of this was undoubtedly Chappie. The character is amazing, funny and lovable and l couldn't help but giggle like a little girl every time he spoke. It is amazing to watch him grow and evolve. As for the other actors both Hugh Jackman and Slumdog Millionaire delivered. Sigourney Weaver wasn't really given much to do in the film. The story is amazing and l don't want to spoil any of it beyond what the synopsis and trailers have revealed so l won't say anything apart from this: The ending seamed a bit love it or hate it but l land on the first of those and l think there may even be room for a sequel considering the applications of...you know..(if you don't know watch the movie!)Anyway this is one solid film and fans of the genre will definitely enjoy it. While definitely not better then Ex Machina it's unquestionably up on the list of best movies of 2015.",Chappie
512,marjancek,A hate-less review,7,16 May 2015,"I saw the movie prior to finding so much hate within the reviews. It is true that the film has 2 or 3 questionable plot-holes, but giving it anything less that 5 is clearly hate rating. The film also is not up for more than 8, since there are some very questionable issues with the development of the plot at certain points, and its message is strong, but rather simple.""Shot-Circuit (1986) meets the gansta"" is entertaining, and leaves a couple of things to think about by the end of it, so I think it does deserve its current average of 7.2.I liked it more than Elyseum, but a bit less that District 9. I clearly recommend it, but keep your expectations in check just in case.",Chappie
513,Kimcritic,Copy,1,21 September 2017,"This is a copy of overall concept of a movie called Short Circuit, from the 1980's. This one is much worse of course and set in a place I have no interest in: South Africa, with very unattractive sounding accents and unappealing characters at every turn. The robot is rather annoying to put it lightly. I don't care one bit about this stupid thing. The voice sounds stupid, the mannerisms are annoying and I never a all sorry for it or care about it winning anything. Who gave this guy $49,000,000???",Chappie
514,Alanrad,Movie with an interesting question.,8,11 October 2015,"This movie is entertaining, touching at times and funny. Some of the jokes and innuendos are best understood if you know South Africa, but this only adds value to those people and does not spoil it for the others. Maybe not the best reviewed movie but I believe it is a sleeper. Well worth the watch. Its entertaining and it offers some rewards. The movie was shot well, has some impressive action, some unusual characters, some tension and the disused industrial location was a great background for the story. The storyline has been detailed elsewhere but this movie left me, for the first time, with the question, why automated ""people"" could not seriously be the next evolutionary step on our planet. After all the human body is just a replicable machine? Could an intelligent non-living machine suit our planet better? After watching this film, it does not seem so much of a stretch - and leaving it with this question does better than some movies who leave you with nothing. So give this movie a watch - and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did - and I hope it offers you the same question.",Chappie
515,hooliganstreetpictures,Chappie is genius,10,24 October 2015,"Incredible film. I don't understand the haters and trolls out there, I can only speculate that they are younger and prefer the usual Hollywood movie. As far as I'm concerned District 9 and Chappie are genius. I've seen people make snide comments that this was a rip off of Short Circuit and Robocop. Considering that movies have been borrowing from each other for decades, and that no story (on the face of this planet) is truly original, I can only surmise that these people haven't lived long enough to know better.What I find most intriguing is the films comment on humanity, which, oddly enough is delivered to us by a non-human. Much the same way that District 9 boiled down to racial tolerance and human nature, Chappie teaches us the same as well as the value of compassion.To me, these are all valuable lessons. For those who wish to discount this film for any number of valid or invalid reasons, they should probably remember that just because god gave them a mouth, doesn't mean they should always use it. In my opinion if you can't say something constructive then shut the F up.More words of wisdom for those who left negative comments.A) For those who couldn't stretch their imagination enough to accept the story. Go watch documentaries.B) Why does the directing in District 9 look the same as the directing in Chappie? Big duh. Go check out the movies of Terry Gilliam, Stanley Kubrick, Tim Burton, Felini, Lynch... and (insert other famous directors) Then get back to me. Did you realize anything? C) For those that complained about Hugh Jackman's hair cut? Really? Are you old enough to watch a mature movie like this? D) For those that thought the punk chick reading to the robot was somehow embarrassing and cringe worthy? Children (in real life) read stories, and treat their dolls as friends. Many people treat their pets like humans. In a cold world such as this movie was set in, I would think that any person of compassion would be dying to show it to anything.E) For those who think the acting was bad? You haven't watched a whole lot of films have you. Not to mention, you must be one of those folks who think all acting should be the same, as if every person on this planet would behave exactly the same way, given the exact same situation.F) For those who found the plot/script bad? How many films have you seen? Please go away and grow up.G) If you truly hated this movie? Please find a quiet room and eat vanilla pudding for every meal, for the rest of your life, that should make you happy.For the open minded, the alive, the artist, the emotionally mature... you will enjoy this film.",Chappie
516,amanda_wagner-244-535973,Better than the critics says,6,10 March 2015,"I was in the cinema Friday night to watch 'Chappie' with my friend. I love robots, so I was very excited for this movie, but my friend was just watching the movie because I wanted to. Summary: We are in year 2016 in Johannesburg, South Africa. The crime has been so bad for many years, so the police is now using a droid in the police force, that the young engineer Deon has invented. He has a dream to create a robot with a real consciousness and feelings, but the company he is working for will not support the experiment, so Deon takes it into his own hands. He takes the scrapped robot Chappie as his guinea pig but unfortunately they get kidnapped by the local gangsters Ninja and YoLandi, so Deon has to - against his will - leave the robot, who is still in a baby state of mind 'Chappie' is the third sci-fi movie of the South African director Neill Blomkamp. The movie is kind of 'District 9' meets 'RoboCop'. I think the movie was very interesting, I'm personally very fascinated by robots and also by artificial intelligence, maybe because I think it will happen in a near future. Robots it's very much in the use right now and they just get better and better, so maybe they will be more common in the every day life soon. And in the future they will probably replace humans in many ways, like for example in the police. And I think 'Chappie' show us some of the positive things about the use of droids, and some of the negative things about it. Artificial intelligence is already happening in small doses like for example computer games. But I think it's gonna be a while before we see it in level like Chappies. But who know? I think the movie was funny and entertaining. The animation was amazing and the soundtrack was really good. The characters is very credibleI will rate 'Chappie' 6 out of 10 stars",Chappie
517,christopher-akritidis,A new low for scifi trash,1,8 November 2015,"There are way too many good sci-fi stories out there for Hollywood to be making garbage like this. A better script could have been written by a four-year-old retarded monkey on crack. The story is an insult to computer scientists, security experts, police officials, neuroscientists, CEOs, criminals and anyone with even a mild interest in sci-fi.Suspending disbelief is not the same as turning off your brain completely. It takes a special kind of mentally challenged individuals to accept even one of the following, casually brushed over ""details"": - Human consiousceness in a USB stick. Really? - A revolutionary robotics & AI company with worse security than an average grade school. - A CEO with an exceptional military weapon in her hands giving up after failing to sell it to a police force. - An AI ""child"" that learns how to speak through 2 days of casual interactions with humans. The child somehow magically categorizes heists and murder as crimes, but violence and car-jackings are OK. - A human mind-reading casket works just fine on a robot. - A SW developer who first tests his AI on a human-like robot, instead of a computer. Whatever!The consiouscness BS is also disturbingly shallow, but enough said. Some people watch sci-fi films for the CGI and special effects, instead of the ideas.

518,mcwriter,Raise your hand if you were paid to provide a thumbs up!,1,27 March 2015,"I had high anticipations for this movie. The trailer could've won a trailer Oscar. After it was over I was so angry that I wished I could terminate everyone involved with this horrible movie. What a waste of time and money. Everybody should be ashamed of their involvement. No plot development, putrid acting performances - hey, Hugh, tone down the roid rage or skip the gym a couple days a week! The villains were laughable, offering wooden recitation of terrible dialog. The plot was so full of logic holes that the focus for me became how anybody would have thought the script was well-written and deserved funding. Somebody - but certainly not the right person - is taking one the hard way for this mess. I'm no Roger Ebert so pardon the lack of cinematic dissertation, but it's not needed. This movie sucks, plain and simple, and the parties responsible should be stripped of their profits and made to watch it repeatedly for a month. It IS that bad.This guy nailed it better than I did so I'm going to give him a shout out - Jeremy Jobe, USA - and try this: ""I have no words for how bad it was. I was thinking of crafting a heated letter to Hugh Jackman and demanding he reimburse me for 2 hours of my life. It was so bad that I used to like District 9, but my consciousness has traveled back in time and now hates it for reminding me of Chappie. It was my personal Vietnam set to film. Terrible plot, combined with every single actor simultaneously putting on the worst acting performances of their respective careers. I just ate some cheesecake to try and take this day down a notch.I don't want to hate the reviewers that posted positive ratings before me, but a small part of me truly does. Why, WHY would you play this cruel joke on your fellow IMDBers? There is no way anyone actually went to this movie and walked out thinking ""That was pretty good!"" How, how, please God, why are there 10/10 reviews all over this page?

It fails and you come across to a mixed mambo jumbo action movie with a TERRIBLE ending. One of the worst i have ever seen. Even worse than Interstellar. Please Neill, Don't f*ck up the Alien.I liked Chappie's problems in the everyday world and his connection with his maker but the movie doesn't focus on that.

The characters are vivid, the setting is real, the story works and Chappie is singular. The director has outdone himself, this movie is even better than District 9, and I loved that one.Chappie is something rare and special, innocent and with endless possibilities ahead of him, yet he is plunged into the abyss of human relationships, strife, crime and, occasionally - hope. He has to learn, grow and adapt if he is to survive. The movie is full of heart, touching, and it empowers you to forget Chappie is all metal. His fears are real and he can love.

It seems as if every Employee can simply take the Guard key, with which you can reprogram the Scouts, and do whatever he wants with it, even take it home (or leave in a robot you stole). Or you steal a Scout with GPS in it, but no one ever comes looking for it, except the ""Badguy"" who then finds it immediately thanks to its GPS.

The style, image and ""feel"" are all reminiscent of that movie but this one is not as good.The CGI, as many other reviewers have said, is breathtaking (there was only one section , as Chappie crosses the rail-yard, where I remembered I was looking at some computer artifact) but the story is too rote, the characters too shallow and the pace of the movie judders. There's not enough of any particular ingredient to carry the movie as a whole and the tantalising splinters of interesting ideas only serve to show what has been missed.As for casting - the three ""heavy weight"" actors are wasted and although I admire the cheek of Die Antwoord's musical style they are no where strong enough actors to fill out the pivotal role their characters play.All in all I'd say that if you haven't seen District 9 - watch that instead.

Picture a mix of Robocop and Wall-e gone wrong, that still isn't as bad as Chappie.Warning: may contain spoilers from this point on.There are lots of plot holes (like one every 5 minute): - Chappie, when first turned on, has only a conscience but zero understanding of its surrounding and environment, like a baby or a child, and, yet, he senses fear and despair, something that is not possible without previous experience - characters change their behavior without any warning or motivation, like the woman that goes from a tough criminal to a mother instantly; - Chappie knows the meaning to the word ""Mommy"" even although he has zero knowledge of the language; - it being smart enough to try not to get involved in a heist, because he knows what a crime is, but too dumb to know what physical violence is. The language thing, by the way, is the worse part in the movie. Why was Chappie's consciousness firmware void of any language skills? Yet it appears to have knowledge enough to understand the weight of some words. The ""humanity"" factor in the movie, if we can call that, is forced and cliché, mostly because Chappie's characters it very badly developed and poorly written.

But, this does not make it a bad movie.Having watched trailers, I created some expectation. The Asimov- esque premise had a lot of potential to create deep characters and interactions. These hopes for an enthralling storyline were dashed in the first half hour by almost every characters' clear lack of common sense. In the first half hour of movie this reached a point that it actually broke my immersion. I'm not sure why, I still kept hope for a good plot, but the movie just defaults to the ""do what is right, protect the ones you love"" cliché.So, why watch this? Because, despite its flaws, it has strengths. The character ""Chappie"" is very much different from what is today's cookie cutter protagonist. And even if the story is shallow, it feels complete, without any cliffhanger meant as hooks for a sequel or plot holes.If you are looking for movies with AI, there are better ones out there (I, Robot and Ex Machina come to mind), but this movie is still a good bet when you want a cinematic ""light snack"".",Chappie

Two other important characters do their jobs well. Despite being a film about robots and futuristic technology, the script and the lines don't always make you run for the nearest thesaurus or science-magazines for help. That's a very important part about film- making (I feel) - To tell the story in the language of your audience. Lately a lot of sci-fi films rely solely on exotic vocabulary to 'sell' the (often times) inaccurate science in the film. Chappie doesn't seem to suffer from such an illness.And despite dealing with some highly far-fetched 'technology', the overall simplicity of the film makes it all forgivable.

My problem is not that I dislike them as actors it's that I dislike them as characters and how pretentious their characters are. As a result that splashes over to Chappie and the movie becomes a self contained circle of self promotion. This movie seems to me like someone had a great idea but decided to pull in Die Antwoord and, being the fanboy that that someone is, designed the plot around the personalities they have established and handed them a promotional opportunity on a silver platter forsaking any believable character or plot developments.

This is why we lean towards critics (in our eyes more experienced in the critical analysis and review of films) to get our ´more educated' reviews on the latest most seemingly interesting films that we may want to watch. However, a film is not defined by cast, budget, or the title of a largely known film company, but the immersion and further entertainment of the audience whomever or wherever they might be. This is why I am now going through some of my more favorite films, rewatching, reviewing, and possibly suggesting them to others, such as this film in itself... Chappie. Greatly blindsided by the hidden talent in acting within South African Hip Hop duo, Die Antwoord, the seemingly experienced two performed very well throughout scenes in the entirety of the film with not a single error or flaw in their performance. You know how some films you watch a scene and think ´that could have been done better'? Well this just so happens to be one of few Action/Adventure films that don't suffer from that same fate. At no point in this film did I find a lack of competence in writing, directing, screenplay or acting throughout. This is a definite recommendation for anyone who enjoys intense action with equally intense emotional connection between the characters themselves, and the highs and lows they face. 10/10.",Chappie
537,levdr,This is really bad...,1,2 July 2015,"I love Scifi movies and series, so with the pretty good IMDb ratings for Chappie, I was ready to enjoy myself. But oh my, what a bad film this is. I liked the visuals and the... no, wait, that was pretty much it.One thing that stood out the most for me was the embarrassingly bad acting. The one exception was Hugh Jackman but his character was completely over the top and pretty ridiculous. And why Sigourney Weaver was there is a mystery, she was pointless. All the others turned in cardboard performances. None of the characters came alive and I couldn't care less what happened to them. The story could have been interesting but wasn't. In fact, the story didn't really begin until an hour and a half into the movie. Before that it's basically mostly people running around and screaming foul language. And the things a viewer is made to believe, like a die-hard female suddenly, from one moment to the next, having strong maternal feelings for a robot, reading him stories of some sheep? Come on! One star.",Chappie
538,johnmarciniak,Hidden Gem - mistakenly thought this was a kids movie,9,16 January 2017,"I finally watched CHAPPiE almost 2 tears after it was released when I found out Yo-Landi and Ninja of the band Die Antwoord were in the movie. Other wise I would have never watched, the reason being I mistakenly thought this was a kids movie. BTW There are several Die Antwoord songs in the sound track. For me CHAPPiE turned out to be a fantastic sci-fi action adventure drama. It was written by Neill Blomkamp & Terri Tatchell and directed by Neill Blomkamp, both also did (District 9) and has similar style. If you liked District 9 you will surely enjoy this movie. Its to bad the trailer didn't convey the gist of the movie better because the main thing I remembered was a child like robot scared and cowering behind a rock and what looked like a corporate militia trying to get it back like a different kids movie I didn't like. It makes me wonder how many people had a similar impression and thought this was a kids movie so never watched or how many parents took their kids to see it at the theater or rented the DVD only to realize to late it's not a kids movie and be completely dis- enthralled. In my opinion this is why reviews are all over the place, because so many people came away not seeing what they expected. That's a tragedy because CHAPPiE didn't do well enough for there to be a sequel. This was supposed to be a trilogy and I'm sure there would have been an evolution of characters and added complexity to the sequels.",Chappie

Script/Dialogue is superb, the Action and Plot are seamlessly composed....Wow, kudos to Blomkamp for having such a stark, clear vision of the near future and telling it so well. Jo'berg didn't fare too good, hopefully this was CGI, which I never felt aware of anywhere in Chappie, and which has been ruining Sci-Fi for 20+ years. Excessive action for the sake of action, convoluted plots as a substitution for good writing...The latter 2 are both, happily, absent in this superior film, crafted by a director who is 'scooting' up beside David Lean in my library of Genius Film Making.",Chappie

541,raoulduke333,Most disappointing film of the decade so far,1,7 August 2015,"There needs to be an option for zero stars or negative stars to accurately convey the true quality of this film. The plot has so many holes that I was appalled to have wasted 2 hours of my life watching it and feel that negative stars are needed to atone for that loss of my life - the film would be a zero if it lasted 5 minutes but at 2 hours it needs less than a zero classification.Perhaps the most disappointing thing (and there are many choices) about this flick is the wasted potential. This could have been a really great film if some of the wanton action scenes were discarded - instead of trying to make a film to sell to action hungry knuckle heads the story could have been kept more realistic and could have ended up being a true great just like district 9.After seeing NB's last 2 films which both went wrong trying to turn a good story into an action flick, I now fear that he will never make another good movie because big bangs and explosions will get in the way.

543,neilireson,A Shame,4,15 May 2015,"Well that was pretty awful, especially from the team that created the original and beautifully grimy ""District 9"". Chappie really is a dog's dinner of a film, with a bunch of ill-conceived and badly executed ideas. The script was terrible with non-nonsensical scenes, and badly drawn, one-dimensional characters. I would think about 80% of this film was just a rehash of Blomkamp's previous two films. The lead actors were woefully underused, really you could have gotten anyone to play the ""Corporate boss"", ""Macho bad guy"", ""Young naive genius, obviously in glasses"". There was no-one in the film who I could care about, even Chappie who provided by far the most interesting character, was so psychotic that I wouldn't wish to spend any time in his company.I have a terrible feeling that Blomkamp may be a one trick pony, I really hope not but so far the evidence is not good.",Chappie
544,sevenfingers2001,a melding of Short Circuit & Robocop,5,19 July 2015,"I just started watching this but it seems that it's a mixture of Short Circuit and Robocop. Hollywood seriously needs to hire real writers. All the talented writers were fired because they were too ""old and out of touch"" with your target audience. At least they weren't mindless young dweebs who had not experienced life enough to come up with something original. I'm giving it a 5 out of kindness. Some, if not most of the more mature audiences would like to see something refreshing, new, and original. The over 50 crowd doesn't really want to see re-hashed versions of old movies and TV shows. We can get those from late night TV, Netflix, Crackle, and YouTube.",Chappie

It seemed to have no character development and to seriously lack the qualities that draws one into a movie. Then Chappie was born, and I was glad I didn't! The movie really picked up at that point. Chappie's character is well- developed, and is what makes the movie worthwhile. The Chappie character also fleshes out the other characters by his interaction with them. It wasn't a totally original movie (quite obviously there are elements of movies such as Robo Cop, I Robot and Short Circuit) but Chappie has it's own uniqueness, and is action-packed and fun! If you're planning on watching it with your children, be aware there is a lot of strong language. It's worth not giving up on this one too quickly!",Chappie

It takes quite a while for everything to get melded into place. You more than likely will not feel the full satisfaction until the end of the movie. If you liked District 9, you'll like this one too. District 9 had a lot more likable characters and emotional ties. Chappie has too many forgettable characters, and a lot of characters that will confuse you. Despite any little criticisms I might have, Chappie is much more relatable to District 9 than Elysium, which was a fine movie, but has a different feel to it than the other 2.

547,joazito,"Great visuals, completely ludicrous plot",3,12 March 2015,"Felt like leaving the theater for this one. It started off nicely, with a hugely successful robot task force with moderate A.I. Then for some reason funding gets cut and the head developer decides to go rogue and install his untested super A.I. on a stolen robot.Hard to swallow plot #1: The robots can only be reprogrammed in the presence of a unique key USB disk. The developer just picks it up and takes it home, spends several days with it, and no one bats an eye.#2: Chappie is born with the knowledge of a baby. But miraculously he learns the English language in a couple of days of exchanging a few sentences with his ""parents"".#3: The bad guys let the developer, which they just stole and beat the crap of, come and go as he pleases. No worries of him alerting the authorities or his companies' own robot army. Which he doesn't, inexplicably.#4: For someone so intelligent, Chappie is pretty dumb. He knows shooting someone kills them but is convinced that knifing ""just makes them sleep"".#5: After lying to manipulate the robot every step of the way, the ""bad daddy"" decides to come clean and admit that in fact he can't prevent Chappie's demise. Which obviously results in almost getting killed.#6: The same ""bad daddy"" then does a complete flip flop and puts his life on the line to save Chappie. Which is going to die in a few hours anyway. And not in any effective way I might add, he just decides to become a sitting duck for some reason.#7: The factory where all the mayhem originated from is the least secure place in the city. And absolutely no one, except for the protagonist and the antagonist, are able to go to the command console and sort things out. In fact it just remains abandoned in all other times.#8: The childlike robot prodigy miraculously (again) is able to do a feat no else had: transfer consciousness. With some banged up laptop too.#9: Police is nowhere to be seen, and despite being perfectly possible to restore the malfunctioning robots from the control central no one decides to even try it. There's just frantic panic and cowboy stunts.There's more but you get the picture. To me the movie was painful to watch. Every character seemed to be shouting all the time and have complete disregard for logic. It was a dumb movie. The one nice thing that temporarily took the pain away was the warm feeling you get when you realize the robot is able to sacrifice his own life for the survival of a human. So, 2 minutes out of 120. Maybe I should have rated this even lower - but the 3/10 stands, because of visuals.",Chappie
548,Montybunny423,Robocop + Short Circuit = Chappie,7,18 March 2015,"Chappie is a well-executed family film that features R-rated violence. This one would be ideal for the kids, except for a few dsturbing moments.Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium)yet again brings us another special effects-ridden adventure set in Johannesburg, South Africa with fun results! A police droid (Sharlto Copley)is badly damaged while under fire and brought back to life by its creator (Dev Patel), only to be stolen by a small group of desperate criminals (Yolandi & Ninja, Jose Pablo Cantillo)in need of some fast cash. The droid is then brought up to behave like a ""gangsta"" and help the criminals with their heists. Meanwhile the creator's nemesis (Hugh Jackman)constantly lurks near by and scheme to destroy the creator's work, to promote his own creation. (A robot controlled by a human) The cast is solid, as is the direction. The tone is a tad uneven- switching often back-and-forth from taut to giddy, the film wants to be Robocop AND Short Circuit; it's obvious but not a bad thing either! Chappie still succeeds in entertaining; the film is explosive, gruelling, heartwarming, beautifully shot, has a great soundtrack and is simply enjoyable-fun!

549,james-allen72,OK. Really?,2,24 July 2016,"I usually consider myself a ""fanboi"" and find that every movie is my ""new favorite thing""-so much that I often find myself wondering if I've lost the ability to be critical of a movie. I especially love movies about near-future A.I. law enforcement (I LOVED the ""Robocop"" reboot). But then I saw ""Chappie"". The premise is right up my alley, and I thought I was in for a helluva ride until the completely over-the- top bad guys hijack the nerd who has just stolen a ""scout"" droid with the purpose of trying his newly-developed A.I. system on it. Everything to this point is pretty tight-right down to Sigourney Weaver's character's reluctance to allow Deon to just try the A.I. on the droid. When the bad guys let Deon go (WHAT?), seemingly unconcerned with whether he would report them to the police, my own logic filled in the hole by reasoning that Deon would not want the police to find the robot that he had stolen and left there with them. But then the rest of the movie was one hole after another and by the time the movie was over, I found myself more exhausted than entertained, having to constantly square the circles, using my own reasoning rather than just enjoy a well-written story. The worst part was that I kept getting the sense that I was supposed to really feel badly for Chappie; that I was supposed to somehow view him as a child and when he found himself in peril or was hurt, I was supposed to feel as I would when watching it happen to a child or perhaps an innocent animal. Don't get me wrong- I am extremely empathetic-probably too much so: I still SOB every time I watch ""Powder"" and I cried all the way through to the end of the credits of the movie, ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"". But I just was not getting anything from Chappie. His ""gangsta"" posturing wasn't ""cute"" to me and I did not relate to him on any fundamental level. I found it ridiculous when his arm was sawed off, the humans muttering, ""That'll teach him"" (or something to that effect) because well, he's a freaking ROBOT! They don't have nerve endings with which to feel pain! Someone should explain that to the guys who are trying to inflict physical pain on a MACHINE!Ah well, I could go on, but I think that by now, anyone reading probably gets the point. If you're older than six and have an I.Q. above 90, save yourself two hours of your time and go watch something with some substance and entertainment quality. If you've got a hankerin' for some Sigourney Weaver, there's four or five movies I could recommend, at least four of which take place in space and are, at worst pretty good action flicks. If you just need to see Hugh Jackman in something besides an ""X-Men"" movie, well, there's ""Australia"" and a couple others. If you're hoping for something that explores the minutiae of concerns to be had when truly considering whether or not we ""should"" continue to develop artificial intelligence, or if we should toss those concerns out the window to focus on whether we have the ability, try ""Ex-Machina"". But really, if you want to watch a movie that explores the possible pitfalls of a sentient law- enforcement robot-one with a little humor and lot of action, either of the iterations of ""Robocop"" is far and away better than this, which only got a second star from me because of the visuals.",Chappie
550,brar-gagan01,Unrealistic average A.I movie,6,4 June 2015,"The movie starts off good with its futuristic approach. But lacks a gripping element which glues you to your seat till the end. As the movie moves ahead, the excitement level is constantly dipping like temperature in the winters.The whole concept, starting from the birth of Chappie to growing up to be a gangster, doesn't really feels realistic as it felt when we all watched Wall-E or Terminator. Also, the South African Tourism department will not be too happy about the movie locations. ;) The ending was also not that much satisfying. It was like as if the makers are also bored with the whole plot and just wants to end it anyway they feel possible. the whole moving your conscience thing to machines really didn't worked as much as they hoped for. it's just like anybody can be chappie just a click away.So, the movie is an average effort with an upcoming concept about A.I which doesn't really holds a grip on you.",Chappie

This is an incredibly violent but, more importantly, cruel film, humanity at its worst & themes of bullying, torture & utter nastiness, most of which was done to a 'child'!! Even my male house-mate found it too much so we turned it off, bit traumatised by the unexpected underbelly of blackened hearts. If you are sensitive in any shape or form, just don't go there! Okay i need more lines, so here goes: It's about an (effectively baby) robot who is learning how to be in the world but the world it has been 'born' into is that of criminals, gangsters, that are simply unsuitable for Chappie's sensitive temperament. He is innocent & willing to learn & be trained but is consistently treated with cruelty & aggression. Why, with all that's going on in the world today do we really need to be subjected to more horror. Yes, some might say it's a metaphor for society & it may well get better later in the movie BUT I cant see that ingesting this kind of thing will make anything better!

That being said, Chappie is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie has it all, action, comedy, drama, emotional scenes. I like to think of myself as an emotionally numb big macho man but parts of this movie had the tear strings jerking....(no I won't admit to tears but dang it they were close). The way the writer/director made you actually feel sympathy and attachment to the ""bad guys"" in this film was amazing. Time and again I had to keep reminding myself that these people were not model citizens and yet, time and again they were not only the underdogs, but you feel actually drawn to them. At first I thought that since I'd never noticed or seen most of the main actors, that they must not be exceptional. I am happy to say that the acting (at least it my eyes) was very good when it came to ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy"". The comedy, oh the comedy.... when Chappie is ""getting daddy's cars back"" I was damn near on the floor rolling. I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard! I about spit my drink out! Chappie is hilarious! The director does an excellent job of grasping the fact that Chappie has the mind of a child while doing things that children should never do. It's amazing.I'd have to say the worst part / corniest part of the movie is when wolverine (sorry I forget his real name) finally gets the go ahead to work his monstrosity.... That part of the movie could have been better in my opinion. The big robot was super clunky and the design flaws that should not have been made even by a novice. I mean, a non-bullet proof camera on the leading edge of a combat chassis? Metal thin enough for a blade to go through and hold a grenade??? who makes a combat chassis that a knife can penetrate!?!?!?Though I would like to go on and tell the readers everything about the movie, I just don't want to ruin everything. This movie is amazing. I knew when I saw the preview months ago in the theaters that I wanted to see it. I'm so very glad that I watched it. Not only did this movie make me laugh, but it tugged at my heart strings as well. Even without the cliché love story. It's not your normal robot movie where all the robots go crazy and it's man vs. robot, it's a well thought out, well directed with an amazing cast of no- name actors that in my eyes did an amazing job. I for one will go see this movie again with the Mrs. and then I will buy it on Blue Ray to support the team for making such an amazing movie. This movie was exceptional to say the least! You should see it! it's a great family movie, couples movie and even just seeing it solo.",Chappie
554,obiwan400,CHAPPiE: Flawed But Fun,7,11 March 2015,"Neill Blomkamp captivated all of us with District 9. Elysium was a disappointment to be sure. I went into CHAPPiE with hopes that Blomkamp would return to form. And he does. And also doesn't. The first half of the film is a disjointed mess. Through most of the half, I kept wondering where the film was supposed to be going. Then, the film finally found what it wanted to be, about halfway through the movie. But once it got it's way, it felt like what we all hoped Blomkamp would give us. Unfortunately, the stumblings of the first half demand to be tied up in the end, resulting in several plot points that we don't actually care for. The good: Sharlto Copley is wonderful as Chappie, the special effects are spot on, with some wonderful cinematography that makes the action sequences captivating. The bad: really disjointed pacing, indecisive editing choices, and a poorly written (though wonderfully acted by Hugh Jackman) villain who seems to be there for the sole purpose of having a villain.Overall, CHAPPiE is enjoyable enough to warrant the price of the ticket. Is it as good as District 9? Not by a long shot. Does it show that Blomkamp has improved since Elysium? Yes, but he's still got some work to do before the Alien movie.",Chappie

Hugh Jackman as the bad guy! with a role that is hardly of any importance!!

557,dan-barth,Not as good as the trailers,2,11 March 2015,"OK so going into Chappie I was really looking forward to seeing the movie. I was a big fan of Blomkamp and I loved his movie District Nine, also the trailers looked really promising for Chappie. But despite its promise Chappie wasn't the movie I was expecting.OK lets start with some of the positives before we go really nitty gritty on why this movie wasn't the best. Dev Petel was solid, his performance was heart warming and you could really empathise for his character. To be honest his character was the only character I cared about in the entire movie. Although I empathise for Petels character I really cant say the same for the main character Chappie. For a film that is about a child like artificial intelligence I should at least feel for that character, and sadly I don't. But back to the positives, Blomkamp's typical cinematography make a welcome comeback and its a phenomenal film visually. However, there are too many similarities between Chappie and District 9 regards to shots and the opening sequence that I started to think that Blomkamp wasn't trying to portray his typical style, but instead was just being lazy. These are the only redeeming features I can really think for Chappie.Now the bad stuff. I have no idea what Blomkamp was thinking about hiring the band members from Die Antwoord. Now Yo-Landi Visser she was okay in her role. She helped to bring out a emotional side to Chappie and the very few times that I actually liked Chappie where when she was in the scene. However, her exaggerated and often annoying acting made it difficult for me to take her seriously in the movie. She's no leading actress put it that way.Now we go onto Ninja my god it hurts to talk about this guy. The lead singer of Die Antwoord was a poor leading actor who mainly annoyed and confused me throughout this movie. His acting was sub-standard and character flawed. At every point in this film he was attempting to seem serious and scary or some kind of no nonsense 'gangster' but the truth is he came off as laughable awkward and generally unlikeable. In the climax of the movie you as the audience are supposed to seem sorry for this guy. But in the film there is no redeeming features about Ninja as a character what so ever. so as a result its hard as an audience member to feel sorry for a character who is genuinely, but without meaning to be unlikeable. I could rant about Die Antwoord all day but I will come back to them later.Next we have Hugh Jackman as the main villain. I would say his name but the character is hard to remember as it is. It was as if Blomkamp sat down Hugh gave him some money and said just swear and be an Australian for a few hours. And to me that just sounds like an angry Hugh Jackman. However I don't blame Jackman for this poor presentation of a character. Its down to the poor screen writing of Chappie. Instead of focusing on the villain and making him have any sort of development besides a basic jealous story, the film focused too much on Die Antwoord, to even allow this character to grow. This again confused me at the climax of the film as I felt that Hugh's character was trying to seem like the main villain but I just didn't care. This comes down too my second abysmal point about Die Antwoord. Throughout the movie there are Die Antwoord posters everywhere, on every wall around every street. But their characters are meant to be two bit thugs, remind me when do thugs get enough cash to advertise themselves around a crime ridden Johannesburg? More importantly why would they want to advertise themselves they are on the run from gangs and police! It just frustrates me how unfocused this movie is.I will say this though Sharlto Copley did well to voice Chappie. He did well in his voice work for when Chappie was developing in the beginning and it did make you think Chappie was a child like artificial intelligence.If only he could have kept that development going and the film would have been ten times better. Again the same with Hugh Jackman I don't blame Copley for the poor character development in this movie. It all comes down to the script and unfortunately Chappie has no real redeeming features. He is mean easily manipulated and although you may feel sorry for him his portrayal isn't a good robot gone bad its a robot made bad and staying bad. This can lead to some funny moments in the film but mainly this side of the movie is flawed. Basically Blomkamp messed up, I know he had some redeeming features in this movie but it was all wasted. For a film that was presented as a exploration into what makes us human it became a mess of wanna be gangsters, poor acting and a unsatisfying ending. If you want to see a good movie by Blomkamp go watch District Nine.Cheers.",Chappie
558,TheReziser,"10/10 visuals but 0.5/10 on the plot (CLICHÉ, CLICHÉ EVERYWHERE)",4,1 July 2015,"This review contains minor spoilers on the plot The movie has been getting very mixed reviews so I decided to watch it myself. It was around 20 minutes in when I lost all hope for this movie. In the past year or two many have tried to make movies cantered around the plot of making an AI (I know there have been also many before such as: I, Robot/Skynet/Matrix/...). Some have succeed (such as: Ex Machina, Her), but many have failed (such as Automata, Transcendence...). Unfortunately, I have to bring Chappie in to the second category. Movies in this category lack a proper plot; visuals and acting are more or less OK. Plus: Great visuals and special effects. The robot was very good animated and on screen, he felt alive. Minus: 1. the plot of the movie is filled with holes and clichés (every character, plot in general). 2. Bad guys will do only bad things because, well they are bad and there is no other reason than that. Good character will always be good, because reasons. 3. Characters are only being shown when the plot wants to, this has been for example Deon who in the most part and at the end is just there doing nothing because plot does not require him to do anything. 4. Movie copied/stole designs from Robocop (robots), Borderlands(gang where robot ""grew up""). 5. Things just happening because plot want's it to. Chappie just suddenly understood everything, Chappie just suddenly learned how to code with no prior knowledge. 6. Meaningless intro Overall, I know this is a poorly written review and I almost never write them. But when you make a movie with a such a high budget, I see no reason why not give the screenplay through some checks so that experts can tell you what you have to change. The movie gives a clear message that the second part is coming and please Neill Blomkamp, rethink everything before you start writing the plot, because I don't want to sit another two hours viewing Elysium and would rather see District 9.",Chappie
559,oceanman1995,Beautiful movie worth watching,10,19 March 2015,"Long review short - Chappie is definitely worth watching. I thought it would be just another robot or artificial intelligence type of movie, but it's so not like it. I honestly really enjoyed watching it and would readily watch it again.There were a few rough edges and illogical actions of the characters, but those are very minor compared to all the ""good stuff"" in the movie.In the near future, crime is patrolled by an oppressive mechanized police force. But now, the people are fighting back. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. As powerful, destructive forces start to see Chappie as a danger to mankind and order, they will stop at nothing to maintain the status quo and ensure that Chappie is the last of his kind.",Chappie

The bad hang are hilarious because of their pathetic acts and dialogs. The outfit looks like bad comics. And it seems that just screaming loud and talking bad is enough to be the worst among bads. But of course, in the end, love can everything. Hugh Jackman plays a ridiculous bad and envious guy hating his successful college, and able to ruin a whole city just to win. Dev Patel as an stereotypical engineer clever but puerile... The script simple, black and white and, over all, boring. In summary, I don't know if it is a bad film or a bad joke.",Chappie

563,laughinggiraffe0,One of the worst films I've seen,1,7 March 2015,"The big problem with this movie is that none of the characters are likable. Chappie's ""family"" is made up of criminals who raise him to be a ""gangsta"" / ""pimp"" complete with bling. I don't know if this was supposed to come off as heartwarming, but it's just stupid and corny as hell. I kept hoping they would die the entire movie.Chappie himself is like an annoying little kid who does stupid things and lacks common sense. The worst part is the accent. I don't know if that's how real South Africans talk, but it just did not fit a robot at all and was really obnoxious to listen to. It was like the movie tried too hard to be cool.Combine all this with a plot that is nonsense. For example:Chappie's maker is like the next Steve Jobs, yet he works in a cubicle in what resembles a run down warehouse.The computers look like they came from the 80's, complete with DOS. Seriously? Did South Africa not get Windows?The gangsters let Chappie's maker go free repeatedly for no apparent reason when he could obviously have gone to the police at any point. Are these the dumbest criminals in the world?These are just a few examples of the idiotic script.Another thing is people keep mentioning how great the director is. I honestly don't care what he directed in the past. This movie sucks.",Chappie
564,Pining-For-The-Fjords,"Remember ""Simple Jack"" from the movie Tropical Thunder?",1,15 June 2015,"Remember Tropical Thunder? Ben Stiller plays a clueless ego-driven actor who does those typical over-the-top Hollywood movies. The lowest point of his career is ""Simple Jack"", a cheesy tear-jerker about a mentally challenged boy. And of course the ridiculous, unimaginative over-use of clichés makes it hilariously bad and corny. Okay, back to present time. Unfortunately, Chappie is the exact same kind of thing. Imagine what it would be like if someone tried to adapt Edward Scissorhands, but gave the lead to a piece of machinery from I Robot. Think about that. Your main character is now a goofy, lovable robot who's basically Ralph Wiggum for the first half of the movie, and then Forrest Gump for the second. He's oh-so innocent and he means well, but his naiveté gets taken advantage of. You've seen it done a hundred times before and a hundred times better. This movie feels like a vaguely familiar student film project.But it doesn't stop there. To make things worse, they gave the supporting leads to two musicians from the same band, who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. And this is where it gets super weird ... They somehow thought it would be a good idea to have those musicians use their actual stage-names and use their music throughout the movie, while they act with their own BAND NAME printed on their shirts!!? Is this supposed to be a Spinal Tap thing? Is it a meta thing? What is the point here? Product placement? It feels so tacky and awkward, it's hard to focus on anything else. But I guess maybe that's not a bad thing, because what you're left with is a steaming mess of a movie. A story filled with plot-holes that are big enough to drive a van through, illogical character decisions, and events that are believable at no point. Sure, Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman are great actors, but you find yourself wondering how they got themselves into this. Did they lose a dare?Oh yeah. And finally, to top it off, let's not forget to insult the intelligence of the audience by writing some obviously fake reviews to boost the stats on IMDb. The top ""loved it"" reviews on here are so fake that it hurts my eyes. But you know, maybe those reviews are actually a good metaphor for this movie. It's just uncomfortable, weird, it's cheesy, fake, awkward, soulless, and you simply can't take it seriously for one second. Every moment is another cliché stolen from some other movie, like a sappy ransom note glued together with computer graphics. It would almost be funny, if it wasn't so sad in so many ways. This is supposed to follow up District 9 and Elysium? Damn... To quote Robert Downey Jr. in Tropical Thunder: ""You should never go full retard!""",Chappie
565,stephaniegracesmithagain,Underrated Movie of The Century,10,14 March 2015,"My husband and I went into the theater with low expectations, having heard very little about the film before we decided to see it. By serendipitous chance we stumbled upon a pure work of genius. Chappie is the movie equivalent of refined gold that so many before have tried and failed to be. Director Neill Blomkamp has done it again, and in our opinion his finest work. Die Antwood is an interesting choice, one that I think really paid off. If you have any level of knowledge about Johannesburg then the characters make perfect sense. The character Chappie himself has been created by Blomkamp in such a beautifully human and relatable way that one can't help but feel deeply for him as he faces a cruel world. 10/10",Chappie
566,twelvegames,"one of the dumbest, most annoying flicks I've ever seen",1,14 August 2015,"I don't review movies, but after seeing this warm pile of nonsense and noticing the decent rating it had here on IMDb, I feel it's my duty to play equalizer and help bring that rating down to a more honest level. So I gave Chappie a 1 out of 10.. and I would have given it a 1 out 10 anyway even if I weren't intentionally trying to bring it's score down. I really is that awful. Everyone's seen bad movies before, movies they would swear were the worst thing they could have possibly sat through, and then a flick like Chappie comes along and just blows chunks and expectations so far out of the water it makes you actually yearn for the quality, entertainment value, and deft intellectualism of something like.. I don't know.. Patrick Swayze and Road House, or maybe Elizabeth Berkley and Showgirls. This movie is the dumbest, most poorly executed, and insipid piece of ham-fisted film making I have seen in years... and I've seen some doozies. (I have Netflix) Have you ever seen a cloyingly child-like robot whiz a couple Chinese throwing stars at someone.. no? Well this movie takes care of that for you. Or how about violent kidnappers that beat and threaten their victim before letting them climb back into their ride and go on about their merry way. This flick has that too. Or how about a movie whose plot is set just one year ahead of the actual date , in Chappie's case that would be 2016, yet inexplicably has technologically advanced police robots scampering around displaying capabilities that are decades away, yet the cars haven't changed, office computers still run command-prompt, and complex digital code is still kept on usb drives. Nice. I'm fairly easy to please with my movie habits and this is easily the worst movie I've seen in years. Lame characterizations pulled directly out of equally lame flicks from the 80's, plot holes so glaringly large you'd think a film studio should have disappeared into them, ridiculous set pieces.. The docket list of offenses this movie commits during it's short life on your screen should be enough to lock up whoever had anything to do with it. And that's a shame, because I like Hugh Jackman and Dev Patel and I'm gonna miss 'em.

The bad gangsters which are getting mellow because now they have to care for a baby (Chappie), the engineers which can come and go in a high security area, fetch even arms out of the security area and so on and so on. There are maybe some good ideas in the film and sure, the special effects are well done, but man ... nobody can stand this story. The only good idea comes at the end, but I don't want to spoil, if somebody really wants to loose 2 hours of his live and feel bad afterwards, like me now.

Being a fan of Blomkamp's work on District 9, even more so. But while Elysium was a tolerable ego trip saved only by Matt Damon's performance, Chappie is the worst film I have seen in two or three years. It's just abominably bad. Chappie's only redeeming feature, being a Blomkamp effort, is its visual effects. But, being a Blomkamp effort, is it utterly devoid of character development, plot or intrigue. There are such massive, gaping plot holes in the already shallow and predictable narrative that I found myself laughing out loud at the absurdity of the assumptions made on the viewer's (lack of) intelligence.12 years ago an animator friend of mine passed me a flash drive with a 1:20 long clip by a budding SA director (Blomkamp) to watch and I remember being floored by it (you can see it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTnxP7e7-YA). That 1:20 clip is a better film than the entirety of Chappie.Sometimes - especially in this case - an artist's greatest work is produced under duress. Blomkamp, much like Shyamalan, will continue to decline rapidly as his resources expand. It's like he doesn't have to try - doesn't have to fight to create something magical - and it shows in this film.",Chappie
572,rains01,a very dangerous movie,1,18 May 2015,"I don't usually rush to write reviews about movies. the movies has either got to inspire me, surprise me or in the worst case disgust me to the point of considering severing all affections to it's makers and participants. Neill Blomkemp and Die Antwoord are 2 of South Africa main art exports and they have done wonders to the reputation of that country as something more than racially torn, crime ridden country. Chappie just erases all of that and makes me lose all respect to those 2 entities and their work past and present. I liked district 9, I forgave Elysium and I was really looking forward to Chappie, but boy, that movie sucks. I listen to and love Die antwoord music, I adore their self made video clips and artistic vision, but given a chance to make their mark, and it's a huge mark, on a full length movie, everything looks stupid, infantile and lame. it seems that their only artistic vision for this movie is to cover everything with ugly graffiti that it's main purpose is to advance their music albums and the sub culture they created called ""zef"". well, it achieved the exact opposite and now I despise everything zef. The script and direction of the movie seemed to be made by n 8 year old playing with his dolls. there are so many points of ""how the f$%# this is happening"", ""what were they thinking"" and ""this makes no sense at all"" that I couldn't watch anymore. I can count on one hand the number of time I stopped watching a movie in disgust and Chappie now joins this list. it all seems like the band had too much money to spend and they went and got themselves a respected director to make a movie built around their image and stupid vision. the result is horrendous. and to think I once considered Yolandi to be hot.",Chappie

I experienced it at an Imax cinema, which is probably the best way to experience it. the story was great, the action sequences superb and I genuinely became engrossed in seeing the poor little robot develop. it reminded me of Frankenstein, a powerful man made thing with the mind of a child who wanted to be loved and do right by people. it was also refreshing to see Hugh Jackman play against type. The dialogue was funny and engaging and the director once again explored discrimination and injustice in the world. You forget that Chappie is created by CGI and you genuinely feel for him and want it to end happily for him. I wont spoil it for you because you will enjoy going through the roller coaster ride me and my son went through for two very fast hours!when you start watching the film, you instantly think of ""I Robot"", ""Robocop"", ""Short Circuit"" and ""Frankenstein"" but it goes in a very original and entertaining direction which you don't expect. me and my son did not want it to end.

574,adiabloa,"Plot holes sure, bad movie not so much",10,14 March 2015,"Before I choose to see it I read some reviews here at IMDb and got mixed messages a lot mentioning that i should expect some plot holes, but as I entered the theater I had almost none expectations bad or good,since District 9 had risen above and beyond while Elysium had fallen quite short. So I tried my very best to be non judgemental, and boy was I surprised. Yes the movie had some holes, one for example being not telling the supervisors about the person who was guilty for shutting down all them scouts instantly, but as movies goes they're limited on time for starters amongst other things, so I expect that much from any movie. And with all that being said, it literally made my day, it was so entertaining on so many plains, the science, the humor, the drama, the action, the cgi, the way it made me sympathize with a robot, they portrayed the robot as a child and like a child he did what he was told and expected the results that he was thought by his parents/role models and couldn't make any other conclusions until he actually tried their teachings in the real world, and even then if he perhaps knew what he was doing might have been wrong far earlier he choose to ignore the facts because his trust to his parents was far stronger than his trust to reality and strangers, and until that trust had to be questioned and the facts couldn't be ignored. Like any other adult he kept doing it, no one got hurt by it, right? So his actions early on are to me nothing but explainable and as far as from the truth as other people have mentioned a plot hole.

576,jvw08,Entertaining & enjoyable movie,10,4 April 2015,"Firstly, let me just say I don't write reviews often. So this won't be a traditional review, but just my experience with the film.When I entered the cinema, all I knew was this film was about a robot and it was directed by the same director as District 9. I had no idea who the actors were, what the storyline entailed, nor did I have any prior expectations. I actually had rather low expectations.The film started rather slowly. I pieced together the story, and the introduction did remind me of district 9. I started to think, perhaps this film is just a rehash of the District 9 ideas and I was questioning why follow the same path? Then it introduced Die Antwood as actors. This was a double shock, early on within the film, and it had me start thinking whether this was simply going to end up being a poor cliché film. However, once the film actually gets started, and the main premise is set, and Chappie is introduced to the audience, along with Hugh Jackman, the film simply gets better and better, and surprisingly, so does the acting work of Die Antwood. I was actually impressed by how natural the Die Antwood crew filled their roles once their characters were established and properly introduced. They almost performed the roles in a self-depreciating way, making fun of the characters along with themselves in the process. The over-emphasis on their gangster ways provoked a few moments of laughter from myself and the audience. At first their characters almost seem dislikable, however, as the movie progresses you start to build empathy for them. They performed very well in the role, and they provided for the perfect contrast with the Engineer who designed Chappie (who Chappie refers to as his 'Creator'), played by Dev Patel, both of whom, provided the wildly contrasting influences upon Chappie during his development.This is a key part of the movie in my opinion. The underlying messages that the film seeks to portray and/or provoke among the audience is obviously and area where Neil focused. The dynamics that occur between the two major influences on Chappie, by his Creator, and his 'Mummy' and 'Daddy' (Die Antwood), reflect the real life influences that can be observed upon children and teenagers, and reminds the viewer of how environmental factors can play a large role in shaping a youths psyche. This movie does this surpassingly well in my opinion. The innocent, inexperienced and vulnerable Chappie is therefore exposed to these elements, out of his own free will and control. He has no say to what he is exposed to at a young age. He doesn't know any better, and therefore puts trust in those around him. As a result of this some scenes can make you feel strong emotion, and can actually come across as rather sad and endearing. This is definitely a key area where the film excels in my opinion, i.e. making you feel a connection and emotion for the character. Even if the character is just a robot. The film actually does this surprisingly well, much better than 95% of other films, where you don't care if the main character lives or dies.Now without giving the whole film away, I'll end on one more note. And that is, this film is also a lot of fun! The film never tries to take itself too seriously. In-fact, the entire storyline, when putting it into perspective, is absolutely ridiculous. The absurdness of some scenes, or of some pivotal characters and their entire craziness and far-fetchness etc (bordering on stereotypical clichés) provides for many humorous moments too. This is one of my favourite aspects of the film. In conclusion Chappie is an excellent, entertaining, original (yes original, which in this day and age is hard to come by) well written movie with solid acting. It offers a range of emotions and layers (depending upon the individual viewers demands). As a result it does surprisingly well in keeping the audience engaged throughout the entire movie (the entire cinema I watched the film in had people of all ages, and 100% of people stayed until the end of the credits, which is very rare for my local cinema, having seen 100's of movies there before and rarely seeing that occur). I personally think many people will enjoy this movie if you give it a chance, and I'm almost certain most people will enjoy this film it if you lower your expectations, relax, and just go in without your judgemental switch on. It really is a fun and enjoyable film and I am very happy I had to pleasure to see it.",Chappie

What I look for in a Sci fi movie is the concept , the pain of research into the concept and that little bit of zing and Neill Blomkamp is a master at making that happen. The casting itself is so fine. Everybody plays their part to perfection. Ninja and Yolandi as gangsters .. who would've thought. The humanization of the robot is perfect. So child like and human. He tugs at the heart for want of love. I have enjoyed this movie so much and have watched it so many times over and every time I do , I find myself more connected to it.

However, I didn't think Elysium was that obvious in making a joke of its topic, so I thought Blomkamp has been running out of mana and his next movie will completely blend in with the background.I'm happy I was wrong - this movie was hilarious and ridiculously absurd and in my opinion this is the best way for a mainstream movie to deal with complicated topics that are just not meant for mainstream movies - by making fun of them. I say this especially in the light of the recent rush of AI-vandalizing movies that came with high ambition but really turned me off.I was also surprised to see Die Antwoord perform longer than the duration of their appearance in the trailer, but instead being among the main act - a fresh idea that I think worked nicely too.Not without its share of cheesiness, but still a very enjoyable movie: 9/10.",Chappie

I expected that this would be more of the same. Both are still present, but surprisingly, with laughs.This is one of the more entertaining movies from every angle that I've seen in awhile. I described it as I left as funny, sad, uplifting, dark, light, silly, and tense.The center of the story is Chappie. He is a hero you want to shelter, even though you want him to learn. But even as you love his curiosity, you fear his naiveté. He is the most complex character, and gives a fascinating paradigm into how children must receive and process human society and contradiction. There are some inconsistencies in Chappie's character (is he already programmed to raise his voice if he's scared, or did he learn that?), but he still succeeds as a dynamic, independent being.Yes, the humans characters are flat. They are merely roles. The Maker. The Villain. Mommy and Daddy. The friend. But as Chappie begins to learn, you see why they have to be flat. They are trying to exert influence on a (robotic) child. Therefore, they must simplify their own motivations and desires into the most basic explanations possible for Chappie to understand. This leads to hilarious imitation and thought-provoking perspectives.Chappie's curiosity was once ours. Chappie's confusion was once ours. Watching Chappie is like watching a sped-up version of childhood social and moral development, with all of the Hollywood tension, explosions, and naughty words to keep you interested, too. There are parts to laugh at because it's funny, parts to laugh at because the costuming and set design is ridiculous, but you still end up thinking seriously the whole time.Give it a chance.

Chappie on the other hand tries to deliver the same experience but with the director and writers' hands tied behind their back as they try to flesh this out. I fell in love with the concept of this film since Tetra Vaal was released. When Martin Scorsese gave the writer of Wolf Of Wall Street, Terrence Winter, the plot of the movie, he said he wanted the same feel and pace of Goodfellas. Neill must've taken that on to himself with writing this compared to District 9, along with similarities to Elysium. (Sigh) A big disappointment to everyone, I know, yet it was a great concept! Also, believe me when I say that Chappie is one-hundred times better than Elysium. So, on to the film itself. The first twenty minutes are great, setting the real story of the film. Clichés aside, it goes well for the first half. Then ambiguity started to sink into the writers' heads and brought on an Elysium-type concept. Too much concept, not enough great writing. I'm a fan of Die Antwoord, the crazy rap experimental group that takes up three- fourths of the film's screen time, and I was pleasantly surprised by their performances. I don't think I'll be seeing them at the Academy Awards ever, besides maybe performing some outrageous song, but nevertheless, good acting. As the story continues, Yolandi's time with Chappie grows on you and you quite to really enjoy the chemistry of great voice-acting from Sharlto Copley (playing Chappie) with his immediate sympathized character love that you could compare to the Prawn species in D9, and maybe even Elephant Man. The art concepts of Die Antwoord's palace as you may call it was a beautiful touch by the crazy group, and gave it a good feel for fans of them that they were playing themselves. (Also retaining their stage names). Dev Patel's screen time is nothing compared to Die Antwoord's which was bothersome, and even more so; Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver. Remember how in Elysium, Weaver had five minutes on screen? She has three in this. With no character development, and no sense of even being a character. Hugh Jackman was a cliché jealous coworker but did shine with some direction from Blomkamp in some scenes. Emphasis on some. The fact that they practically brought this robot police tank-like fighter straight out of a mash-up of D9's ending, Robocop, and Avatar made it feel unoriginal. Sixty minutes into the film, you're still liking it. And the scenes between Yolandi and Chappie still hang over everything else. The use of the ""Black Sheep"" story is a nice touch, but hangs a little too close to being overused, Next, we have the last twenty-five minutes. Warning: laughter of ridiculous ambiguity ensued from me, along with the small audience I sat with in the cinema. Remember when in Avatar, they use a machine to transfer your consciousness into some other body? Here it is, being even more ridiculous. I won't get into it, but wow is it cringey, along with just bad writing. A fight scene that's so well setup turns into a backtracking mission of wounded ""protagonists"" and death scenes that don't make you feel anything. Originality gets squashed and turns into a slo-mo scene of Michael Bay garbage. At this point, my friend had dropped his popcorn on the floor mistakenly, but ended up becoming a metaphor for how bad this film became. Fast forward an awful fifteen minutes of Interstellar-type- ambiguity-nonsense, and here we are. One person after another, getting their consciousness into something else that I won't mention, making this movie dumber by the minute. The last shot opens it for a sequel (God, please don't make a sequel) and makes you ""wanting"" more. I wasn't feeling any desire for this film to go on or be dragged into a worse sequel. I know I speak mostly ill of this movie, but I give it a 7/10 for good directing for most of it, and a new take on some old concepts that go back to the 80s. Great VFX (which I usually hate in nowaday superhero films and the fantastic (sarcasm) Transformers franchise.Pros- - It's fun. - Smart writing for three-fourths of the film. - Sharlto Copley's voice performance, along with Die Antwoords'. - Some original concepts. - Blomkamp's fun directing style. - Great VFX.Cons- - Falls flat on its face towards the end. - Forced emotion. - Too. Much. Ambiguity. - Not enough screen time for the ""stars"". - Writing gets dull. - Clichés all over. - Overall undeveloped concept that could've been way better.",Chappie

A premise that included a promising setting, on the heels of District Nine's eclectic success. And of course included leading roles played by Weaver and Jackman. As if on cue, those two played their parts in a similarly clueless fashion. Jackman at times almost resorting to a ""muahaha"" as a plot antagonist. Some of his scenes included facial expression bordering on the campy, in a story that was decidedly serious. (Notwithstanding interactions with Chappie were unavoidably comical, but camp was not part of that.) This was Hugh Jackman without his makeup on, and it wasn't pretty.I give the movie a 3 on the strength of the robots...",Chappie
590,zeroja2,Just watch it. Then think about it,9,19 June 2015,"This movie is not about robocops. It's not about criminals. Sure, it presents itself that way, sometimes shows some goofy scenes, some funny jokes. Yet the main idea behind it is probably ""what does it mean to be alive?"". What is consciousness? What makes us human? Is it only the body? The mind? Rational thought and logic would tear this movie apart, but that can be said about almost every movie ever made. Don't think that way, don't look at it that way. Try to open your mind a little and read between the lines. Sure, sometimes it's cheesy, goofy, over-the-top, but for me, at least, it was well worth the time. Watched it a week after seeing Ex Machina. They share the basic idea, but this time it's more up-close. A well crafted movie for someone who likes to see beyond what's on the surface.",Chappie
591,collateralcable,"This is a movie that follows Chappie, a robot previously used on the police force, as he is given a new intelligence that can think and create for itself.",6,9 June 2017,"Chappie is a scout robot from the police force who has experienced damage beyond repair. Before destruction, his creator, Deon Wilson, wishes to run an experiment on him by installing an intelligence that thinks, learns, and designs. However, when this falls into the hands of a street gang, Chappie must learn to chose his own right and wrong as he hears the conflicting views of Deon and the various gang members. This is where the movie truly shines. It creates a setting that makes viewers question their own morals and cheer for Chappie as he strives for a moral life. For the most part, this was a movie that focused on emotion instead of computerized action, and I loved that about it. However, without giving anything away, I can say that the ending did not leave me feeling as though the movie was complete. I found myself wanting certain scenes relating to Chappie's imagination to last longer, while wanting less scenes relating to the gang members' lives. I also believe that certain characters were far from well developed, while some were completely unnecessary. I believe this movie could have added time to its run time without dragging out the plot and still allowing characters to be well-developed. In summary, Chappie gives its audiences much to consider, yet it finds itself suffering from a variety of flaws. However, having said all of this, it was not a bad movie, it was simply less than what it could have been. I hope I can see more movies such as this that strive for great depth.",Chappie
592,GrafSchmidt,"""Where suspension of disbelief dare""",6,9 January 2016,"The plot is simple: strong and capable robots mounted on titanium chassis, with some sort of A.I. (without consciousness) are built in order to do the job humans don't want to anymore (taking bullets and heavy fire). At a certain point a damaged unit is sent for scrapping, but the genius Indian boy (who said Indians can't program? Hah!) who invented their A.I., turns out to have compiled the first artificial consciousness in the world and he's going to install it into this defective unit. From there a gangastah robot will become the first A.I. of the world.The viewers are advised on the beginning to arm themselves with a great suspension of disbelief. First of all I can't understand why it is said the robots are made of titanium. Even if it is 5 times stronger than steel, you can't expect the chest hull can stop a .50 BMG. Unless you have let's say 30 or more cm thick armor. They built robots capable of superhuman feats, I'd expect to see titanium skeletons covered by much more technological carbon polymers. Then even if we can believe those robots are made out of titanium, I can't even imagine how many weak points they have. Sensors on the head are exposed and easily to target as well as the CPU, a single circuit with a usb-port shielded from the external environment by a simple 5 mm thick titanium plate.So, a defective unit is going to be updated by a consciousness.dat - I must confess that even an amateur programmer like me can't believe you can write a C++ or c# consciousness and including it into a single archive. I would expect Prolog, or something similar, not the same logic you program your everyday pc programs. They just need a simple way for Hugh Jackson to remote turn off all the scouts at once with one single file creating the cheap kill switch ever.After Chappie is a teenage gangstah like robot, he figures out a way to use a sensor helmet capable of reading human brain activities, in an helmet able to read the ""consciousness"" of a living being (robotic or human, yeah whatever). I can understand the helmet can read human brains ... how can it work with a piece of hardware such as Chappie? His brain is an overclocked Intel i7 with some Nvidia GPUs and a few giga of RAM - it's 2016 and their idea of a self-conscious brain is an IBM compatible device enclosed into a titanium hull. Hey it was 1980 when Star Trek The Next Generation said the android Data had a ""positronic brain"" made specifically to simulate human brain activity.And then it comes Hugh Jackman and still I can't figure out why he does carry his gun around the office - Texas' style - while being an engineer, and while he had been a ... what, NSA agent?And the movie ends with a bang, meaning it becomes bloody and splatter with a sudden change of style.Not a bad movie but we've seen better.",Chappie
593,suzie767,This film is amazing,10,14 June 2015,"Although low budget with some unknown actors it's brilliantly executed and very well acted by Sharlto Copley who manages to inject more humanity into his performance as a robot than most actors playing human. The story line, while fairly predictable is entertaining and the character arc of each of the characters very well done. Characters that are unlikeable at the beginning become someone you care aboutHugh Jackman's performance is a little featureless but his casting is good - outside of his usual macho action hero role to someone is weak and selfishI found this very emotionally gripping and I'm looking forward to watching it again",Chappie

Ordering a pizza just to rob the pizza delivery guy? Using ninja stars as actual weaponry? Motocross protective gear? A sudden maternal instinct to say ""Oh, Chappie"" repeatedly to a microwave just because it can say ""mommie""? Or a major robotics corporation's blatant disregard for the first and only conscious robot created in human history? So why did I watch the movie for 1 hour and 30 minutes before I decided to turn it off? Was it because I kept feeling like the script was going to improve once every 15 minutes? I will answer all my questions with ""I just don't know.""

This movie reminds me of Ex Machina and Wall-E together. I read this movie got a bad rap but I personally liked it. The end is not predictable like most movies are. And the special effects are top of the line! Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver really shine in this movie, and colorful characters such as hippo and Ninja really make the movie more alive. This movie does have a lot of swearing language, very brief nudity shown on TV, and very brief dismember body. It may not suitable for little kids because of the reasons I described earlier. The end of movie really shocked me. It defies all science as we know it. I may not spend money to watch this in the theater, but I will definitely rent the movie.

This is a solid sci-fi flick that attempts to tackle big questions about artificial intelligence, consciousness, humanity, and the will to live. All the while providing an entertaining and surprisingly funny and emotional experience. The South African rap duo ""Die Antwoord"" featured heavily in this film are not the strongest actors in the world, but they serve their roles well. However, Sharlto Copley does an amazing job in providing the movie with its heart and soul, ironically through his performance of the titled robot ""Chappie"". Not a perfect film by any means, but Blomkamp and sci-fi fans in general would get a kick out of this. I give it a 7.8/10",Chappie

Great fun, lots of laugh-out-loud moments as well as action and I particularly liked the baby-child-teenager developments of the newly sentient robot. No boring bits either. There are a few clichéd scenes which is why its 9 stars for me and not 10, but the rest of the film more than makes up for it. I can only assume the poor ratings this film has undeservedly attracted are down to the release timing and poor unrepresentative trailers, and maybe the title? I had no idea Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman were in the film, and it didn't really make any difference, it didn't need them. I hope it grows in popularity through TV, it deserves to.

Not much of the movie made sense, and the sad thing is the director really wanted you to care about the bad guys, rather than cops, I really wanted them to be killed, I also cannot believe I watched the whole thing, thinking it will get better.I'm pretty sure the high ratings were paid by those who've worked for the movie or something close to it. The only way you would actually like this movie, is if you just started watching movies and you don't really know much about movies, seriously. Don't waste your time on it.",Chappie

This movie was so bad, I actually fell asleep half an hour into it, so i felt confused with the story and walked out of the movie house a few times on purpose. Simply put, this movie is about a dumb robot that acts retarded throughout the entire film and they throw in Hugh Jackman in there just to make the movie seem more ""pleasant"" and ""watchable"" yet it is trying hard to hide the fact that it is ""laughable"" (in a bad way) and belongs in the $5 shitty movie bin at WAL-MART.

Niell managed to involve all the action, drama, comic relief and special effects, but still managed to keep an interesting story and interesting characters with exquisite Blomkamp flare.The dynamic were slightly clunky, but every film has things wrong with it. Many complain that the accents weren't up to scratch and, kind of annoying; but what they didn't realize was that that was what made the character (Chappie). It set him apart from the rest of the world. People also didn't like Hugh Jackman's character, but I found he was still an engaging character, even though he might seem generic at a glance.Some might argue that the story has been use dozens of times in movies, but never before has a movie presented it in such a way, with the gritty realism and different mix.This movie is a must-see - 10/10",Chappie

It is rare that this many people get something wrong but Chappie is the most thought-provoking action sci-fi movie since the Matrix. Deal with it. *Apparently, I have to add more lines to this review so I will explain...This movie checks every box a movie can hit with absolute authority. It's got the unstoppable action, creative vision of the future, premium effects, tear-jerker moments, pain, tension, joy, thrill and a perfect ending. This movie will also make you think about the nature of humanity and consciousness in a unique way. Whereas District 9 is a little overrated, this is grossly misunderstood.

I went to the theater with an open mind despite seeing reviews from both camps. After viewing the movie to the end, I walked out somewhat baffled by what I'd watched. The first impression, ten minutes in, was that the dialog was written by a twelve year old child, maybe ten. Characterizations likewise seemed so utterly juvenile. Fine. Whatever. So it's a kids movie? Right? Wrong! Blood and guts, adult themes, and really immature gangsters portrayed as somehow likable. Horrible script! What is this? Disney gone wrong? There was such a discordant note running through this mess. Are film-makers really so desperate for revenue that they stoop to lowly marketing ploys? Are adults dumbed down to the extent of enjoying such ploys? I'm thinking it's decrepit marketing. ""Let's just bandwidth the audience to the lowest common denominator,""said the executive producers. Terri is a much better writer than this...this...train-wreck deserves. District 9 had an adult theme and appropriate dialog. This film did not meet both criteria. Now I understand the critical reviews stating this film as a failure in execution. Insulting to adults, detrimental to kids. Shame on you Neill Blomkamp. You let us down in many ways. Minus many stars for wasting, insulting exceptional talent. 4/10 only for amazing production values and CGI. Everything else is garbage, including the choice to have Chappie's AI ""learn"" in a totally absurd manner. That's all.",Chappie

All you can hope for is that they'll find their real self before it's too late...I usually don't like violent movies, or films about gangsters, druggies, and such. This has all these components in it - however, it was very clear to me, that I would never, ever want to live in a world as depicted there. (Not like most other movies with these topics, where that attitude towards life is idolized and glorified...)Never mind what the critics say, watch it yourself - what have you got to loose? 2 hours of your life.

This is more of a warning than a review.I saw the high rating on IMDb and gave this movie a shot. The trailer looked decent and reminded me of good action scenes in District 9. I wanted to leave while watching the movie so many times. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did... I had my hopes up when the thugs were teaching Chappie how to stab people that he'd stab them, I'd have a laugh, and we'd move on to some other characters and a better movie! But I was let down on that one. The movie doesn't go anywhere. You just hang out with the obnoxious Die Antwoord members the whole time. Others have mentioned the movie being like Short Circuit and Robocop, but the movie even adds a flare of Transcendence towards the end -- Chappie figures out how to transfer consciousness to save his maker, himself and even ""mommy."" Ninja keeps going on about a heist he wants Chappie to help him with the whole movie. The heist was my ticket price and 2 hours. I felt frustrated and let down after watching this movie.

Obviously it's not the best movie in the world but I've found it to be very entertaining.The CGI is top. The Chappie felt very real. The Moose not so though. Despite the critics I liked the gang of Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika. They've humored me. One thing I thought was believable were the interfaces of the computers/programs they were using. Not too futuristic. They have made it simple as I would imagine so. Not that futuristic-super-cool-buttons-to-fix-stuff that we usually get on sci-fi movies. One thing I didn't appreciate was the time span of the movie. I would believe it more if the learning process of Chappie wouldn't take so few days. Maybe some months for him to learn, investigate and evolve. That would be more believable in my opinion.Hugh Jackman was not that great. It's was the typical bad guy cliché. Sigourney Weaver part could have be done by a totally different actress. Dev Patel is not my favorite actor as well but it was alright.There were some exaggerations throughout the movie but they weren't a big turn-off to me.This movie is more like a 6.5 to me but as you can't rate to the decimal I've round it up. It's a little unfair to other movies of my 7 pool but that's life.Go see it for yourself and try to enjoy it. I've seen it with no expectations and that was the best thing I could do!By the way, please stop the 1 reviews madness.

607,TheGreatKhanOfPatagonia,Neil Blomkamp's worst film by far,3,16 August 2017,"Neil Blomkamp is one of my favourite directors, he has never made a film I have not absolutely loved, until I watched Chappie. I hate the idea of sentient AI, I hate the theory in real life and the theme in fiction, this is from someone who codes for a living, I can tell you this can never happen no matter how hard you try. But that isn't the main reason I didn't like this film at all. It's the ending, not only did Chappie somehow use a helmet to detect neural brainwaves, even though he has no organic brain, but his Creator used it to literally transfer his consciousness into a robot's body. There is no explanation in the film of how this works, and in real life it you would have more or a chance of transferring your contentiousness to a machine by banging your head against it.I ending hits especially hard if you consider Neil Blomkamp's other works. In all of Blomkamp's films he keeps the ""Fi"" in ""Sci-Fi"" to a minimum, he used things that could be possible, or improved versions of existing things, and if something does not exist, he finds a way of making it damn cool and unique. The start of this film does just that, it looks believable and extremely cool at the same time. But half an hour into the film this dies, the film becomes extremely boring and less and less believable. I find none of the characters believable or likable except Huge Jackman's character, of whom I felt myself rooting for by the end.This is by far Blomkamp's worst film, on a technical level and compared to his other films, this film is garbage. It was boring, stupid, unbelievable and was filled with countless obvious plot hols. If you are a fan of Blomkamp's or with grounded Sci-Fi in general, do yourself a favour and give this film a miss, it will do nothing for you. If you are into action, then the first 20 minutes or so is interesting, but the other hour and 40 minutes are a complete drag.",Chappie

The concept, idea and thoughtfulness presents itself within the first 20 minutes and then it is all downhill. This movie forgets the fine line between being queer & being inane quite often. You are left with some sparks of magic but it falls short, by a long mile. I think the director forgot to make the best of two superb cast members - Hugh Jackman & Sigourney Weaver. AI is a wonderful concept to work on for any medium. It is also a double edged sword - can backfire easily. This one backfires very quickly. Truly forgettable experience.",Chappie

If you want to have a good laugh and wish to see a movie that is at times surprising and unpredictable, Chappie is the right film to see. Watching the movie is a fun way to spend the evening, although the characters do lack a bit of character development. As the story progresses the characters that surround Chappie change, but the changes are abrupt and without reason, not enough is displayed to allow this kind of change, which some may find an annoyance. Finally the ending is just as well original as in hilarious, as the movie sidetracks itself from displaying a possible future to a somewhat version of Ex: Machina. Overall 7/10, go see the movie.

With the perfect juxtaposition of an incredible range of plot elements (such as Chappie's doll of ""mommy"" who is a drug dealer) themes are more naturally drawn out--not too forced--as a movie concerned with AI can be--ie Terminator. The trade-off is slight ambiguity, which provides the basis of the film's criticism, but in life developments in technology will always be ambiguous. Technology is art, much like this film.

Let me put it this way : if you liked District 9, Bicentennial Man, Robocop, gangster movies or even Iron Man, then you'll have a good time watching Chappie, as it's a mix of all those. And while doing a mix is not original, the things that this movie approaches differently, plus the great CGI, will worth watching. Not to mention the social and behavioral aspects that Chappie explores (e.g. the barbaric behavior of humans towards different ""creatures"").Have fun watching.",Chappie
614,nosheen-96943,I love this movie,10,26 September 2015,"It is my first review as I was really impressed with this movie. When I seen box office collection I wasn't expecting much from this movies except typical robotic movie. I would rate this movie 100 times better then Avengers movie. Movie has a story, action and most important emotions. I really enjoyed this movie from start to end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who love Sci-Fi movies but also a story which make some sense not like Avengers which most of the time is lot of rubbish. Movie starts very well but it has similarities with Robocop and I thought oh no, not another one but as movie progressed and Chappie was born, it was altogether different story.",Chappie
615,easybullet3,"Completely unoriginal, but good for kids.",4,15 March 2015,"Chappie has ripped-off MAJOR story parts from Robocop. (namely: 2 robots, 1 is good and 1 is bad). The developer of the bad robot wants to get the police to buy his robot (instead of the good robot). So he sets about to ruin and destroy the good robot. also: the design of the Bad Robot has been completely ripped off from the bad robot in Robocop!also: the Good robot in Robocop had a HUMAN-side (emotions etc) to make you sympathize with him more... which is EXACTLY the same as the HUMAN emotion in Chappie. (again,, completely ripped off from Robocop). The idea of the Robot wanting to continually be HOME with mum and dad is ripped off from A.I. (Spielberg Movie)The sketching/painting that the Chappie does is Completely ripped off from i-robot (will smith movie)OK, About the actual Story and Acting and Characters:the story has some MAJOR goofs in it!! Anyone over 14 years old will know that a Murdering Hijacker DOES NOT JUST LET THE HIJACKED PERSON WALK FREE!!! it was really stupid. Me and my friends looked at each-other in the cinema with a ""what the hell just happened?"" expression! it was a really silly flaw in the story-line. the guy who made Chappie ought to have been killed on several occasions (but the murdering/villain/hijacking/drug-dealer/bad boy lets him go every time!!) so silly.. it is assuming the audience are fools and don't notice this. its kind of offensive to the intelligence of the audience.Acting was Average.Chappie was the BEST actor in the story! LolHugh Jackman probably realized (from the success of Real Steel) that Robot movies are a good money-spinner. And in this movie he makes a pretty bad attempt at being a 'bad guy'. (he grew a goatee for the role in an attempt to look 'bad'). but his acting was unconvincing. Finally: the movie is quite Violent. (its a bit too violent for a kids movie).I enjoyed the South African setting.the BEST part of the movie was Chappie. They did a GREAT job of getting the audience connected to his emotions. Chappie made the whole movie watchable.For kids this is PERFECT.. (except for some violent scenes). For adults, (if you can avoid thinking about the blatant stupidities in the story and bad acting and plagiarized plot), then its an enjoyable movie :)",Chappie
616,sangabriel72,Awful.,1,11 July 2015,"If you think this is a sci-fi movie about a robot then you are completely wrong. This movie is all about a couple of South African rappers. These two talentless wannabe actors couldn't have advertised themselves better if they paid Neill Blomkamp. This is a 2 hour long advertisement of a South African rap duo.It is awful. It makes you wanna ask yourself if that's the guy who made District 9 and Elysium.Those were great movies. Especially District 9 was one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen. It was original, it was beautifully shot. Chappie on the other hand feels-to say the least- cheap.

If you're looking at this movie with a critical eye, it's very disappointing.The movie was simply not believable, for a host of reasons. To name a few...-The Moose robot has guns, cluster bombs and anti-aircraft technology.For some inexplicable reason it also has claws for decapitating humans. Why? -The creator of the Moose robot is inexplicably a mass murderer who doesn't seem to fear the fact that he could be held accountable for killing people with his robot. -The firm building the robots has exactly two programmers working on all the robots. Nobody knows what the other hundreds of employees do. -Their security is so lax that one programmer is able to upload a virus to all of the robots and take them offline without anyone knowing that he did it. The other programmer is able to steal a defunct robot and modify it as he sees fit - Again no one notices. -Somehow a helmet used for controlling a robot via a human brain is modified so that people can save their consciousness to a computer? -Uploading one's consciousness inexplicably removes it from the computer/human body that it is presently stored in? Except for when Chappie's mom's consciousness is saved to a flash drive?-A multi billion dollar security firm doesn't have any backups of their robot firmware? They have no contingency plan for when their robots go offline?The lack of scientific / technological understanding is just so bad. The writers clearly either didn't understand, or didn't care about the basics of how computer science works.",Chappie
618,pbutlerg,Great theme underrated by critic concerned with perfection.,7,24 March 2017,"This movie is a critics nightmare. Involving important concepts which they think they know about. A brave attempt by the director/writer Neill Blomkamp. His style so anti Hollywood executive but plenty gun action to keep them happy. This delightful movie definitely could be better or a lot worse, they still had ""Y"" Hollywood computer button. Two of the minor characters were interesting and deserve credit. The script could of been better, a little Wes Anderson bizarre , not a bad thing. Starlighting Weaver, Jackman, Patel. They earned their dollars professionally being but out shown by Watkin Tudor Jones and Chappies Mommy . This is no Ex Machina/Terminator but a more realistic view on Asimov AI birth. Understated special effects were superb, such a modern day rarity. These critics however are spoilt from Kramer vs Kramer and 12 Angry Men.

621,appysamanosuke,"The other side of AI, the beautiful one.",8,5 March 2018,"Its not the same old ""Artificial Intelligence taking over the world"" kind of a story, but begins with the inevitable and obvious,disruption of human society. What leads to this you ask?watch the movie and find out.
Its my first Neill Blomkamp movie, and I must say I relished every single moment of it. The concept of AI had to be introduced by some nerdy-brainy scientist-programmer and that role was played by Dev Patel. Ex-military turned engineer, the main antagonist Hugh Jackman was the main reason I wanted to watch the movie in the first place.
And of course, not to forget the main lead, Chappie himself, voiced by Sharlto Copley.
The fact that this movie doesn't take place in New York, or any other part of the States prone to alien attacks or rise of deadly zombies, is comforting.
The evolution of the character Chappie is a beautiful journey. A loving and caring mom, and a drunken mean father, also a understanding uncle, are the roles played by the supporting cast. The story does show the ugly side of human nature, with every single person being self centred. The 'maker' Dev Patel wanted to test his newly developed AI program and used Chappie as a test subject. Ninja plays the role of a daddy who again tricks Chappie into crimes for his personal gain, and looks at him like he is nothing more than a pile of talking metal chunk. Hugh Jackman, jeopardizes the safety of the whole city, just so that he can test his own ""superior drone"" and taste success,on which Dev Patel was basking till now.His superior drone, is literally over-kill and ruthless, literally cutting a man in half. 
In all this self-centeredness and mayhem, Chappie doesnt lose his humble and kind hearted nature. Not only that he makes you love him by his childish antics in the beginning, makes your eyes moist as he feels pain(actually he can't) but he surpasses his creator, his 'maker' and creates something bigger, better, something which only can be dreamed of. Exactly that should be the purpose of AI, to go beyond capabilities of humans to create something more. Every other film,(or at least many of them) focus on the dark side of AI, but this one shows that if nurtured with love, AI can help solve the ultimate question, making fiction into reality.
One more thing that I really like, in any movie is to end it with a question which makes viewers want more, which keeps the possiblity of the second part alive, which can continue to live on its legacy and take it forward.
Chappie is a really under-rated movie, and if you want to watch something beautiful such as a robot more human than its creator himself, then this makes up for a really touching and rewarding affair.",Chappie

625,ferlie_burns,Chappie Has a Voice,8,8 March 2015,"""Chappie"" isn't perfect, but the bottom line is, no one but Neill Blomkamp could've made this film. The picture has a singular voice, manifests a unique view of the world. It's funny, bizarre, ridiculous, idiosyncratic, compelling. It's also very touching. ""Chappie"" expresses itself, rather than caters to audience expectations. Isn't that the point of art/entertainment?If you wanna dig, there are also some really interesting things going on here thematically - the film presents a society in which the government's response to destitution is an iron fist, which provokes violence from the population. This in turn provokes an even harsher reaction from the government. So look at Chappie the character. He is given the choice to turn to violence or benevolence - different role models teach him with different ways of living. In the end, even though he gives in to violence and anger when his mother is killed, he forgives her killer (in a hilarious moment) and in the end chooses benevolence.",Chappie

I usually don't write reviews, but after seeing the brutal rating this movie is getting I felt compelled to write this review.Chappie is a funny, entertaining, and surprisingly sentimental movie about a sentient robot being raised by gangsters in Johannesburg. Most of the criticisms I've seen about one- dimensional characters and illogical character choices are valid, but Chappie's character, the CGI, the humor, and the overall aesthetic of the movie more than make up for these shortcomings.Please go see this movie and make up your own mind. I almost didn't go last night because of the negative reviews, but I'm so happy I did. I'm very excited to see this movie again. You leave this movie feeling like you've become friends with Chappie, and I hope the bad reviews don't prevent the sequels from being made.If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this movie.",Chappie

The robot moves so lifelike and that's what makes it a relatable character along with Deon played by Dev Patel is great The sense of worry he gives and accomplishment in his voice and overall movements feels like a real person not just an actor playing a character. As for Chappie voiced by Sharlto Copley it's so lifelike and unique as what the perspective of how an artificial intelligence would actually arise.

637,ronaldhenderson,Expected more,5,15 March 2015,"The film started with an interesting plot. Unfortunately it lapsed back in a standard course of the film, little predictive, simple story. The social criticism could have been more exploited. The acting performance was of the entire cast was good. The parts of Weaver and Jackman were small with little content and likely in the film to put on the billboard. The performance of Die Antwoord duo was good. Sadly, there characters ware put down as caricatures. One-liners included. It's too laughable. The motion capture performance of the robot Chappie was brilliantly done and keeps the film up. Disturbing was the sloppiness, especially in the end. By the ridiculousness it is easy to watch, entertaining, but still halfway I was bored.",Chappie

I realize for the sake of time we cant get to involved details like SECURITY of a multi-billion dollar company ...but cmon. People taking equipment, lock keys, going in and out like its a public facility. And the bad guys/good guys ( hazy line here ) kidnapping Patel then letting him come and go as he pleased.....

I would have saved the money.They tried to get to much into the story of the film. Had the director removed a few screw up characters from the story.Graphically the movie is appealing.

641,peppe-staf,Reply to joazito,8,18 May 2015,"Jozito said (my reply in brackets):Hard to swallow plot #1: The robots can only be reprogrammed in the presence of a unique key USB disk. The developer just picks it up and takes it home, spends several days with it, and no one bats an eye. (it's useful for the story, not the best solution, but he is the creator and anyway the security called him).#2: Chappie is born with the knowledge of a baby. But miraculously he learns the English language in a couple of days of exchanging a few sentences with his ""parents"". (A lot of time during the film they say he will learn much faster, also he didn't learn a perfect English, i don't see the problem)#3: The bad guys let the developer, which they just stole and beat the crap of, come and go as he pleases. No worries of him alerting the authorities or his companies' own robot army. Which he doesn't, inexplicably.(Of course the creator, or developer, didn't alert the authorities, was his fault and he could be accused of everything.)#4: For someone so intelligent, Chappie is pretty dumb. He knows shooting someone kills them but is convinced that knifing ""just makes them sleep"". (at the point 2 you are saying that he learn to fast, now is dumb, mmh? He was learning, the creator told him not to shot people, he doesn't know it hurts, he just doesn't do it because he was told him to do so. Also he has seen the effect of the firearms, but not of knife. They fooled him because nobody have told him what's a knife is).#5: After lying to manipulate the robot every step of the way, the ""bad daddy"" decides to come clean and admit that in fact he can't prevent Chappie's demise. Which obviously results in almost getting killed. (All the story is about the ""bad guy"" being schizophrenic, i think he did it pretty well, is obvious that is not ""all bad"", he's a junkie with a lot of problems but he cares about the robot anyway. He told him and probably was thinking they would find another solution and the robot wouldn't kill him anyway). #6: The same ""bad daddy"" then does a complete flip flop and puts his life on the line to save Chappie. Which is going to die in a few hours anyway. And not in any effective way I might add, he just decides to become a sitting duck for some reason. (He tried to get time so the girlfriend, the developer and robot could save their life. It wasn't only the robot, that had a chance to live anyway).#7: The factory where all the mayhem originated from is the least secure place in the city. And absolutely no one, except for the protagonist and the antagonist, are able to go to the command console and sort things out. In fact it just remains abandoned in all other times. (I didn't like this too).#8: The childlike robot prodigy miraculously (again) is able to do a feat no else had: transfer consciousness. With some banged up laptop too. (He's not child anymore, is almost the end of the movie and he has learnt a lot more through internet too. It wasn't only a banged laptop, but a lot of PS4 linked together to help with the CPUs. I know, is not really realistic but they tried and is not that bad, they even added ""CPU alert"" and it's not perfect, but OK.).#9: Police is nowhere to be seen, and despite being perfectly possible to restore the malfunctioning robots from the control central no one decides to even try it. There's just frantic panic and cowboy stunts.(yes, this is a plot hole)",Chappie

649,jeremyjobe,"Truly, TRULY the singular worst movie I have seen in 34 years of existence. Why did the other reviewers do this to me?",1,8 March 2015,"I have no words for how bad it was. I was thinking of crafting a heated letter to Hugh Jackman and demanding he reimburse me for 2 hours of my life. It was so bad that I used to like District 9, but my consciousness has traveled back in time and now hates it for reminding me of Chappie. It was my personal Vietnam set to film. Terrible plot, combined with every single actor simultaneously putting on the worst acting performances of their respective careers. I just ate some cheesecake to try and take this day down a notch.I don't want to hate the reviewers that posted positive ratings before me, but a small part of me truly does. Why, WHY would you play this cruel joke on your fellow IMDBers? There is no way anyone actually went to this movie and walked out thinking ""That was pretty good!"" How, how, please God, why are there 10/10 reviews all over this page?When I am 80 years old and on my death bed, I will look back and wonder what I might have been able to do with the 2 hours that I once squandered watching Chappie.",Chappie
650,hvafaen,Nothing more than an OK sci-fi action movie,6,8 March 2015,"Chappie himself was a brilliant character beautifully played by Sharlto Copley, but he couldn't lift this movie alone. Most of the other main characters are well acted, but their character development are close to non existent. I had a hard time caring for anyone other than Chappie. The biggest downfall is two main characters played by the real hip hop group ""Die antwoord"", who play them self, in a way.. They are not good actors, they are not interesting, and they had way too much screen time in this movie.The story was decent, but not as fresh as it could have been. It borrowed a lot from other AI movies, and had the potential to do something different, but didn't really use it that well. They did send Chappie in a different direction than I anticipated, but that didn't justify the lack of depth I expected from the same director as District 9. Overall, this is an OK sci-fi movie. It is entertaining, but it falls short in most aspects to be a ""good"" movie for me. Worth a watch if you like AI sci-fi, or if you just want a decent action movie.6/10",Chappie
651,candy1387,Fun movie,9,4 March 2015,Here is my review of #ChappieMovie ...I really really loved it!!! (I only wish I wouldn't take that last seat in the theater which was on the first row!!! My head was ready to explode) so the movie just collected everything -it was funny and it was so sad sometimes ..then it was full of action and murders and blood ...lol but really entertaining and cool:)) I fell in love with Chappie))) and oh my god #DieAntwoord were amazing in the movie:)))) they played so good!!! I'm gonna listen to their songs again now:))) I remember I was a big fan of them:)) overall -funny and sad and some drama and full of action:)) I'm reading now bad reviews on different websites but I really really liked it and the whole theater was applauding at the end!!!:))) #Chappie,Chappie
652,yj-choi79,"I'm glad that I watched this movie despite the unreasonable reviews that rated this ""1""",8,12 October 2015,"I usually don't write reviews but I feel this movie deserves to be rated better than it currently is (similar to ""Automata"" - which is also underrated). The criticism in several reviews which rated this movie a ""1"" is not reasonable. I agree with several positive reviewers who find it difficult to comprehend the level of hate being expressed there - it doesn't make sense. The acting and the storyline are not THAT bad - on the contrary: This was a quite enjoyable science fiction experience, despite perhaps minor imperfections. I almost didn't watch this movie because of the bad reviews, but I'm glad that I still did. Form your own opinion - I'm sure it won't be a waste of time for most of you who enjoy some depth (as well as some action) in movies.",Chappie
653,randall-shimizu,Was more of a kids movie,3,21 June 2015,"The first 20"" minutes of Chappie was okay, but went down from there. Those goofy ears made hard to take the robot seriously. I also found Yolandi's voice to be irritating as well. I watched the whole movie with a friend. But Chappie was longer than it needed to be. The move should have been 90 minutes at most If they toned down the violence it would have been more suitable for kids. Thestory was not very compelling. as well.The gang genre was also irritating as well. In the end this movie had a very corn ball feel to it and it's one skip. I understand why this movie was barely a blurb at the theaters.",Chappie
654,schmatzler,A bad version of GTA: San Andreas,2,15 May 2015,"This film has received a lot of hype beforehand, because some of the people from ""District 9"" have worked on it. However, I can't see any of the values that District 9 provided in this movie.The official trailer is absolutely misleading: In the trailer we have slow and quiet music which suits the scenes we can see. The actual music in the movie is loud and unpleasant. Most of the time, it sounds like ""Die Antwoord - Rich Bitch"", which is just really bad gangster rap. The robot is not talking in the trailer. But in the actual movie, he can't speak properly. He learns the language from his family and since these all talk like ""Yo I'm gonna get ya, I'm da pimp"" the robot does, too. I cannot identify myself with a being that is moving and talking like a character from ""GTA San Andreas"". I also don't understand how these lines are supposed to bring the plot of a Science Fiction related movie forward.This movie also doesn't give us any moral values or any moral judgement at all: The robot is being raised by a gangster family and all of these people deserve to be truly hated. They steal cars and property, they kill people and they even abandon the robot so he ends up with a group of kids who are setting him on flames. Then he comes back to them, they apologize for it and now they live ""happily ever after"" - even when they lie to him so he hurts other people with knives. Seriously?I was already expecting a movie with a lot of action and a thin plot, but I think this plot is harmful for younger viewers. What would happen if there were only movies like this - delinquent, heavily tattooed, armed men steal cars and kill people just to be rewarded for it in the end - these are not the values of Science Fiction for me.Also, this movie is full of clichés. The operating system of the robots is DOS, the programmer is a skinny white guy who's working in a cubicle and doesn't get credit for his hard work...enough for me. But at least the action scenes were good and very enjoyable.",Chappie
655,adnanareeb,Best Movie Ever! Must Watch,10,6 July 2015,Its a Great movie i never write reviews but this i had to. this is a very unique and different feel good type movie you will love it. i think this movie should have made more money and it deserve a lot more appreciation well done to the story writer producers and actors.I wont tell much about the story thought because that will ruin it but i just loved this movie its very emotional and sweet movie make sure you watch it.its entertaining from start till the end and the ending is unexpected so its a full surprise package for all.Thank you for this master piece.,Chappie
656,shootingstar358,Chappie is one of the most endearing movies I have ever seen,9,12 March 2015,"I never write reviews but I felt compelled to with Chappie because I feel it's being severely underrated. I really don't understand what all the hate is about. It may not be perfect but it's a beautiful story that can make you laugh, cry, cringe, and, above all, fall in love with Chappie's character.It amazes me how much the critics have been bashing this film. It may not be the most original movie but I think it's actually one of the more original films of the recent decade. There's no theme that hasn't been done over a hundred times but the sentient AI theme behind Chappie is handled in a way I have never seen before. Chappie's childlike personality really captures your heart and it's fascinating to see how he reacts with being mixed up in a gang of thugs.I also thought the acting given by Die Antwoord was very decent, much better than I would have expected. Yolandi, especially, portrays a convincing and sweet mother figure to Chappie. The blatant self-advertisement on their shirts was the worst thing about the movie, to me, but this was nowhere near enough to ruin the film.All in all, I think Chappie is a very entertaining story and it has quickly become one of my favorites.",Chappie
657,PinkValek,FRESH and Stylish SCI-FI flick! Watched OVER AND OVER!,10,7 June 2015,"I don't normally do reviews, but this movie was one in a million. It had great characters, that were not only interesting and funny, they had a certain authentic quality that really made you feel for them, as they drew you into their world. The characters didn't force you to like, or find them funny- it just happened- as they naturally were captivating and magnetic people. The acting debut of Die Antwoord's Ninja and Yolandi Vissar was superb. They gave this movie it's beautiful, funky and tough ""zef"" style, and really held their own as actors. They added a unique ""realness"" that you normally wouldn't get with a ""real"" actor. I didn't even know they weren't ""actors"" before watching this movie. Chappie, the robot, was also very believable as a just-born sentient being. It was hilarious to watch him try to ""fit-in"" with the gang.On the whole this movie was great. Being a post-apocalyptic movie, I would've normally liked to see a bigger story line, but with how the director kept the attention on this small group of people, (as well as the events that get unfolded, and their consequential effects), it really allowed you to get swallowed up by their world, and experience this crazy world as if you were there. It wasn't exactly an action-packed sci-fi film, (which I liked for a change), but it did draw you into the story through humor, style, character, and love.One of the brilliant things about this movie, (as all of Blomkamp's movies), was the post-apocalyptic style in the setting. It's unique, and the use of color in such a dismal world is amazing. I realize in this film, Die Antwoord's Ninja and Yolandi brought a lot of their own style to this movie as well, and the combination of styles, (w/ Blomkamp's) was perfect! I have watched this movie over and over. I almost didn't even see it at first, (thinking it was just another ""stupid robot movie""). I am so glad I did!",Chappie
658,ExplodIngNinja,A fantastic mix of dark comedy and science fiction.,9,19 May 2015,"Being a huge fan of District 9, I had high expectations for CHAPPiE, I am also a fan of Die Antwoord's weird music. After seeing the movie, I can say without a doubt in my mind that this is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. Die Antwoord has gotten a lot of negative criticism regarding their ""douchey"" performances, what some people don't understand is that, that was the point of the movie, at least in my opinion. Movies where you root for the better of two evils rarely come around, and this is one of them, however, some people may be turned off by the crass behavior of Yolandi Visser and Ninja. I really liked the character of CHAPPiE, his story was surprisingly tragic and it was a very relatable underdog story. Sharlto Copley was really good in his motion capture work for CHAPPiE, and his voice work. Hugh Jackman as the villain was a little distracting, he pulled off a menacing villain, but he was a little too goofy at times, one scene in particular was very far-fetched, but he was still very entertaining to watch. Neil Blomkamp took some interesting directions with the story, it was very unpredictable. The dark comedy aspect of this movie is not advertised for the trailers at all, which is disappointing, because it's a very major part of the movie. All I'm saying is, know what you're getting into This movie is entertaining as hell, and is definitely worth checking out. 4.5/5",Chappie
659,xhysteriax,Short Circuit meets Robocop,8,9 June 2015,"What can I say about this film? It was pretty easy to watch, you can kind of see where things are going to go from the start, but thats not really a problem. Its hard to have a film about a robot really grab you, as its got the action, but it also has a softer side to it. The whole concept of Chappie, and who he is really does grab you, and its a strange feeling when you feel so sympathetic to a robot.So, I titled it as such, Short Circuit meets Robocop, because in my opinion that's pretty much it. It has no massive sub plot, and they even seem to have set the main part of it in the same derelict building... of course, I joke! But there are a lot of elements that certainly scream ''Johnny 5 is alive'' when Chappie is making an escape over abandoned wasteland. OR parts where the villains are in there lair just reek of Clarence Boddicker and his cronies.I think they even used M 209 from Robocop!!!I liked it though. It wasn't too in depth, however I do feel that the film would have been a lot better without the two big Hollywood actors.Sigourney Weaver always plays a good role, but here, I think she was too big and actor for the role she played. It was almost like a cameo appearance. Hugh Jackman also had a similar issue in his role, but I think he spoiled that himself from his over acting. Dev Patel was great! He is amazing, and the role fit him well.That's about it really.",Chappie
660,grantrichard,Go Into Chappie With an Open Mind,9,9 March 2015,"By now, like me, you have seen the Chappie trailers. If you have seen District 9 and loved it, and Elysium and wanted to love it but were a little disappointed, then you are filled with hope that Chappie will be on that path you felt with District 9. I would tell you to retain that hope, and go into Chappie with an open mind. It does go back to the gritty world of District 9 somewhat. Die Antwoord may not be for everyone, but again, keep an open mind. I think there is merit in having two non-Hollywood actors in the role of Chappie's ""parents"", regardless if their music is your taste or not. The droids are impeccable in their detail and actions, which I thought was great. There is plenty of violence and there are some sequences of cruelty. I felt the movie allowed the viewer to develop deep feelings for Chappie, as he develops feelings for the characters he interacts with. The story draws some interesting thoughts to contemplate regarding a link between human and AI consciousness and the existence of a soul, as well as what is moral or immoral, and the capacity for - yes - love. Is it a perfect movie, haters? No, it is not. It is a big ball of wax to explore and absorb. I, for one, definitely want to see this movie more than once.",Chappie
661,PedroLagoa,Disappointing,5,22 July 2015,"I'm an engineer and Sci-fi fan !I really enjoyed District 9 and Elysium, from the same director, but what a heck Neill Blomkamp had in mind for this movie?Things hard to accept: - AI behaving like a teenager. - AI smart enough to understand what consciousness is, but kill humans thinking he is making them sleep! What?? - A human brain scanner used by a robot. Oh yeah... Of course... - Unable to copy memory state of the robot to transfer it to another hardware. Need the human brain scanner, to scan a robot hardware, lol. - The ""nerd"" guy is very dumb and annoying. Terrible acting as well. - Bad guys allow the nerd to come in and go from their place whenever he wants to.Here in Brazil we would rate this movie as a typical ""seção da tarde"". Like a movie you watch when you have nothing more important to do.Very very DISAPPOINT !",Chappie
662,ccavute,a journey of an AI robot growing up.,10,24 May 2015,"I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating. It is obviously underrated in many aspects. From character design to development of characters impressed me through out the movie. This movie is one of my fav movie of the year, perhaps all time fav one. I love how Chappie was created and how he learned from different stages of story as it progresses. from someone knows nothing about the world, about people to gradually getting a hang of it. It's really fascinating to see how he changed his personality from time to time. THIS is the ideal stage of a great movie should be, which you understand and relate to the character, doesn't matter if its a robot or a human. His often criticized ""bunny' ears are actually a great design, I don't care what it looks like, it express his emotions and feeling visually clearly without his facial expressions. I was a bit afraid that I may get confused him with other robots, however it isn't a case here as his ear and arm and blings are so distinguishable through out the movie. As someone who work in a 3D industry, I truly appreciate the people who created this movie. I enjoyed very much and became very emotionally related toward the characters, especially Chappie. Great movie Great acting Great character design Great character development Great story",Chappie
663,lancegibson24,Did I Really Just Pay To See This??,3,7 March 2015,"So I have just gotten home from going to watch Chappie. Let me tell you, that was the longest intro to a music video that I have ever seen. And it wasn't even a new song. The worst part was that I paid actual money to see this. A robot that has the ability to become self aware and learn is a pretty good concept but this whole film seems to be about how Die Antwoord can raise a robot baby. I had read how Ninja was terrible to work with but holy snap, it seems that he bullies his way into every scene possible so he can live out his action movie star fantasy. And I don't blame him if he did. Given the chance anyone would probably do the same. But the fact that all of the music that I did hear was their music and they still went with their band names is just a big middle finger to everyone watching. Am I really expected to believe that the only music playing in South Africa is theirs? But as bad as all of this was it all comes down to director, Neill Blomkamp. I get it. You want to live out a music video fantasy. District 9 was amazing, no doubt about that. After the Eminem fiasco for Elysium it was obvious about the desire for music and film to collide in your features. Now you've had this atrocity and it's time to learn from your mistakes and don't you dare mess up the new Alien movie.",Chappie
664,larspsandersen,Lost potential,5,18 July 2015,"When you see the movie for it self, you think it is a good movie, but I fund it hard to enjoy. The concept of this movie is brilliant, absolutely brilliant, but when you are done, you sit back and think ""they could have done so much more"". Chappie has potential, and in the end it looks like they wasted it. It's a shame. A movie where Hugh Jackman as our main character is a criminal, who captures a police robot to fight on their side against a corrupted police force. That would have been a movie. Instead we are presented a group of main characters who you just want to shut up. The scenes there are meant to move us, falls short because you can't connect to the characters. Besides a head of an IT company which doesn't acknowledge artificial intelligence, who says it is not important, it is unrealistic of a level equal of the pope saying to god ""go away we are not interested"".",Chappie
665,siddharthausham,Hopeless movie,2,17 May 2015,"This is one of the worst sci-fi movie I've ever watched. When I saw the robot with emotions, it felt funny. I keep waiting for something cool to happen after that but it never happened. So many easily visible plot holes are there. Some thugs kidnapped an engineer and he construct the robot which is capable of showing emotions. The kidnapped engineer is then suddenly allowed to roam freely in their hideout. He then went to his lab to get more equipments for the robot. He then started going to and fro from his lab to the hideout where he is held captive. But he never thought to inform the police or tell his co-workers at the laboratory. Hugh Jackman is another disappointment in this horrible movie. He is another engineer in the same lab. Yet, he somehow acquire rifles and bodyguards with big guns and he started attacking the robot without any reason. People keep dying easily without any story leading to it. And the robot start making other robots which contains memory and skill of the persons he met before they died. It's a complete waste of time. I couldn't find any good part in the whole damn movie.",Chappie
666,arnabringiton,A sci-fi that makes us realize humanity.......,10,15 May 2015,"This is perhaps the most thought provoking sci-fi ever. I have seen lots of sci-fi and this one blends human spirit and technology like never before. It is more than film because it makes you fall in love with a machine just like E.T did. But this isn't just about emotional overkill either. Its also about the plot develops, making subtle depictions of what human nature is like biologically speaking. This move is a must-watch for all the sci-fi lovers and also for those who wish find the meaning of human existence. Dev Patel and Hugh Jackman does well in the movie but the entire performance is dominated by CHAPPIE himself. Never seen a non-human taking centre stage with a human-like performance. Definitely the best movie till now in 2015 in its genre. And I am unsure whether it is better than Interstellar as a movie. Interstellar was based on complex yet sound mathematical physics but Chappie is closer to our hearts and feels more realistic, enjoyable and insinuates deeper emotions.",Chappie

I considered Elyseum below average, as a commercial consequence of the success of District 9, so I had hopes for Chappie. How can I say, I rarely rate 1 a movie, even more rarely write a review. The only word which comes to my mind is ""ridiculous"". Everything, from the screenplay, the actors, the credibility, the music, the narrative, everything on all axis is wrong: a totally failed combination of District 9, Robocop and Ghost in the Shell, to a nauseous point. 1 is my final score as the average of my inner ratings of all the movie components.

669,ewhishaw,A new and more ruddy step into the AI story,9,25 May 2016,"The critics are very wrong about this film. I believe the story is a fantastic step into the nature / nature debate, but for Artificial Intelligence (AI). The central characters are unusual, but also provide a pared down view of our social drivers and survival instincts. Daring, this is a film for which I would be keen to see a sequel which challenges our views on sharing our world and what discrimination could look like in the future if we walk towards technological breakthroughs without our eyes wide open.Most AI stories require a maniacal super villain... Here, Chappie has people driven by normal, sometimes immoral, drivers.Loved it.",Chappie
670,Ruaan-Van-Rooyen,Existential Zefness and Transhumanism in a Dystopian South Africa,7,21 March 2015,"At first I want to say that I was rather shocked being the only one in the cinema on the 3rd night of the film's release in South Africa. As an inspiring filmmaker myself and having studied film for 3 years those of us locals crazy enough to pursue this unforgiving career face the most difficult audience in the world. Why is it that South Africans are so unsupportive of local productions? I wish that people can wake up and see that our film industry has carried a lot of our economies but mostly in favor of foreign filmmakers. The only way that we can transform our film industry to become one of an export for international distribution and recognition is by the support of our own audience. We have plenty of undiscovered talent and it will remain that way until the domestic audience has a collective change of view. As for Chappie, I found the film highly entertaining. Even though the film had quite a few mistakes in terms of believable scenarios, which was hard to buy, I was still moved by the story, especially the Character and Subtext of Chappie himself.Every technology that we have designed are extensions of ourselves. A computer will never know what it is to be human and a human will never know what it is to be God. Or it's creator if I may put it like that. Yet, in Chappie that existential dilemma experiences a breakthrough. In most science fiction films with this theme, they allow self-aware artificial intelligence to become a militant threat with apocalyptic consequences. In Chappie, a small baby with superhuman intelligence is born inside the broken body of a police robot. I love how his character portrays that of an innocent street kid from the slums of Johannesburg and finds himself in an unforgiving dystopian South Africa and gets adopted or actually stolen by a criminal couple(DieAntwoord) stuck in a deadly vice. Can you imagine that? Niel Blomkamp did and I found it one of the most entertaining expressions of isolation in terms of an existential given. As for the themes of life and death, having a purpose and creating a meaningful existence in order to survive in the suburbs of Hell I found the story and production design creates yet an even bigger breakthrough to cheat death and bring back those who made you and died for you. It gave me goosebumps from head to toe. Chappie is a Marvel of Human Ingenuity and tells a story that evolves the ideas of dying for your sins and having everlasting life to a very plausible novelty. I think most of the reviews I read about the film people are too judgemental and, therefore, fails to read the subtext of the film. They can't help themselves to criticise Die Antwoord and Neil Blomkamp. You guys are going on like a pack of hyenas on a carcass.If you are a South African reading this, can you imagine yourself the amount of pressure and hard work these brilliant artists had to deal with? Please, give them a break. They did an outstanding job and it is unfair to measure their work with those of Hitchcock and Scorcese who grew up in a super power economy where their religion is filmmaking. Besides, they have their own style, in fact, they have actually created their own genre. Every true artist can create his own unique style, but it takes a canonic approach to creating a new genre. Only a handful of artists can say that. Whether you like them or not, you're probably missing the point. In terms of acting, Chappie was definitely the best, perhaps because he is a robot, after all. I could see that Ninja was 'acting' in the 1st part of the film and I am sure that he was too confident about playing the character and did not rehearse it enough with his director. It felt unnatural. Yet, from about the beginning of the 2nd Act he slipped into character and actually carried the film really well. Yolande was really easy. She didn't act at all. She is exactly who she needs to be, very well played and you are a great Mom, by the way.. :) Everyone else did a fair job except whoever played the Cyber Punk gang leader. He was the biggest joke of the entire movie. That guy gave me the creeps yo. As for look and feel, I felt that the colour pallet had way too much blue in it. The blue was really overwhelming. I suppose they wanted to portray the whole police vibe but seriously. It was slightly off putting, to be honest. At least for me it was. I think they could have given it a more grungy colour pallet. That was the only thing that bugged me in this department. As for VFX and Production Design they did an outstanding job that can be compared to Transformers but on a smaller scale. Overall I just want to say that Chappie is definitely worth your time and money so make sure to unplug from the matrix and escape into their world with some Popcorn and a Large Coke.Regards,Ruaan Van RooyenDevelopment Producer at Enigma Ace Films.",Chappie
671,blackdragone,"Great idea, disappointing plot",5,13 March 2015,"I felt emotionally involved during almost all movie but I at the end I had to admit to myself the plot had incredible logical gaps. Such gaps could've been easily filled with putting a little more thought into writing the plot. Almost all main characters are poorly built, so that they do not even feel real. They tried to put together too many subplots without making the effort of connecting them narratively. Too bad, because the idea of the movie is great and there are great actors. I also loved District 9, from the same director, so I was surprised. My 2 cents is: do not pay a movie ticket for this, simply rent it later or watch in on Netflix.",Chappie
672,cahalmcquillan,Avoid this film like the plague!,4,14 March 2015,"I don't usually write reviews but due to the fact that IMDb's rating is the sole reason I watched Chappie I felt compelled to. Last Saturday my friends and I decided to see a movie, with Chappie and Focus looking like the only two decent films I sought IMDb's opinion, so that I could make a more informed decision. Seeing as Chappie was rocking a 7.4 from a solid 10,000 reviews, it seemed a safe bet.Sadly I was completely wrong! With a lazy storyline that seems alittle too similar to District 9, completely one-dimensional characters whose actions make you face-palm on a regular basis and an overblown budget to top. Chappie is a total waste of your time.I understand that some people don't mind a film with a template storyline and lazily written characters just so long as the movie's fun to watch. But the truth is the flaws in Chappie are too big to ignore. It glazes over characters nearly murdering one another without a second mention, it ignores key points of the movie that were introduced as facts (Tetravaal's seemingly state of the art security for example) and really just breaks science for the sake of the plot. Admittedly the character Chappie is actually very likable and without a doubt the only solid part of the film. But still, I just cannot recommend this movie in any way or form. To reinforce my summary for Chappie. Avoid it like the plague!",Chappie
673,frody1111,This Movie is Amazing,9,17 March 2015,"Don't let anyone tell you differently before you see this movie. It is amazing, as a Computer Science Major I love artificial intelligence and this is exactly how the formation of A.I. would happen if it were to evolve from pre-existing machines. The reason that I find people are having with this movie, is that it made them sad. There is nothing wrong with a movie making you sad. A good movie should move you emotionally. Unfortunately, humanity does not have a good track record with treating new technology appropriately (i.e. Atomic Bomb). Yes I do know that most technological advances stem from military research, but that does not mean that everyone still treats technology how they should. Yes this movie is sad but it is more accurate then most and just because it is accurate does not mean that it should be hurt in the ratings by America's short attention span for anything that does not have a textbook happy ending. It was amazing!",Chappie

This story is about a lot more than just robot police officers it is a thought provoking social commentary on many modern day issues and what it is like to bring life into the modern world.I very much enjoyed District 9 but I would even go as far to say I enjoyed Chappie much, much more.There were so many aspects to this film that could have went wrong but have been nailed on the head by the director. The effect once again visually striking and a very well paced and intricate development of characters as well as interesting set design helps keep chappie fresh and not just another reboot of any other sci fi film as critics will have you believe.I would also say I enjoyed this film much, much more than the likes of robo-cop.",Chappie
675,waynemalynyk,Chumppie,1,7 July 2015,"Worst movie ever. Punk rock looking rappers with marker for tattoo's with bad accents?? How did this make it to the big screen??? The only thing missing was them to be on skate boards. What is with the bright silly colors and spray painting c*ck, b*lls on the walls?? Who does that an 8 year old kid maybe. I think the sticker on chappie's head in the photo says it all lol. This movie is definitely not a 7, there is much better movies out there that have worse scores that are better than this. This movie is not green because all the DVD's are going to end up in the landfill lol. I wish I could delete this movie from my brain.",Chappie
676,omartarbush22,Really good but feels slightly disappointing when compared to Blomkamp's past work,8,4 March 2015,"Let me start off by saying I am a massive fan of Neil Blomkamp's work, District 9 being one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time and personally, I believe Elysium gets way more flack than it deserves and that film is very unfairly criticized. Going in to Chappie I was extremely excited to see what Neil could do next and I came out satisfied. Chappie boasts some great action, generally very good performances, a fantastic score and is completely entertaining throughout.The flaws of the film however are definitely there and hard to overlook. Starting off with the inclusion of Die Antwoord. Their presence in the film seems rather forced especially seeing them wear shirts with their names on them and listening to their own music. The whole thing seems out of place and I do not think they should have been the people to play such important roles in the movie. Brendan Auret's characters also feels rather over the top and silly yet underused. Another problem is that the film feels slightly too familiar with some of it's occurrences as it progresses, and coming from a huge Blomkamp fan I would now like to see him branch away from this type of movie, hopefully starting with his upcoming Alien project.Overall, Chappie is a fun time and is definitely worth going and seeing in the theater however it can't help but feel like a slight letdown considering the talent.",Chappie
677,itay_bia,crappiest acting ever,4,10 July 2015,"can't believe they took good actors and made them do this... the movie could've been really nice if the director had any balls, and didn't cast die antwoord, which made it into a movie about them (and their really bad acting). the story, generally, kinda reminds you of ""short circuit"", but with a gangster vibe. the parts about how chappie relates to the world are nice, but everything to do with technology in this movie is so far from realistic, it's absurd. if you're in any way thinking that this movie is in the level of district 9, i'm here to tell you a definite NO! i loved district 9, and this movie is a total waste of time.",Chappie
678,thezeffs,Nonsensical movie with nothing new to add to genre,2,7 June 2015,"Not sure why I even gave this two stars. It owes me two stars for wasting my time. The actions and the motives of the characters make no sense. A tough criminal suddenly suddenly believes she is the mother of a stupid robot who isn't even cute? The evil criminals let the ""maker"" get away more then once? The most profound question asked, by the robot, is ""Why would my maker create me to die?"" Ugh... wonder what that question is supposed to remind us of? The only problem is the robot's creator is not the ""all-powerful"" creator, but took something someone else made and gave it new abilities. There are so many other movies that ask the question about the cross and connection between AI and humanity and the existence of a ""soul"" that are so so so much better than this ugly, violent and nonsensical trash, take your time and go watch those. Her, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Moon, Steven Spielberg's AI Artificial Intelligence, was particularly good. If you love ugly characters, endless violence, shallow and uninteresting plot, bad acting, and ""we are trying hard to be profound here"" moments, then you will love this movie.",Chappie
679,jansett-683-84030,Annoying with brief moments,6,1 August 2015,"On the whole Chappie came across as annoying. It really doesn't follow a true principal of AI - learning should have been exponential rather than the robot just acting like a kid for 90% of the movie.This is definitely not District 9 or Elysium, both I enjoyed a lot, this just lacked something. None of the main characters were very likable.... but the nuances of South African gangs might be lost on me if this is at all a accurate representation.This is a watch if there is nothing better and you're in the mood for a action/street gang movie. If you're looking for an AI movie, go watch Ex Machina if you're looking for a street crime sci-fi Dredd is probably better (imo).",Chappie
680,enjikaka,Promising story brought down by Die Antwoord,3,24 July 2015,"The trailer makes this film seem like a really great piece of Sci-Fi. Having a very promising plot by having AI in robots, future police being robots and grasping the surface of the abstract consciousness; it's a pity they let Die Antwoord in on this. Apart from the great AI plot properties, the whole film feels like an excuse for Die Antwoord to get their crappy music in a movie and for them so play cool and ""gansta"" in their old crappy warehouse. The movie could very well have left out these idiots for real actors. The computers used in the movie seem very outdated and not capable of dealing with AI in a professional way. One would think that, for advanced AI programming; there would have evolved some more advances interfaces to interact with this phenomenon.",Chappie
681,M_Natas,Surprisingly entertaining,9,6 March 2015,"(sorry, if my English is not perfect, I'm not a native speaker ;) ).I really liked the movie. It was able to engage me and make me feel with Chappie.Chappie is the heart and the strongest part of the movie. Aside from the great CGI, he took my heart. If you don't relate and like Chappie, the movie will fall short for you, because its more of a character piece and no simple action movie.The other characters ... only Deon (Dev Patel) and Yolandi stand out, because they care for Chappie, we can relate to them in their love for the robot.At the beginning, I had a problem with Ninja, Yolandi, Amerika and all the bad gang members, because they look and act like they come straight out of an 80s post-apocalyptic B-Movie. You would expect such characters in escape from new york, but not in a Sci-Fi-Movie from 2015 (and before the end credits I didn't know anything about Die Antwoord). But after getting used to the fact, that the movie is more goofy and campy than you are used to with the gritty, dark realistic movies of this millennium, the film gets really enjoyable.The story only develops Chappie quite good. Deon and Yolandi are relatable. But the rest of the characters are not really characters, they are functions, they are plot points, only in the movie to serve the development of Chappie or the plot.Vincent (Hugh Jackman) is also in the tradition of the crazy 80s post-apocalyptic villain, at least in the end. But his actions, like shutting down all scouts, are quite - extreme. Its obvious that his actions are motivated to get the plot to a point where he can use his big robot against Chappie. He is too much of a plot device and too less of a character.I'm not so sure if I like Ninja. His character is dumb and I usually don't like dumb characters. He is necessary for the development of Chappie but he is to much of a caricature of a character. Only at the end trough the death of Yolandi he got relatable to me.And I really hope, that nobody in south Africa dresses like these guys. Come on, we are in 2015 and not in 1985.An other problem was the timeline and one story-point. Using exact years is ... Its just make it hard to let Suspension of disbelief happen, if you are supposed to believe, that next year, we will have cool police-robots. Also it is a little bit far stretched, even for south Africa, that riots start immediately when the police shuts down.The thing is, the whole film can and will work and will really engage you, when you can accept, that this is an unrealistic 80s-post-apocalpitc b-movie with modern CGI.If you expect a realistic, gritty sci-if-drama or can't relate to the campiness of 80s post-apocalyptic movies, you will not like this movie.For me it was a 9 out of 10. After an itchy start with the goofy characters, after I understand what this movie was, I could suspend my disbelief and was able to enjoy it.",Chappie
682,yehgoodone,Chappie steal the show,7,22 March 2015,"This is one of those films that comes close to becoming a richly rewarding spectacle that makes a significant impact in the world of entertainment. I chose my subject heading carefully as Chappie is by far the best actor in this film, an ironic feature considering the premise of the film. Weaver and Jackman added very little and I can only assume were added to draw in uncertain viewers into this genre. The South Africa cast and location was also a disappointment but perhaps that lends toward my own short sightedness, and Hollywoods impact on cinema.The story line has some impressive depth, highlighting important reflections upon both adolescence and parenthood and all the emotions we all go through as a part of growing up. In that sense the film was a remarkable success. Never has a robot been portrayed with such raw human emotion. Unfortunately the storyline that surrounds this feature just becomes a messy distraction and all the gunfire, violence and mad max style Utopian society ruins a potentially ground breaking experience.",Chappie

I saw an emotional film about innocence and loss. I REALLY don't understand. Sure, maybe the film didn't have the best dialogue or the best acting in the world, but it hit home for me. The VFX were phenomenal, Chappie is the best CGI motion capture I have seen in a long time, the 100% electronic musical score by Hans Zimmer was really unique and fresh, and it has a really great ending. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. If you like Blomkamp's previous films or are remotely interested, please watch it yourself. I think the critics are wrong on this one. I have been thinking for a while about why the reviews are so out there. First off, the trailers are AWFUL. The first to come out was this philosophical ""What does it mean to be human?"" kinda movie. The TV trailers were ""GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, ROBOTS!!!"" and it is neither. Think ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with a robot, that is a more accurate representation. Blomkamp's most underrated film.",Chappie

I gave it 10 stars because its rough and ready style is part ot the social critique that makes the movie gripping. Amazingly the director is able to present the greatest existential threat for humanity in its cradle without making those in the know want to jump off a ""cell"" tower.We are training Ai! What are those lessons? Will they be kind when they inherit The earth?Take away: Chappie is like the Office but instead of satires about the mundane nature of generic humanity and office life.Chappie is satire addressing the impoverished state of the human Condition and the volatile cocktail it is when it constitutes the formative moments for Ai.Not deep but relevant, cute, and with plenty of meat to get people thinking. Lots of killing and foul language, incredibly sex free.Never wrote one of there before.",Chappie
687,PaulAshraf,"Had a lot of potential, but it fell apart at the end.",6,5 March 2015,"Director Neill Blomkamp after his amazing work at District 9 (2009) (check out District 9 if you haven't seen it, it's one of the best sci fi of the decade.) and not so amazing but still good work on Elysium (2013), gives us his next ambitious project, Chappie. So let's start with the good. The visual effects are stunning, excellent work thanks to the visual effects team and Blomkamp. It looks as good as District 9 (which looked awesome.) I never once felt like I was seeing a CGI robot. But the most notable things about this movie is the robot Chappie. I don't want to give away anything because this is easily the best part of the movie. Blomkamp adds a new twist to the usual robot-having-human-brain plot. It's new, original and fresh. And surprisingly there's some amazing humor too. But the movie just falls apart when it moves the attention away from Chappie and tries focus on other plot lines. It tries to have a drug related subplot as a motivation for the characters, I guess. I honestly can't remember a thing about this subplot, you know there's something wrong in your movie when the viewer can't remember a certain thing after a few hours. And it also have a Hugh Jackman subplot which is completely unnecessary and clichéd, and only increase it's runtime to 2 hours. The movie drags a lot and would have been better if 20-30 mins were cut out. And also what the hell is this ending song? Seriously, It's horrible.All in all, the movie is above average and had some really great ideas and awesome visuals effects. But it's too long and focused on clichéd and dull subplots instead of Chappie himself. This feels like the shitty version of District 9.6/10.",Chappie

689,iamnotblackadam1,Chappie is wonderful movie from the genius behind District 9,10,21 April 2015,"Don't let those reviewers over at meta-critic fool you, this movie is wonderfully done with colourful characters and a wonderful atmosphere. The characters in this movie have rich emotion to go with each of them from beginning to end, especially Chappie who you see change throughout the entire movie. He goes from an innocent robot who doesn't like hurting people to basically the Terminator. But it's not an instant change as you see this robot's opinion and attitude change towards the end of the movie. And if you want a good laugh this movie has plenty of funny moments for you to enjoy. Especially the moments in the movie when Chappie learns how to swear from his 'Daddy' Ninja. However this wouldn't be a Neill Blomkamp without some sad parts either. There's a scene in a movie that, although Chappie was a former police robot that some though near indestructible. You get to see his vulnerability in a scene in which Chappie is dropped off by a group of hood rats who obviously don't like the police. So the proceed to beat him with objects like rock or lead pipes, all the while he is begging for the to stop. Eventually they go so far to even start him on fire which is very sad as he repeats that he just wants to go home. Shortly after that he is abducted by his maker's 'rival' in order to get a chip from his head, but since his rival is jealous he decided to have him killed. They worst they did to him was take his left arm off. When he finally gets home he is greeted by his human 'mother' who sees his injuries and berates Ninja for letting him go. This is a very emotional series of events and reveals to the audience that although Chappie could definitely kill anyone, he's kind hearted and refuses to do so.",Chappie
690,jjhbowers,Wonderful movie!,10,21 March 2019,"My own theory as to why this movie is bashed by critics is the usual reason:It is politically incorrect!Gangsters are shown to be BAD. They even try to corrupt an innocent robot, and we all know in the REAL world they would never do so- only the evil white patriarchy would do something like that!It is a great movie, with believable (if flawed) characters, and the ending is PERFECT! Of course, the gangsters had to be white, even in South Africa (where they are all really black), but even so, that makes it unpalatable to liberals everywhere...But watch it!! It is really compelling, and you will miss your MOMMY!",Chappie
691,pseidel125,The critics were so wrong.,9,19 March 2015,"So many things done right by Blomkamp. Just the he opening action sequence where we see swat operators doing stacks and entries with the robots was phenomenal. The entire element of gang bangers raising an infant mind- it was compelling and took me on an emotional roller coaster. The scene where Chappie was dumped out of the van and petrified of the unknown, I can't remember the last time I had an emotional reaction to a film. It was all done so well.Spoilers below! The ending was a hidden gem- Chappie discovered immortality in only 5 days. When Chappie said he could take consciousness out of the body, I thought he didn't understand, but I wanted to be proved wrong. I kinda wished Neil would have killed off all the gang members (Die Antwood), as their irresponsible and selfish behavior (never mind the all the violent crimes they committed) is exactly what's wrong with modern society. It would have been one for the good guys.Great job Neil! Looking forward to Aliens, don't't kill Hicks",Chappie
692,okeys7,Shame,2,27 July 2015,"The concept is interesting enough, and the directer has a history of making good realistic sci-fi. The problem is this feels like a film made by committee. On the one hand we have a comedy subplot about ridiculous gangsters, but we are supposed to jump from this to a serious plot about the city being overrun by criminals. It feels like a good script had too much nonsense added at the last minute and was ruined.Shame that Die Antwood ruin what could have been a half decent sci-fi film.

We couldn't watch it anymore. It kind of ticked us off that Chappie was being trained by criminals and being taught 'gangster'. I was really wanting to see him grow and learn the right way. Some of his training seemed to be like training a dog to fetch. We were disappointed because we thought with some of the actors that it was going to be really great but it was just cheesy. We also didn't like the bad language Chappie was learning when he was supposed to be like a child. So lots or potential for this movie but just disappointing.",Chappie

Visually Blomkamp is very consistent. his films all capture a grungy side to scifi.. one of the best comparisons to his work could be equated to the visual style of the first ""Alien"" Film. Everything looks functional or appears to have a purpose even if not used by the cast. The characters are compelling, and the over arching message of the film is not lost (as seen in Elysium). Hopefully this is a commercial and critical success. It is very deserving of a 2nd viewing. I look forward to renting when released on bluray. first act was engaging and didn't seem slow or pandering to anyone seeking ""content"". final act of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat! Sharlto Copley does a great job of making us empathize with his character- Chappie is an endearing, and deep character. Another mention-able cast member is Yo-landi Visser.

The action scenes are very cool, although it could be better filmed and better angles sometimes, but that's okay. I think if you are with nothing else to do, you can watch this movie and entertain yourself for sometime.

Its like a steak enthusiast goes into McDonalds only to find hamburgers. They deduct points for having the buns. Chappie is a story of an intelligent robot surviving in the real world. It depicts the struggle we have today for right vs wrong, and how society and culture can affect a once pure heart. It is about consciousness and our power to feel and learn. If I wanted to see a blockbuster rivalry between two scientists battling out to see who's better, I'd watch any blockbuster shitty action movie. Chappie is much more than that, however critics fail to realize this.

Chappie himself, looks like something built in the 1980's, and can get downright annoying, he never shuts up. In the movie's beginning you learn that Chappie has the ability to think and feel on his own. This is gripping at first, but then in short order you're let down by this not so intelligent machine.

From there, the movie just goes downhill, with its plot-holes, goofs, and incredibly poor acting. I couldn't decide what was worse..the story line, or the lack of originality. In one scene, it looks like they dusted off the prop for ED2 in the original RoboCop, recharged it's batteries and fired him up as ""Moose"" in this schlock-piece.Without going into any more detail about the ""story"", I truly hope that, if there is a sequel, that Chappie the robot gets captured and forced to live in District 10, subsisting only on a diet of cat food.",Chappie

Wow! Excellent from A to Z! The trailer doesn't do it justice at all. When you see the trailer, I don't know about you, but I was trying to remember District 9's story and I was expecting something as heart wrenching, yet didn't know how they would achieve this. With the aid of Ninja and Yolandi, this movie really picks up. Yet, I have issues with the acting here. The Die Antwoord members are experienced at being filmed and being in public as they do concerts and make video clips with some story lines and all. But what I found with this movie is that it contains so much Die Antwoord music, so much Die Antwoord acting, style, mood, that for me it just became a huge Die Antwoord video-clip movie.Yes it is good, yes Yolandi is awesome, as well as Ninja even if his role is rather simplistic, but at times touching. I felt that the movie was awesome still. The storyline is excellent and kept me on the edge of my seat, it was THAT GOOD. But, I have a few issues with acting. Most characters are, as described by others, rather flat in personality. It's very similar to District 9 in that manner. But, that alone will not ruin this movie for me, as for many others from what I read in other reviews, simply because we wanted to see what Chappie was about, and we were thrilled with how the movie ended up being; more than what I expected for sure. Not to mention that it is a rather long (2 hours) filled with action scenes, violence, emotions, and so forth.If you loved District 9, this movie is for you. If you like Die Antwoord, you will fall in love here for sure. Great movie, but very much a Die Antwoord packed.",Chappie

I liked the portion of Chappie learning the accent of the humans.The film left an open for Chappie 2, however, I am not sure what else can they do in Chappie 2, they could build an army of Chappies on their own, I think it would be much thrilling to watch.Overall, the show is funny with thin plot, I cant really say I dislike it but not to extend of liking it either.",Chappie

Blomkamp's District 9 was a great movie with some good actors, so naturally I was excited to hear that he was making another movie. And even more so after learning about the main character, a robot named Chappie. I rushed to the theaters on Saturday and fidgeted in my seat the whole time the commercials went on. I had heard bad reviews from critics. Copying Short Circuit? That was a horrible movie. I hoped not.The characters were what drew me in. I thought it was fantastic to add Die Antwoord. Yolandi and Ninja were great in their roles, although I very much disliked Ninja for reasons that are quite obvious. Deon didn't change much through the movie (until the end), but he still was a favorite character. The CGI was amazing and all of the action mixed with the hilarious comic relief, adorable scenes, and the heart-breaking moments made this movie a roller-coaster of emotions. And the scenes where Ninja and Amerika tried to make Chappie into a gangster were quite entertaining.Some scenes were triggering, though. Chappie was attacked a few times film, and those scenes were compared to child abuse, because he had the mental capacity of a child at the beginning of the movie. It's rather sad, but the movie was fantastic so I highly recommend watching it. The critics were dead wrong.",Chappie

So... after i watched this movie i wase shocked... seriusly shocked.. this little robot how he acts how he start to see the world to feal.. yes talking about fealings when you know he is a robot afterall.. but this MI really have a soul... at least the director set up something here that if there will be an MI someday this is how he wi8ll react at first.. this movie doesn't want to be the best just gives a message to the world for those ho willing to listen... after watching more than 790 movies in my life i finally reached the movie with 10/10 rank! The best one i ever seen in my life!,Chappie
710,cassicouture,Don't let the critics scare you away from this movie. It's great!!,9,9 March 2015,"This movie is being compared to other Sci-Fi films and it's unnecessary. CHAPPiE pulls at your heart strings and really captures you into the robot character. It's full of fun laughs and plenty of edge of your seat action. What I mainly enjoyed was falling in love with the character CHAPPiE, the reviews almost scared me away from this movie but I'm super happy I went anyways. I read through a lot of the critics reviews and found them to be too harsh on this fun/ fantastic film. There could have been a good half an hour taken out which is my only complaint about the film, the only minor issue was it had moments where it dragged but not many.I give this film a solid 9/10.",Chappie
711,golf-89394,just bad,3,4 March 2015,"If you are looking for an action scene, too bad, this movie offers little to none of it. If you are looking for drama about robot trying to understand what he is and asking for human acceptance, then no, this movie offer none of it.What this movie is offering is a constant shake on your head about how unreasonable these characters in this movie act, how sloppy the plot is and how distorted the science behind this movie logic.Overall, this is a very bad movie for me. too many plot hole, characters are too dumb to act reasonably, little to none good action scene to compensate its bad parts, and how science works in this movie is just wrong.",Chappie
712,danirindge,Questionable Underlying Theme...,4,5 March 2015,"I am hesitant to fully accept the underlying message presented. Chappie is viewed as a person and possesses virtuous characteristics that make ""his"" dignity something worth protecting and even admirable. Chappie's actions and virtues are inspiring and cause an emotional connect with the viewer, drawing us closer to desiring to emulate such behavior. As inspiring and personable as this is, I cannot help but have a pit in my stomach. Chappie is a robot , and no matter how much you program ""him"" to feel, a robot simply cannot. By holding a robot to the level of a person is belittling to our own irreplaceable uniqueness and personally insulting. The gender of ""he"" is applied to an object, something that cannot and does not have a gender or even the basic biological make up necessary. I appreciate the film for the inspiration evoking contemplation on the value of innocence and selflessness. However, the underlying theme of a mere machine requiring the same love, dignity, and respect as a person is belittling to our very nature. The attribution of an incommunicable equivalent to every human person makes me wonder how we view ourselves if the focus has been placed on objects. Even if this were a legitimate position, are we really in the proper position to place such a dignity on a robot when we are unable to uphold our own dignity for the human race? It is essential to focus on the dignity of every human person at all stages of life (from conception to natural death) before even playing with such a proposition.",Chappie
713,bugeboy,Great movie. Reviewers are way off with this.,9,5 March 2015,"This is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell Blomkamp. However, some people might consider this a fault, as Elysium was a little off the mark. What is great about the movie is its style. They really went all out with Yolandi and Ninja (the main characters part of the musical group Die Antwoord). Hugh Jackman is pretty hilarious as a bloodthirsty war vet, selling his role pretty well. The technology in this movie is fantastic, as usual coming from Blomkamp, leaving plenty of ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future. Of course, Chappie really makes this movie; taking something so technical and robotic, making it human in action. He really gets the feels going. I haven't laughed like that in a movie theater in a long time. Add to that the oddness of the characters influencing the development of Chappie, this movie is gangster. Still, 9/10, super great movie.",Chappie
714,rksh-69808,Critics may have to eat their words back...,8,6 March 2015,"The Critics seem to have taken an offense to this film and have literally badgered the ratings in Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. They feel this film is worse than Elysium and it's Neill Blomkamp's worst film. ""Robocopy"", ""Jar Jar wept.."", etc. were the exact comments critics came out with. One of them has even quoted ""I haven't been as happy to see a movie end since the third Transformers."" Are you kidding me? It was a blast and this film keeps you engaged throughout the film. There's never a boring moment. I've read most of the reviews and they only have a very few valid points. There are things like how Jackman pins Dev Patel with a gun in office without anyone saying anything or how gangsters let their kidnapping victim come and go. Yes, these are some screen writing concerns which makes the experience unreasonable at times. But it's still a breezy script and the action moves along without having a dull moment. Trust me, most of the reviews are just wild rants and people conforming to peer pressure. I'll take down their points one by one.This film has been heavily criticized for its derivativeness, especially with its links to Robocop. But hey, there's nothing original in art, and art is all about referencing other art forms. Also, original may be uninteresting and boring. On the contrary, this film is refreshing new especially the way he combined old references to create something unique. Much like Tarantino, he took it to a whole new level of existential philosophy and action. In fact, it's way better than any Robocop sequels ever made.Now, an annoying Chappie seems to have bothered many. But hey, wasn't Chappie was just as fun like being with a child. And, making it behave like a child must include a little annoyance. It makes it cute and realistic. No wonder Yolandi's motherly instincts kicked in so well. If anyone thinks that an annoying child is a bad thing then they should check with their psychiatrist immediately.Yes, the acting wasn't great like Birdman but it wasn't a distraction either. If people are upset because the actors look odd and aren't as good looking then they should think again. Nothing is noticeably bad, rather it's realistic. And, if Birdman hasn't bagged any Oscars for acting then what acting are we talking about? Sharlto Copley was awesome and how he brings Chappie to life from an inanimate is commendable. I also admire Blomkamp's guts to go in with new actors.Blomkamp has expanded big time on philosophical content in films and he really provides us with something to think about. What is consciousness and how can it pass on? Does it itself make someone exist or we only exist when others believe that we do? It's a classical existential film which tells us how important it is for us to attach meaning and purpose to a cause. It's also a statement on how the world is a bad place for an outcast or someone who is different, and expands on his earlier xenophobic themes in films.I must add that there are some missed opportunities in this film as well. The sense of style in District 9 was there but not as good and because of this the film lacked unity in style. Secondly, they could have done better with some strong actors even though the acting wasn't so bad. Third, some of the characters were really not necessary for e.g. Dev Patel could have had a minor role. They draw attention away from our main character i.e. Chappie. Also, the antagonists could have definitely been stronger and more intimidating. The film could have ended earlier and last but not the least, it needed to be a little darker and going by D9 it fell a little short there.However, saying all that doesn't take away from the fact that this is still a very emotional film and gets you to choke every now and then. At the same time it is filled with some tense action scenes. It's delivered on its ideas too and is subtle enough to scratch your head when you think about those existential questions. But, above all it's a fun ride with Chappie who's thrown into this world with no knowledge of things around him. Definitely could have done better with a little more fun and humor, but either way it was still a great watch. I loved it and I have my own reasons no matter what the others say, especially the recognized critics. So, I suggest to go and find it out for yourself because, ""I am consciousness, I'm Chappie""",Chappie
715,ephx-andrew,An Excellent Movie with a few rough edges,9,6 March 2015,"Chappie is exuberant, playful, funny and perhaps one of the most human characters to grace the screen in years. He's an unwilling action hero that one can both identify with and admire. His story is gripping and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately some of Chappie's brilliance comes at the expense of the world around him. Plot holes and logical fallacies abound, and although some of it can be written off to the imperfection of humanity (a central theme in the movie) there are enough ""Wait, why the would he/she/they do X."""" moments to be a significant distraction.Many reviewers have complained that Chappie Cliché. In an era where the majority of box office darlings with >8 star reviews are remakes, reboots or result of the Disney/Pixar/Marvel equation the majority of those reviewers are clearly either hypocrites or they don't know what cliché means. Chappie is soaked in the Blomkamp style and while that style was new and fresh with District 9, its unreasonable to expect a director's primary product to be novelty.Overall it's a good movie, certainly more interesting than most of the box-office-safe fare out that's been out there.",Chappie
716,bullet_tooth77,Great movie definitely worth watching,10,7 March 2015,"I find Chappie is an excellent movie. It is very rich in different ways, from the wide range of emotions generated in the viewer, to the action packed sequences taking place in a hip, colourful, environment. Chappie, being a robot, seems to cause discomfort to certain, causing them to even go as much as calling him annoying. It all depends on what you're in for as an experience, but him going through different phases, and mostly, being even possible through a plot that seems, let's not argue about the plausibility, but certainly quite enjoyable makes it all an entertaining story, and a refreshing perspective. Him going through innocence (Rousseau reference - good), life and its challenges, while learning what ""Being yourself"", ""Trust"" and ""Live"" mean, and then on the other hand; ""Lying"", ""Mean"" and ""Dying"" and their devastating effects, in an environment being volatile between narcotics and a child's amazement could actually make you think of certain aspectsthe importance of being true to yourself and what you desire. The movie strokes multiple times the consciousness subject through its different facets, and does a good job at it. There's an interest take on how it could be stored You get numerous laughs pertaining to modernity's characteristics, 2 automobile acronyms that matter, and then you get deep discussions from some of the characters you would least expect. Isn't that original? There are some nice references to realizing the self, the importance of good deeds; the afterlifethe same refutation that can't handle these subjects is that which makes the good struggle in the movie, in a very nice and artistic depiction. Then there's Hans Zimmer's name on the score I'd take that as a story any time, rather than drift aloof in a constant atmosphere of molestation. I don't read critics, but from what I've seen so far, they're very good at keeping it at a very simplistic level, what a sad outlook. Guess what? That's how creativity dies. At some point it gets really appealing to quickly see what another says, encompassed by routine, it comes up to being time efficient. If you don't believe it could be interestingyou don't have to go watch it. No one is forcing your eyes to open up on something elsebut if on the other hand you believe it could be appealing to you, you should go. Its message is beautifully transmitted to us, or more like brought back to us. It is the third movie by Blomkamp that I really enjoyed.",Chappie
717,gvickers-79050,Chappie was Brilliant!,10,8 March 2015,"This movie was well written from beginning right to the very end. The cinematography was absolutely brilliant. In all fairness, I did watch it on the Imax screen. Money well spent that is for sure. I was on the edge of my seat because of the intense action, there was humor and there was sadness. It had all the elements I look for in a movie. This is by far one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have seen in a long while. It reminded me greatly of District 9(which I loved), Robocop and Short Circuit. I never thought I would fall in love with another robot movie but I indeed have fallen in love with Chappie. Go see it, you won't be disappointed!",Chappie
718,jay-90125,Hijacked by bad choices....Neil what happened?,2,8 March 2015,"Neil's movies were once visionary to me but Chappie is a monumental failure from the Blom-camp (see what I did there) All bad puns aside, the movie fall apart from the word go. I actually walked out of the movie the first time I screened it. While it feels like a Blompkamp film, the story is told poorly through bad choices in actors or their connecting story lines. Possibly the worst choice ever in casting (sorry guys) is having Ninja and Yolandi (who pretty much play themselves) hijack much of the films feel by plugging their record label and style all over the film. You can tell that the much talked about fallout between them and cast members and movie upper staff, reflects in the finished product. That and maybe take out about 90 percent of the F bombs in the script...Just saying. I think Neil is trying to hard to ride the ideas of District 9 into the ground.... those days are over. Please do not bring this downward spiral of continued movie failures (yes, Elysium failed overall) into the Alien universe when you attempt that....Heaven knows that franchise has suffered enough between 3, resurrection and the wonderful AVP movies! That being said, I always look forward to the next Blomkamp film. Hoping to not be disappointed.",Chappie

If you read no further, know that this is a must see.Our hero Chappie, a grand new life, created by Deos - I mean Deon - is born not into some lab or else into some kind home, but rather the sickness of the world. From the slums to the corporate arms dealers in heaven's own half acre, the journey of a lost soul racing against his own mortality and the conflict with his maker and the nature of these strange things that hurt and lie echoes into a grand song that reverberates into every facet of this story.If you like robots, themes on the nature of man and his maker, and overcoming the forces of heaven and hell, suffer through the beautiful agony this movie will sting you with.",Chappie

I watch a lot of movies but this film was so brilliant. It was beautifully put together, it looked great, was really really funny with a great story that you cared about and some really good action but not over the top. I love how this Director can take a Sci Fi scenario and make it so realistic and engaging. I have never felt such a strong urge to buy another ticket after watching a film and I am pre-ordering this film as soon as I have finished this review. I genuinely loved this film and do feel that all different people will like it. It's not as kid friendly as you may think it would be (Not at all) but trust me thats a good thing.

What???? I absolutely loved, loved, loved this film. It had action, humour and on top of that sentiment that's really difficult to do in a film so packed with action. What is wrong with these people?? lol Anyway, i advise people to go see it and decide for yourselves!Of all the ""robot"" movies I've ever seen, this one was by far my favourite and Chappie as a character was so endearing and easy to contact with. It was interesting to see Hugh Jackman play the bad guy, he did it very well. Sigourney Weavers character was pretty pointless imo, they probably didn't need to spend money on actress like her when they didn't really utilise her, her character was pretty background and not hugely important. Maybe they just wanted a ""big"" name to sell the film and get bums on the seats?",Chappie
722,veronicamcgovern-99860,"As a Die Antwoord fan, I loved this movie!",10,11 March 2015,"I wanted to preface this review by saying that I am a Die Antwoord fan. That aside, I really did enjoy this film. This film to me is Neil Blomkamp's love-letter to Die Antwoord...with Short Circuit and a little Robocop mixed in.I initially went to see this film with a friend, expecting this film to be absolutely terrible (Come on, Die Antwoord in an action film?). I was actually really pleasantly surprised with how deep some of the themes in this film were, the special effects, and the tear-jerking scenes between Chappie, Deon, and Yolandi.But unfortunately, there were some plot holes in the film, such as (spoiler):If consciousness is transferred over to AI, does this include emotion as well? Chappie very clearly displayed emotion (such as fear, love, anger, etc.)It was actually pretty entertaining to see Hugh Jackman playing a religious nut-job, hear Die Antwoord's music as the movie soundtrack, and just overall thinking about what makes something ""human"". A really thought-provoking movie. Ignore the critics and go see it!",Chappie
723,vertigo_000,Neill Blomkamp is a genius - bad reviewers missed the point!!!,9,10 March 2015,"Like many others out there, I never bothered to review a movie - until I saw CHAPPiE! I felt compelled to correct a huge injustice. To all the negative reviewers out there on IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and Youtube - I've got news for you. You missed the point of this movie COMPLETELY! CHAPPiE is a comedy! It is supposed to be a complete FARCE! Even the trailers and all the commercials were meant to give you the WRONG impression of the premise of the movie. Clearly some of us (those of us that love this movie) figured this out in the first 5 minutes - the rest of you totally missed the boat! News flash - CHAPPiE isn't going to save the world or save humanity - he is just there to give you a really good laugh! (and I laughed throughout the entire movie) CHAPPiE is also suppose to warm your heart - and he did that in earnest! I have read a lot of critical reviews about how this movie is a rip off of many other previous Sci-Fi movies (again, that is part of the point). However, I bet many of the same negative reviewers loved Star Wars and/or Avatar - and we all know that these movies are BLATANT copies of previous works! Furthermore, many complain that the actors are ""flat"" and ""unemotional"". Again, this is on purpose! Neill wanted CHAPPiE to play center stage throughout the performance - not to be upstaged by any supporting characters. Everyone is a caricature of them selves: Deon is the uber-geek; Vincent is the dumb jock type; the gangsters are supposed to be bad parents. CHAPPiE is also clearly a nod to Anime (Appleseed most notably). Anime usually has very stiff dialog with only one main character that is outspoken - clearly CHAPPiE is this character. The only character with an ounce of humanity in his soul is CHAPPiE while all the ""humans"" around him try and destroy each other. CHAPPiE is one of the best pieces of fiction I have seen in a long time (not the mindless cookie-cutter ""drone"" material that typically comes from Hollywood these days). Do yourself a favor - forget the mindless idiots that missed the premise of this movie; grab a box of popcorn; and go see a really GREAT FUNNY movie!!!",Chappie
724,jareddeckard,Bizarre and Touching,10,10 March 2015,"On the surface this movie is a ""Pinocchio"" meets ""Mad Max"" action movie with robots in South Africa.The plot is driven by the actions of the employees at a large, government funded tactical robot manufacturer and a band of dangerous criminals who are trying to rip them off.As Chappie's character grows more complex the dialog touches on heavy subjects like childhood, spirituality, and morality.The gangsters provide a look into the dark, twisted side of the world.The story moves at a fast pace, provides satisfying hard science fiction, and evokes deep questions about the meaning of life.",Chappie
725,ritaelizabetholah,Absolutely worth watching,10,10 March 2015,"Absolutely agree with ""samwturner"" reviewing below; go watch this movie. I absolutely never write reviews, this has been the first time I ever bothered to sign in and write one, but I felt obliged, seeing the bad reviews the movie has gotten, which are frankly, bs! I am a writer and teach literature, thus have a faint idea about theme, character development and story arch, not that it should matter. I never read reviews prior to watching a film because I know that anyone should be smart enough to make up their own mind whether they want to watch something, would enjoy something or not. Chappie, as Sam said, is a lovely movie that tackles the heavy questions of humanity, mortality and consciousness with Chappie as a lovable lead. If you find yourself a nice person who is open-minded and intelligent, you will enjoy this movie made from scratch (writing, directing, etc.) by Blomkamp, which itself is a rarity in the profit-driven industry that movie making has become.",Chappie
726,stargirl-17007,Exceeded my expectations! WOW,10,10 March 2015,"Chappie will easily become one of my favourite movies. Everyone I went with loved this movie. The summary and trailer doesn't do it justice. Chappie will make you laugh, cry, smile, and think. It has many genres in it: sci-fi, drama, action, humor, love, family, growing-up, life and death. It's a great movie and I would watch it again. The story-line is very abstract and it will have you at the edge of your seat. I usually can predict how a movie will be ending but for this one I had no idea. The story was very creative and fresh. It's definitely for the younger generations who will understand the characters, the cultural references, and can identify with this movie. I loved the character of Chappie, he was the most human character of them all. I think everyone has started as a Chappie in their life, trying to lean their way and find an identity despite all obstacles.",Chappie
727,simonantonyhull,Short Circuit meets Wall-E meets Robocop?,9,17 March 2015,"Loved it! I was totally engrossed for the entire duration of the movie. The characters are very colourful, and while some make you feel uncomfortable I was surprised at how much empathy I felt for Chappie's character. My annoyance at the abuses he suffers mirrors my disdain for the abuses of innocents and the vulnerable in South Africa and around the world. (I think this is what Blomkamp might have been aiming at.) The movie gives Joburg a really bad rap, so viewers from that part of the world take note! Other than that I felt proudly South African watching something of this caliber made on South African soil. My only real irritation was the mix of accents. Most of the main characters have authentic South African accents, or something close to it. Sigourney Weaver's character is unashamedly American, and Hugh sounds very Australian while pretending to be South African. But it's the supporting actors that bothered me: guys in the crowd speaking with American accents when they are obviously supposed to be South African! It's a petty gripe, I know, but there it is.",Chappie
728,rahuljose,Cant trust the reviews in IMDb,4,11 March 2015,"I decided to go watch the movie after reading the reviews here. The movie was a modern fairy tale, vision of sci-fi dystopia or dark comedy; like the identity crisis of the film's robot, Chappie suffers from not knowing what it wants to be and a script full of dialog for simpletons and nonsensical moments galore doesn't help!!The film has some ideas and certainly looks good (as one would expect), but is all over the place and lacks much coherence, beyond honest intentions.In the end, will this be a film remembered by many people? No, I do however admire the hell out of the ideas trying to be presented here, but it all felt a little too familiar. Neil Bomkamp is without a doubt, a fantastic filmmaker, but he needs more original material. I kind of enjoyed some elements that were explored throughout this picture, but the script it too clumsy and sloppy to hold your attention past a few scenes at a time. You either buy this story how it is or you will hate it. I fall somewhere right in the middle. Overall, a promising but forgettable film.",Chappie
729,korayyalkut,Deeper than what it seems,10,12 March 2015,"Well this is my first review but I really wanted to write this for this movie. This is a very good movie in many aspects. It's expected for it to have some plots and holes when you think about the subject but as District 9 this one is also different and realistic. I'll pass all the hi-tech things and most of the logic criticism. Here we see a child learning from his environment, developing himself and taking the ways of the ones surrounding them. Making his own judgments as he grows (which is fast since it's a hi-tech robot).* SPOILER* One of the most impressive scenes was when Chappie was asking his creator why he put him in a mortal body and creator answered back saying that how could he know or anticipate how far Chappie could develop and grow. So in my opinion this is the questioning of existence. Maybe god didn't expect us to come this far...Later on when they transfer the consciousness to another body I think this represents re-incarnation and also at he same time eternal life (immortality).So this is what I see other than a great sci-fi and action movie with many colorful characters. Amazing (sometimes over the top) animation. Great humor in the way Chappie walks, talks and uses his eyebrows and ears and wiping his nose sniffing (especially that touch was great).This movie was not dull like a common sci-fi, was full of hope, entertaining, fast and clever...So you see what you look for in a movie. As you look at life itself. If you search for mistakes you'll find them, as if you choose to flow with it, enjoy and experience then you'll find that. I think this movie is really great and can be watched several times. Thank you for reading...",Chappie

The basic premise may seem tired and overused but you will soon find yourself surprised at how human the story is. Neill, much like he did with District 9, absolutely captures the human condition for those with a heart for outsiders, misfits, and the downtrodden. I can't recommend this film enough. If you're not brought to tears by the finale, I feel sorry for you. Since the ignorant AI of IMDb seems to decide whether a review is complete by the number of lines submitted I submit for your approval That Chappie Is A Marvel Of cinematic storytelling.

The robot Chappie not just marvels you but make you emotional at times. So be prepared to get your eyes drenched at times. I think these are some of those moments when you feel this is not a sci-fi or action stereotype, but that is what makes it wonderful.Action cuts are great(very less of them), actor have done wonderful job (especially the lady who acts as Chappies ""mommie"")Loved it.P.S.

If you liked District 9, then you will most surely like this one as well. It starts with the same filming style as District 9, in the sense that people are interviewed about the events that happen in the movie. In addition to this, it also takes place in the same place as District 9, Johanneberg, a corrupt city where the main characters live and work. The way the movie portrays the evolution of Chappie from a child to a ""living adult"", not only reflects our own understanding of how we raise kids in our society, but also the toll of bad socialization agents on children. In general, I would highly recommend this movie.",Chappie

The reactions of the characters doesn't make sense. When you create a gangster he needs to be a real bad ass. Not someone that can let a hostage go sleep in his bed driving his car who can go straight to the police. I have a million examples why this movie doesn't make sense but of course don't wanna spoil the movie.

This film seems to be tremendously polarizing. I based my decision to see this film upon user reviews and let me just say that it is by far a more accurate review score than what the critics give it credit for.Chappie as a film takes itself far less serious than Elysium, bringing back some of that dark humour that made District 9 such a complete joy to watch. And in all honesty I enjoyed Chappie far more than I did Elysium. Not that Elysium was in any way a bad film.But my intention is not to compare, but rather rejoice in the fact that Blomkamp brings original stories to the big screen. Yes, we've seen movies before about a robot becoming sentient, but his take on the matter is ludicrously dark, humorous and sad. And in all honesty I don't believe Blomkamp was trying to convey a message with this film, but rather just telling a story the way he saw fit. And as far as I am concerned it worked.Die Antwoord's acting leaves something to be desired, but I believe their casting was appropriate for the film. Copley gives a masterful portrayal of a robot coping with consciousness. Hugh Jackman's character is a typical villain with a magnificent mullet. Sigourney Weaver, I feel, was underutilized in the film.I think Chappie will become a cult classic and I am very comfortable with Alien 5 in Blomkamp's hands.",Chappie
735,bankbarclays,Half the viewers walked out.,1,16 March 2015,"This has to be one of the worst movie i've seen. The script and acting were bad, they had to make the robot act bad too. All throughout the screening, people would stand up, gather their things and walk out. By the end, only half had enough courage to endure such a bad movie. I'm amaze to see so many people voting this a 10. I guess these 10 votes comes from people working on this crap movie.One would assume that with a mechanical robot as the main character, children, boy in particular would enjoy this flick, but no. Chappie wasn't likable, he looked like a junkie, which was on purpose seeing he was educated to act as such.",Chappie
736,minekiller,Don't listen to the critics!!!!!!!!!,10,17 March 2015,"Don't listen to over paid critics who tear down the hard work of those who make movies. I for one don't listen to them. I think their full of beans. You are the critic. You go and see Chappie, I fell in love with that character the moment I laid eyes on him. I will stop at nothing to make sure I buy the movie day one upon its release, in support for another story about Chappie. He is my friend, one I can care for, love and appreciate who he is. Chappie, your the man. You go on and continue living. There's a place in my heart for you. I had to watch it a second time. I'll go and watch it again and again as long as I am capable of doing so. Please go see it. Wouldn't recommend it for the kids. It's definitely not a kid friendly movie. You be the judge. Die Antwoord, you guys are amazing, keep up the hard work.First off, I am adding to my review. I want to say a lot of the negative reviews I've read are horrible. Don't listen to them. I've watched the movie about ten times, plus or minus. And every time I've watched it, I have been thoroughly thrilled and enjoy Blomkamp and his directing skills. I've grown to love die antwoord and their music. I find it sad that people are to analytical about movies. I think we've forgotten the reason why we go see them, that reason is to shut your brain off and watch a piece of art unfold before you. Going and seeing movies is an escape. It truly is, go see for yourself. I loved watching chappie and how he becomes aware of what life is really like. Life is truly difficult, there's no guarantee for what tomorrow brings. I believe I can relate with chappie in my own life, chappie seeking understanding of consciousness with his maker. Go and see the movie with an open mind. If you can't do that, then maybe you shouldn't be watching movies with a negative attitude. I went and seen chappie with an open mind for the first time only because I was under the influence of something I don't care to admit on this review. The influence I am talking about truly does open your mind, though it is not needed. I personally felt a greater understanding for chappie while under the influence. Enough said, go... Watch the movie... This movie is a one of a kind. Has no comparison.",Chappie
737,appleshannon-71642,"Don't listen to the critics, watch it and make up your own mind.",10,18 March 2015,"I went to see this movie and I wasn't really expecting much. Luckily for me, I do trust IMDb ratings over those of critics. Anything about a 7/10 on here is normally worth a look from me. Usually when the people speak, they are giving an honest rating. This movie was charming, downright hilarious and it asked questions about mortality. It had the right balance between funny, and dead serious. I can't help but think that some questions could have been answered better, but maybe those were intended for a sequel. A sequel that may not get made now due to the critical response.Personally, I found one of the ""professional"" reviewers who gave this movie a 25/100 to be quite biased (the worst review the film got via metacritic btw). He talks about the band members who act in it in a distasteful manner. I didn't know who they were when I watched it, and I didn't see anything wrong with their characters. I thought they fit the movie theme well. The acting wasn't worthy of an Oscar, but since when did that totally ruin a movie experience so long as there were other layers? When challenged about his rating by a member of the public, the critic threw a very public tantrum and blocked comments on his review. He shouldn't have had to defend it if the review was deserved. People like this shouldn't really be telling the rest of us what to watch.I gave it a 10/10, not to compensate for the terrible unfair reviews that it got, but because it ticked all the boxes for me as a viewer. I am overlooking some of the so-so acting from the virtually unknown actors because 1. It made me laugh countless times, and the entire theater was in giggles, not just me. 2. Hugh Jackman as a rare bad guy, hahaha he was hilariously evil. 3. There was a charming cuteness to the main character ""chappie."" The actor who played him pulled it off really well. 4. It had plenty of action. Less profanities might have been nice, but we can't have it all.",Chappie

Great acting, great storyline, great music, great everything. I would most definitely recommend everybody watch this movie. I for one will be owning a copy of this movie when it comes out on DVD.

741,dong-shi-qi,"Huge potential, huge disappointment",6,22 March 2015,"About 20 minutes into the movie you will have already known who the director is. Many will say that Elysium was missed potential, and I think this movie is no different.This movie is certainly not bad, the visual effects were spectacular, it has a human cast which we can't hate and a robot that we can instantly relate to and feel for. Chappie is introduced to us as a kid, ""he has to learn"" says Deon Wilson, the creator of this sentient robot. We see him learn, see him grow. and see him fear death, something very human. A very emotional moment occurs when we see Chappie pleading to Vincent not to hurt him, ""Please, please"".I think we all kind of expected Hugh Jackman to be the good guy in this movie, but he plays the role of the main villain. Hugh Jackmans character just does not seem to fit into this movie. His interaction with Michelle Bradley seems to imply that she likes his idea, the ""Moose"", yet the film seems to suggest the object. Vincent Moore's motives lack conviction.Ninja and Yolandi (from Die Antwoord) plays the role of soft-on-the-inside gangsters. From the start, Ninja's characters makes questionable decisions, one minute he'll hate Chappie, and the next he'll love him.Overall the movie was enjoyable, but nothing remarkable. 6.5/10Bonus nitpick: During Deon's video log, he states that he only has ""a few terabytes of code left"" (paraphrasing but somewhere along the lines of that), thats a lot of code. A. LOT. If he can write that much code in one night, no wonder he can create AI.",Chappie

I kept thinking how on earth did Hugh Jackman get roped in to this mess?All the characters were annoying, the thick South African accents made it difficult to go with the flow as you had to translate the sentences on the fly. Given they had subtitles for a number of the characters they knew this was a problem too.The only highlight I can take away from it was seeing the preview for the new Marvel movie coming soon.Chappie, what a shocker!",Chappie
743,barrysprevaricator,Do some of you out there know the definition of a comedy?,10,27 March 2015,"Chappie is a COMEDY! I cannot believe how many reviewers still have not figured this out (must be due to so many low IQ's). I am also wondering how many ""professional reviewers"" like ""Mike Costello"" are getting paid by Hollywood to post negative reviews of this movie. How many more reviewers are going to make the same lame statement ""this isn't the movie I expected from the trailers""; rate the movie on its merits - not some 30 sec. trailer. Looking at the breakdown of the demographic of the ratings for this movie, it is obvious that only mature middle-age adults get the complexity of this movie (most of the negative reviews seem to come from teenage boys that still live in their parents' basements). Also, it is also painfully obvious that most of the negative reviewers flunked basic drama class in school (and have never been to an actual live theater performance or actually read a book). I weep how Shakespeare would rate with today's movie audience given that many complaints with Chappie are due to ""hard to understand accents"" - you people do realize this movie was filmed in a country other than USA, right?

It stars the rap-rave duo, Die Antwoord; who's acting is quite good for people who don't act. The film has many memorable moments and is full of charm. You really become attached to the character that is Chappie. The movie made me laugh, cry (Nearly), and feel. Although Die Antwoord wearing clothing with their own face on it was a bit ridiculous. In conclusion, Neill blomkamp delivers a great sci-fi film that earned its right to stand next to District 9. A lot of critics who too harsh on this film because of its choppy marketing but if you look past that Chappie is a great sci-fi flick.",Chappie

746,mikew-17227,"Very entertaining, but flawed",8,12 February 2020,"This is a really cute film, with good actors and acting, and great special effects. The story is interesting too. The many flaws are a serious detraction, but didn't stop me from watching to the end. But details matter. Some of the flaws are small, and I overlooked because handling them properly would have added to the film's length. But some of them were just awful for anybody with an ounce of tech knowledge. They jolt you back to reality when you're expected to believe stuff that couldn't possibly happen. It actually felt insulting that the film's makers expect us to go along with it. Spoilers ahead
As a programmer, I cringed when the AI program was good to go after one successful compile. He did say he was ready to test it on hardware, but the test consisted of loading it once, and off we go. In the real world, there are runtime errors that require code fixes, especially considering that this was the first AI program of its kind.Chappie's first ""instinct"" upon achieving consciousness was to exhibit fear and a desire to hide. As much as you might want to overlook it, Chappie is a robot, with programming, and that behavior would have had to be programmed. Why would you make that design decision? Makes no sense.The movie Short Circuit handled the education of a new AI lifeform much better. Chappie's learning seems to leapfrog without a basis to get there.A major error was the helmet used to read brainwaves. It was designed for human brains, yet it works perfectly when placed on a robot head. Does anybody think Chappie's head contains a human brain?We saw the police robots get fried circuits when they were all shut down. Yet at the end it just took a simple software reload and they're good to go again.Those are just off the top of my head. The movie was riddled with such glaring errors. It saddens me to see that they put so much effort into this movie, yet didn't bother to clean up the script to fix things like this. In spite of this, it's still worth seeing.",Chappie
747,germanamaciocci,"Fair is Foul and Foul is Fair: finding God in a Sci-Fi Movie. A Review of Humandroid, directed by Neill Blomkamp",10,12 May 2015,"You can read a very good summary of the plot on Wikipedia, therefore I will not talk about it here. I fore say that before watching this film I did not know who was director Neill Blomkamp, and ​​I still do not know who he is, and I had not seen his previous films. I do not know if I'll watch them one day, too. But, after nearly a week, the idea of ​​writing my thoughts on this film, which was born immediately after seeing it, now comes into life on my blog.I would invite you in any case to go and watch it, forgetting, when possible, any comparison with previous films such as AI, I Robot, Wall E, and above all, Robocop or Terminator. Especially because such artistic comparisons are always harmful, such as those between brothers. And also because, to give examples that make a sense, the artificial intelligence of Chappie, created by Deon (which is pronounced Dion, and in Italian Dio is the word for God) not only does not respond to the laws of robotics: he is undeniably good, up to transcending orders that humans want to impose him (he disobeys to its creator remaining with the clan of the ""bad guy"" Ninja for the love of Yolandi, Ninja's girlfriend, who treats him as a loving and patient mother would do with her own child), but his goodness is not lacking a particular sense of justice (if you consider the scene where he fights nearly to death Vincent Moore, because he killed Yolandi with the Moose). Of course, as a child, he trusts, and he literally interprets the messages that are addressed to him, especially at the beginning. But Chappie evolves, thinks, chooses, exceeds his creator managing to transfer his consciousness on a laptop, bringing then back to life even Deon, himself in a new ""body"", and the same Yolandi.But, hear ye, in the aforementioned scene, Chappie not only does not kill Vincent. Chappie forgives him.Talking about comparisons with other films, trying to explain the whys and wherefores of director or authors Some critics even wondered why Deon decides to create a robot with its own conscience! Let's not forget that science fiction starts precisely from imagination, and not everything has to be explained, otherwise where does the senses of surprise, discovery, curiosity go, when it is often torn apart by too complex plots (plotswhich, instead of simplifying stories, make them even more unlikely)? Is reality itself, not to mention human spirit, decipherable with an algorithm? The only sensible question that could come out from the vision of this movie would be precisely that, and for those who believe in God and for those who do not believe in him: could anyone possibly reduce human consciousness, our sentient part in a series of strings, transferable from one body (or a machine) to another? But we're still just talking about science-fiction Can we for once enjoy watching a movie without becoming all film critics or Rita Levi Montalcini? Otherwise, how sad my friends I came to the conclusion that what also strikes bad about this film could be that, taken for granted a provocative intent of the authors, there is not a radical departure between good and bad. Or, talking about complex human beings living in a complex world, influenced not only by family environment, economic and social status, education and so on and so forth, anyone can decide his own future because we make choices determined by our personal sense of justice. Still someone wrote it was annoying that Hugh Jackman played the villain in this movie: first of all, he is an actor, and actors' skills include also the capacity to play different parts. Talking about the character he plays, again, he is not definitely bad: he is really convinced that with its big reinforced robot he can eliminate the cancer of violence from his world – as when we say to our children to stop to scream, and we tell them screaming Refusing to be aware that the nuances of the human soul are certainly not only fifty and they have no definite colors, makes us certain less aware than Chappie and his consciousness, which would therefore come out as higher than human's. And maybe is this the disturbing matter of this film?Personally, I think there is more humanity in this story, that in many other films or television shows of mold indulgent- philosophizing which are proposed to us every day. I conclude here quoting my friend Giulia, who I ""forced"" to go see Humandroid. After watching it, she said that one thing she could say for certain, if the film was made with the sole intention of proving that, once again, the good side is the winning one, the authors of this film are perfect Christians without even knowing it. And Daniele, who states that the his favorite part of the movie is the one where Chappie saves Dean, he wondered why in a particularly bloody scene I instinctively covered his eyes with one hand, ""Mom, but why? You know that I can understand very well the difference between reality and fantasy!""Good boy. Probablyhe will never become a critic.",Chappie

The accent was meh but I'm sure the Australian accent in South Africa is rough. All in all great movie. The acting wasn't that bad. I don't understand how this movie got bad reviews. Maybe because of the religious aspect of it. I'm the manliest man ever and I actually shed tears during the movie. Honestly I would recommend buying the DVD or even renting it from Red Box before buying it. So now I have to come up with some jargon to fill up my 10 lines.

Why didn't Ninja and his crew just get out of town? What is with the conception of turning people into robots? Why was Jackman is still hired, I know you can't pull a gun out in your job?

I agree that there are a few logical flaws in the behavior of some of the characters. However, this is more than made up for by the visuals, the humor and the emotional warmth in the movie. Often, the sci-fi genre is afraid to tackle emotional subjects, for fear of losing its macho audience, but I think that this movie is bold enough to go there. Also, I want to mention that it is refreshing to see the action set in an uncommon location. Overall, the movie is fast-paced and entertaining, and is a must-watch if you are willing to overlook the logical flaws for some novelty.",Chappie

And I heard that you can't compare one artist/art with another. It is a great movie and if I would read all those terrible comments about the film i wouldn't watch it. But I am glad I didn't because it was one of the best movies I saw for the last few years. It wasn't cheesy like other films with worn out lines and boring story lines. I think that the reason why so many people hate it or don't like it is because they are used to movies like Avengers or Fast and furious franchises but they don't see the movie as they should see. You can see that they put a lot of effort in making it. the effects are great and the story line is even better. I found it stunning how Blomkamp could show us a not ordinary and 100 % perfect world like a lot of movies show us today. There isn't just black and white and movie shows that really well.

I truly believe that Deon should have been his mentor from the beginning. Besides this issue that I have I found, the movie was really mind-blowing.

I know it's impossible to make a movie which everybody likes, but this movie gave me the creeps and goosebumps several times, and it was all worth watching it.The movie has a lot of similarities with District 9, including the way you follow the characters in the movie. This documentary perspective at some points, makes it seem like your'e actually watching the news or a documentary, which gives you somehow the feeling of reality and trueness. This is definitely a long shot from the director, but it gives the movie a certain edge to it, which is rather uncommon.It's no secret I liked the movie a lot. If your mind is set for sci-fi and just sucks it in, this movie will make you feel something. To make robots which looks like humans and behaves like them too, is going to twist your mind. You are going to like the robot, have sympathy with the way Chappie acts.This subject will everyone have an opinion about, and I think the director hits the head on the nail on this one. This is what makes the movie so fantastic. He questions the humanity by bringing consciousness to a robot which behaves just like human beings, and if that isn't a subject to discuss these days, I don't know what isn't.I really recommend it. And remember, what is life without questions?",Chappie
756,banjonavarro,The story failed the new concept of police robot.,3,1 June 2015,"The scrip is very illogical in the sense that it lacked common sense. I mean, how could Deon not call the police when he had the chance to take Chappie back? Really? A genius could not think of that? Where's the security in Tetravaal? No cameras? How could Deon and Vincent slip away with the key guard? Or whatever they called it. When Deon was shot, why would they not go to the hospital instead of transferring his consciousness? I mean that's where the first place to go.As for my review, there are many gaps and out of the context decisions by characters in the story. Some may argue that this movie is revolutionary in the sense that it goes away with the ""mainstream stories"" and tackles rather ""socio-political issues"". But I've seen a lot of movies like that, and they were not mediocre like what Chappie movie shows. The story could have been better. I was expecting more of ""what would a human do"" on several scenes rather than ""how stupid can human be"".If the story was about corrupt government and society, well, it failed to show it. Although it showed potential in giving a new taste of robot police concept, the story failed it.",Chappie

Hugh Jackman looked like Hugh jackass. the story doesn't seems to be synced properly at all. almost everything seems to be mess. hope next time this director makes a better movie or no story based action movie.

762,onlineguy-11576,"Just an ""Okay"" Movie and Lacks Realism in Regards to AI",5,10 June 2015,"Before I begin my review, I wanted to say that this review contains what some people may call a spoiler. I was careful though to give away as little information as possible so as not to lessen anyone's enjoyment of the movie.I would say that this movie was an okay movie, and is not worthy of more then a rating of 5. I did have some fun watching the movie, but I didn't feel like I was watching the greatest movie in the world. It felt like a low budget movie, regardless of how much money was actually spent on it's production. After watching this movie, I thought of it as a ""Poor Man's Version"" of the movie Short Circuit. Where Short Circuit was very funny and enjoyable to watch from beginning to end, this movie differed in I was getting bored and annoyed at various parts thru out. It also lacked the good taste that I found in the movie Short Circuit. The parts of the movie I was getting annoyed at included the parts portrayed by the actor who played the ""daddy"" of Chappie. It was just totally unbelievable. I thought his acting was over the top, and just plain annoying to watch. I also did not like the other actor who played the character who was ""owed"" the 20 million. I thought his acting was over the top too, and whoever was his writer did not do a good job. I think a better writer would of given him better lines to speak. However, the redeeming grace of the movie and the reason I would still give it a rating of 5, was the quality of the other actors work. I especially liked the actor who played ""mommie"" for Chappie, I liked the actor who was the ""maker"", and most of all I liked the actor who played Chappie. These three actors, made up for the poorer quality of the other actors work, and made the movie enjoyable to watch. However, my biggest criticism of the movie is how it handled the subject of Artificial Intelligence. I am a firm believer in the science of Artificial Intelligence and the possibility of someday having computers that can think as well or better then humans. The movie did not promote the possibility of Artificial Intelligence like it should of done since it handled the subject like a joke, and for that I was very disgusted thru out my entire time of watching it. Furthermore, it did not add any entertainment value to the movie with the way they did it. Lastly, it totally ignored all the science behind Artificial Intelligence. (Note: The information that some people may call a spoiler that I mentioned in the beginning is coming up next) An example of how it ignored the science is it wasn't possible in the movie to copy a working Artificial Intelligence from one machine to another using something like a copy command. I would give other examples of where the Artificial Intelligence did not make sense scientifically but they would be major spoilers, and I do not want to give away anything major.Enjoy the movie!",Chappie

But A.I. is raped with worst possible way they can. God bless Hollywood. I am an I.T. Engg. and as I know, A.I. is totally different thing, and what they shown in movie is stupidity.

The plot is seriously lacking anything riveting or engaging, the dialogue is equally as lackluster and the plot is hopeful to reach the caliber of Ex Machina and the latest Mad Max in the utmost of shortcomings it could've resulted in. IMDb with a 7/10 is greatly misleading and you should do anything but waste your time on this film. I'd rather watch a recent Adam Sandler flick. Wit very little to go on in terms of a plot worth investing your thought or energy, quips that fall very flat on their face, a point of tension that doesn't really have you feeling like the edge of your seat is a place...

Although Ninja was a jerk, especially when it came down to ""tough love"" and leaving him to fend for himself, I respected that he apologized and tried to be better toward Chappie. Deon was from beginning to the end devoted to Chappie and would do anything to make sure he was okay. Throughout the film you hear Chappie say ""I cannot, I promised maker"" and it just speaks volumes on his intelligence and understanding of what it means to be honest and feel. When it comes down to being different, it's beautiful to watch a character transform. I felt for Chappie and simply loved the concept of this film.",Chappie

And I've already watched chappie 4 times this week. Die Antwords appearance in the movie added a certain perfection I couldn't have ever expected before viewing this film. I would be extremely excited to know if there was going to be a sequel or not. Chappie and everything that went with it was bad-ass.

As such, I went in expecting a mediocre movie. Boy, was I disappointed! If I would have gone in to the movie thinking it was going to be the worst film ever, I would have given the movie at least a 3. The acting was the worst I have ever seen.

I'm not going to go into a long diatribe, I just found it preposterous, not because of the concept of the film which is following a current trend in near future Ai/robot story lines, but because of the almost cartoonish acting, and the disjointed implausible plot development from start to finish. I am a Sigourney Weaver fan but I'm afraid this is a turkey for her, and I guess the other main actors will list this film very low down on their CV. Anyone that watches this film should then compare it with another recent Ai film; 'Ex Machina', which I consider to be a far superior movie on all levels.",Chappie

From it's logic, full of holes, to it's acting and more... was just terrible! Never have I so happily been cheering that the main characters get killed. I mean, what were they (the filmmakers) trying to convey? Why did they want you to cheer for the thugs? And I mean thugs! Ninja and the group... terrible!

I couldn't even finish the damn film first time through because it just lost my interest within the first 30 minutes. I got to about the half way point (about an hour and 10 minutes or so) into the film, but then had to stop it and watch something else before returning to it. The only redeeming factor from the whole film is you feel bad for the robot, Chappie, and the special effects are pretty damn cool. But that's not enough for a film to be watchable or enjoyable. I mean, even Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver couldn't save this stink bomb of a film! So, in short, avoid this film! It quite possibly may lower your IQ, or give you cancer.

777,admin-01276,Horrible script,1,17 October 2015,"I am a South African. Indeed, part of the same OMNI magazine reading generation that Neill Blomkamp came from. I should be biased to be supportive. But, sadly..., err, how do I say this..., Neill wrote a real SH*TTY script. I have this sick notion that he was probably trying to follow in the tradition of the indie spirit of many a writer/director (like Tarantino) who threw caution to the wind and did it their way. You know that type of movie professional: the one wanting to be a one of those new ""cool"" writer/directors like..., and being so fresh, disruptive..., like..., doing it in your own style and bringing a new and innovative flavour to mainstream cinema. You know ""Gangsta style"" or the ""you don't steal cars from Daddy"" style - township gangster style. Jaaaa..., (note the long drawn Afrikaans version of the English word ""yes"") brush that paint of ""South Africaness"" layered deep and wide to make it look different and authentic. Wah, wah, waaahhh....You can bring the heavy guttural South African accent to your protagonists, the gritty Joburg and Soweto style scenery, and the electronic Afrikaans voice generated soundtracks to the party - you know, to bring a fresh perspective on so many a hackneyed narrative that Hollywood churns out. BUT, please, please, (ag, asseblief man)..., use all that South African charm and grit ONLY with a worthy script.It does have have an upside or two though: its well positioned to entertain the sh*t out of pre-teens who do not need to appreciate how inconsistent the science, logic, and common-sense is in the film.It could also be entertaining for those who see it in a comedic slant too. Hugh Jackman and Dev Patel probably weren't aware it would come off being like that. Maybe they did and thought this was an excellent opportunity to further their careers. (Joke!) The comedic genre would mostly be appreciated by South Africans. So many figures in the film speak to an infantility of the South African imagination. The language we used ourselves as kids playing ""cops and robbers"" on the streets of Pretoria and Joburg. What does Hugh Jackman say in the 101st minute - ""This is your day of reckoning..., boy""?

The way the computer programs are projected on to the audience is really neat, photography is above average, soundtrack suits the setup.

782,ben-13392,Low expectations may be why I love this film so much.,9,2 March 2017,"I did not care for any of the hype when this film was released. I initially wrote it off as another Hollywood re-do of one of my favorite childhood films, this time being Short Circuit. I refused to see it at the theater, and I regret that decision now. Since then I have watched it at least a dozen times. I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum as I elaborate on why I love this film.The world of Chappie is very much like our own, though slightly more dystopian. Violent crime has ravaged Johannesburg to a point that police forces are unable to combat street gangs and an ever revolving door of drug lords. Enter Deon Wilson. A genius engineer / programmer that has designed a V.I. (Virtual Intelligence) controlled robotic police force used for heavy suppression of violent crime. (A Robotic SWAT team if you will.) These machines are able to take back the city almost overnight, and with far less collateral damage than a full military force could hope to do. This success sets Deon up as the savior of the city from the viewpoint of law enforcement. However Deon's end goal was never V.I., as he has somewhat of a GOD complex. To Deon, V.I. is just a stepping stone to a true A.I. capable of independent thought.Obviously, Deon is able to create a stable A.I. but does not have the patience to test it in an appropriate manner. His excitement gets the best of him, and he decides to install his A.I. in a damaged, and irreparable police drone. Chappie is then born with a blank slate, and this makes him incredibly human. There is very much a coming of age story, though at a highly accelerated pace because of how fast Chappie is able to learn. (Especially once he accesses the internet.) To go further in detail would end up short selling the dramatic elements within the film, but I can wholeheartedly say that Neill Blomkamp managed to take everything great about Short Circuit, and create a completely unique (and adult) story that is easy to accept, and well explained. The movie is violent, crude, and often hilarious. I risked breaking the re-wind function on my laptop the first time I heard Chappie call a woman a ""slut"" while car-jacking her. The acting is great throughout particularly by Hugh Jackman who plays Vincent Moore, an engineer with a GOD complex that is a stark contrast to Deon's. Moore aspires to be a Zeus-type GOD, relishing destruction over creation. Ninja and Yo-Landi of Die Antwoord are surprisingly good in the film as well. The CGI is spectacular. Take notes Lucasfilm...There are shortcomings in the film that are more annoyances than anything. Jose Pablo Cantillo's character Amerika is a total ""Vato"" stereotype, and a terrible one at that. It felt very forced, dishonest, and frankly unnecessary. He would have been a fine cast, if he had played a character closer to his SOA role as Hector Salazar. They could have edited his character out of the film completely, and it would have been better. The ""Vato loco ese"" base was all wrong. Cantillo is a much better actor than that. It would have been the same as seeing Mekhi Phifer acting like DMX. Grrrr ARF! ARF!The whole introduction of the film showing different talking-head opinions on Chappie and Deon are completely lost in the film, UNLESS you watch the alternate ending which is much darker (and better IMO) than the theatrical ending. I could have completely done without this introduction though, as it seemed to be pulled directly from District 9. Yes, same writers / director, but it's a trite way to build interest and curiosity. In fact, the ONLY reason it was acceptable in D9, was because of the ""Documentary"" style filming. Chappie was not shot the same, and shouldn't have been introduced as such.Chappie refers to himself in the 3rd person. It's cute, but actually makes him seem less-human since this is a completely unnatural way to speak.The Crime-Lord Hippo is WAY over the top. Not at all a bad performance or unfitting for the film, just a little extravagant for someone who has reached the top of the criminal food-chain. You just couldn't be that outlandish and not be locked up or killed by the authorities, even if they are completely overwhelmed.Whatever drug Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika are pushing, looks like moth balls. Seems like it would have been less effort and more believable to fill little baggies with baking powder. I'm nit-picking at this point, but it's weird.I expected this movie to p!ss me off, but instead it's become one of my all time favorites. Even if you end up disagreeing with me, it's definitely worth watching. As far as Blomkamp's works go, I say it's better than District 9, and on par or slightly better than Elysium.

But any attempt to describe it as a thought-provoking look at the nature of consciousness and what it means to be human should be met with a roll of the eyes.The plot is dead simple and the attempts at exploring the ideas mentioned above are hamfisted at best. The character evolution also comes off as contrived and forced. The characters themselves are a shadow of what was seen in District 9. They do what they have to in order to move the story, but they lack any real depth. The most important part of any adversarial movie is the antagonist. Without her/him the heroes are just sitting around drinking coffee. Chappie has truly uninspired bad guys. One is an ex-military, ambitious, win-at-any-cost type. The other is a mindless, greedy, thug. Standard stuff.I found myself bursting out in laughter throughout the movie. I wonder, was it supposed to be a comedy?

This is the first movie I have ever watched that I was really hoping all of the main characters would fail horribly and die so that none of their plans could be brought to fruition. Huge Jackman is the antagonist.... kinda. I was rooting for him to succeed more often then not, he has a few moments when he seems to suffer from PTSD that make you think oh I guess he is supposed to be the bag guy. Chappie oh Chappie, I usually don't notice when a character is being used to fill a stereotype but this was pretty undeniable. The way this Robot.... oh words fail to come to mind that can describe him. I felt that he ""might"" have been used to portray a Mexican stereotype, just maybe. I found it really racist, and I hope that the director was doing it that way, so that when I laughed I knew without a doubt I am a broken and horrible human who needs to take I extra long look at myself crying into a bucket of ice cream. You would figure they would have just used a South African stereotype for Chappie. Then again they might have a lot of stereotypical Mexicans in South Africa, I have not been there so I do not know. The main Doctor was crazy at one point he threatens another character by saying he would report him. I had to pause the movie at that point and contemplate how stupid he would have to be to even consider doing that. It took me ten minutes before my laughing subsided. My mind was blown. If he would have done that at that point the other guy would have received a possible slap on the wrist. Where on the other had the Dr would have potentially been put in a windowless room deep underground so they could still force him to make creations but never allow him to see the light of day. The ""mom"" and ""dad"" once again gloriously horrible creatures that made me wonder if they could possibly exist. That though robbed me of sleep for a week. This movie is absolutely a treasure of terribleness I loved/hated every last minute of this.Do I recommend this movie? No, oh god no that would make me a horrible person. Hum.... I guess I kinda am in a way so I guess I do recommend this movie. You have been warned so enjoy.",Chappie
792,edwinjshin,Nicely done,8,9 August 2017,"Not typically a fan of si-fi as they can become unwatchable(Indiana Jones: Crystal Skull), however this was an impressive film. I personally would have enjoyed a different set of characters instead of Ninja's gang but maybe that's just me. The movie has many underlying themes which I feel is very common from movies outside of America. You can see the lengths people will go just to get what they want whether it be right or wrong. Don't let the bad reviews push you away from this film as I can understand why some people might have trouble following the plot. I have noticed some reviews actually have their characters mixed up and that does not surprise me. Keep in mind that films outside of the US normally take more critical thinking as everything is not spoon fed to you. The film may not be for the uneducated.",Chappie
793,jhanelam,Robo baby.,9,25 March 2018,This is a weird sci-fi dystopian movie about a robot being born to an Indian creator who loses him to some wannbe gangsters and what appears to be South Africa. The robot named chappie is a metaphor for The Human Experience as we all experience. He goes through trials and tribulations to eventually learn what it means to be human as a robot with and expiration as we humans have. Throughout the course of this movie we eventually sympathize and empathize with a robot who is used and abused by the systems of surrounding him as his only goals are to keep living.,Chappie

796,DruidessOfMidian,"Totally gripping and addictive watching, I need more!",10,20 January 2019,"Just watched #Chappie and was totally glued to the screen! I've always had a soft spot for sentient AI films ( #ShortCircuit #BatteriesNotIncluded etc), as well as anything #CyberPunk, #TankGirl, #PostApocalyptic, #Dystopian and this film rocks all those boxes and then some!Totally arse kicking action and all the feels, plenty going on while riding this one's waves! Frakking awesome cast, #YoLandiVissir and #Ninja were epic as always, #SharltoCopley was awesome as #Chappie and #DevPatel played an incredibly emotive ""maker"" - this film has left me buzzing, it's pretty rare for any recent films to have this affect on me, to keep me utterly gripped to the point I just absorbed the story and completely forgot about the dinner I was eating... I now have numb hands from where I'd been gripping my eating irons the entire time! 😂Deffo a new found favourite, 10🌟!",Chappie
