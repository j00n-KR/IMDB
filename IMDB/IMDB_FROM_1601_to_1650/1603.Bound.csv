0,Leofwine_draca,B-movie thriller with some good moments,6,3 June 2016,"BOUND is a Tarantino-style thriller that comes to us courtesy of the Wachowski siblings. These are the two brothers (who have now transitioned to sisters) who wowed audiences with THE MATRIX but have been disappointing ever since. I quite liked this as an early step in their career, although it is quite forgettable and quite clearly a B-movie.I did get a chuckle when I read that Bogart and Eastwood were acting inspirations for the main characters, played by a game Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly. Both are acceptable as the couple embarking on a torrid lesbian affair and getting involved with some violent gangsters, but to link this to classic, golden age cinema in any way, shape, or form is a joke. Gershon has done better work elsewhere while Tilly is too much of a mouth breather (similar to Renee Zellweger) to take seriously.Instead, as I said, the influence is clearly Tarantino, so expect lots of shouty moments, quick fire dialogue, and expletives. I thought the use of the single location (a grubby apartment) was handled very well, and there are some nice twists and turns as the story progresses. Joe Pantoliano (MEMENTO) gives probably the best performance as the out-of-his-head boyfriend, and it's nice to see John P. Ryan (IT'S ALIVE) on screen again, although he looks very old and isn't in it much; this was his last acting role.",Bound
1,SnoopyStyle,Fabulous noir style,8,9 August 2015,Corky (Gina Gershon) is a lesbian ex-con who is working as a handywoman in an apartment building owned by criminals. Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) are the couple living next door to the room she's working on. Violet seduces Corky. Violet wants to run off and suggests stealing $2 million from Caesar who is laundering money for the mob.This has fabulous noir style. It is darkly beautiful. The Wachowskis show early on their amazing visual style. This is also very sexy due to the pairing of Gershon and Tilly. They are not only beautiful but they also have these magnetic personalities. They fit their roles so well. The Wachowskis add brutal violence to this heady mix for their impressive directorial debut.,Bound
2,Prismark10,Painting a plan,6,22 May 2016,"Bound is Wachowski's first film as writer/directors and put them in the map that led to the Matrix films.There is very little original about it. A non pastiche Coen Brother's modern film noir with Tarantino dollops of violence.Ex-con plumber Corky (Gina Gershon) moves in next door to a gangster's moll Violet's (Jennifer Tilly) apartment to redecorate and both become attracted to each other. It is one of the few mainstream films that actually offers a better portrayal of lesbian sex.Violet's gangster boyfriend Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) launders money for the mafia. The two women plot to steal $2 million from Caesar and frame him, so his bosses think he stole it. We already see the mafia's boss son sadistically torture one schmuck.The plan seems to be going fine but Ceasar does not run when he sees that the money is missing and starts to work things out leading to mayhem for the two women.There is nothing new in the plot and I found Tilly's acting rather off, her voice sounds like it has had a dose of helium.What the Wachowski's get right is to make a mean and tight thriller on a low budget making the best use of cinematography and art direction at their disposal.Interestingly the Wachowski's did subvert the female role in the 'Heist' genre. Corky is essentially the male character in these type of films. It might also offer an insight to the Wachoswki's own trans journey.",Bound
3,kosmasp,Break free,9,11 November 2019,"Bound - not just a great title, but also a great movie. And I'm not saying this, because this has beautiful women in the main roles (who happen to be lesbian or bisexual and very openly so, at least towards each other), but because it works as a thriller! While the setting is confined, there is much to discuss and disect. Be it the very naughty/wet theme throughout or how things unfold.Some things cannot be planned, others people do not see coming because of their ... let's call it ideology. Revisiting this all these years later only made me cherish certain things more. Great cast, no one being afraid (or at least it looks like they're not) to go all the way. And a very funny audio commentary on the Arrow UK release of the movie too. Guessing it is on other releases too, but that's the release I purchased. Not for the faint hearted or people easily offended (I really don't get the outrage, from neither side) ... but everyone else who can just sit back and enjoy this for what it is",Bound
4,classicsoncall,"""You're among good people here.""",9,20 June 2018,"So what would you call this - an erotic thriller? A sexy gangster flick? A sleek suspense drama? Hey I got it, Thelma and Louise on steroids!However way you look at it, this is one smooth ride with a perfectly cast mix of deceitful characters who keep you guessing with their motivations and duplicity. Jennifer Tilly is perfectly suited for dumb blonde roles, the only problem here is she's not dumb, and definitely not blonde. Gina Gershon just oozes sexiness, even when she's beaten and tied up by Joe Pantoliano's character, who's got the sleaze factor down just about right. The story is filled with enough double crosses to make your head spin, and doesn't let up on the tension until the very end.From the delinquently fertile minds of the Wachowski Brothers (Lana and Lilly, go figure), this is a finely crafted suspense film that borders on both horror and soft porn, but in a slightly demented good way if you know what I mean. As the viewer you're always kept guessing about that cool, two point one seven million, and when the dust settles and the paint dries, you know that the only difference between Violet and Corky is..., not one thing.",Bound
5,gavin6942,Surprisingly Good Crime Neo-Noir,8,16 May 2015,"Corky (Gina Gershon), a tough female ex con and her lover Violet (Jennifer Tilly) concoct a scheme to steal millions of stashed mob money and pin the blame on Violet's crooked boyfriend Caeser (Joe Pantoliano).For the first half hour, I was not at all convinced this was the great film some make it out to be. Although I really liked the aesthetic, the focus on the romance was not really necessary and almost seemed exploitative. (And not because it was a lesbian romance; most love scenes in movies are gratuitous.) But once it got going, wow, what a brilliant game of double cross, and yet tightly scripted. Not too many characters, very few sets (almost completely within one apartment), and some great, nasty characters. This was like a nihilistic stage play come to life.",Bound
6,lee_eisenberg,Noir and sexuality,10,30 December 2017,"The film noir is a genre widely associated with the 1940s and 1950s. Occasional movies since then have dabbled in the genre (such as Oliver Stone's ""U Turn""), but ""Bound"" is probably the most interesting. Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly play lesbians who scheme to obtain a bunch of money from Tilly's character's mafia husband (Joe Pantoliano). But things don't quite go as planned, leading to some of the tensest moments ever put on screen.The Wachowski sisters (brothers at the time, as they hadn't yet transitioned) say that the movie is about ""the boxes people make of their lives"", that it is not only gay people who ""live in closets"". Most of the movie takes place in closed spaces, while Tilly's character is trapped in her marriage.Whatever the case, it's an impressive piece of work. The Wachowskis continued their fine output with ""The Matrix"" and ""Cloud Atlas"" (while producing ""V for Vendetta""). In the meantime, ""Bound"" constituted part of the shift in cinema's depictions of LGBT people. I recommend it.",Bound
7,jboothmillard,Bound,7,8 July 2005,"I always remember this film for the obvious sequences between the female characters, but I am glad I watched it to judge it as a full film also, directed by Lana and Lilly Wachowski (then Andy and Larry) (The Matrix Trilogy, Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas). Basically lesbian ex-con Corky (Gina Gershon) has finished a five-year jail sentence, she is now working in an apartment building as a painter and plumber, she is working next-door from Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). Violet is intrigued by Corky, after Caesar has gone out Violet asks Corky to help retrieve an earring that has fallen down the sink, she slowly seduces Corky, and admits to doing it on purpose, they kiss. They are interrupted by Caesar arriving, Corky finishes work for the day, Violet follows her, they go to Corky's apartment and have sex, the next morning Violet tells Corky that Caesar launders money for the Mafia, and has been with him for five years. Violet overhears Caesar and his associates beating and torturing Shelly (Barry Kivel), she is upset by the violence and cruelty, she tells Corky she wants to get away and have a new life, she tells that Caesar will be counting $2 million that Shelly took in the apartment, the two women hatch a plan to steal it. Johnnie (Christopher Meloni), the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzzone (Richard C. Sarafian), has shot and killed Shelly, Caesar returns with the bloody money and proceeds to wash, iron and hang it to dry. Violet explains that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, Johnnie will be coming to the apartment to collect to the money, the plan is for Corky steal the money from the briefcase, Violet will then tell Caesar she has seen Johnnie leaving, making Caesar think that the money was stolen by him. Corky and Violet think that Caesar will be forced to go on the run because Gino will assume he took the money, not Johnnie, but things go awry when Caesar realises if he runs, Gino will think he took the money, he decides he must try and get it back from Johnnie, and he forces a panicked Violet to stay. While Corky is waiting next-door with the money, Gino and Johnnie arrive, Caesar pulls his gun out and accuses Johnnie of stealing the money, in angry panic he kills him, his father and bodyguard Roy (Gene Borkan), Caesar narrowly avoids being caught by two police officers, alerted by a neighbour who reported the gunshots. Caesar tells Violet they have to find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived, unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment Caesar buys some time by calling Mafia friend Mickey (John P. Ryan), telling him Gino has yet to arrive. However Caesar discovers it was Corky and Violet that stole the money, he ties them up and gags them, threatening to torture and demanding to know where the money is, but he is interrupted by the arrival of Mickey, Caesar panics and makes a deal with Violet to help him stall. As Caesar plans to kill Mickey, Violet calls the landline from Johnnie's cell phone, she convinces him to pretend he is speaking to Gino, calling from hospital following an accident, Mickey is convinced and leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar she has hidden the money in a can of paint, he goes to find it, while Violet manages to escape and calls Mickey, convincing him that he stole the money and told her to keep quiet. Corky tries to stop Caesar taking the money, he beats her and is about to kill her, but Violet points a gun at him and tells him Mickey is on his way and says he should run while he can, Caesar tells Violet she will not shoot him, but she does, killing him. In the end Mickey believes Violet's story, he tells her he will find Caesar and there will be no police involvement, he wants her to be his girlfriend, but Violet longs for a clean break, so she drives away with Corky and the money. Also starring Mary Mara as Sue the bartender, Ivan Kane as Cop #1 and Kevin Michael Richardson as Cop #2. Tilly is gorgeous with her whispery voice, Gershon is good as the woman who makes the plans, together they are convincing lovers, and Pantoliano is good as the mobster who loses his rag easily, it is a good simple story of two women who want to swindle the mob and be together, the passionate lesbian scenes are the most memorable, but it also works well as a funny and gripping crime story, a terrific crime thriller. It was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!",Bound
8,rmax304823,Nifty B Thriller,6,26 December 2004,"With very little effort you could visualize this on the screen of some neighborhood theater -- The Ritz or the Bijou or the Mayfair -- in, say, 1949. Only then it would be in black and white. The credits take about 90 seconds to unroll. It stars people like Edmond O'Brian and Adele Jergens and Marie Windsor and Ted DeCorsia. It's not called ""Bound,"" though. I'm having a little trouble putting that together. It's called something more like ""The Big Con"" or Edge of Darkness"" or ""Where Danger Lives."" ""Bound"" is a bit too suggestive even for 1949.""Bound"" is a B movie. The script is pretty elementary, the film has no bankable stars, everybody double-crosses everybody else, and it's cheaply made. But it's updated through the direction, which gives us not just some hood holding a snub-nosed .38 at his hip and shooting someone once. Instead, the hood holds his big pistol sideways and at eye level. Okay, this makes no sense. If you're going to hold it high enough to take aim, why hold the weapon sideways? The answer, I guess, is that that's how it's done in modern thrillers. Frankly, I blame Bruce Willis for this. He was the first to use this self-defeating convention on screen, that I know of, in ""Die Hard."" It's updated too in that the director has more freedom. So, for instance, the camera can climb up an apartment wall and then OVER the top into the apartment next door.And, people aren't usually shot just once but several times. Sometimes many times. Bullet holes and blood all over the place. And when shot, the victim doesn't simply grasp his belly and grimace, then twirl around and crumple to the floor. He throws out his arms, slips around on a floor covered with bone-white latex interior paint, dripping blood in artsy patterns onto the slickness. It could be grand opera, except that sometimes the victim has time enough, though bullet-riddled, to raise his finger as if lecturing the shooter and make some absurd wisecrack -- ""Please don't shoot,"" in this case.And it's updated also because the two lovers take off with the boodle to live happily ever after, we guess. In 1949 the lovers would have been maybe Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Ryan. Here the lovers are two lesbians. (Some nice, but not hot sex between them is thrown in for the voyeurs.) And although they are both pre-verts and at least one of them has murdered somebody in cold blood, the getaway vehicle in the final scene doesn't plunge off a cliff, as it would have had to in 1949. What I mean is, did Hannibal Lecter die at the end of ""Silence of the Lambs""? No -- and he ATE people. Times have changed.Gina Gershon with her protruding lips could pass for an ex inmate. Jennifer Tilly's voice is a slow, wispy croak and she comes across as the dark side of the moon of Melanie Griffith. The Italian mobsters weren't too impressive, but Joe Pantoliano was great as usual. He can play almost anything. Here he covers his Jersey City accent with a reasonably authentic Chicago sound, although perhaps nobody but Pantoliano would catch it, or would care if they did.Interesting minor flick, worth watching.",Bound
9,Tweekums,An interesting twist to the gangster genre,9,20 July 2008,"While this film is best known for being ""that lesbian gangster movie"" it is far better than that tag might suggest; it is exciting, stylish and occasionally horrifying.Caesar is money launderer for the Chicago mob and Violet is his girlfriend who has been with him for the last five years, he has no idea when female painter/plumber (and ex con) Corky arrives on the scene to work in the neighbouring apartment that it will have such a dramatic effect on his life. Violet however notices Corky immediately and soon sets about seducing her by asking for help retrieving an earring that she has ""accidentally"" dropped down the sink. Even when Caesar returns and sees her looking somewhat dishevelled he regains his calm when he sees that the other person present is a woman and thus not a threat to him.After Caesar takes part in the brutal torture and murder of another gangster who had stolen over two million dollars from the mob he returns to the apartment and sets about cleaning the blood-soaked money. At this point Violet hatches a plan to steal the money with Corky, together the plan how they can take the money while making Caesar thing it was stolen by Jonnie, the son of a senior Mafia member who he had recently come to blows with. Of course the scheme doesn't go according to plan when instead of running Caesar decides to confront Jonnie about the theft.Unlike a lit of thrillers this contains no exciting stunts or exotic locations, if fact it it is set almost entirely in Caesar's apartment and the one next door. Rather than limit the film it provides a sense of claustrophobia so we can see why Violet wants out. The acting is excellent throughout and the direction is stylish without being overly so. There are one or two scenes that might disturb some viewers; every time I've watched it I've had to look away in the early scene involving a pair of secateurs. The film even contains a few dark laughs such as when a policeman investigating gunshots asks to use to lavatory when there are three bodies in the bath hidden by the shower curtain. All in all if you like gangster films and want to see something a little different you should certainly check this one out.",Bound
10,BA_Harrison,A marvellous debut.,9,30 August 2013,"Those who seek out this film simply to see Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly entwined in sapphic bliss might be pleasantly surprised to discover that Bound is not just a good opportunity for an ogle but that it is actually a really good noir/pulp thriller—well written, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly acted. The fact that the two female stars roll around together in the buff is just an added bonus.One of the most confident directorial debuts I have ever seen, Bound's writers/directors The Wachowski's employ all manner of subtle, stylish touches to tell their tale of two lesbians who decide to relieve the mafia of $2million dollars with shocking consequences. The result is not just tense, atmospheric and unpredictable, but visually arresting throughout as well—an accomplished work that deserves to be known for more than just its sexy bits.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Bound
11,moonspinner55,Gushy pulp,6,27 July 2006,"Debut film from sibling writing-directing team of Andy and Larry Wachowski is flashy nonsense involving a lesbian mechanic who becomes partners (and lovers) with a gangster's girl in ripping off two million dollars from the mob. The central relationship is interesting and believable despite the uneven performances by the two leading actresses. Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon each need a few scenes to let their characters sink in (this is particularly true of Tilly as the modern-day moll, who struggles a bit; Gershon, who really does look like a tough auto buff, tends to just plow forward). The arty direction gets carried away with flash-forwards that make no sense, while the screenplay allows too many potentially strong scenes to happen off-camera. Still, there are amusing moments of suspense, pulp dialogue, B-movie atmospherics and plotting, all leading to a terrific finale. **1/2 from ****",Bound
12,blanche-2,modern noir,7,2 March 2013,"Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a very young Christopher Meloni star in ""Bound,"" a 1996 film written and directed by the Wachowskis.Violet (Tilly) is the girlfriend of mobster Caesar (Pantoliano) meets a woman, Corky (Gershon) working as a plumber in their building. The two become lovers, and Violet talks Corky into helping her steal 2 million dollars from Caesar, who is holding the money and will turn it over to the big boss, Gino. The women set Caesar up to take the fall for the loss of the money. It doesn't go quite as planned.Violent, suspenseful, and tense, Bound is a real nail-biter. And I swear I've never heard such dramatic music in a film. It all goes toward setting up a nerve-wracking atmosphere.Violet is very sexy and does a great job as a mob girlfriend who knows her way around. Gershon is smart and tough as Corky.Someone made the comment that the two women didn't seem as in love as they should have been. I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and Violet saw a way out, and Corky, who has been in prison, was attracted to the money. The two have a passion for one another, but it's possible that neither one of them is capable of a deep, true love. Violet has been living with a man she doesn't care about -- she cares about Corky as much as she can, but I think she's a cool customer.Highly recommended if your nerves can stand it and if you don't mind all the violence. This is a very stylish film in the noir tradition.",Bound
13,hitchcockthelegend,"She's a Lady. Whoa whoa whoa, She's a Lady.",9,25 July 2012,"Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal $2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (Pantoliano).Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers, a stylised neo-noir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days, now glides two women, lovers in cahoots, deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick, it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative, the coupling is sexy but tender, a pair of gals who are very easy to root for, with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been ""bound"" by ties in the preceding five years, Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison, let down by a former lover, and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together, trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the see-saw, which way will it tilt?Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward, but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here, no grubby top shelf leanings, it's wonderfully sexy for sure, but natural passion rules the day, a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice, too, to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes, but he no idiot, he's brainy and brawny, if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true, a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so.With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp, tech aspects score high, with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way (the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker). But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky, a Monroesque creation, Gershon goes method, all brooding with intensity, and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past, while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers, but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neo-noir landscape. 9/10",Bound
14,Hey_Sweden,"Taut, compelling thriller.",7,21 September 2014,"While the lesbian coupling in this film is a plot point, it's actually not the main hook. It's merely one thing that this interesting and enjoyable crime film does a little bit differently. The story, as concocted by ""Matrix"" series creators / siblings Andy and Lana Wachowski, is very nicely directed, with a twist-laden plot that keeps the viewer riveted. The acting is excellent from our three leads, and the supporting cast is equally fine. As the situation in ""Bound"" snowballs out of control, you are made to wonder how the characters are going to think their way out of predicaments. Sometimes they might be saved by a deus ex machina, sometimes they're on their own.Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon burn up the screen as Violet, the moll of money launderer Caesar (Joe Pantoliano), and Corky, an ex-con turned handywoman. Violet is instantly attracted to Corky and turns up the heat, inspiring the other woman to join her in a plot to pilfer over two million dollars in mob money and to try to pin the whole thing on Caesar. Predictably enough, things don't go quite the way they planned.The Wachowskis do know how to hold your attention. They do go out of their way to emphasize the sexiness of the two leading ladies, especially in a steamy apartment tryst. Lesbian erotica writer Susie Bright served as the technical consultant, and also has a cameo in a bar scene. The story is actually pretty entertaining once it takes off. The tension is undeniable from scene to scene, and we have to marvel at the resiliency and resourcefulness of not just Violet and Corky, but Caesar as well. (He's not a totally unsympathetic person.) Joey Pants is absolutely terrific in the role of Caesar, and John P. Ryan, future TV star Christopher Meloni, and film director Richard C. Sarafian (""Vanishing Point"") round out a solid cast. ""Bound"" is pretty serious, but not without humour, and the Wachowskis bring some of that style that they made popular in the ""Matrix"" series to this enticing diversion.Well worth seeing.Seven out of 10.",Bound
15,LeonLouisRicci,Comes Close But A Bit Too Lazy,7,19 May 2012,"Notorious for its Lesbian Scenes and the Sexy Female Leads, this Debut from ""The Matrix"" (1999) Directors is a Naughty Neo-Noir that comes close, but does Not attain Minor Classic status. A Good Looking Film that Showcases some Visual Flair but, the Claustrophobic Low Budget is somehow Not Utilized for the Ultimate Effect and the Male Characters are Not Edgy enough to Penetrate these Strong, Luscious Women.

16,poolandrews,Entertaining modern crime thriller noir.,7,19 May 2008,"Bound is set in Chicago where the seductive Violet (Jennifer Tilly) lives in a posh apartment with her boyfriend Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) who launders money for the mob. A lesbian named Corky (Gina Gershon) is hired to do some work in the next apartment & Violet takes a fancy to her, in no time at all they are sleeping with each other. Violet tells Corky that she wants to leave Caesar, Violet also says that Caesar is looking after & counting over two million dollars of stolen mob money before he hands it back to the boss Gino Marzzone (Richard C. Sarafian) & that if they could steal it they could live happily ever after together. Corky agrees but stealing over two million dollars worth of mob money & getting away with it isn't going to be easy, it's going to take meticulous planning & a foolproof scheme to cover their tracks...Executive produced, written & directed by Andy & Larry Wachowski (as The Wachowski Brothers) one has to say that Bound is a terrific gangster thriller with a touch of stylish film noir about it. The script revolves around two lesbian lovers & their intricate plans to steal two million dollars of mob money & get away Scott free, the film is largely set in two apartments with a minimal cast which gives it a certain tight & claustrophobic feel which works perfectly. The character's are excellent, are well fleshed out & developed as the film progresses. There are always doubts in your mind as to who you can trust & what people's motives are. The first third of the film focuses on Violet & Corky's lesbian relationship but while that's the most controversial & infamous aspect of Bound the film could have been made without it & still been as effective, it's just a way to get Violet & Corky together & provide a motive for the theft. Having said that there's nothing wrong with a bit of gratuitous lesbianism, is there? Once the complicated plot gets going there's double crosses, unexpected problems & the script certainly keeps you on your toes as a lot of people stand to either lose or gain a huge amount. The one slightly disappointing aspect of an otherwise intelligent & gripping script is that it does play out a little to logically, I know that sounds odd but there weren't any big surprises or twists & while I love the plot & the feel nothing made me sit up & go 'wow I didn't see that coming'. Still, Bound is a fantastic thriller with a great plot that keeps you glued to the screen although once you have seen it I am not sure how much replay value it has.Director's the Wachowski Brothers do a great job & Bound is surely one of the most stylish thrillers you will ever see, from extreme close-ups on objects to dizzying ceiling shots to a clever scene as the camera follows the telephone cord as a call is made including a loop the loop moment as some of the cord is twisted into a knot! The contrast between Violet & Corky is superb as well with actress Jennifer Tilly all feminine lipstick, large cleavage, short skirts & sexy high heels while Gina Gershon wears jeans, shirts & working boots. They play off each other's styles brilliantly. The apartment has a nice sleek, shiny art deco look to it which suits the film noir feel perfectly. There's not much violence, there's a severed finger, some gunshot wounds & some blood splatter although the Walchowski's manage to bring some style to the violence as well like in the scene at the end when someone is shot & their blood mixes with spilt white paint on the floor. For a film with the notoriety Bound has there's only one sex scene in it & an earlier seduction scene which are both quite arousing actually & filmed with class & style, this isn't just uncultured lesbian porn this is style...With a supposed budget of about $4,500,000 Bound wasn't the biggest budget film ever made but it did get the Wachowski Brothers The Matrix (1999) gig. Set almost entirely in two apartments Bound has a certain stage production feel about it, the production values are high & it's well made with the cinematography in particular deserving a mention. Although set in Chicago it was filmed in Los Angeles. The acting is top notch with Tilly, Gershon & Pantoliano excelling. Veteran actor John P. Ryan has a small role.Bound is an excellent crime thriller with bags of style, great moments & an involving plot. I am not sure if I would want to see it again anytime soon but it's definitely well worth a watch whichever way you look at it.",Bound
17,lastliberal,I can see again!,9,27 July 2008,"When Jennifer Tilly was playing Gina Gershon like a musical instrument and her toes curled up, it was cinema magic. This movie is hot from start to finish.You just know something is up in this brilliant film noir, but it's hard to focus with all that sexual energy floating in the air.Joe Pantoliano was absolutely fantastic, and it was interesting seeing Christopher Meloni as a bad guy.The cinematography was just marvelous.This was an excellent movie all around.

18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Magnificent thriller,8,5 February 2004,"I watched this because I'm a big fan of the Wachowskies, and after watching their first movie(Assassins, which they only wrote) I hoped to see another masterpiece from the makers of The Matrix that had nothing to do with it. It's no wonder the producers let them direct aforementioned sci-fi/action masterpiece after they did this. For such a little amount of money, they really made the most of it. Few characters, sets and occasionally limited camera-work is easy to look past(hard to notice, in fact). The movie is breathtaking. For the entirety of the last half I was literally at the edge of my seat, extremely excited and couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The first half is mostly a setup for the last half, but it isn't boring, and is well worth watching, as it makes the second half near-perfect in suspense. The lesbian subplot might throw some people off, and will definitely offend some people, but if you're aren't one of them, then you most likely will enjoy it, if you're into thrillers. The plot is very well-written, and with twists and turns thrown in every so often, it keeps you watching closely. The acting is mostly good, especially from the three leads. The characters are great... diverse, interesting and credible. The cinematography contains several of the same things later made famous in The Matrix... anyone who's seen both movies can tell that it's the same people behind the cameras. The action is really well-done. The story-telling is just slightly experimental... reminiscent of various heist flicks. This also contains some quite stylish visuals, though not as many as the brothers' later works. All in all, just works really well and keeps you entertained throughout.

19,neil-476,"Gosh, what a surprise",9,28 December 2007,"Let's get one thing straight at the start - the Brits aren't very good at sex. Obviously we're good enough to procreate and what have you, but when it comes to movies, we don't have a clue. What's more, we still have a strong streak of the Victorian puritan ethic running through us. This accounts for the fact that, in the period running up to Bound's cinema release, certain British newspapers hyped up the explicit lesbian content with a kind of outraged glee.And, of course, when someone says ""Disgusting - it ought to be banned!"" then you want to see it all the more, don't you? So there I am, looking forward to a little girl on girl action (and it's there alright, filmed in tasteful arty stark contrast), and what do I get? A bloody good crime thriller, that's what.There are many comments here, so I'll just say two things.One, this is not the outrageous lesbian free-for-all which it was made out to be by certain elements of the British press. The relationship between the two women is absolutely essential to the credibility of what follows.And, two, this is a film which you watch for the first time in a state of almost unbearable stress. I do not recall ever seeing another film in which extreme tension is maintained so well for such a sustained period.",Bound

Things don't go according to plan when Caesar reacts unexpectedly, and his boss(played by John P. Ryan) gets involved, forcing the women to come up with another plan if they hope to get away with the money and their lives...Good cast and stylish direction cannot redeem this sordid story that gives the viewer nobody to root for. Everyone here is without conscience and out for themselves, so I can't really cheer at the ""happy"" ending, and Caesar is in some ways more sympathetic than the two women!A cult film nonetheless.",Bound

Bound is a very entertaining thriller, filled with suspense and tension. The sexual tension in the first scene will arouse a lot of people, and that's all because of the extremely sensual Jennifer Tilly. Her breathy, little girl voice, her voluptuous bombshell figure (two characteristics of her that we're used of but that will always work), and her excellent acting were a delight to watch. She's one of those actresses that will bring a sexual tension in a room just by her speaking and her style. Great performance from Joe Pantoliano as well. He grew perfectly into his character towards the end, really great to watch him in this movie that has everything to become a classic. Great cast, great story, perfect evening if you ask me. The Wachowskis set the tone with this debut.",Bound
22,JamesHitchcock,It is not only gay people who live in closets,8,21 August 2019,"The first mainstream American film with an explicitly lesbian theme was ""The Children's Hour"" from as long ago as 1961, which, remarkably, starred Audrey Hepburn, normally one of Hollywood's squeaky-clean sweethearts, in a leading rile. Lesbianism, however, has never really become a common subject in the cinematic mainstream over the intervening 58 years. Boy-loves-girl is still a lot more popular than girl-loves-girl or, for that matter, boy-loves-boy. ""Bound"" from 1996 is one of the few exceptions. It tells the story of Violet, a gangster's girlfriend, and Corky, a female ex-convict who becomes her lover, and of how they plot to steal $2 million of mafia money from Violet's boyfriend Caesar and his associates. I don't really need to set out any more of the plot; as with many crime thrillers from the nineties it is highly complex with several twists.The film can be regarded as an example of neo-noir, a cinematic movement which takes its inspiration from the film noir tradition but tries to adapt it to modern film-making techniques. Most scenes take place in claustrophobic, often darkened, interiors, and while this feature may have been dictated by the film's tight budget it also takes on a metaphorical character, symbolising one of the film's major themes. Its writer-directors the Wachowskis (directing their first film) described it as being about ""the boxes people make of their lives"", adding that ""it is not only gay people who live in closets"". All the characters are trapped in some way or another. Violet is trapped in her relationship with the abusive Caesar, Corky by her criminal past, Caesar and his fellow-gangsters by their criminal present. The title ""Bound"" refers on a literal level to a scene where one character is bound and gagged by another, and on a figurative level by these traps which people make for themselves.Possibly because of the film's controversial subject-matter, the Wachowskis had difficulty casting the two main female roles, but were lucky to obtain the services of Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon who both give great performances. Their characters are sharply differentiated. Tilly's lipstick-bisexual Violet (significantly named after a flower) is the ""femme"" half of the partnership, feminine in appearance and speaking in a high-pitched ""girly"" voice. Although Gershon is strikingly attractive in real life, her androgynous Corky (significantly referred to by a male-sounding nickname which was presumably not bestowed upon her by her godfathers and godmothers in her baptism) is, with her short hair and unisex clothing, much more ""butch"". The film was seen as something of a comeback Gershon after her role in the much-criticised ""Showgirls"" from the previous year. (In that film it is hinted that Gershon's character might be sexually attracted to Elizabeth Berkeley's Nomi, although any lesbian content is implied rather than explicit).There are, of course, significant differences between neo-noir and the old-time films noirs of the forties and fifties. No mainstream film from that era could possibly have had a gay or lesbian theme, and none would have been as violent as ""Bound"" is. Although the old noirs often dealt with violent crime neither the Production Code not the moral climate of the mid twentieth century would have allowed it to be shown in all the full gory detail which the Wachowskis show here. ""Bound"" is not for those who are allergic to either the sight of blood or to explicit lesbian sex scenes. To anyone with a strong stomach for sex and violence, however, it can be an interesting experience, a well-acted crime thriller with some intriguing twists and some dark, sardonic humour. 8/10",Bound
23,=G=,Hmmm. Whatever.,6,24 March 2003,"""Bound"" is about a mob guy, his lady, a bunch of money, a dyke, and some gangsters all tossed into the air so the audience can see how they land. A claustrophobic noirish flick which walks a fine line between dark comedy and drama, ""Bound"" does have a method to its madness which is sufficiently intriguing for it to score favorably with critics and public alike. However, ""Bound"" does not provide a protagonist with whom we can empathize leaving the audience to participate as detached voyeurs watching more out of curiosity than involvement.

24,KineticSeoul,It's a alright directorial debut film by the Wachowski's but nothing more,6,28 April 2013,"This one starts out fairly amusing and cool because of the stylish elements. And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet. Anyways when it comes down to it I didn't find any of the character likable. Sure you don't need likable characters in a movie for it to be a good or even great. But there just wasn't any characteristics or traits that made any of the characters stand out. It's just has bad people stealing from even badder people. Which can also work but not in this case. It's a alright directorial debut from the Wachowski's but nothing all that special. At least the Wachowski's directed a revolutionary film right after this one. And personally I think Gina Gershon would have been a better Trinity.6.6/10",Bound

This film has inspired much controversy with its lesbian sex scenes, but actually there are only two of them, both rather brief. They were pretty hot, but I found Gina Gershon's character a little too stereotypical - she's like a caricature of a ""butch"" lesbian that could've been dreamt up by a 16-year-old boy. But as a pure caper thriller, this movie is engrossing and suspenseful, with perfect casting in every role.

27,bowmanblue,Look past the lesbian angle,7,26 January 2015,"Bound is the story of... lesbians. Or at least that's what a lot of people seem to dwell on when talking about the film. Actually, any lesbian activity is only a small part of the film. Bound is actually a tale of deception and doublecrossing where a couple of women (yes, lesbians) hatch a plan to steal money from the mob.Whereas with other gangster films, they rely on constantly witty dialogue to establish character, or various other gimmicks. Bound is simple cause and effect. What starts out as a relatively straightforward plan leads to something going wrong, which leads to something else going wrong and so on.Issues of trust, loyalty, love, violence and everything else are covered, along with a couple of sex scenes and violence utilizing pruning shears. All of this is choreographed beautifully by the Wachowski brothers. However, it's Joe Pantoliano who steals the show. He plays a wiseguy that gets caught in the downward spiral which the girls have created.If you're looking for a sexy, stylish, tense thriller, this is for you (just don't expect any 'Matrix-style' fight scenes!).",Bound

The plot is tight and the Wachowskis sustain fantastic tension over the entire final hour, after a steamy setup which has a gang moll (Jennifer Tilly) seduce a general contractor (Gina Gershon) working in the apartment next door. I love how daring the film was at the time for the lesbian relationship, and yet how simply it was shown, just as two people who fall hard for each other. Oh, and then hatch a plan to steal a couple of million dollars from the mob, via the moll's boyfriend (Joe Pantoliano), with the intention to pin it on him. The twists and turns which follow are highly entertaining, albeit violent at times. There are some nice visual and auditory effects employed, and Pantoliano in particular turns in an excellent performance. Tilly is the weak link in an otherwise fine cast, just a little too airy and removed in her vocalization for my taste. She and Gershon have excellent chemistry, however, and both of them add an individual touch to their characters. Highly recommended.",Bound

Her voice is the sound of a 50's stargirl and she dressed like a babe! Seriously Jennifer Tilly should be more in movies that are set in olden times and she would literally steal the show! With Corky, she is serious character.She really looked stunning as a greaser and I liked her bad girl attitude since she is an ex convict after all. She showed that love for Violet and like its not easy to save 2 million from the mafia with Violet.

30,johnnyboyz,"Slick, stylish and very clever - and that's just the two lead characters.",8,25 November 2006,"Before the likes of The Matrix sequels and V for Vendetta, it seems the Wachowski brothers actually managed write and direct good films and 'Bound' is the one example that wasn't a film merely filmed for fun in their backyard or wherever. Bound is funny, entertaining, violent and gripping in its delivery.The film starts out in a rather noticeably tantalising way. We're given glimpses of things through point of views quick and through edits and the time the characters of Corky and Violet spend together in the early exchanges is fascinating. One character knocks on the door and enters, achieves her aim and just when you think the relationship is building, rather anti climatically, she leaves. There's another example of this when Corky goes out to a bar and even goes as far to exclaim she's 'here to get laid'. There are a few disappointing dialogue sequences before she leaves and goes home. Although this establishes she's a lesbian; the feeling of emptiness, disappointment and anticlimax is there and starts to simmer in the pot. Moving onto emptiness, Corky's apartment also bears a plain, empty look about it which works well with the films setting and character emotion being emitted.Being a lover of crime films that rely on dialogue and action combined, the simplistic plot of attempting to rob another gang through means of a plan (which is excellently spelled out whilst simultaneously executed) was very alluring to me. The chain of events that play out throughout the duration of the film's second third are entertaining and fascinating. Right from the initial incident where a character realises he might have been ripped off and the whole 'what am I going to do?!' scenario; the film moves onwards and upwards very cleverly in its situations as more and more things occur that build up the hopelessness we realise is there.Although the film is told from the point of view and is manipulating us to root for the two female robbers, they are technically the 'bad guys' (or gals) of the film and the fact it's centred around them is very interesting. This brings me onto the character of Cesar (Pantoliano) who is the fall guy of the piece and although acts as the character the tension centres around, also acts as a comic relief for the film. I, in truth, felt sorry for him at certain points. But, since the film's core is all about the breakaway of two oppressed, unlucky-in-life women who defy the males and attempt to win outright, you can't sympathise too much with Cesar.Bound is a very good film and is highly entertaining. This acts as proof that you don't need to go over the top on CGI or adapt a comic book from God knows when centred around a masked vigilante to make a good film.Ah, the good old days",Bound
31,Anonymous_Maxine,"The Wachowski brothers showed their talents long before The Matrix, but hardly anyone noticed because Bound is nearly direct-to-video material.",10,16 February 2001,"Any way you look at it, Bound is a sex thriller. The story is very engaging and the direction is absolutely incredible, but the whole lesbian thing really overshadows all of that, which severely limits the impact that this movie could have had. Gina Gershon stars as a tough woman who falls in love with Jennifer Tilly, who happens to be the girlfriend of a gangster (Joe Pantoliano). The two concoct a scheme to steal $2 million from the mob, and this story is presented very skillfully and interestingly.
Ironically enough, you have to look past all of the lesbian action between Tilly and Gershon in order to really experience the skill that this movie is full of. Bound is Larry and Andy Wachowskis' writing and directing debut, proving that they had the skills from the start. The style that made The Matrix so good can be seen in nearly every shot in this film, and this style is probably the best part of the whole movie.But the excellent directing wasn't the only thing that made Bound so good. This is an great gangster film, despite a few cheesy or flawed moments. For example, it was a little weird that the mobsters who came to Pantoliano's apartment - suspicious of the murder that had recently taken place which Pantoliano was desperately trying to cover up - didn't see their own bloody footprints on the carpet, or at least feel the blood squishing up through the carpet as they walked on it. But that's okay, because where else can you see $2 million hung up in an apartment on dozens of wires, drying after having blood washed off of it? This is good stuff.Gershon and Tilly work perfectly on screen, and not just in the sex scenes. Their unique relationship was made interesting by their skillful acting, which was best when they were beginning to distrust each other. Hey, that's what happens when you put your life into the hands of someone you just met. Gershon, in particular, delivered an excellent performance, flawlessly bringing out her masculine side to play the strong role in her relationship with Tilly. There is something to be said about a sex thriller that is as good and as engaging as Bound, because they never really are any good, you know? Don't be put off by this element of the film, because Bound is a trashy movie that definitely deserves your attention.",Bound
32,videorama-759-859391,"Lesbo crime thriller, something different, jockeyed by two great performances + Pantaliano, it's third",8,14 November 2013,"Bound is something refreshingly different, straight off the bat. A lesbian mafia type thriller. Our two hot lesbos, the great Jennifer Tilly (a way better actress than her sister, Meg) and the underrated Gina Gershon, who always impresses us with her character acting, hatch a ballsy plan to rip off the mob. And no one wants to see her violent gangster husband Caesar, dead, more, than the wife Tilly. And with Caesar recently having a falling out with Johnny (a familiar Law And Order face) the son of his boss, everything could run to plan, as these two rivals go at each other like dogs. And then our two will be together. Bound is great story and suspense structure, penned, by a group of brothers (no, not the Coens) who earlier wrote the sly hit, Assassins, but after Bound, went onto make a big hit movie (can you tell me what that is?). Bound's earlier scenes, before the drama hits, I liked, that has independent ex con, Corky (Gershon) just moving into the apartment, where an offer of coffee from Violent, leads to bigger things. A montage that has Corky revamping the place, was another thing, when played against a nice Linda Ronstadd type track. Also check out Corky, going into a gay bar, crashing a couple's private moment. What brazenness, and Gershon does it so well. Some of the witty dialogue in this bonza movie is priceless, like when the fantastic Pantaliano, (Caesar) confronts Violent, in the heated moments, leading up to the finale, and says ""What did she did do to you"". Her response. ""Everything you couldn't"". A hundred percent true baby. Bound ends grandly too. You want the two women to get away. And then there's the lingering kiss, between Gershon and Tilly, harvested for so long, as is the waiting for the two mafia clowns to do each other, and then they'll be get, scott free. Bound has some pretty tense and dangerous moments too, and things get bloody here and there, but arty movies like this, is what makes me enjoy cinema, so much.",Bound
33,freemantle_uk,A excellent debut from from The Wachowskis,9,17 February 2013,"The Wachowskis are best known as the directors of The Matrix Trilogy. But before they were allowed to direct the first great movie and the so-so sequels they had to prove they were capable as directors. To do this they made a neo-noir small thriller, Bound: which resulted with us getting a very entertaining film.Corky (Gina Gershon) is an ex-convict who is hired to refurbish an apartment.

They see a opportunity to steal $2 Million from the Mafia and make Caesar the fall guy. But as the plan to put into action it starts to unravel and people start to die.Bound was a low budget film with a small cast and of a minimum of locations. It was a film that had to be driven by the characters and the plot and Wachowskis gave us taut and stylist experience. Bound has a neo-noir, postmodern style throughout as the plot twists and turns as the women's have to react to the changing situation. The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment.Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions. It was perfectly paced film and the editing make scenes follow together seamlessly. There are many moments and shots that's has striking similarities to The Matrix.Because of the crime story and much of the character moments and dialogue Bound felt very much like an early Quentin Tarantino film, particular Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They share similar styles and both Jackie Brown and Bound focusing on minor criminals and outsiders who plan to screw over a major criminal figure. Those films focus on a simple crime stories but are focused on the characters have a noir feel to them.Bound is an excellent film, a tight thriller that uses every moment of screenplay to great effect.

Written and directed by the Wachowskis, rumor has it that this film gave them enough cred with the studios to turn around and produce The Matrix a few years later. I can see that potential at times, though it's still very rough around the edges. The first act is a real bore, borderline softcore porno that I very nearly shut off and wrote off, but the plot really comes to life at about the forty-minute mark and swiftly ramps up into a rousing, unpredictable little dose of dark suspense. Sadly, no amount of nifty writing and unexpected twists can compensate for Jennifer Tilly's acting. She's Anna Nicole-Smith levels of bad, trying to seem sultry, deep and smart but really just coming across as drug-whipped and out of her depth. Apart from an inspired effort from Joe Pantoliano as the short-fuse mafia fall-guy at the center of it all, though, that's pretty much par for the course.

The following tale of deciept and manipulation is well planned out, tense, twisty and fun.One almost thinks it couldn't have been the same if someone other than the writes had directed this movie it wouldn't pop of the screen with visual inventiveness (at one point the camera follows the phone call across the full length of the phone wire).That this narrative of women side stepping heteronormativity and undermining a vision of toxic masculinity was written by two brothers was a pleasant surprise to me.

37,MBunge,A preview of why The Matrix would be great and why The Matrix sequels would stink on ice,5,1 September 2010,"Ah, the mid 90s. No doubt future historians will look back on it as the age when Lesbian Chic ruled Hollywood. That's surely the only explanation for a film like Bound ever getting made. If you've never known exactly what people mean when they refer to ""film noir"" but don't particularly like watching old black-and-white movies, go rent Bound. It's like a textbook of the sub-genre, just with lesbians.Gina Gershon plays Corky, a hard scrabble ex-con lured into a scheme to steal 2 million dollars from the Mob by the beautiful Violet (Jennifer Tilly). And after hearing the name said over and over, you'll understand why no serious character in a movie should ever be called Corky. Joe Pantoliano plays Caesar, Violet's mobbed up sugar daddy and they the guy they plan to frame for the theft. That right there is the classic noir plot, except instead of a guy tempted into nefarious acts by a woman in black, it's another woman. Bound is remarkably faithful to the conventions and style of the genre. There's no attempt to reimagine noir or slap some sort of twist on it. The filmmakers act like every noir film has been about lesbian lovers. It's an interesting choice. It gives the film a certain creative integrity, instead of getting all caught up in trying to ""enlighten"" the audience. But while the film doesn't pigeonhole Corky and Violet as lesbians, it doesn't do much else with them as noir stereotypes. Gershon and Tilly do what they can, but you're never given much reason or incentive to like or root for their characters.That's not the case with Caesar. If you only know Joe Pantoliano from The Matrix and wonder why some people make a big deal out of him as an actor, watch Bound. He gives the quintessential noir performance of a man who steps in urban quicksand and desperately, frantically tries to keep himself from sinking. Corky and Violet hatch their plan with a cool indifference and then spend a good chunk of the movie standing around watching Caesar sweat and think and act. We're supposed to want the two women to get away with their plan but they're too passive. T he audience is never really given a reason to care about them. That's not the case with Caesar. You can't help but be drawn in as you see this guy's life blown apart, watch him exert every last bit of strength and smarts and will to pull it back together, only to have it all slip through his fingers again and again. Pantoliano creates a bad guy that you don't stand back from and observe, but one you feel comfortable identifying with.In the end, though, Bound can't really be considered more than an interesting failure. Without Pantoliano's work, the movie is well-directed but very shallow. His performance, however, is so appealing and compelling that the rest of the film has no room to breathe. Without Pantoliano, you'd notice there's not much to the movie, but there's no more room for anything while he's there. It's possible that if the film had used lesbianism to help us feel a sense of alienation or isolation in Corky and Violet that it could have counterbalanced the attraction the audience feels for Caesar. Treating the sexual relationship in a matter-of-fact fashion may have been socially enlightened, but good storytelling doesn't always care about being good for you.Interesting failure also covers the direction of this film. It looks really good. The scenes flow smoothly from one to another. You can tell the filmmakers are always stretching to find new visual ways to reach the audience and give them something striking to look at. You come away from Bound knowing it isn't a great film, but that the guys who made it will make a really great film someday. You couldn't have predicted they would go on to make two really crappy sequels to that really great film, however.If I had to guess, I'd say the Wachowski Brothers just wanted to make themselves an old fashioned noir film and added in the lesbian angle to round up enough money to make it happen. It's a fairly clever way to get to do what you want in an industry where a million other people are trying to get you to do what they want. I can't help but think, though, that the ""we're going to do what we want"" attitude is the main reason the Matrix sequels sucked so very, very hard.",Bound
38,kirbylee70-599-526179,NO LONGER CONTROVERSIAL,8,24 October 2018,"Released in 1996 the movie BOUND was the first directorial effort by the Wachowski brothers who went on to direct the successful MATRIX films. Having just written ASSASSINS they wanted to delve into directing and chose this for their first film. A story involving two lesbians was considered controversial at the time of release but in today's world, with the exception of their steamy love scene, would easily be found on episodic TV.Gina Gershon plays Corky, a recently released lesbian convict doing a restoration project of an apartment for a mobster. On her way up to check the apartment out she meets the neighbors, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) a low level mobster and money launderer for the mob and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). There is a bit of unspoken flirting that takes place between the two women but nothing happens.As Corky begins work on the apartment Violet stops by and offers her a cup of coffee. More flirting goes on and it isn't long before Corky ends up in Violet's apartment where the pair have a ""stimulating"" conversation. Before things can progress Caesar arrives home and at first thinks there is another man in the house before he realizes its Corky. Knowing who she works for he offers her money which she takes, a way of imposing his dominance over her.The next day Violet stops by to apologize. Corky assumes she is apologizing for letting things go as far as they did but instead Violet is apologizing for them not going further. The pair embrace and a full-fledged love scene follows with both of the women enjoying the sexual experience of being with one another. The scene is played to the erotic with little sensationalism on display.In bed together the pair begin to talk about things that have transpired. A money counter named Shelly, who Violet has also slept with, has stolen $2 million from the mob. Local boss Mickey (John P. Ryan), hot head Johnnie (Christopher Meloni) and Caesar were questioning him in Caesar's bathroom in a brutal interrogation that involves a pair of pruning shears. Going where the money is Johnnie shot Shelly once it was recovered, covering the money in blood. Caesar snapped and punched Johnnie, a relationship with no love lost between the two boiling over.With the money on hand to be literally laundered before mob boss Gino Marzzone arrives to collect it, Corky and Violet come up with a plan to steal the money, send Caesar on the run and come up clean without fear of mob retaliation. Their plan involve Caesar thinking Johnnie stole the money and then taking him out. But their plan doesn't go quite the way they intended and it isn't long before Caesar comes up with a plan of his own.The title describes so many different things here. On one hand Violet is bound to Caesar, a slave to his affections and a lifestyle that involves being his plaything at his whim. It also describes her sexuality, a woman who loves women but who pretends to love men to get the things she wants. Bound also describes Corky who is tied up with no place to go and no job accept that she was provided. For Corky it also literally describes her predicament later in the film when Caesar has her tied up in Violet's closet. All of the characters here are bound in one way or another and reason for the title is apparent as the story unfolds.The movie is fascinating in the fact that it is the classic film noir type story but with the lesbian twist added to it. In spite of that the movie doesn't use that as a plot device any more than it would if the couple were a straight couple as the genre has used many times in the past. As with many films in the genre we have two lovers plotting to steal money and lay the blame elsewhere knowing that death for their patsy will follow. The question of their morality doesn't lie in their sexual choices but in their criminality. That the brothers could develop a story and keep it on track without the sensationalism it could have had is a tribute to their skills as directors/story writers.All three lead actors here offer amazing performances. Tilly has always been saddled with the stupid bimbo roles in the past but she presents Violet as a seductress with smarts, trapped in a world from which she wants to escape. Gershon has been the gorgeous babe in so many movies yet here she trades that in for a more butch type dyke role as described by some feminists. And Pantoliano has never been slimier or more threatening than he is here.Olive Films is offering the movie on blu-ray format with a new high definition restoration of the film. Not only that they've added a number of extras that fans of the films or those just discovering it like myself can enjoy. Those extras include an audio commentary track with the Wachowskis, Pantoliano, Tilly and Gershon, film editor Zach Staenberg and technical consultant Susie Bright, PART AND PARCEL with titles designer Patti Podesta, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND ME with B. Ruby Rich and Jen Moorman, HERE'S JOHNNY! with Christopher Meloni, FEMME FATALES with Gershon and Tilly, MODERN NOIR: THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF BOUND with cinematographer Bill Pope, editor Staenberg and composer Don Davis, the theatrical trailer and an essay by Guinevere Turner.Movie lovers, especially those who adore the film noir genre, will thoroughly enjoy this film. It is well paced, well directed, well written, well shot and entertaining from start to finish. But know going in what to expect. Those offended by the inclusion of homosexuality will find this one a movie to avoid. While the movie includes that and the main characters are involved in a romance, it is not the focus of the film but it is there. Olive has done a wonderful job with this release and I recommend it for those who feel they will enjoy it.",Bound
39,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Kinky little gem,9,18 July 2016,"Before the Wachowskis rocketed into the stratosphere of cinema with their big budget world building and brilliant, lofty ideas, they made Bound, a down n' dirty, kinky little slice of mob pulp that's as much fun as it is sexy, potent and dangerous. Gina Gershon plays Corky, a hard nosed opportunist with a keen eye for making money and a fondness for beautiful women. Jennifer Tilly is Violet, the bored wife of weaselly gangster Ceasar (a lively Joe Pantoliano), who has just come into a whole wacky of shady cash via his employer Mickey, played by one of the great character actors of his generation, John P. Ryan, who is sadly no longer with us. Ceasar has been given the money to launder, but Violet has other plans that involve double crossing him and making off with it. When she happens to wander into the gay bar that Corky frequents, sparks fly. And I really mean it, for soon enough the two are in bed together for one of the single most hot and heavy sex scenes you will ever see in a film. Seriously, you'll want to open some windows for this baby. As soon as Corky gets wind of the money, the plot simmers as everyone makes a discreet mad dash for riches and no one is sure who is screwing over who. Gershon is tough, sexy as hell and leaves a faint trace of vulnerability in her excellent performance. Tilly is crafty and secretive, deliberately making people underestimate her until it's too late. This was Ryan's last film role, and he makes the most of it as a salty old thug with a dash of class, a touch of kindness and the unnerving tendency to snap at the drop of a hat. Christopher Meloni is hilariously pathetic as his second in command who irritates everyone around him, especially Ceasar, who has a scary little temper of his own. One senses real danger for our two female leads, because despite the somewhat playful and often satirical tone towards tell gangsters, the Wachowskis have still fashioned them to be formidable and cruel, a wise tonal choice that grounds the viewer and distills genuine suspense. The characters are all brilliantly written and realized, so if you read this review thinking this was a trashy little lowbrow affair, it's not. It's It's a real world tale that just so happens to take place in a lurid part of movie town, and contains one scorcher of a lesbian love affair that is as affecting in dialogue and body language as it is with sex. A special film, and not one to be missed.e",Bound
40,I_Ailurophile,Unapologetically fun and thrilling,9,12 May 2021,"This is still another movie it's taken me far too long to get around to watching. In some ways it didn't quite match the hype and anticipation, but in others it well exceeded my expectations. There's no question, though, that 'Bound' is purposefully indelicate, indiscreet, sensual, violent - and an absolute delight.'Bound' wastes no time setting up the pivotal relationship between Corky and Violet. After establishing Corky's character, the film proceeds quickly to the two not so subtly checking each other out - leading in no short order as well to intimacy and a tantalizing sex scene. All the while, this first third of the movie inserts deliberately ham-handed dialogue. Don Davis' accompanying score meets that same tone as it switches between lounge music, themes that wouldn't sound out of place in an '80s crime/noir thriller, and dreamy, ethereal ambience. Even the sex scene itself is lovingly, carefully shot in a way that builds the same unifying sense to the first act of 'Bound'--the conscious, unswerving air of a softcore porn feature.It's so over the top that one can't help but giddily laugh at the spectacle of it, even as we indulge in the chemistry between the stars. Yet there's no mistaking that every moment is calculated and intentional: Lana and Lilly knew precisely what they were doing. These early scenes prime the audience for the remainder of the film in the most devious way - by giving us false expectations, and not actually preparing us at all.Because the following onset of rising action in the narrative brings with it the mere first taste of blood. Corky and Violet begin making plans, set them in motion - and then the thrills begin. And a considerable amount of violence.The cast is wonderful. Jennifer Tilly truly shines as Violet, deceptively intelligent and conniving with her unmistakable voice. She lights up the screen just as much as co-star Gina Gershon, whose portrayal of Corky mirrors Tilly's performance, though with a still harder personality. And Joe Pantoliano, prolific as he is, has surely had few parts as vibrant as unpredictable Caesar.It feels weird to see Christopher Meloni here, 3 years before he appeared on 'Law and Order: Special Victims Unit' as Detective Stabler, in the supporting role of a vicious, hotheaded monster of a mobster. But then, I suppose that's not all too different from a cop after all, is it?The Wachowskis are fine writers, and every slightest turn in the plot is exciting. So much so that I found myself pleasantly surprised - I anticipated enjoying 'Bound,' but the quality of the storytelling is admittedly greater than I had naively assumed. Conversely, I had rather been led to believe that there was significantly more sex in this movie than there is, and on that account it confounded my expectations. Yet I think both these misconceptions are borne from the same source:In the mid-'90s American society wasn't exactly receptive to LGBT stories - relationships, representation, or issues. I seem to recall a measure of controversy surrounding 'Bound' when it was first released regarding its ""explicit nature"" - when, in actuality, the entirety of the consternation stemmed from the mere suggestion that Corky and Violet are lesbians, let alone any portrayal of intimacy. Those same windbags who would decry gay themes, or a woman's celebration of sex, are quick to downplay quality film-making if it in any way fails to meet their arbitrary standards. Thus 'Bound' bore a bit of a mark against it, barely registering on the cinematic radar even after 'The matrix' sparked greater interest in the Wachowskis. What an absolute shame - then and now, this has deserved so much more recognition.The attention to detail throughout the film's length is commendable. The intricacy of Corky and Violet's plot dovetails handily into the various ways in which the course of events deviates from that careful plan. Caesar's many cautious steps to counteract the scheme are no less entertaining, and as screenwriters and directors the Wachowskis skillfully capture every moment.Whether you're here for the lesbian representation, the violence, the general thrills, or the cast, 'Bound' is an exceptionally enjoyable movie. It's been sadly overlooked in the recent history of modern cinema, but is definitely worth revisiting - or, if you're like me, belatedly watching for the first time.Highly recommended!",Bound

42,vertigo_14,A slick slice of modern noir. (spoilers),8,20 July 2005,"At first impression, 'Bound' was a slightly predictable, almost unintentionally humorous sexual fantasy of the pre-Matrix Wachowski brothers. But the arrangement of characters, the story, and its settings were not as obvious as I had originally supposed and actually, what was unveiled was a rather artful (though I might not say clever) thriller that both exceeded expectations and defied some overused conventions (particularly the standard double-crossing females and double-crossing protagonist team in the finale).This modern noir, though riddled with idiotic stereotypes in an attempt to define characters, is actually cleverly displayed in art direction, dialog, and various interaction among the characters and with the audience. Simple, but excellent. This is mostly the story of three characters motivated by what else, but greed. Corky (Gina Gershon) plays the by-the-book ex-con lesbian. A mastermind thief (or at least, so we're told), she becomes quietly sexually involved with seductive and somewhat mysterious Violet (Jennifer Tilly), who lives next door to the apartment in which Corky is working to repair. Violet lives with a wry gangster, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano), to whom she serves as a paid companion (i.e. personal prostitute services). Violet wants to move on and leave ""the business,"" but there's no easy way out. Once you're in, you're in for good, as it usually goes.When Caesar threatens to kill her if she left him, she finds a window of opportunity, one involving a load of cash and a possible safe getaway which Corky helps her plan. They expect their plan, which exploits mistrust among the gangsters, to go well. But instead, things get blown wide open and Violet and Corky are left to fend for themselves as things gradually fall apart. Once the plan falls into action, the movie really starts to pick up as the artful thriller begins to unfold. There are moments of hesitancy and moments where it is hard to believe much emergency in the situation the way the characters slowly react or fail to use the obvious course of action to avenge the other or save themselves. But all in all, this is such a simply, well-done thriller.Recommended.",Bound

Violet and Corky are two girls that start on a date, and when we see, they are planning to rob Violet's husband in order to escape with the money. I believed this movie would center around the girls' love, but actually it's the less striking aspect of it-- male audience may disagree with me, since the few scenes involving that aspect are extremely sexy. There are lots of twists that make you feel entertained and thrilled with such good writing, with an initially simple plan that goes wrong and turns out to be a cat-and-mouse chasing. The ending is very Hollywood and let loose, making you feel like that girls rocked-- and in fact, they did. GREAT movie-- in my opinion, better than 1999's ""Matrix"". Don't be hateful on me.",Bound

45,seymourblack-1,"Slick, Stylish & Easy On The Eye",8,14 August 2016,"Slick, stylish and easy on the eye, this Nineties' noir kicks into gear with a torrid lesbian affair which triggers a caper that becomes life threatening for everyone involved. Inevitably, not everything goes according to plan and that's when the story's main characters have to use all their ingenuity to try to achieve their objectives. This well-written low-budget thriller is full of twists, humour and violence as well as an ever-present tension that increases consistently as the action plays out. It's this tension and the unpredictability of its characters that really makes ""Bound"" so gripping and entertaining to watch.After recently being released from a five-year prison sentence, professional thief Corky (Gina Gershon), is given a job as a handy-woman in a Chicago apartment building by one of her criminal acquaintances. It's there that she meets and is seduced by Violet (Jennifer Tilly), a gangster's moll who lives in the same building with her Mafioso boyfriend Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). Caesar's a money launderer who suddenly has $2,000,000 in his possession after recovering it from a bagman who'd been stealing money from the Mob for some time.Disenchanted with the life that she'd been living for the last five years, Violet becomes attracted to the idea of stealing the $2,000,000 so that she and Corky can make a new life together. Corky isn't sure how much she can trust Violet but eventually the two women devise a plan to carry out the theft before local Mob boss Gino Marzzone (Christopher Meloni) calls by at Caesar's apartment to collect the money. Violet's confident that the plan will work, because she knows that when Caesar discovers the disappearance of the money, he'll have to go on the run to save his skin and in so doing, will make it look as if he's the thief.When the plan's put into action, it seems to work relatively well until the point where Caesar discovers the theft and then doesn't react in the way that Violet had expected.First-time directors The Wachowskis did a great job in making this movie so visually impressive whilst also creating the kind of claustrophobic atmosphere that emphasises the danger that the women are constantly in. Additionally, their economical writing style is both intelligent and perfectly fitting for this type of material.The two leads in this movie are quite different as Corky is an overtly butch lesbian who sports a labrys tattoo on her arm while Violet appears to be a conventional moll whose breathy, high-pitched voice makes her seem rather vulnerable. Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly are both faultless in the ways that they bring out the individual characteristics of these women whilst also creating enough uncertainty about their motives and integrity to add strongly to the tension of the piece. Joe Pantoliano is also highly entertaining in the way that he, so effectively, conveys Caesar's unique combination of craziness and cunning.The relatively high body count and copious amounts of blood on view, emphasise how high the stakes are for everyone in the story but its humour, the amusing ways in which Caesar and Violet both underestimate each other and the ways in which the music (particularly by Aretha Franklin and Tom Jones) is used, are all additional elements that add tremendously to the enjoyment of watching this movie which is so much better appreciated now than it was at the time of its initial release.",Bound
46,hall895,What is this exactly?,4,29 November 2006,"It's a mob movie, it's a lesbian movie, it's a suspense thriller, it's a heist film, it's a love story...Bound tries to be a lot of things. In the end it just ends up being a bit of a mess. The lesbian angle got most of the attention when the film came out but the fact the two lovers here both happen to be women almost seems beside the point by the end. It's almost as if halfway through the filmmakers said, ""OK let's drop the lesbian stuff and turn this into a crime caper."" The movie goes off in all kinds of different directions and the whole thing never really comes together and holds your interest.Jennifer Tilly as Violet and Gina Gershon as Corky play the lovers in question here and there are a few sparks between the two but nothing is ever really sustained. The whole relationship seems rather forced and the performers, Tilly especially, never seem entirely comfortable in their roles. The best performance in the film comes from Joe Pantoliano, who plays Violet's rather oblivious mobster boyfriend Caesar, who never seems to notice that his girlfriend is more interested in Corky than she is in him. Eventually things will start to go badly for Caesar when a rather large sum of money goes missing. Watching Pantoliano's full-blown freak-out is about the best thing the film has to offer. As for why the money goes missing, suffice to say there is plenty of back-stabbing and double-crossing. There is meant to be a great deal of suspense but there really isn't. The whole caper thing just is not very interesting and quite frankly the same can be said for the movie as a whole. It starts with some promise but never really hits its stride and in the end disappoints.",Bound

It ticks more boxes on the guilty pleasure list than practically any other film I've seen. Two beautiful lesbians, (a huskily voluptuous Jennifer Tilly and tomboy Gina Gershon) as the girl of a mobster, played by the excellent, uptight Joe Pantoliano, and as the plumber who comes to do repairs in the claustrophobic Chicago block it's set in.In true film-noir movie tradition, the women get together, into bed and get discussing and making plans to run off with the $2m that Cesar (Pantoliano) has pinched from the mob and so set Violet (Tilly) free.But does that make it a good film? Clever, suspenseful and with superb camera and directorial flourishes it all unfolds in a polished and hypnotic way and totally sweeps you along. Largely devoid of music until acute moments of tension this adds to the atmosphere of peril. Cesar whispers, then shouts in jealously paranoid circles to the point of inquisition when the $2m gets 'lost' and has to cover it up and suspects Violet. How will he get it back to the mob? And he knows Violet's attentions are heading elsewhere... but where? (He has no idea of her orientation).In my view, a good film but not a classic.

The basic story, a double-crossing (or is it triple?), along with a few murders, is pretty decent, but nothing to get all worked up over. Acting, OK, for the most part. The cast was actually fairly small, with the majority of the film taking place between just a few characters. They certainly didn't spend a lot of money on set decoration because they didn't need to! The art department certainly had an easy film in this one! Likewise the wardrobe department. A minor mafia figure has over $2 million to give to his boss.

Jennifer gets a lot of flack by the unintelligent about her voice, but she works it in this movie. The seduction of Gina Gershon by Jennifer Tilly displays that there is a lot more going on in Jennifer than her meek voice implies. Gina Gershon rises from the ashes of Showgirls to play a tough, intelligent woman. There is a rough, intimidating beauty to Gina that suits the character. I don't want to imagine anyone else in either role. As for Joe, he is not the sap that the two girls took him for. The smiling Caesar's fury and resourcefulness matches the girl's wit. The movie pays respect to noir in it's story and lack of color. I hate to be too typically man, but the sex scene rocks me every time. I love how Gina curls her toes, pulling the sheet off the bed.

Yet the film is smart enough not to depend on the novelty of it being a ""lesbian"" film, but takes time to develop both the story and the romance, so we're caught up.  I also liked how Violet (the Jennifer Tilly) character turned out; she at first seemed like a pushover but turned out to be the strongest character in the movie.If I had a quibble, it's that Corky (Gina Gershon, who is very good), is inactive for a crucial, and lengthy, part of the film, which slows things down a little.

58,Bogey Man,One of the most stylish thrillers of the 90's,9,31 May 2002,"Spoiler Alert Bound is directed and written by the brothers (Andy and Larry Wachowsky) who also made The Matrix, a huge success at the box office. Bound is about one apartment, in which two lesbians meet and start to think how they could get their hands on the huge amount of money owned by mafia, in which the other lady's boyfriend is involved. So there are gangsters and criminals, but the friendship and love between these two women, Corky and Violet, is the main point of the film. This is extremely stylish and surprising thriller and has that unusual theme in it.I think that all the females in the world would love this film, because it is hard to imagine more female-loving motion picture in the earth. Men are described pretty ugly and stupid (which is true in most cases in real world, we males are not as clever and fine as we think, and I'm not some kind of a transvestite by saying that!) and those lovely females, who have lesbian affair too, are very sensual and love each other honestly, not just each others' bodies. Bound is one of the most beautiful and interesting studies of friendship without any limits I've seen for some time. The steamy lesbian love making scenes are pretty graphic (and probably way too much for MPAA as the rating shows) but what's so wrong with them? Love involves also physical contact and love making and this film only beautifully shows and depicts it. Some disgusting human types consider lesbians or gays unaccepted groups or inhumans, and it is sad that this kind of narrow-mindedness exists so widely in our ""civilized"" world. Love doesn't follow the limits or attitudes created by human beings and no-one can say that homosexuals are lower pieces of mankind and thus despisable and worth hating. The lesbian love making scenes are pretty similar to the scenes in Antonia Bird's wonderful Priest, which is also a beautiful analysis and depiction of love between same sex (males this time) and horrible attitudes in society which try to destroy it.Bound looks fantastic as it is so stylish and looks cool without looking stupid or calculating. The death scene of Joe Pantoliano is one of the coolest scenes in cinema I've seen for years! The paint splattering in slow motion reminds me of similar scenes in The Matrix and it looks fantastic. There are many other great elements in Bound, too, and the Wachowsky brothers really knew from the beginning how to use camera innovatively and brilliantly.A fine example of what modern cinema can be and should be, and highly surprising little film before the mainstream success of the brothers behind this.

It's not so loaded of philosophical questions and critics against the 'system', that became later their film's trademarks, but the 'twisted' plot turns, that also are a trademark of their works(however it's a relatively minor detail) started since this film, and it has as well a very well-build thriller which probably will catch any viewer to the middle until the end of the film. The acting by all the three leads in the film were convincing, not that good, but convincing... The stylized cinematography is a worth highlight as well... and the story itself is really interesting.

The story is Hitchcockian in that the viewer knows what is going on but the characters don't and you get to watch them try to figure out what to do.

62,squirrel_burst,"Come for the lesbian sex scenes, stay for the gripping thrills",10,22 December 2014,"There's more to ""Bound"" than the famous erotic scenes; it's a gripping heist film that will have you on the edge of your seat as you try to guess where it goes next. You have probably heard of this movie because of the leads, Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon, but the real stars at the Wachowski siblings, who wrote and directed a tight story that's complex but not confusing. Like most heist films, once the plan is set up a lot of the fun is guessing what is going to go right and what will go wrong but I also really enjoyed seeing the protagonists adapt to the constantly changing situation they found themselves in. There isn't a moment that's wasted and the tension builds consistently throughout the movie. You may go in for the famous love making scene, but great performances and believable characters will suck you in as soon as the movie starts. (On VHS, July 16, 2012)",Bound
63,happyendingrocks,More that just a sex scene,7,28 June 2009,"People who still remember this modestly-received thriller are more likely to discuss the lesbian encounter in the film than any of the noir elements. So, let's get this out in the open: Yes, there is a passionate lesbian love scene here, and yes, it is inherently hotter than anything you'll stumble across on Skinemax. However, even stripped of its Tilly-spooning, Bound is a nifty and nimble little thriller in its own right.I realize that this may be a benchmark for lesbianism in mainstream cinema (as recently immortalized in the NOFX song ""Creeping Out Sara""), but to focus in on that one aspect of Bound is to dismiss the other fine qualities it has going for it. While the sexuality of our leading ladies is certainly instrumental to the plot, watching how the scenario plays out, one would suspect that Bound would have worked fine even if our machinating mistresses were just good friends.The caper is a collection of rather standard noir touchstones: scheming dames, clueless husbands, stealing money from bad guys, etc. But the film has style to spare and boasts a stellar supporting cast of top-notch character actors, which means even if you've seen this plot played out before, there are plenty of fresh angles to look at in this version.The under-used Jennifer Tilly is particularly excellent, and seeing her handle this material with such flair, we can't help but think she was born a few decades too late. Had she been around in the golden age of major studio black-and-whites, her pouty and sensuous turn as the bad girl who's really just in over her head would have made her a natural to share marquees with Bogie and Bacall.The ending works out in quite an unexpected and refreshing fashion. Most viewers will be expecting a trademarked double-cross to round things out, but what they receive is a nicely bookended tale where it's okay to root for some of the bad guys, since the ones who get their just desserts are badder. What initially seems unclever actually turns out to be a perfect way to end the film, and even if things don't close out with one last big bang, there's plenty of game being run throughout the movie to satisfy those wanting to see top-notch scheming in action. And if you like your noir thrillers wet, there's also plenty of well-executed blood-letting on display, including one beautifully-essayed scene that uses the interplay of dark crimson blood against pure white paint to conjure a gorgeously macabre image that makes us glad this bad boy wasn't shot in black and white. Bound is not a see-it-now classic by any means, but it doesn't aim to be anything more than an entertaining evening excursion. At that, it succeeds admirably. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the film is seeing the future Matrix masterminds tackle a more straight-forward character piece that relies on atmosphere instead of kinetic action.Bound may not be the genre-defining work that Matrix is, but at least it doesn't have two awful sequels sullying its good name. You certainly have to give it that.",Bound

When her boyfriend (an excellent Joe Pantaliano) steals $2.137 Mn for the mafia, the two ladies decide to steal it from him. The cat and mouse games that ensue are the bulk of the film.I liked the twists and turns in the movie. The direction, photography and especially the lighting were superb. In the cast Joe Pantaliano stands out but Gina Gershon is quite good. This is a superb debut for the Wachowski Brothers who went on to make the Matrix Trilogy (Part 1 of which was quite good).What I didn't like was that the whole love thing between Tilly and Gershon seems quite contrived. They have two brief ""fingering sessions"" and they're in love! Also, Tilly may be a good actress but I didn't like her. None of the characters is sympathetic but Caesar is so nasty and vicious he becomes a sort of anti-hero.The film is quite violent but there is very little in the way of sex so I'm surprised at the R rating.",Bound

This leads to that and that leads to something else and that leads to this and so on. What is special about this film, is that everything is connected. This is not Tarantino nonsense, that has no point and simply tries to rely on gimmicks and witty dialog. This is a clever thriller. The story centers around Corky, Violet and Caesar, who in one way or another, are involved in a plan to scam the mob. Of course, scamming the mob is never a good idea. Issues of trust, loyalty, love, violence and everything else are covered. There are very arousing sex scenes and scenes of disturbing violence, utilizing pruning shears. All of it choreographed beautifully by two very talented brothers. However,it is Joe Pantoliano who steals the show. He plays a wiseguy that gets caught in a downward spiral that can only finish one way, but he does his best to delay it. How he was omitted by the Academy is beyond me. To the pompous nitwits that peck away at this film, I have one question. What Hollywood films in the last ten years can you reel off that were nearly as clever as this film? Yeah, I thought so. **** out of ****, a simply brilliant motion picture.",Bound

70,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,Excellent! This is how 'Neo-Noir' films should be.,8,11 July 2018,"It is hard to accept the fact that I haven't ever heard of this great Neo-Noir, written and directed by the acclaimed Wachowski Brothers (Lana&Lilly) in the early stages of their career which reached its peak with ''The Matrix'' (1999). ''Bound'' is an absorbing crime/mystery with dashes of Hitchcockian suspense, having a solid plotline and great cast such as Joe Pantoliano and Jennifer Tilly who both deliver tremendous performances in their roles of a husband and wife, the former being a made mafioso and the latter a typical 'Damsel in Distress' who searches for a safe exit from the Mob's violent characters and proceedings, while becoming infatuated with her new neighbor (Gina Gershon's character). Tilly's character, acted with a mischievous- almost manipulative- sexiness and cynical determination, hatches a plan to rob her husband of mob money, with the guidance and support from her new lover. But, as always, reality doesn't follow the plan and things spiral out of control with a high body count and Caesar (J. Pantoliano's character) on the verge of a complete breakdown as he finds himself owing to his own mob family a sum of 2.000.000 dollars. The main theme of ''Bound'' is trust between humans and the risks that people are taking, based on the trust to a closely related person. The movie, apart from its references to classic Film-Noir, brought to my mind the early Joel&Ethan Coen pictures and plotwise it will somehow remind you of the superb ''Shallow Grave'' by Danny Boyle. This is a little-known gem that is certainly worth spending the approximately 100 minutes of your precious time and it will leave you wondering why it is so hard to find similar productions in the contemporary era.",Bound
71,jrfranklin01,Steamy Stealing,7,17 October 2004,"This film is the Wachowski Brothers' debut (famous for The Matrix series). If you listen closely you can actually hear some of the sfx that are used in The Matrix. From the beginning of the film you can tell its the work of the Wachowski's in the creative effects on introducing the title (remember the scrolling green numbers that read The Matrix). I still am having trouble fitting the title to the film's plot but it's not necessary. The film quickly gets to its point in involving the two main characters Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Corky (Gina Gershon). For you guys out there who are familiar with these ladies, you understand that to say they are simply attractive is a heinous understatement. One of the things and perhaps ""the thing"" that really blew me away about this film was the director's ability to almost make you squirm with the development and heating up of a lesbian sex scene between Gershon and Tilly. Now I'm not just saying this because I'm a guy. I think you ladies might appreciate at least the director's build-up (unpredictably corny yet captivating) of relations between the two.In a heart-stopper of sex scene, Gershon and Tilly shock the audience with an incredibly intense orgasmic lovemaking. For the Wachowskis debut film, I gotta admit it's amazing yet also a very risky move for them. Thankfully, it just happened to work. Corky and Violet continue their affairs while Corky works in an adjacent apartment. All the while, Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (a mob lackey played by Joe Pantoliano), is unaware. Violet soon tempts Corky with the idea of stealing $2 million dollars that her boyfriend is holding for the mob. But for the robbery plan to go off smoothly, Violet and Corky have to put their trust and lives on the line.Don't judge this simple plot too quickly. You are given a clue at the beginning of the film that Corky and Violet's plans don't go as follows. Lies and deceit continually change the ending and who gets away with the mob's money. 7/10",Bound

73,cofemug,Awesome movie,10,9 August 2000,"There is a comment close to the bottom that compare the movie to the likes of Hitchcock and Welles.  When i first saw this it was in my Hitchcock film class.  We were watching films inspired by Hitchcock, without completely ripping it off.  (see What Lies Beneath).  This is a great movie that I could keep watching over and over again.  It is a taut suspense thriller, an ironic comedy, a mob movie, with a dash of soft-core porn.  OK, OK, don't get scared away by the soft-core porn, just last through the first 30 min or so, and it will be all over.The movie was one of the first in a long time to keep me on the edge of my seat.  You see in the beginning, and are reminded in between act 1 & 2, where it will eventually lead to.  But, the question is how does it get there?  There are so many different possibilities, that you keep guessing what will happen, and are kept in taut suspense about it.  Then, since the movie turns every genre on its head practically, you don't know how it will finish in the third act.  Great movie-making.The movie is also very very stylish.  With its use of color, camera angles (the hanging money shot is fabulous), mixture of long shots and close-ups, plot twists, and good scoring, the movie will keep you tense.  I love this movie, and see it again and again.  I suggest everybody that can get past two lesbian scenes, since I am a guy, I found it more than easy, to rent this movie.  And, even those who can't, that is what fast-forward is for.10/10",Bound

They are good, in fact I would rank the first seduction scene in this movie amongst the most erotic scenes ever filmed.But you can skip the romance entirely in this film and you have a great crime drama. All the key elements are here - the mob, lots of money, power struggles, double crosses, sexy girls, macho headstrong guys and endless suspense. And like any good drama, there are no good guys, so you have to choose which of the bad guys to side with.This movie winds and winds the suspense relentless until there are so many possible outcomes, its dizzying. This is worthy of Hitchcock.Tilly and Gershon are excellent, but this is Joe Pantoliano's triumph. In a Oscar worthy performance, Pantoliano plays a low level mobster whose easy life caves in on him in a matter hours. Also excellent in a bit part is Chris Meloni, Keller from HBOs Oz.This movie is famous for its love scenes. It is so much more than that - it is one of the best crime dramas of the 90's.

77,sonya90028,"Edgy, spine-tingling crime drama.",7,12 October 2008,"I'd never seen Bound when it came out 12 years ago. So, I recently decided to see it on DVD. As a crime drama, it really packs a punch. The storyline centers on a gangster moll named Violet, and her plot to steal over 2 million bucks from her 'common thug' of a boyfriend, Caeser. Caeser is involved with the mob, and is laundering the huge sum of money for them. The money belongs to the mob, and Caeser must turn it over to them, after laundering it.Their neighbor, named Corky (played with flinty perfection by Gina Gershon), is a lesbian ex-con. Corky is a plumber. She's doing some repairs in an apartment, which is right next to Violet and Caeser's place.Tired of the violent, criminal world that she's been a part of through Caeser, Violet wants a fresh start. She soon winds-up seducing Corky, and enlists Corky's help in a scheme to steal the millions in cash from Caeser. Having fallen for Violet, Corky agrees to help her steal the cash from Caeser, then set him up to make him appear to be the culprit. Corky tells Violet how dangerous it is to risk stealing from the mob, and that their plan has to be fool-proof. Their brilliant plan goes well-at first. But it starts to unravel, and then the thrills really begin. From then on, the film features harrowing plot-twists, and plenty of nail-biting suspense.The acting in this film, was top-notch. Especially the performances by Gina Gershon, and Jennifer Tilly (who played Violet). When this film was made, lesbian characters were beginning to turn-up in mainstream movies, in larger numbers than ever before. And Bound was especially cutting-edge, by featuring a lesbian character as one of the main protagonists in the film, rather than as just a supporting character.I would give Bound a higher rating. But I was a bit put-off by the excessive, gory violence contained in this film. Otherwise, Bound is an exciting, powerful crime drama, which will keep you on the edge of your seat.",Bound

What could go wrong huh?Gershon is employed to renovate an apartment in a block owned by the mob after just getting out. The first meeting between Violet and Corky is pure sexual cinema and brilliantly filmed and played without words. Things soon speed up and Caesar is asked to collect two million dollars from a bent mob guy and hold it for the big boss to collect. This is where Violet and Corky start their plan.Only things do not go according to plan (of course they don't heh). Double dealings, revenge and desperation follow. I will not go into much more for those who have not seen this brilliant film, but trust that things get way out of hand for all concerned. Will Vi and Corky be together? Watch and find out.This is perhaps the Wachowski Sisters best film and it has a real noir feel to it. Though I would not call it noir or even particularly neo-noir, the vibes and feel are there. I also would not have been in the least bit surprised if the Cohen brothers had directed it. The film has a real feel of theirs to it also.

81,eamon-hennedy,Lesbians and gangsters. A perfect combination!,9,24 November 2003,"Looking at this film nowadays makes for an interesting viewing experience. It comes as a surprise that the sibling directorial duo of this movie went on to make one of the most culturally redefining science fiction films of the past five years. In fact it is equally surprising that a science fiction film was going to be next for Larry and Andy Wachowski. Their first feature isn't about alternate realities, it sure as hell isn't about modern day Messiahs and doesn't feature any revolutionary special effects. In saying that, Bound is still a highly representative film that marks out a talent to look out for. Their first film is a fantastic Hitchcock style film-noir gangster thriller that is in equal parts suspenseful and sexually explicit. The first thing they do is to make the lovers at the center of the film's narrative two women. While the brothers' do take advantage of this strand to create one of the most of explicit sexual scenes in recent memory, they do not let this dominate the film, or make the fact that two lesbians are at the heart of their film become apparent for the sake of it. The sex scene is done and dusted in the first twenty minutes and the screenplay treats the fact that Violet and Corky are lesbians as something mundane. Their relationship is treated, rightly, as something normal and never is this something that is treated in an exploitative way nor does the film remind us every five minutes that the film you are watching has two female lovers in it.The screenplay is first class. Double crossing gangsters to snare a lot of money has been done to death, but the Wachowski's do it with style and panache, not to mention in a gripping fashion. The brothers' squeeze every inch of suspense out of the situation and have created a modern day film which reeks of something Hitchcock would make in today's age if he were still alive. Their directorial touches are also fantastic. Visually this is one of the most stunning films that I have ever seen. Unusual angles abound, especially in the opening scene, while one breathtaking moment features the character of Violet telephoning Corky  in the next room, only for the camera to sweep down the telephone wire, to the wall, into the next apartment and then up to Corky as she answers it. Add to this some fantastic performances. Jennifer Tilly has always been a favorite of mine and here she shines superbly as a modern day femme fatale in her sleekly tight outfits and sexual air that is alluding. Likewise Gina Gershon who plays the more physically tough character Corky. Both she and Tilly have great chemistry together and makes for one of modern cinema's most gorgeous pairing. However the film is stolen by the great Joe Pantoliano as Caesar, the gangster that Violet and Corky are stealing off. Like his character of Ralph in The Sopranos, Caesar is both funny, yet frightening. Panotliano is breathtaking as the character, playing the sleaze ball with considerate ease.Overall Bound is a fantastic film. The mixture of a romantic love story, stolen money, gangsters and violence makes for a fantastic mixture of ingredients that works terrifically. It's no surprise that future success lay ahead for the film's sibling duo.",Bound
82,boondocksaint20,A rare treat. A thriller film-noir with 'Matrix' style direction and great acting.,9,10 January 2003,"There are so many similarities between this movie, and The Matrix, both directed by the talented Wachowski brothers; namely, the direction, the fancy pans that make the violence almost an art form, and of course, the always great Joe Pantoliano.  I got this movie based on the fact that I loved The Matrix and that this was the Wachowski brothers' first film (plus, a rumor of a little lesbianage didn't hurt, either).Frankly, I was never much of a fan for either Jennifer Tilly or Gina Gershon, but both women did a great job in this movie.  Tilly especially, playing the manipulative femme fatale that reminded me of so many film noirs of the past.  She plays Violet, the girlfriend of Caesar (Pantoliano), a made man with the local mafia.  I loved how sensual this character was, and it was incredibly portrayed by Tilly's natural raspy/whispery voice and her comely features, that are always dressed symbolically in black.  Gershon plays her love interest, an ex-con who has moved next door.  I found her acting to be pretty good, not as good as need be, but at least she played 'the butch' part well without being too 'butchy'.  Both females leads did well, but, I just wasn't convinced that they were in love with each other as much as they and the script claimed them to be.  This did bother me a little, but it doesn't detract from the fun that is to be had with this film.The real standout was Pantoliano as the frenzied and always on edge mafioso, Caesar.  In the film, he goes through one stressed filled situation to another, and with each progressing scene, I was amazed at how well Pantoliano portrayed Caesar as he slows slipped farther and farther away from sanity, yet, still kept a straight and paranoid air about him.  To tell the truth, his performance was so powerful, it was the main reason why many of the latter scenes are dripping with suspense (I found myself rooting for him the whole time over the two lesbian protagonists).  You really feel for this guy; though he is a 'bad' guy by profession, he seems to play things safely and by the book...you can't help at feel for his innocense and frantic desperation throughout the film, and how the resolution of a bad situation seems to continually spawn an even worse situation for him. Words can't describe how well he acted in this film...I don't think this film would have been the same without Joe Pantoliano.Each scene is shot with style, and many of the settings (especially the bathroom), clothing (the dark clothing of most of the characters, and the old style dress of the police officers' uniforms) and camera shots reminded me so much of The Matrix, which was a wonderful treat.  Imagine a thriller film-noir with 'Matrix' style direction, and you have Bound.  Though the ending may be a bit predictable, it is still an enjoyable watch. Wonderful direction, writing and acting, larger than life characters and true film-noir at its best makes Bound one of those rare gems that deserves more recognition than it has.  Despite the wonderfully uncomfortable and ubiquitous feeling of madness, suspicion, paranoia and double-crossing, its rather predictable ending, in addition to the fact that I was never truly convinced that the two female protagonists truly loved each other to the point of risking each other's lives for one another are the only reasons I cannot give it a perfect rating.  To tell the truth, I would have enjoyed one last double cross at the end since the movie seems to end a little too upbeat, and just a little too unbelievable given the characters and the scenarios.  However, it is an excellent movie that simply demands multiple viewings due to its style, acting and atmosphere.  Highly recommended. 9/10 stars.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.",Bound

It was clearly written not just in a rush but by Hollywood types who have little idea of what Mafia guys really are like or how they operate. The portrayals of Caesar and the rest are grotesquely unconvincing. Nor does it stop there. The butch ex-con Corky also is more caricature than character--just a collection of tattoos and piercings in men's underwear that never adds up to a believable person.OK, the cinematography and sets are stylish. The producers got the most from a low budget with no money for outdoor scenes so it's **film noir** in color. So what? Gina Gershon never got a part again in a major movie after appearing in this **dreck**.Even if every queer in the western world gave this picture ten stars on here, Hollywood, like the viewing public, made its own decision and this picture was gone from theaters--those few it ran in--faster than a late night movie crowd.",Bound
84,98nurdinm-1,Naughty...but nice!,6,4 February 2005,"""Bound"", the film that gave the Wachowski brothers the funding to make ""The Matrix"" and it's lacklustre sequels, is quite an interesting film. It almost immediately goes into the seduction/pairing between the characters of Corky, the recently-released criminal, and Violet, the gangster's moll. I'm not sure what trip the Wachowski brothers were on when they decided to make the two anti-heroes lovers, and I wonder actually if it would have worked any better if Corky was a guy? After the first half-hour or so of this the mood changes completely, and for the better. This is a very funny dark film. The scene with the towel is particularly amusing. The first time I saw the film I almost laughed out loud, and therefore almost blew my cover. (I had snack down to see this movie after hearing about it from a friend of mine.) In terms of acting, I'm not a real fan of Jennifer Tilly. Her Violet was not believable - it was too much of a ""late-night movie"" style bad acting. I don't know if that's what the Wachowski brothers wanted, but if it is then it just doesn't work. Gina Gershon is more believable as the con woman Corky, and the fact that the character is played as she does is good for the film's standards.However the star of the show must be Joe Pantalino. He is brilliant as Ceaser - paranoid the one moment, very funny the next. He reminds me of a cross between Joe Pesci and Steve Buscemi, which I don't think is a bad thing at all.A word of caution, though.

For one, the plot is hatching as we watch and listen to the two women's plan.  It may be confusing at first, but you get the hang of it.The verdict: 4 of 5 stars.",Bound

89,HBeachBabe,the best film of 1996,10,6 January 2000,"Before striking the motherlode with the Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers made this gem.  Easily the best ""lesbians try to steal money from the mob"" movie ever made.  Even without the lesbian content (which is what originally drew me in) this film is wonderful.  The plotting is tense & taut, with narey a hole in site.  Despite the preponderance of mob movies and the stereotypes associated with them, ""Bound"" manages to avoid all of them.  All the character's from the leads (Cesar, Corky & Violet) to the minors (Micky, Shelly, even the cops) are originals, with each scene revealing a new dimension to the characters.  And the direction is fantastic.  The lighting, the angles, the editing, all are used to highten the tension and never come across like ""tricks""  I just bought the letterbox version of the video so I can watch it over and over.  Highly recommended!",Bound
90,Lt_Coffey_182,Film Noir at its best,9,11 November 2003,"I saw this in a bargain bin for 6 pounds in HMV and thought 'might as well give it a crack'. I was in no way disappointed. This movie has something for everyone; violence, romance, drama and suspense galore. The film entices the viewer to keep on watching, mainly by making the audience care so much for the two main characters. Tilly and Gershon are focal in the films plot and the Wachowski brothers develop the characters in a far more superior way than the over rated Matrix. An interesting aspect is that Corky acts as Violet's ""mentor"" in to lesbianism and shows her the light from Caesar's dark pit of despair.Pantoliano is always good. He was the best actor in The Matrix, shone in Memento and loved to be hated in The Sopranos. His seedy character proves to be strong and dangerous to underestimate. Gina Gershon is one of my favourite actresses who was criminally wasted in The Insider but proved a wonderful character in Face/Off and Red Heat as the bad guy's girlfriend/wife. Her performance in Bound is brilliant. She is amazingly seductive, sensitive but strong character who has a full range of emotions. Tilly has the performance of her life as the brave yet overwhelmingly vulnerable lead character. Her voice is a touch annoying at times but her performance is compelling enough that she gets away with it.The lighting of the film is superb. Film Noir seems to be a phrase long forgotten but Bound shows the artistic qualities of noir. It greatly illustrates the mood of the film, top directing. The use of slow motion is also very effective and imprints the directors' style on the film. It isn't over used in this film and is done to an art form rather than to just show off directorial flair.A lot of people when they talk about Bound simply mention the love scene. This is very unfair as the film has a lot more to offer than something to dribble at. The scene is however, worth a mention. Whilst Gershon and Tilly both look great, the scene is extremely beautiful and full of emotion. The scene is also very realistic and isn't done in a gratuitous way at all.A slick, suspenseful thriller with a wonderful relationship blossoming in between the bloodshed makes for one of my favourite films that is sadly ignored by film critics. It is clear though that Bound is a quality film that is packed full of career best performances.",Bound
91,Preston-10,Corky + Violet 4-Ever (SPOILERS),10,30 May 2002,"Bound is one of those movies where right after you see it for the first time you want to see it again, and again. It's definitely one of the best films ever made and the single best piece of contemporary film noir since Miller's Crossing. It also manages to do a lot while having very little on the production angle (more than half of it is filmed in a room). I also like the mind games that everyone plays in the movie. You can just feel Joe Pantoliano's heart sink when he discovers that the money's missing, he's absolutely amazing in this film. For some reason I think of Bogart from Treasure of the Sierra Madre when I see his performance, he's so vile and so tightly-wound.With a film like Bound, where the action keeps the story going, you also have to look at the value of the relationship between Coky and Violet. A lot of people think that you can't have a girly character like the one Jennifer Tilly played, fall in love with the more masculine, butch lesbian that Gina Gershon played. For me, I can't think of a more perfect relationship.(SPOILERS) In a sense, each character has escaped her own prospective trap. Corky was an ex-con who just came out of prison. Likewise, Violet, by the end of the film, escaped her role as a gangster's girlfriend. They both knew what it was like to be trapped, to be 'bound' by some negative, external factor. I also love how Corky is played. This is absolutely the coolest character I have ever seen in a movie, you can't help but love her. I mean, how can you not like a movie in which the stereotypical lesbians dupe the stereotypical gangsters? That's why I love Bound.",Bound

Sometimes I judge movies by the musical score... well, that sure didn't help, either. I apologize to all, but I thought this was badly written, directed, shot, acted... but yet, I did not turn it off. Probably due to the two leads, at their best back then. Beautiful, tough, and hot.

93,Euphorbia,"Original, engaging, deliciously twisted noir fantasy",7,11 December 2003,"8/10. Would have been higher than ""8"" had there been more sex on screen, especially between Violet and Corky. When bluenoses complain about 'sex and violence' in movies, what they really mean is that they don't want sex diluting their violence. To them I say: Stick to video games.
Comparisons are odious, so let's compare this movie: ""Bound"" is not in the same league as such great gangster dramas as ""The Shield"" (on FX TV, and now on DVD) or ""L.A. Confidential,"" probably because the ambiguities of the cop perspective are inherently more dramatic, and hence more interesting, than the simple-minded gangster world.
But ""Bound"" is better than ""Wild Side"" (either version), which is similar in theme and structure to ""Bound,"" but ""Bound"" is a more polished and more dramatic movie. ""Bound"" is much better than ""Miller's Crossing,"" which seems more like a low-budget amateur stage play than an actual movie. ""Miller's Crossing"" has big empty sets, and big empty characters. ""Bound"" is just as stagey, but the sets are richer, and the characters are much more interesting -- equally unrealistic, of course, but that's part of the fun of the noir genre.
And ""Bound"" is much, much, much better than the Warchowksis' 'other' movie, ""The Matrix,"" which I consider an incoherent failure -- explained in detail in my comments. I don't know if the popularity of ""The Matrix"" reflects the failure of American education, or the failure of the war on drugs, but one would have to be either irrational, or stoned, or both, to overlook the lapses in ""The Matrix.""",Bound
94,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 5 out of 5,9,27 December 2002,"Bound is a sexy, stylish and suspenseful modern visitation to the film noir genre that emerged in the 1940s and 1950s.  Right from the outset - where the letters of the film's name cast deep dark shadows like high-rise buildings - the viewer is inducted into a world where duplicity is the norm and where choices made result in prices being paid.  And with over $2 million of Mob money at stake, the risk to life and limb is very high indeed.
Violet is a latter-day gangster's moll looking for a way out of  'the business'.  Her chance comes when her boyfriend, Ceasar, brings home a fortune in cash to be sorted and collated before being passed on to the Chicago Mafia.  She seduces the tough-talking ex-con who is renovating the next-door apartment (an impressively butch Gina Gershon) and together they scheme to relieve the Mob of the money.  But when Ceasar doesn't react according to plan, suddenly there are dead bodies to deal with and events begin to spiral out of control.  The women's trust in each other is stretched to breaking point as they are drawn into a deadly battle of wits.
Directors Larry and Andy Wachowski make judicious use of the conventions of film noir, such as extensive chiaroscuro, and some imaginative and uncomfortable extreme close-up shots.  The clever cinematography is backed up by a tension-laden script and an excellent cast (particularly Joe Pantoliano as the increasingly frenzied Ceasar).  Although Bound may take some viewers out of their comfort zone with its graphic lesbian sex scene and depiction of Mob torture tactics, it is a film that will reward its audience with a stylish and intelligent foray into the eternally murky confluence of good and evil.",Bound

The movie has legs after the first 20 minutes and gets visually and structurally interesting. Joey Pants is always an engaging and fun to watch. Gershon is fantastic. Jennifer Tilly is fulcrum of the story and the reason I was turned off but she is very good in the role, after all. This is worth watching. A fun time. An unusual movie in many aspects.

98,fidelio74,Wonderful film noir,5,27 November 2010,"On a Saturday afternoon in 1996 I took in a screening of David Cronenberg's controversial 'Crash' at the Palace cinema in Adelaide. One of the pre-film trailers advertised a movie I had never heard of. It was a thriller called 'Bound' and the preview totally sold me - the flick looked stylish, violent, and intense. I had to see it! So, when it was released, I returned to the same cinema to check it out. I was far from disappointed. 'Bound' is a wonderful film noir up there with 'After Dark, My Sweet' and 'The Grifters'.Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Corky (Gina Gershon) steam the screen as lesbian lovers who decide to steal two million dollars from a Chicago mobster. They first meet in an elevator and Corky, who is just out of prison, soon discovers that she is doing some plumbing right next door to the apartment where Violet lives as a kept woman with her low-level mobster partner (the always excellent Joe Pantoliano).One evening Caesar bursts through the front door with a large paper grocery bag almost overflowing with blood-soaked money. He explains that the money belongs to Gino Marzzone (Richard C. Sarafian), the head of a Chicago crime family. Caesar's plan is to wash the blood off the money, hang it up to dry, iron each and every bill individually, then divide the money into denominations using an automatic counting machine, and place a band around each denomination. Then he will place all the cash neatly into a suitcase and present it to Gino when he flies in to collect it. But Violet and Corky have other ideas, and they hatch a plan to make off with the cash. Will they get away clean? This is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, but it is not for the prudish or the faint of heart. There are plenty of clever twists and some shocking violence. 'Bound' represents an opportunity to see what the directing team of the Wachowski Brothers did before they conquered the world with the mind-bending science fiction of the 'The Matrix' trilogy and the brilliant and unfairly reviled 'Speed Racer'. They show that they can be just as inventive and imaginative on a small budget as they are on a big one. If you like film noir, then this is highly recommended.",Bound
99,morfeus,Excellent,10,3 July 2005,"This is a truly great movie, both from artistic point of view and regarding its political correctness. The plot is quite simple: a bisexual girl Violet and a lesbian Corky (played by Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon) decide to steal 2 millions which belong to mob. However, the money is guarded by Violet's boyfriend Cesar (Joe Pantoliano), so they set him up, have him killed, and provoke a small internal war in Chicago mob in the process. Surprisingly, they manage to trick the whole Manzone family, and get their happy ending. The best part of the plot is that it doesn't accent the lesbian part,but instead it focuses on character development and suspense, thus being truly neutral and politically correct. Directing is great, the whole flashback sequence is well-thought and entertaining. Acting is almost perfect, Jennifer Tilly especially excels, getting out of her typecast ""bimbo"" roles. Joe Pantoliano also does an incredible job, especially in scenes when he's going paranoid. So, to sum up, the movie has great directing, acting, no stereotypes, and almost perfect plot (in real world, Violet definitely would have been killed, as an unwanted witness), so it's a true masterpiece.",Bound
100,camachoborracho,Stunning directorial debut by Wachowskis,8,23 November 2004,"Bound is a film for which I have mixed feelings: it looks and feels amazing, the cinematography, acting, directing, costumes, wardrobe, props, colors, moods, etc. feel like a graphic novel brought to life. Yet on the other hand there is something that smacks of ""aren't we cool for doing x?"" - I guess the lesbian scenes and camera work were what did this so as to give it a punk/hip feel (then again, this is not long after Pulp Fiction came out so everyone was doing it).Having seen the Matrix 1-3 I can understand and appreciate the camera work on second viewing, but it feels like the Wachowski brothers were pushing the lesbian eroticism for the sake of shock and males in the audience. It definitely seems to be directed by males insofar as the sex scenes go (the female body is both fetishist and problematized as a threat to men throughout the film too, but that's a different subject altogether), but these are more artsy than ""Skinemax"" night flicks in that there is very little nudity, it was tastefully shown for the most part and a lot was told with sounds and shadows. (Personally, I think the lesbians were there for shock since a male lover would have worked just as well, but in general I think some more subtlety could have been used in the sex scenes myself since imagining it is sexier IMHO).That said, the first half, which establishes character, does seem to drag quite a bit, but once the caper gets going it never stops. You also feel for all of the characters - surprisingly, I felt the most for Cesar, the ""villain"" of the piece (perhaps because of an amazing shot when he opens the briefcase and then the world seems out of whack as we look up at him).I can't really find anything ""wrong"" with this film per se and it is a good film although I could have easily fast forwarded the first half and got roughly the same effect. Still I could watch this film over and over again for the way it was shot since it is amazing and there are a lot of techniques and style one can learn from it, plus the story is great too. So for this I give the film8 out of 10 stars. Definitely worth a watch, although some of you more conservative folks might be a little put off by the lesbian scenes.",Bound

The performances are superb.  Jennifer Tilley is great as Violet, her voice little over a husky whisper.  Gina Gershon is cool and sexy as the ex-con Corky.  And Joe Pantoliano is great as Ceasar.  Great story, great dialogue, and great actors, what more could you ask for?  My score-8.",Bound
102,azeemak,"Breathless, brilliant thriller",10,9 September 2002,"Seeing this film for the third time recently, I was amazed that I was STILL gripped towards the end, even though I knew how it ended.  About how many thrillers can that be said?A few critics (in the UK at least) dismissed this film as a Sapphic exploitation flick, but they could not be more wrong.  The sexual chemistry between Gershon and Tilly is astonishingly potent, but there is only one nude sex scene, which looks to an outsider (ie a straight man) to be a lot more authentic than what you sometimes see in ""erotic thrillers"" and soft-core made-for-cable movies.  The seduction scene which precedes it is also highly erotic, but both of these scenes are over quite early in the film, and the directors obviously trusted the strength of the story enough not to have to throw more sex scenes in later.And they were right: the plot is a doozy, constantly keeping us guessing, mainly thanks to the mercurial Caesar (another treasurable performance from Joe Pantoliano), who like Violet is a bit smarter than he seems.  For much of the film he is perched on the brink of hysteria, but every now and then his vision clears and he thinks he can see a way out.  Only a really good actor could bring this off and make it believable, and almost evoke our sympathy.The screenplay is unbelievably good, tight as a drum, and with no holes that I could see.  The twists and turns never seemed contrived, most of them arising out of the characters and the relationships between them.  For example, a crucial plank in Corky's plan involves exploiting the hatred between Caesar and Johnny Marzzano, which has previously been shown.  And Mickey's tender feelings towards Violet, very subtly hinted at, help to explain his credulity at the end of the film (not to give it away).  I honestly reckon the screenplay deserved a written-for-the-screen Oscar nomination at least.Structurally, too, the film is very strong.  While there is nothing new about cutting the chronology around to make the film non-linear, the W brothers do this just enough to keep it fresh.  In particular, the opening shot is pretty daring, including as it does several of the film's key lines played over it, but not in such a way that it would ruin the suspense.And the two leads?  It's hard to imagine how they could have been better. Jennifer Tilly's breathy voice is an undoubted asset here, and she has the chops to suggest that under the gangster's moll exterior there lies a clever and cunning woman.  Gina Gershon is even better: wry, wary, smart and sexy as hell.  Some of her insolent lines to Caesar as the film's climax approaches are outrageously well-delivered.  She's up there with Catherine Keener and Judy Davis in the sardonic stakes.Bound has been comprehensively overshadowed by the Matrix, but, as with Paul Thomas Anderson's debut, Hard Eight (aka Sydney), I would like to think that posterity will recognise it as the superior work.  See this film!",Bound
103,Grismar,"Simple, yet effective",8,20 September 2001,"An at times beautifully shot, well thought out thriller.

And although the ending may be a little predictable, the movie has enough extras to even consider seeing it again.",Bound
104,Clockwork-Avacado,The Wachowski Brothers best film,4,7 November 2013,"To say that this is the best Wachowski-siblings directed film ever made, really isn't much of a compliment. A few years later, based on the success of this film, they would go on to destroy action movies forever with the ""Matrix"" trilogy, and generally, they manage to destroy everything they touch - their only moment of glory was as screenwriters for the marvellous ""V for Vendetta"", bu then, they basically lifted 98% of it from the original graphic novel anyway. But, as their second film, ""Bound"" is by no means a typical effort. Rather than the crushing over-kill, and terrible stylistic choices, we instead have a kind of...average film.As a genre piece, it's very unremarkable. Basically, it's ten or fifteen minutes of lesbian scenes, followed by your standard, unremarkable crime film, where everyone's unlikeable, and violence is glorified. There's some visually arresting scenes, usually depicted blood swirling in water, or paint, but for the most part, there really isn't much new and exciting about this storyline, about a gangster's girlfriend who wants to escape from the brutal world of the mob with her lover. The only change is, the lover is also a woman. Maybe the lack of lesbian fiction back in those days made this more remarkable, but to contemporary eyes, it's nothing new. In fact, it's rather clichéd in places, with it's rather unsubtle archetypes.However, what makes a very limited crime drama palatable, is the standard of the acting. There's a tiny cast in this movie, really only about five or six major parts, and all the action unfolds in the same building. It gets a little wearing, and claustrophobic at times, but as I said, the acting is exceptional. Joe Pantoliano gives a marvellous performance, as Brooklyn-born mafia man Caesar, definitely his best role as far as I'm concerned. Jennifer Tilly, who plays Violet, his girlfriend, gives a fresh and interesting performance, although there's no denying that there's something terribly annoying about her breathlessly husky, squeaky voice at times. Is there something clinically wrong with her, or is htis just an affectation? Because it ruins about half her lines of dialogue. If, as was originally planned, she'd have been cast as Corky, the whole film may have taken a dive off a cliff - perhaps, as ws rumoured at the time, with Marcia Gay Harden as Violet.The real star of the film, is Gina Gershon, as the electrically charged Corky, Violet's lover. Her workman-like clothing, and air of ennui may be rather a stereotype of a butch lesbian, but her performance is anything but stereotyped. In fact, there are definite signs that it has influenced Ruta Gedmints' portrayal of Frankie, the heroine of the BBC's superlative lesbian drama, ""Lip Service"". Gershon is a stunning talent, and carries the movie, with a little help from Pantoliano, almost single-handedly. She is nothing short of brilliant to watch.Adult film actress Susie Bright appears in a bit part as Jessie, in the (presumably) gay bar into which Corky visits early on - one of the few changes of location in the entire movie - and even gets a few lines. Whilst her performance, aside form being very sexy, adds nothing, she would provide valuable assistance in a rather bizarre form as the ""adviser"" to the sex scenes in the film, which, with neither actress being gay, must have been quite a feat. Mary Mara also gives a brief turn as a visually impressive policewoman.The rampant immorality is rather tiresome, although it has some style, rather than the barefaced repulsion of a Scorsese effort. There are no characters we can sympathise with, and, at the end of the day, the story is so limited, that there really is very little you actually get out of this film, other than some titillation, and a seen-it-all-before storyline.Generally, though, this is a relatively uninspired gangster film, which, whilst promising a clever and witty thrill-ride, really descends into violence, sex and shouting matches. Its' visual limitations are always apparent, because of the claustrophobic nature of the plot itself, clearly influenced by superior efforts, such as Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"". Riding high on the crest of immorality, this offers us little new, except some steamy lesbian sex scenes, and a handful of superb performances. Some scenes stand up in isolation, where we get a sense of tension, such as the interrogation, or the police searching Caesar's place, or Caesar's artfully filmed demise. But, as a whole, there really are too few ideas, and even the decent moments have the feeling that we've seen it all before.",Bound

107,Phoenix-36,A brilliant and sexy thriller,8,12 February 1999,"Recently released from prison Corky (Gina Gershon) obtains a job painting and refurbishing an apartment. Living in the building is Violet (Jennifer Tilly), the mistress of medium sized hood Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). And Caesar has two million dollars is a suitcase on his kitchen table. Violet wants to seduce Corky and run off with the cash.Stylish 90's noir at its best, this movie begins by letting you know the plans eventually fall apart. The trick is learning who all these people are and what role they all have to play. Of course Violet and Corky make an attempt, falling in love/lust in the process. These two women are smart, tough,and cunning, and are well matched against very violent, equally cunning villains. The plot twists and turns in the ways real life does and the tension, set up from the opening sequence, never lets you go.The other remarkable feature of the film is that almost every scene takes place in the two apartments in Violet's building. Yet the direction is such that the space is claustrophobic and expansive, often at the same time. While the film has garnered many comparisons to the dark humor of the Coen brothers, it reminds me more of the harsh but excellent Reservoir Dogs. The violence erupts from circumstance and is brutal, casual, yet not trivial. When Corky takes up a large pipe wrench in defense of Violet, the effect is overpowering.This film has been called a black comedy, but that's an understatement.",Bound
108,Freedomisanillusion,Quite possibly the greatest movie I have ever seen.,10,24 April 2005,"Of all the films I've seen in my sixteen sweet years of existence, none have struck such a chord with me as Bound has.I'd heard of it before in relation to the Wachowski Brothers, but also due to it being one of Christopher Meloni's first film roles. I searched high and low for it, and found it in my video store, much to my delight.Gina Gershon is Corky. Corky has short hair and an attitude, with tattoos that are displayed marvellously by her Singlet tops, or covered by her leather jacket. Factor all these things in with the fact that it's a woman, and you come to one obvious conclusion: Corky is a lesbian. She doesn't do much to hide this fact, nor should she need to.The film opens with a brilliantly filmed single-take of a closet. We descend down into it, passing the clothes on the racks to the shoes on the shelf, down to Corky's unconscious, bound and gagged body.We then flash back to the beginning of the story.Jennifer Tilly is Violet, the woman that Corky so generously holds the elevator door open for. She enters the elevator with Corky, closely followed by Joe Pantoliano, who is Caesar. Caesar is Violet's semi-mobster boyfriend. He works for the mob, but merely stands around watching the dirty work be down by the real mobsters.Corky is moving into the apartment next door to Violet, renovating it as her first job on the outside. She has just served a five year prison sentence. The chemistry between Violet and Corky is instantaneous and electric.As Violet leaves the elevator, Corky watches her walk down the hall, and it seems as though violet is walking in such a provocative way quite on purpose.Before long, Violet has either seduced or been seduced by Corky, depending on how you look at it, and the two have an incredibly strong bond.After being home when a man she has always liked is sadistically tortured and murdered in her bathroom by the mob (including Caesar), Violet decides she wants out of this life.She goes to Corky with the proposition of stealing the (upwards of) 2 million dollars that the mob has obtained, and Caesar is keeping for safe keeping, all the time pinning the blame on someone else.Christopher Meloni is Johnnie Marzonne, son of the mob boss, and rival of Caesar. Johnnie flirts endlessly with Violet, much to Caesar's chagrin, so he seems an obvious choice to pin the blame on.Of course, such a brilliant plan must go wrong somehow, and the two women must deal with the kinks in their scheme.' To tell you anymore would be to ruin the film, something I will never intentionally do. Needless to say, I loved this movie.The plot is intricate and so very clever, and the acting is superb. Gina Gershon exudes copious amounts of sex appeal, while Jennifer Tilly is pitch perfect as Violet, the girl who's not anywhere near as ditzy as they thought.Joe Pantoliano is also good, acting out the swings from ultra panic to blind rage with tremendous ability.Christopher Meloni (who I find it hard to say a bad word about anyway) is also great as Johnnie: playing the half-wit son of the mob boss without making it a clichéd caricature.The Wachowski Brothers pay a tremendous amount of attention to detail, and I wonder just how long they spent planning each shot of the film. It's a beautifully filmed piece of art.Of course, the film relies heavily on the relationship between Corky and Violet, and I've heard a lot of ridicule form people despising the (rather explicit) lesbian sex scenes.As a sixteen-year-old, I honestly can't complain about the sex scenes, but in all honesty: they are completely pivotal to the story. The film would not have worked the same way as if Violet had been attracted to a man, or vice versa.As Bound finished, I found myself utterly and completely satisfied. An intricately woven, edge-of-your-seat thriller with lavish production design, and moments of genuine humour.The only thing I can complain about is that the film has not made it onto DVD in Australia. But I will be buying it the second it does.Utterly and completely 10 out of 10.Rated R18+ for Medium Level Violence, Medium Level Sex Scenes.",Bound
109,Tyler-Durden,Great film.,9,20 January 2001,"Many people recommended Bound, and now I know why.Everything in this movie is great.

And Joe Pantoliano as Ceasar was great too. All the acting was great.The script was also great. Very good and original story, never seen it before. The way the movie develops is quite good, it never gets boring and something new is always happening. Through the film you get to see how all the 3 main characters think, what's going on through their minds (Gershon, Tilly and Pantoliano), and that's something you don't see a lot, at least not with more than 1 character in a the same film.I can't say it's the best movie I've ever seen, of course, but it's a great film that I'd recommend to anyone. Truly worth watching. 9 out of 10 (being a little generous =) ..",Bound
110,moviestar26,Noir Movie in Gangster genre.,7,23 March 2010,"Prior to the Matrix trilogy, the Wachowski brothers first feature movie was the movie 'Bound', which released in late 1996. Their directorial debut was a fantastic and impressive attempt at a tribute to the noir genre. The camera work and stylish close up shots proved to the audiences that they had the ability to make good movies. What I did not understand was how they ventured in to the sci fi genre with 'Matrix'. Maybe if they continued with this theme they could have had the opportunity to offer great noir movies like the Coen brothers have. Upon viewing this movie I asked myself 'what makes these directors and the movie in particular special ?'. Firstly for a noir movie fan, it has every element present. Greed, betrayal, money and murder. All factors were taken in to consideration. In fact it contains the perfect menu. However if I had the opportunity to add some ideas of my own, I would integrate a few more plot twists in the second half and increase the pace in the first half.As far as the director duo are concerned, there directing techniques and camera angles are brilliant. To direct a movie within a room setting can be a challenging task. So I feel that they are due all the credit they deserve. In terms of plot the movie is not complicated, but straightforward because a plan is made and then implemented. I have to be honest. It was very ingeniously thought out. The Warchowski brothers have wrote a great script. Much of their thoughts and ideas stem from the traditional noirs from the 50s era. Even Jennifer Tilly looked reminiscent of the evil women of the yester years. Her hair style and dresses were evident of this. ***************************SPOLIERS AHEAD********************** Tilly is the girlfriend to money launderer Palantinio. They stay in apartment next door to where Gershon who is a decorator fix it woman. At first glance both women have a liking to one another and it turns in to a relationship. Meanwhile Palantino recovers a large amount of cash from a fellow member that he has to pass on to his boss 'Gino'. Gino has a son by the name of 'Johnny', who Palantino does not get along with. This gives Gershon and Tilly the idea to devise a scheme of taking the money and placing the doubt of Johnny in to the min of Palantino. Their plans works out. Unfortunately Palantino reacts in a unpredictable manner and kills Gino and his son to save himself. Tilly and Gershon predict that he would go on the run however Palantino is persistent to get the money back. After he is unsuccessful he makes over plans that may spill more blood.******************END OF SPOILERS***********************Two factors stay in ones mind after watching the movie. The plot and the performances. Both are truly to the highest standard. They compliment each other very well. The noir theme has been combined beautifully with the backdrop of gangster characters. The black and grey set designs create the appropriate atmosphere and environment of a noir movie. If the movie was shot even in black and white I don't think it would have made much difference. The impact would have been similar. The close up shots are filmed very stylishly and seemed to be the source of inspiration for many of the Matrix movies. The pace of the movie is moderate. However the first half sets the plan in motion therefore it takes time for the movie to get going. After the midway point the movie progresses at a immense speed to satisfying climax. The lesbian context did not have much scope and neither was it core to the lot. But it proved a reason for the story to develop. I for one has not admired the movie just for that element. I can not help but assume that Tarantino may have been inspired to make 'Jackie Brown' after seeing this movie, despite it being based on a novel. The theme is very similar. The 'blame game' factor was also used in an Indian movie from 2003 called 'Boom'. The movie does contain many memorable and iconic scenes. I especially adored the part when Palantino kills Gino and his son. It is truly a nervous moment. As we can sense how Palantino would be feeling at the time. All performances were very good. However I would give special mention to Joe Palantino. He was under the skin in his character and mastered the accent wonderfully. He is the main attraction of the movie. Gina Gershon did not get much scope in the second half. While Jennifer Tilly gives a haunting performance. Any man would not be able to resist her charm and beauty. She played the dangerous woman character fantastically. Overall this is recommended to those who enjoy cinema of this genre. Good performances and a witty plot make for enjoyable viewing.",Bound
111,tonopah6,*Nice mobsters get no respect,4,21 September 2002,"Pretty fair acting . . . I'd have to admit. John Ryan was the best to see. But . . . what's all the hype about ??? This movie is no great adventure; it's filmed in either an apartment or a bar. There have been other devious women movies that were better. Much better! 'The Last Seduction' puts 'Bound' to shame. So just because lesbianism is involved (which there really wasn't much of when it comes to actual contact) should not make this a special movie. In no way should 'Bound' be rated above a 6 out of 10 for its genre, and that's being generous.",Bound
112,ftyl,Without a doubt their second best film,7,12 May 2008,"Are they still brothers? Did Larry Wachowski ever become Linda? Anyway, this slick, smart thriller may not be exactly feminist but it certainly plays with our standard notions about the genre. The conceit seems relatively incidental- replace the young male lover with another woman- but infuses the film with a atmosphere of minor taboo-breaking that works in it's favour. More significantly, Bound is the movie that introduced the Wachowski's to the world. Up until 2003, believe it or not, this was considered to be a very good thing. Let's try to remember that, before the overwrought ostentation of The Matrix Reloaded and the bilious sludge of Revolutions they made a couple of good films. So go rent Bound and The Matrix and have a Wachowski retrospective because, judging by early accounts of Speed Racer they may never make another film worth seeing...",Bound
113,witness-7,Entertaining in spite of itself,6,26 August 2002,"The plot and the acting manage to save what could have easily been a cult favorite for mockery. The storyline adds solid suspense, the cast is excellent, and there are cinematic moments of Wachowski fame.However, the dialog is abysmal, over-the-top, and dripping with blunt hyperbole. The Wachowski brothers seem to have learned everything they need to know about lesbians from letters to Penthouse. What's supposed to be steamy and erotic is marked instead by head trauma with a blunt-force script: there isn't one iota of subtlety (IMO, completely insulting the audience's intelligence) and the dialog makes the B-movie film noir of the 40s seem like natural conversation.That said, the movie ultimately saves itself from these flaws overall. The mob stars are all excellent, and Tilly's and Gershon's characters manage to make you look beyond your eye-rolling over their interactions.",Bound

118,nbfcblog,Arguably the Wachowski's Best Film,10,25 January 2018,"It's a shame that when most people talk about the Wachowski's masterful debut these days, it's in reference to the impressively graphic lesbian sex scene, which only lasts about 2 minutes of the actual screen time.That is too bad because Bound is not only a sincerely effective lesbian romance tale, but it's also a great Hitchcockian thrill-ride that benefits from great performances (Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon and Joe Pantoliano).Even though their next film (The Matrix) would help the siblings explode onto the pop culture landscape and started them on the path towards making large budget special effects spectacles; this small but meticulously-crafted neo-noir exploration of characters who each feel trapped within their own lives exceeds them all in terms of story-telling and emotional resonance.Check it out!",Bound
119,beedebee,Not bad for two college drop-outs!!!,10,20 September 2001,"The Wachowski's first outing before they would be propelled to the A-list with 'the Matrix' is one entertaining, sexy thriller. Simple in its setup, basically it feels like you're watching a play, with only a couple of locations and speaking parts.Jennifer Tilly - the one with the voice - plays Voilet, plaything of mobster Ceasar (the always impeccable Joe Pantoliano), who hooks up, in more than one way, with the plumber next door in a scheme to get their hands on some serious mob cash. Added touch, the plumber is played by Gina Gershon -yes, the one with the lips.A great screenplay, virtuoso cameratricks (following the phoneline with incoming calls is but one that comes to mind), slick performances and a real sense of suspense when to two women play out their dangerous game make this one of the most impressing debuts out there.",Bound

121,ca_dale,"Love, deception, betrayal, and blackmail, woven to together in an always tense, always unpredictable tapestry",8,15 January 2007,"Bound revolves around the plot of two women; Violet (Jennifer Tilly), and Corky (Gina Gershon), to con a local mobster; Caesar (Joe Pantoliano), out of a huge stash of stolen money. Violet is Caesar's long time mistress, Corky is a recently released ex-con, doing renovation work in the apartment next to theirs. Violet is distraught by the dark life she has been thrust into and seeking a way out begins a secret relationship with Corky. After learning that Caesar is holding nearly two million dollars in transit to his bosses, the two devise an elaborate plan to steal it, pin the theft on Caesar, and escape clean with the cash.And this is where the film really takes off. We are treated to a barrage of events intent on upsetting the plan. From an apartment shoot-out to a surprise visit from the cops, the film is relentless in drawing you in and grasping your attention.Acting is top notch. Pantoliano's portrayal of Caesar after he realizes that his money is gone is just brilliant. His progression from panicked and irrational, to plotting and methodical as he tries to make sense of what has happened and plan his next move comes across perfectly. It's gradual and realistic, something you have to see for yourself to truly appreciate. Tilly also gives an excellent performance as Violet. Underneath Violet's seemingly fragile and comforting exterior she is cunning, mysterious, and complex. Her subtle manipulation of Caesar's emotions throughout the second half of the film is so convincing, you would almost start to believe her yourself if you didn't know better. Gershon generally does a good job as Corky; I just wish she'd been given more screen time in the second half of the film to further develop the character. Once the plan is in action she just sort of disappears for the last third. Numerous secondary characters add to the mix, the most endearing of which has to be Johnnie (Christopher Meloni) the brash and obnoxious son of Caesar's boss.One of the other great appeals of the film is the Wackowski brothers' terrific camera work (the same guys who would go on to do the Matrix films). Their intense zooms and frequent use of slow motion add greatly to the suspense and tension as events play out.All said and done Bound offers a great combination of suspense, characters, and aesthetic. If you want an engaging thriller with lots of twists and turns, for my money you can't do much better. A word of caution though, Bound contains some extremely graphic moments. One scene in particular involving a man being beaten and tortured in a bathroom is especially brutal. Make sure you have a strong stomach.You've been warned!",Bound
122,dodgee_69,Well made crime thriller with lesbians...,8,3 June 2005,"A well written, well directed and well thought out crime thriller where two lesbians attempt to rip off the Mob for $2million. This is the sort of film that is very easy to do badly, but the Wachowski's have definitely succeeded where many others would of failed. Excellent performances from Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly and especially Joe Pantoliano as the maniacal Caesar, ensure that this is a film worth watching. Full of suspense, Mafia torture and a generally highly entertaining narrative, the film simply tells an enjoyable story. The setting never changes from the apartment building our lead characters live in, and yet the film is packed with juicy dialogue, tense one-on-one scenes and a tasty ending that will make you think twice about the 'lesbian crime' genre.The sex scenes never become gratuitous and are only at the beginning, acting as a sort of comical relief from the tense, bloody and gunshot riddled events that take place in the second half of the film. Perhaps not for everyone, but an excellent film to watch on a night in with friends.",Bound
123,junecatpower,10 out of 10! Perfect!,10,4 September 2004,"Bound is a sexy, stylish and suspenseful modern visitation to the film noir genre that emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. Right from the outset - where the letters of the film's name cast deep dark shadows like high-rise buildings - the viewer is inducted into a world where duplicity is the norm and where choices maderesult in prices being paid. And with over $2 million of Mob money at stake, the risk to life and limb is very high indeed. Violet is a latter-day gangster's moll looking for a way out of 'the business'. Her chance comes when her boyfriend, Ceasar, brings home a fortune in cash to besorted and collated before being passed on to the Chicago Mafia. She seducesthe tough-talking ex-con who is renovating the next-door apartment (animpressively butch Gina Gershon) and together they scheme to relieve the Mobof the money. But when Ceasar doesn't react according to plan, suddenly there are dead bodies to deal with and events begin to spiral out of control. Thewomen's trust in each other is stretched to breaking point as they are drawn into a deadly battle of wits. Directors Larry and Andy Wachowski make judicious use of the conventions offilm noir, such as extensive chiaroscuro, and some imaginative anduncomfortable extreme close-up shots. The clever cinematography is backed upby a tension-laden script and an excellent cast (particularly Joe Pantoliano as the increasingly frenzied Ceasar). Although Bound may take some viewers outof their comfort zone with its graphic lesbian sex scene (which I LOVE!) anddepiction of Mob torture tactics, it is a film that will reward its audience with a stylish and intelligent foray into the eternally murky confluence of good and evil.",Bound

But as I watched it more and more, I finally managed to really appreciate the whole thing. It's a very sexual, provocative gangster movie with great talent by awesome actors, especially the three main ones. Jennifer Tilly plays the lead role in the film as Violet, a bisexual femme fatale and the girlfriend of a gangster. She strongly lusts after Corky(Gina Gershon), her tough lesbian ex con neighbor now working as a plumber. Joe Pantoliano portrays Caeser, Violet's mobster boyfriend. The two women start plotting a way to get 2 million dollars from the Mafia and set up Caeser for Violet to have a fresh start and move away from the violence in her and her crooked boyfriend's lives. Larry and Andy Wachowski's directional debut is far from boring, it's a cult classic! I really enjoyed watching it as I enjoyed watching The Matrix and its sequels. I also have to say that Joe Pantoliano's performance in this film was really captivating, genuine and superb. The rest of the cast was brilliant too. If you want to see a good film with Joey Pants acting out, I definitely recommend this film.",Bound

It has a compelling story, great acting and great characters.Normally I dislike movies that feature criminals as protagonists, but Bound does a fine job with its leads. While we do sympathise with Corky and Violet, it never glamorises the fact that they are both on the wrong side of the law, or makes it look like 'it's fun to be a lawbreaker', or anything like that. Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly both do an amazing job, portraying very interesting characters. The love-making scene is very good; I dislike movies with gratuitous nudity, but I don't mind if it's used to help further a story as it is here.Plus, I support GLBT rights, so any film with gay/lesbian main characters that are treated with respect deserves praise.

127,ProfessorMovieMovie,Excellent All The Way Through,10,12 November 2005,"A top notch noir type suspense movie starring Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon and Joe Pantalioni. Stylistically filmed with a thorough script and great acting. Sure there are a few mafia type clichés in the story but the acting, pacing, editing and overall story more than make up for the one or two flaws this film may have.I think this film has become a sort of cult favorite because of the steamy sex scenes between the two female stars but that is not all this picture has going for it. There is a good suspense story here. Who is telling the truth? Who is lying? Who can be trusted? What will happen next? Tilly and Gershon were both fabulous as Violet and Corky new lovers who scheme to steal money from a powerful mob boss. But it is Pantalioni's over the GED, Cesar, who is my favorite. As he races to figure out what the hell is going on and to keep from getting caught up and killed, he is driven into a desperate frenzy that is great to watch the actor build up to.Really, this film does not disappoint from beginning to end (which is a bit predictable but still appropriate) and if you like any of the actors, suspense movies and great cinematography then this is a film for you.Not as violent as most of the newer movies of this genre but still a bit bloody. Not recommend for those who do not like any violence at all.",Bound

But ""Bound"" is more cruel and ruthless one, the characters doesn't show a bit of solace for their deeds; whether they shot the head of the mafia on whom you work, whether you kill your husband - the pistols fly shamelessly. The story is very enjoyable and keeps you in tension during the whole film. ""Bound"" is also visually impressive, it has good interieurs and fantastic camera work. The cast is the ""everyone in its right place"" case though most of the actors have never had such strong roles as in this one.

The plot itself is slow to get off the ground, and I felt my interest waning a great deal. The turning point for me was the scene between Corky and Violet where they iron out the details of their plan.  Admittedly, a scene like this is a cheap and easy way to advance a plot, but I've always felt the Wachowski's were better directors than they were writers, and the direction of this scene saves it.After this, it's non-stop intrigue all the way. My criticisms would be that the dialogue was cheesy at times, and Jennifer Tilly's husky voice gets annoying after a while (do you think she always talks like that? You can't imagine her speaking like that to a bank clerk, for instance)But all things considered, this is a good film. Not a great one, but not a poor one either.

144,luke-283,Bound for Obscurity,3,22 September 2006,"this movie is not for everyone, but judging from the reviews submitted here at IMDb it has obviously attracted a cult following. by collecting more than 14,000 votes and thus garnering a 7.+ rating, i thought Bound might be a hidden gem.the combination of slick visuals and the dynamics of the lesbian relationship are obviously responsible for a lions share of the votes. and i agree the Wachowski bros did reasonably well on their first major big screen project. but i don't feel the plot was anything extraordinary. the love triangle/renege combo has been done many times by any number of writers so there was nothing new there.there was sufficient on-screen chemistry between Gershon and Tilly but it didn't carry beyond the sexual attraction of the two characters. and after a while the soft, low, growl of Tillys voice got on my nerves.as the male lead Joe Pantoliano really pulled his weight in this film. his frequent small screen roles tend to pigeon hole him as a TV character type. but, alas, he wont be remembered for for his role here because this film is...Bound for Obscurity",Bound
145,droide,Could have been really good,7,20 September 2013,"Nice movie, stylish, atmospheric. The movie is about love, friendship, and it is believable. It's a rather typical crime story, the usual ""italiano-money-mafia""-trash. Pathetic at that - most movies are about crime, pistols and violence. So it is hard to find a good one, 98% of these movies are just trash. But I really would like to give this one up to 10 points! Alas! There are more than three points of mistakes (I am aware of (and not really sober at that)) or obviously constructed and stupid twists. It is such a pity. I think someone in the future, let's say in the next 30 years, will cut this film anew, and we will have real fun. This film could be a classical movie, and I hope will be made into, but this version lacks of faith into the consumers.

150,BobbiCrow,Perfect Noir Film- loved it!,10,29 January 2006,"Late last night I caught 'BOUND'on the Independent Film Channel, and am still thinking about this film, shot in Red, White, and Black which further underlined the noir nature. Gina Gerson and Joe Pantoliano were memorable, as was everyone else- even the two policemen who come to check things out, having received a call about gunshots having been overheard. Clever, funny, occasionally sexy, but it hold your attention as the story unfolds and introduces many story lines. Unfortunately I am NOT a fan of Jennifer Tilly- her voice is like fingernails on a blackboard to me- but she was perfect for this role.The final scene was perfect, and I didn't see it coming, which always pleases me. Check it out- you'll be glad you did.",Bound
151,guox0032,As good as it gets.,9,11 October 2001,"I was totally amazed by this movie for 2 reasons.  The first reason is the chemistry between the 2 female characters, Corky and Violet (played by Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly).  They are terrific together, the scene which Violet seduces Corky is unbelievably hot. There is no doubt that this is the best performance of Gershon and Tilly. It is easily the best seduction scene of all time, and it is between 2 women, so I guess it makes it even more special.   But that's not all, the movie is not about a romantic story between 2 women as the opening 20minutes might have indicated, instead the plot moves on and becomes a thriller.  Corky and Violet have to steal $2million from Violet's mob boyfriend.  There are a lot twists and surprises in the movie, and it is well constructed.  The bound between the 2 women getting stronger and tighter during the movie, it really makes you care for them as the movie goes on.  There is another movie called The Last Seduction, which evolves seduction, a lot of money and woman and man who all want it. The Last Seduction is about as smart movie as the Bound, but the difference is after you watches The last Seduction you probably have a bitterness left in the mouse, on the contrary all Bound leaves you behind is sweetness. One of my favorite movies of all time. 10/10",Bound

I loved  how they showed the relationship between the two women (not because of the sex scene I'am not that sad but it was great). My favorite scene in the movie is when Jennifer Tilly shots Joe Pantolaino and I just love  how the blood goes together with the white paint. I like  how the two women robb the money and Joe is accusing everyone and shooting everyone. The point of this comment is just to say Ilove this movie.This was the Waschoski brothers first film  directing and I think they have done it brilliant and I can't wait till their third film of directing comes out( Matrix Reloaded ).

Not only are the two central characters dripping with sex appeal they are also superbly portrayed and swimming in detail that is matched only by the quality of the screenplay and its direction. The plot, a string of endless complexities and twists, is brilliantly executed through the energy and pace that is generated. The simplicity of the set allows these intricate details to live. I would have enjoyed this film even with out the gay content, as it is, what a lovely bonus! Gina you inspire me. It is so refreshing to see this movie be so mainstream. Corky's proud!",Bound
154,U-turn,A-MA-ZING,9,22 April 1999,"This is probably one of the best movies I have seen lately. Because of this movie, I found out I kinda like the film-noir genre, but I am aware that there are less than a few better noirs than this one. At first I thought I had accidentally rented a solely lesbian movie. Jennifer Tilly is seducing Gina Gershon which results (as it always does) in steamy sex. But then suddenly the plot twists and, from that moment on, I was curious about what would be happening next. Even through the end titles I just couldn't stop watching. Jennifer Tilly is a mediocre actress with an awful voice. But I guess it's the voice that makes her so popular, and special. She also has a nice body, so I guess the combination voice-body has persuaded the people in Hollywood to give her this role. Gina Gershon is absolutely fabulous. I thought she would look like a showgirl again, but she is SOOOO convincing as a lesbian. And I just kept looking at her mouth, it's so special. Someone who is also able to give a stunning performance is Joe Pantoliano, someone I had never heard of. At the beginning, he seems a bit awkward, like this isn't his type of movie. But as his character gradually develops, he becomes fascinating as Caesar, the minor but very smart mob guy.In conclusion : great, go see it, now! And notice the stylish things the Wachowski brothers do with the cameras. My favourite piece is when Violet (Tilly) is calling Corky (Gershon). They follow the telephone wire from Violet's phone to Corky's phone (which is in the apartment next to it) and then Corky's phone starts to ring. They must have got so many great ideas concerning movie making! It's a 9 out of 10 for me. But that's actually not fair, because no movie will ever get the 10 anymore since I've seen Scream. OK, make it a 9.5.",Bound

The comedy comes in several places, e.g. when the male main character Caesar litterally white washes and irons money for the mafia.

161,taxidriver_448,"Clever, tense, heart-stopping caper thriller",9,6 January 2005,"Having seen the Matrix Trilogy, I was very interested to see Bound, the film that the Wachowskis made in order to receive funding for said trilogy. And there are quite a few similarities with the Matrix here: roving birds-eye view camera angles, uncompromising violence, an obsession with ringing phones, and of course the awesome and yet criminally-underused Joe Pantoliano.For me, the sheer genius of this film is that about 90% of it takes place in one apartment. This adds a sense of claustrophobia and almost nausea to the already supremely tense second half- reminiscent of David Fincher's Panic Room. For any directors looking to make a film on a low budget, this is the way to go: few locations, few actors, clever use of camera work to make up for lack of overblown action sequences.The film also has a nice balance of sex & violence while still managing to engage fully in the characters. By the end of the film, I didn't know who I sympathised with most: Violet, the Gangster's moll who just wants out; Cesar, her mafia boyfriend who is not really a bad guy at all, just caught up in a dangerous situation he didn't create but must get out of; or Corky, the tough ex- con who is trying to get her life back together and escape with the woman she loves.The violence is also brilliantly executed. A torture scene involving finger- chopping beats Denzel Washington's similar efforts in Man on Fire any day, and is a rival for that wave of nausea and tension so perfectly exemplified in the ear-chopping scene of Reservoir Dogs. The key is that the directors show you enough to know what's going on, but leave the really gory details to your imagination (infinitely more powerful than anything that can be shown on screen).I suppose the only real criticism I have of Bound is that the first half drags a little, and is relatively empty content-wise. All it does is establish the relationship between the three characters, which is easy to understand and can be explained in ten minutes of film: Violet digs Corky, Corky digs Violet, Violet doesn't dig Cesar, Cesar digs Violet, Corky has no feelings either way about Cesar, and Cesar thinks Corky's a flaming dyke. Simple. Not sure it needed half an hour of obvious flirting and a dodgy softcore lesbian sex scene to tell the story.Once the con is on though, Bound becomes a heart-stopping, white knuckle ride of a caper film, made infinitely more tense by the realisation of what will happen to our heroes if the sh*t hits the fan.For fans of the original Matrix's stylish yet gritty urban feel, and the well- managed tension of Neo's escape from the matrix, this film is for you.",Bound

Gina and Jennifer Tilly were great together and had some chemistry. the story: in this film you have too feel sorry for Ceaser, he tried so hard to be the good guy. But i guess when a guy like Ceaser gets screwed over by his own girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilley) with her dykey lover Corky (Gina Gershon) you can understand why he gets upset. Poor guy killed a big part of the mafia because of that girl. Corky and Violet crew Ceaser out of $2million Ceaser thought it was one of his partners Johnnie so he killed him and a lot of others too. Then he realised it's was Violet, but too late. The best lines from this film are: "" Wake up you fxxing dyke"" ""I can see again""",Bound

Even Pantoliano did this role much better in The Sopranos - I really don't see what folks are getting so excited about. In fact, I would much rather have watched any episode of that show, than this mediocre movie. The first Matrix movie had its moments, but all the Wachowski movies before and since are b movies at best.

I felt that this film was trying to push the envelope and that does not necessarily make for good film making.First you are introduced to the heroes of this movie who turn out to be a lesbian pair, unusual and unexpected.  Second come the scenes of torture where the tormentors ""creatively"" use normally innocuous household items. The visual cruelty was just too much and we had to turn off the movie.

167,sonyalynn,"Unique, taut, sexy, and a Top 5(tm) flick for me!",10,4 November 2002,"I gave this one the full 10, despite slight niggling critiques of the slightly uneven acting (mostly from Gina Gershon).The Wachowskis made their name with this movie, and with many good reasons! First, it wasn't a ""lesbian film""...not that I have any problem with those, being a lesbian and all, but it was nice that the Corky character could just as easily have been a man with slight rewriting (a little more initial suspicion from Cesar, a few testosterone-soaked threats to the effect of ""my property"", etc., etc.). The plot came first, the lesbianism second, but for that, it was still well done!And how do you write a convincing story of burgeoning lesbian lust when you're two boys? Simple, you hire Susie Bright (aka Susie Sexpert, aka the founding editor of On Our Backs) as a ""lesbian consultant"", and even give her a cameo! How often these simple solutions seem to elude us...although I also have to agree with lesbian critics who found Corky not nearly ""butch"" enough. A sop to the boys? Perhaps...but as a femme-loving femme myself, I liked her better that way, anyhow.Toss in the tight plot, the notes of desperation and stress being hit just right, outrageously good cinematography, and the sheer, sultry sex-kitten-with-a-twist quality that you never would have believed could have actually come from Jennifer Tilly, and you have a true original worthy of the best collections.And *such* a satisfying ending!SEE...THIS...MOVIE!!!",Bound

There is some great acting and Joe Pantoliano is superb as Caesea.You can really appreciate some of the camera work and the opening shot is just so puzzling till you realise what you're seeing. Being a Wachowski brothers film also makes this something special, especially being pre-matrix.

177,jillyjo1,Completely cheesy,3,21 February 2004,"Admittedly, I started watching this movie with high expectations, on a recommendation from a friend. And that's one less friend to ask for movie advice, because this movie was one big cliche.  This was the directing debut of the Wachowski Brothers, but if you want to see their best work, go rent the first Matrix.  This film was not their writing debut, however, I think Wachowski fans would be even more upset to realize that their first screenplay was the dud Assassins in 1995.)One of the worst aspects of this film is its cinematography, which is downright pornographic. There are so many close-ups you feel like the cameramen employed are severely near-sighted.The sex scenes are undeniably hot, but the characters are dull and simplistic cliches.  Not one character is well-developed or intellectually intriguing. Also, the lead performances were comparable to those of students in a high school play, the only exception being that of Joe Pantoliano, who plays one role over and over, but plays it well.Yet, with all of its problems, I would say the worst aspect of this film is the cheesy dialogue, especially that which takes place in the bedroom. I often found myself laughing at moments that were meant to be serious and soul-searching just because the lines being spoken were so ludicrous.  At points the dialogue was so cliche-filled I found myself wondering if the entire movie was meant to be farcical. Sadly, it was not.
While I have been thoroughly panning this movie, I have to concede that it is entertaining, and keeps your attention for its entire duration. The clever plot spirals in all sorts of directions. However, if you feel like seeing a GOOD film, look elsewhere.",Bound
178,jhaneyzz,Ok fanboys and girls hold your stars,6,15 May 2021,"6.3 at best.A really solid sophomore film for budding greats but far from a masterpiece...Slightly heavy handed but very competent directing of a solid, uncompromising script.",Bound
179,PandoraLady,Cheers for lesbian romance,9,22 April 2012,"Whichever critical or analytical angle you look at Bound by the Wachowski brothers, it is a film that is quite successful in each realm it chooses to represent. The film spans across the lesbian and thriller genre, which in part may have contributed to the film's widely acclaimed success upon release in the late nineties. Bound's ability to fluctuate beautifully between genres enhances the film's appeal, but perhaps the more critical film viewer felt as if Bound was less of a thriller, and more of a tale of prohibited romance between Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). It is in this way, as a lesbian film, that I wish to discuss elements of the film. The film's title itself represents a double meaning. To be bound to something, unable to be free or obtain a more personal self-freedom, is a defining factor in the film. In a heteronormative society that functions on social stereotypes and condemnable taboos, lesbian romance is literally bound to social constructionism. This is a pessimistic view of the film, but still remains to be a defining element in any ""controversial"" film to be considered and evaluated. Other than social normativity as a restriction for Corky and Violet's relationship, Violet's mobster boyfriend Caesar acts as a physical and mental barrier for Violet. Violet is bound to Caesar and the ""business"" in which he deals. She struggles to escape from his grip. In the first half of the film where Caesar's character is not present, Corky and Violet are able to flourish together in his absence. Yet, his presence becomes inherently violent and threatening whenever Violet stresses that she will leave him. Violet is unable to fulfill this promise without Corky. The more positive aspect to the film's title is that the Wachowski brothers reinforce a positive future for Corky and Violet. They are bound to one another, and are bound to escape (together) a dark, violent, and restrictive world forced upon them by Caesar and his mobster affiliates. While previously restrictive elements jeopardized their romantic relationship (not to mention getting away with the $2 million), Corky and Violet were predestined or bound to have a life together. Caesar, the mobsters, or the two lone, prison-like apartments in the film are unable to break this bond between Corky and Violet that can be seen in the very beginning of their journey.Gershon and Tilly function together brilliantly on screen, channeling just the right amount of sexual tension in a precisely calculated situation requiring trust, a vital element to any relationship. Gershon first appears to be rather fluid in her sexuality, at certain points the filmmakers seem to imply this ambiguous sexuality in her character. As viewers, we assume she is attracted to both men and women, even though we never see her interact sexually or flirtatiously with a man. Even in the bar scene, Gershon seeks out a female companion for the night but is denied by outside influences (the cop). Gershon's physically referred to as a ""dike"" or the embodiment of the masculine female. On the other hand, Tilly is quite the opposite, but finds Gershon's character to be enticingly attractive. Perhaps the seemingly heterosexual Violet seeks the thrill of being with Corky because it is ""forbidden"" in her reality to venture outside Caesar's apartment and out of his bed. Despite how initial attraction was conceived, Corky and Violet's romance is evidence of a heroic effort to overcome external forces that would otherwise criticize and scrutinize a romance such as theirs, which is ultimately more successful than any heterosexual relationship seen in the film.",Bound
180,phoenixoscura,On my top 5 list....,10,23 July 2004,"In my personal opinion, Bound is one of the most intelligent and erotic films ever made. It's not often that you see both of those words describing the same work of art.I don't feel that the relationship between Corky and Violet is something that you should have to ""get past"" being that the tone of the film is that of escape (hence the title ""Bound"") and the very nature of their relationship upholds that idea. However if you are less open-minded regarding your own sexuality or completely homophobic, the scattered and brief exchanges between the two leading characters may not settle well with you. One of the best things about the film is the cinematic detail, all the little disturbing and intriguing things that the Wachowskis chose to hone in on...If you are a fan of The Matrix films, you'll really get to see where it all started with Bound.I could rattle on forever about the pure genius of the film and that of the Wachowski Brothers but I won't.
