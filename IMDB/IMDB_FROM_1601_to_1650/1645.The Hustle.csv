0,SnoopyStyle,not funny,4,18 October 2020,"Penny Rust (Rebel Wilson) is a con woman who steals from sexist men. Josephine Chesterfield (Anne Hathaway) is a sophisticated hustler conning the rich from her French Riviera villa. The town is not big enough for the both of them. They make a bet on tech billionaire Thomas Westerburg (Alex Sharp).This is a remake of 1988's Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. The problem is that it does achieve any comedic takeoff. Rebel continues to play the same character over and over again. Anne Hathaway does not crack a smile or delivers a smile to the audience. At its core, these characters are not funny. It actually improves slightly with them fighting over Thomas and Rebel achieves humanity when she tries to play it straight with him. The movie is almost good for that section but it's not enough.",The Hustle
1,boblipton,Funny Remake Of DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS,6,5 February 2020,"High-class con artist Ann Hathaway agrees to take on grifter Rebel Wilson as a trainee. When she pays off the rest of her crew on a job, Miss Wilson is left out, because she's still a student. When Rebel objects that she capable, they agree that whoever can take app billionaire Alex Sharp for half a million wins the argument.In 1964, writers Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning co-wrote BEDTIME STORY, which wasn't terribly successful, as co-stars Marlon Brando and David Niven trod on the comedy. It's been remade three times, including as the highly successful DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS. in this one, the genders have been switched, and under director Chris Addison, it's quite funny...although not much has been added to it, except for the updating.Paul Henning only wrote two movies, both of them with Shapiro. He was much more prolific as a writer and producer for CBS's country comedies in the 1960s. He died in 2005, aged 93.",The Hustle
2,nogodnomasters,Medusa,8,27 May 2019,Penny (Rebel Wilson) is a small scale catfishing hustler. While traveling she meets Josephine Chesterfield (Anne Hathaway) a high-end hustler. Penny becomes her apprentice as they scam rich men. Their relationship tends to be on the love-hate side as they set a mark and enter into a competition.While the two had good chemistry it was far from Bullock-McCarthy. I wish they had led into the main scam with better and longer scams other than the constant crazy sister act. But that requires clever writing. I liked the 60's style animated opening credits.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.,The Hustle
3,kosmasp,Year of the (female) Hustlers,6,25 September 2019,"Well with this and the one that Jennifer Lopez is starring in one might have a point to make. All kidding aside though, having two charismatic leads like Hatheway and Wilson helps and elevates this movie a lot. Not everything is predictable I reckon, but most of it at least.The jokes are nice and the flow of the movie works out great with the leads. So go with that flow and just enjoy this easily digestible comedy",The Hustle
4,tavm,The Hustle was a pretty good comedy vehicle for Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson,6,4 February 2020,"When my mom saw the movie Hustlers with Jennifer Lopez, she originally thought it was this one and was disappointed it wasn't. So now that we've both seen this one called The Hustle, she liked this one better. Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson are pretty funny with their con artist roles though they're more highly amusing than truly hilarious. I know this was a remake of Bedtime Story and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels but I've yet to watch either of those. Maybe sometime soon...",The Hustle
5,studioAT,Weak remake,1,15 September 2019,"With two likable leads this remake of 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' had everything going for it.However, once you watch it you almost can't believe what you're seeing.This is poor, I'm sorry, because I imagine this was well intentioned, but it is. Joke after joke is poor, and even the charms of both leads can't carry it.",The Hustle
6,CinemaSerf,Hard to find the words... it's awful!,4,6 January 2020,"A totally class-free remake of ""Bedtime Story"" that is both vulgar and crass. All it needed was a little bit of subtlety and it could have been quite a fun role-reversal caper; instead it is clumsy and cringe-makingly unsophisticated. No amount of glamorous location photography can make it any less so. I never leave the cinema half way through a film, but was sorely tempted with this nonsense.",The Hustle
7,writers_reign,On Your Marks,5,18 May 2019,"It is - or it certainly should be by now - a given that Hollywood is totally incapable of remaking a movie and equalling let alone eclipsing the original so if you must check out a remake keep that in mind. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels was made 24 years after Bedtime Story which it rip - sorry, remade. In other words there was a good chance that the original audience for Bedtime Story no longer went to movies when Dirty Rotten Scoundrels was released in 1988. Similarly The Hustle has been released some 31 years after Dirty Rotten Scoundrels so why all the knashing of teeth. As it happens I've seen both Bedtime Story AND Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and have no problem with The Hustle which is essentially Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with tits. Orson Welles isn't going to be turning in his grave and the voting members of the Academy are not likely to be troubled but in terms of a time=passer it's more than adequate.",The Hustle
8,neil-476,Amusing,7,20 May 2019,"Sleek, polished, glamorous Josephine goes head to head with fat, unpolished Penny as they compete for position as scammers in an affluent Mediterranean resort.This comedy is a female-oriented take on the Michael Caine/Steve Martin movie Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. It has garnered moderate criticism, some virulent, on IMDB, but I quite enjoyed it. There is a school of thought which seems to take great exception to any female prominence, let alone headlining a film, let alone let alone headlining a film which was once headlind by men. I'm not one of those - it doesn't worry me.Anne Hathaway plays Josephine with a dodgy upper-class Brit accent which fits in well with her overall dodginess. Rebel Wilson plays, well, Rebel Wilson. You know, fat, crass, knockabout humour with an air of mild sleaze.But the two women are both quite likeable, and there are some funny lines.",The Hustle
9,phd_travel,Can't quite compare but some laughs still,6,23 September 2019,"For fans of the wonderful Steve Martin Michael Caine movie, there are some things stacked against this movie. Firstly the pair aren't Steve Martin and Michael Caine. Not that they don't try hard but they suffer in comparison. Anne hams it up with accents and all. Rebel does a lot of physical comedy here partly successfully. Secondly most who know the story may find it a bit lame. Actually I think the jokes were so good that they still are funny in this movie with the gender switch. Especially after the bet is on.Overall it's still good for a few laughs.",The Hustle
10,DKosty123,Funny Remake And This Is Why,7,15 May 2020,"Granted this is a remake of Dirty Rotten Scondrels and without Steve Martin it's a different flavor. For those of us who know Paul Henning who has writing credit for both films, it is the writing of one of the great humor writers of this era. Henning wrote a lot of sit-coms including the Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres among others. Pauls sense of humor still shows through on this remake even though he's been gone for quite some time. This is a funny movie.Granted Australian Rebel Wilson is a polarizing type of woman. I think of the Peter Faulk line in ""Murder By Death"" when I see Rebel. ""There's nothing like making it with a big blondie waitress."" Her character here reminds me of that line, though there's no murder here. This movie is simply a con job.
The thing is, if you just want to laugh, and do not think of seriously mounting the waitress, this is a funny film. I am too old to be mounting them anyhow.Anne Hathaway is the beauty con, who with a team cons people out of millions of dollars. She sometimes pulls the bait and switch, but she does it with style. Then she meets Wilson whose kind of a lower class of con artists. Then she takes the big one under her wing From there they find the ultimate mark, a Dot millionaire. There's some great humor and some throw away lines along the way.There's no reason not to laugh here. The trademark of Henning's humor is still here to enjoy. While it might be considered a bit below the Martin -Caine version, the 2 ladies here do pretty well. They even stick in an outtake after the credits which is worth a look.",The Hustle

13,inkblot11,"Thank God for Rebel Wilson! She is my new heroine; Hathaway fun, too, in a so-so film",7,14 May 2019,"Penny (Rebel Wilson) is backpacking through France with her ""swindling"" ability. She can fake sad stories and exhort money from disappointed men seeking mates. But, alas, she is not big time. Meanwhile, Josephine (Anne Hathaway) lives in Beaumont Sur Mer, where there is a casino and she knows how to win big money through deception. In part, its due to her police officer friend and loyal butler Albert who, when Jo is successful, get their cuts. When Penny and Josephine meet on a train, Jo, who has witnessed Penny grifting a dinner and faking her way into first class, tries to convince the blonde lady NOT to disembark in B Sur M. Penny does not to so but is only fooled for a brief while. Eventually, Penny discovers the rich lifestyle that Josephine pursues and WILL NOT LEAVE WITHOUT professional secrets. So, while each dislikes the other mightily, Jo and Penny team up to deceive their way into even more riches. Soon, they learn a naive tech billionaire may be a great mark and they decide to challenge each other for the prize. Who will win? This remake of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels has its charms, mainly from Rebel Wilson. SHE is the new ""it"" gal of comedy and Hollywood should take notice. No matter that the script is so-so, Ms. Wilson can mine gold from pyrite. Ms. Hathaway and the supporting staff are fine, fine as well. Then, too, the viewer will be enchanted with the fabulous sets and costumes!

14,tabuno,Fun and Entertaining Female Remake,7,25 May 2019,"Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson star in this feminine version of Michael Caine and Steve Martin's Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988) comedic grifters movie. Along with Heartbreakers (2001) starring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt, The Hustle offers up the sophisticated and the crude approaches to pilfering off the mostly unsuspecting male of the species. We have had the female Ghostbusters (2016) and the female Ocean's Eight (2018) that also co-starred Anne Hathaway. Anne is back again to bolster the female reign of comedy with an unfortunate accent to her voice that just doesn't quite ring true. But she does get to show off her usual talent for underplayed comedy and a nice diversity of character performances. Rebel Wilson gets to show off her more vulgar behavior like Melissa McCarthy undertook in the comedy crime thriller The Heat (2013) with Sandra Bullock. Somehow Chris Addison manages to keep the mixed personality comedy together where Anne and Rebel scenes come together to retain an acceptable, fluid dynamics without becoming annoyingly repugnant or overly crass. There isn't much new in this female version to Dirty Rotten Scoundrel's and even the ending of The Hustle seems somewhat diminished and derivative. Yet there are moments that shine, especially regarding the innocent mark who provides a good performance. This is an entertaining and fun summer movie that while not in any way really remarkable is competently directly, nicely performed in a risky movie genre oftentimes quite difficult to accomplish well.",The Hustle

16,cruise01,Boring and unfunny.,4,22 August 2019,"The Hustle (2 out of 5 stars).The Hustle is a comedy film that could have been funnier than expected with the leads played by Rebel Wilson and Anne Hathaway. The plot being about them being scam artists and conning man to giving them money or expensive jewelry. Hathaway plays a con artists that scams rich man. And Wilson is a con artists that tries to scam man for 500 dollars. They both team up to try to see who is the best con artist by trying to steal from a young rich guy who creates gaming apps.It could have been funny. However, I feel like most of the laughs usually is in the trailer. While the rest of the movie is just dull and cheesy. It does have two great leads. The script lacks in keeping up with the humor and jokes. It gets boring for most of the movie. The plot is thin. There is a twist which does not leave you surprised at all. The music score is annoying by having a score like the 1960s heist movie.Overall, The Hustle is a bad film. It is not as funny the trailer made out to be. Most of the humor and jokes are shown in the trailer. The story is boring. The direction is cheesy with its music score. Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson are the only positive things about the movie but even they could not save the movie.",The Hustle
17,pennyelenabooks,Not Good Enough,4,12 September 2019,"I guess the movie was just like Hathaway's brittish accent, a bit forced. Although the idea was good and the twist in the ending unpredictable, the movie was not funny for a comedy.",The Hustle
18,TheMovieDiorama,"The Hustle is dirty, rotten and packed full of talentless scoundrels.",1,18 January 2020,"*sigh*...Why do I do this to myself? Stealing seems to be the theme here, and getting away with it whilst attempting to produce hilarity. So it's incredibly ironic that this remake of a remake, which already robbed most of its originality through blatant imitation, hustled the most precious asset that I could ever own. Life. Well, I'm not going to beat around Rebel Wilson's bush. Objectively speaking, The Hustle is categorically one of the worst modern mainstream comedies I've ever had the displeasure of enduring. In fact, it might just be *the* worst. A professional wealthy hustler is forced into recruiting an amateur where their differing skills are put to the test when fleecing a famous app developer.Chris Addison, who is fairly confident in the British comedy circuit, ""directed"" this. And I'm ashamed. There was no direction. At all. Just a series of elongated gags that tested my precious patience before abruptly closing down Netflix, shutting the MacBook and requesting Wilson herself to take it from me. She, yet again, isn't acting. Portraying the same ditzy Australian persona that she has done throughout her entire career. I'm so done with it. Pretending to be blind for half the film in one of the most monotonous performances ever? C'mon! Go away. Hathaway, who I'd like to remind you has won an Academy Award, butchered a plethora of accents in her harsh attempt in being likeable and funny. Woops! Forgot to mention that she, and Wilson, are two of my least favourite actresses working in Hollywood today. They both lack chemistry. They both force themselves to appear on screen. And they both reek of desperation. Urgh!Every line of dialogue from the incomprehensibly woeful screenplay missed the mark so massively, that I had to pause halfway through and check that I was still alive. Painfully unfunny. No seriously, I'm mentally injured. The absence of a cohesive story failed to conduct any electricity within the entirety of this production. Simply put, it was lifeless. From effortlessly stealing from stupid rich men who have zero common sense to bickering amongst themselves due to their background differences. Nothing happened! I can't stress enough that literally zero progress was made within the narrative.Fortunately I expended none of my hard-earned money on this feature, and I feel fantastic. These hustlers couldn't hustle me. I saw right through them. 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' this is not, and with the utmost of confidence, claim that The Hustle is the worst film of last year.",The Hustle
19,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,23 August 2019,"It's pretty much a re-make of ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" which was itself a remake, only this one isn't as good.It's actually just ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" that has been gender swapped and, like all of the gender swapped remakes of late, the humor, the plot, the entire story is wrapped around the fact that the gender has been swapped, and done so without an actual story or humor.It's basically a remake with women and the draw is intended to be that it has women in it this time rather than men... and that doesn't work without a story or actual jokes with punchlines and timing, jokes that divert expectations... not jokes that are revolved around a swap in characters and nothing more.Save your time, it's just like Ghostbusters, What Men Want, Oceans 8 and all the other movies that have done the exact same thing and failed because they lacked an actual story and humor",The Hustle
20,stevendbeard,Unfunny Comedy,4,19 May 2019,"I saw ""The Hustle"", starring Anne Hathaway-Serenity, The Dark Knight Rises; Rebel Wilson-The Pitch Perfect movies, Bridesmaids; Dean Norris-Death Wish_2018, The Big Bang Theory_tv and Douggie McMeekin-Harlots_tv, The Call Up.
This is an unfunny comedy. I like Anne Hathaway but Rebel Wilson is a wild card here; sometimes she is good and sometimes she is not. This is mostly a not and she brings Anne down to her level and it's not good. Rebel is also a producer. The plot is a gender reversed remake of the 1988 Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Anne in the Michael Caine role as the classy con artist and Rebel in the Steve Martin role as a ..... well, not so classy one. Dean and Douggie are a couple of their marks. Anne and Rebel do not get along at first-each thinking the other is cutting in on their territory-but eventually become teammates and work together. The previews of the movie make it look funnier than it really is. FYI: There is a scene after the end credits but it's not funny either.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.
I would not buy this on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it comes to cable.",The Hustle

The movie is full of some lame jokes and bad comic scenes which majorly doesn't create and laughter.Acting apart from Anne Hathaway is average infact Rebel Wilson is too loud in some of the scenes and irritates.

28,rgkarim,"Trying To Rustle Up Some Twists, But Only Hustles That's The Gist",6,13 May 2019,"Buddy comedies are fun, and sometimes turn out to be the movies that become the cultural icons of the generation. Often a bunch of one liners and aggressive comedy that becomes meme worthy and quotable, these movies vary across the spectrum in terms of quality. Nevertheless, these movies do have a place in the mainstream as those fun films that entertain people. So will it achieve its goal and be entertaining, or so aggressively silly that it robs you of your money? That's where I come in for a little movie review to give my opinions and maybe help guide your viewing pleasures. Let us take a look at:Movie: The Hustle (2019)Director:
Chris Addison
Writers:
Stanley Shapiro (screenplay by), Paul Henning (screenplay by)
Stars:
Anne Hathaway, Rebel Wilson, Alex SharpLIKES:The Chemistry
Alex Sharp's Character
Attempt At A Story
Short Run Time
Some Humor
MusicSUMMARY:
A buddy comedy requires good chemistry for the actors to utilize, being able to play off one another and maximize the relationship between the characters. Fortunately Rebel and Anne have achieved this dynamic, establishing the dynamic that the trailers suggested which helps maximize the delivery of the plethora of jokes to come. They looked to have had fun and that I believe sells the dynamic between the two. Once Alex Sharp's character came in, his characteristics and direction fit well into the movie, but also helped curb some of the extreme qualities that the movie had the leading ladies pursuing. His delivery and innocence his character contained, made for a character to grab onto by those not a fan of the two leads, and can help get through the tale at hand.
Speaking of that, The Hustle's story from the trailers looks to be a very thread thin, shallow plot about taking advantage of condescending men. Instead, there were some attempts to mix it up a bit and progress it towards new directions that put our characters into uncomfortable zones. A few twists were nicely added, and the push past that simplistic story gets applause in my book. But if the story is not up your alley then two things will grant you some berth in the storm of things this movie holds. First, it's a short run time, so you won't have too long to fend off against the onslaught of jokes and stupidity that is crammed into the film. Your second saving grace is some of the humor actually hits home as well, perfectly timed or expertly delivered to maximize the laughs. Much of this had to do with the comedy that was not too forced, but there are some subtle nods at humor that my dorky humor appreciates. As an added bonus, there are some fun musical tracks that get into the spirit of the scenes and add some edge to the movie or at least make you dance in your seat.DISLIKES:Predictable
Victim of Trailers
Story Failure
Shallow Characters
Too political
Too Aggressive/Forceful for HumorSUMMARY:Despite some of the good this movie did for me, there were some shortcomings that did not quite work for me as they may for other audiences. It starts with the predictability of the tale, primarily in how hard the foreshadowing and attempt to surprise you came. These twists would have probably been successfully executed had there not been such a blatant attempt to misdirect in dialogue and drowning plot elements with the cantankerous humor. In addition, the fact that the trailers revealed so much did not help with hiding the surprises nor keeping the comedy fresh.
In addition to giving away much of the surprise, the movie also failed to deliver the story to me that I was hoping to get out of it. For once, it might have been nice to actually do a mockery of the Ocean's movies by making it all about conning corrupt villains and a central rival to their game. Sadly, their attempts to diverge from this story came out as pale attempts that did not gain the momentum needed to have the impact they needed. Secondly, it's always good for me to have some characters with a little more depth, then what I got here. The Hustle's protagonists have very little in terms of story, characteristics, or qualities outside of what you got from the trailer. I get this is probably some symbolic presentation of con artists, but perhaps more into how they came into the lifestyle, and the driving force could have granted these talented actresses some better roles to bring to life. Perhaps this is why I like Alex Sharp's character, because there is at least some attempts to bring his character some added layers, instead of just a comedic punching bag.
Still those components are not quite the force that took the most away from me in this movie. The first is too political a statement for this film. The writers and direction got a little too femme fatale and preachy for me, with much of the dialog driven down a road that takes away the fun for me. I think it will hit the right audience members, but from a general standpoint some of the aggressive sexism jokes did not quite impress me. Second, the humor is a little too slapstick and force for my tastes. The trailer made some of these jokes stale, but there were times where overacting and pushing that joke over the line or on me just did not set well. As such, I didn't laugh as hard as I had hoped from the trailers and was a bit bored with some of the designed sequences. Again, this comedy will hit its niche audience, but for guys like me, it's not going to be the most clever or unique jokes that present themselves.The VERDICT:If you are expecting the next masterpiece of comedy in this film, you will be disappointed with The Hustle. Yet, if you go in there ready for simplistic comedy, filled with one liners and focused audience and you have got yourself the flick of the weekend. It's got some good points and great chemistry, jamming it's all its gimmicks into a short run time to entertain very quickly. However, if you are looking for something like Bridesmaids with heart, cleverness, and entertainment, then reserve this one for a home viewing in my opinion. My scores are:Comedy: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0",The Hustle
29,Kamurai25,Did...did I get Hustled?,6,9 June 2020,"Decent watch, could watch again, but hard to recommend.This really feels like two movies (more than just multi-threaded stories) that severely clash with each other. Those with a talent for writing might say that's done on purpose to accent something, like a message. I'm just not sure if that message is that women should destroy other women for the sake of men's attention, that they should support each other instead of the first, that they should destroy each other instead of the first as they're the superior sex, or regardless of sex, industry, profession, or status: there is always someone with enough in common that you can work together.Its a decently funny movie, on both the Anne Hatheway and the Rebel Wilson side. Its also terrifying that there really are sociopaths like these characters.I'd still think this is a missed opportunity to do two movies that crossover in one story line (it wouldn't have to be the Hustle-verse). I think either movie focused on the style of either actress would work better than what we got by compromising between the two styles.",The Hustle

31,vengeance20,"In All Honesty, It Wasn't That Bad.",5,11 May 2019,"Seen this tonight & was expecting a female empowered man hating mess of a film if Ghostbusters or Oceans 8 were anything to go by...But surprisingly the film wasn't all that bad. I mean, I still dislike the underlying fact that the reason this was made was to a have man hating, 3rd wave feminists put down men in for the sake of reversed sexism & political correctness.I haven't seen the male version of this film, but I'm pretty sure that the reason for hustling in that film wasn't about opposite hating exploiting & corrupt empowerment for the sheer hell of it and that men are bad, stupid ""all the same!"" & women are clever, better & perfect. This film unfortunately has a couple of jokes & lines about the very subject which I despise.The story was simple enough & easy to follow which is great. The film however did drag a bit for the last half, but was surprising with the twist at the end which made me like this film more than I would've. The ending was half & half, but way more satisfying than that of Oceans 8 which sucked arse.The actors were alright too, but the dialogue was diabolical. The film was enticing enough & had some funny moments.Overall the film wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. The reason for making this was clearly political & made to hate on men & bash them for the sake of it. But on the other hand the film had some surprising moments & twists I didn't see coming.

35,michaeltrivedi,"Bad, but watchable",3,29 November 2019,"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is top notch entertainment in my opinion. It's basically a perfect picture, though it has problems somewhere inside the story and viewing. This is a remake of that, and a very very weak one at that. But like all comedies, I got a kick out of it for what measly comedy it could give me.The Hustle is about two con artists. One is wealthy and works with rich people. The other is conniving and small time, and her crowd is the same. The latter wants to work with the former. So a teaching sessions begins. When the small time crook finds she's not getting paid, she puts a challenge about the first person who could con $500k out of a tech billionaire. And the show goes on.It's not a good movie. Even as I am writing this, I remember how bad it is. Anne Hathaway even does a weak job, though I think she's amazing in other stuff. And lastly, let's talk about the main actress.I've seen her in quite a few movies, and only recently has she been trying to work on more lead roles. She has a horrible face, and her acting is just stupid. She plays the lazy, stupid character, and she does it so horribly. It's passable to an extent, but no one wants to see her as that. She's not a lead performer at all. It would be great to see her in more side roles, though I wouldn't look forward to that either.Amateur effort. Perhaps worth a watch though.

I could almost forgive this (and ignore it) had they simply been ad-libbing each and every line. Even the scams were incredibly stupid and ham-fisted.

40,rockman182,The Hustle (2019),6,13 May 2019,"I saw Dirty Rotten Scoundrels within the last year and immediately thought that The Hustle trailer looked very similar. Until I realized it actually was a gender swapped remake. Rebel Wilson is fairly hit or miss for me. I think Fat Amy is the worst part of the Pitch Perfect series. However, I liked Wilson in Isn't it Romantic earlier this year. I like Anne Hathaway in almost everything and it was meant even more knowing that she'd be doing accents in this film. I thought some of the writing is messy at times and the humor is inconsistent but the chemistry between the leading ladies drives the film.The film is about a small time con woman who comes to path with a career con artist who is much more successful. They are at odds with each other as they realize they have to compete with each other. Both are interested in taking money from a young aloof tech developer and will lie and do whatever they can to get their cash. The film also stars Alex Sharp, who for the longest time looked so familiar until just now where I remembered he was in How to Talk to Girls At Parties.Anne Hathaway excels in this role. Elegant, sexy, and comically ruthless. She and Rebel Wilson play off each other very well. I liked Rebel for the most part but I feel Rebel gets let down by the material at times. The best segments where when Rebel was pretending to be blind and Hathaway's character was putting her ""blindness"" to the test. There are a few laugh out loud funny moments but its not a consistently funny film. I also feel like the plot isn't always present and when it is it feels rushed or like it could have been written better.You get what you came for with The Hustle. You aren't here to see something completely amazing. You do get a competent comedy with two leading ladies who bring their A game in a film that does a nice re-imagining and revision of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. All I know is that I want to see Anne Hathaway doing more comedies of the sort. I notice a trend of women led remakes of old films like Ghostbusters, Oceans 8 and What Men Want. I have no issues if the film is good.6.5/10",The Hustle
41,RforFilm,"If The Hustle is meant to be a swindle, then it did something right. It got some laughs, but nothing much more",5,16 May 2019,"When I went to France for the first time in 2006, I recall that on my first visit to the Eiffel Tower, I was confronted by a young woman in her twenties and asked me in English for money. She said that she and her mother had been stuck in the country. Nothing more. Instead of giving her anything, I pointed to a random person, claimed that he was a friend and that he was rich. I told her to ask him, and as soon as she went to him, I walked in the other direction. This is one of several stories about a con artist that tried to scam me only for me to scam my way out of it.I certainly don't feel bad for what I did, but I also don't think that woman felt bad either. Con artists are already sociopathic to be living a life of telling lies, feeling unashamed about the game their playing and the money their making off of it. Because they've been with us since the beginning of time, their a good source for comedy. In fact, one of them, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, has been given a remake in The Hustle. Let's see if it can be persuasive.In the French Rivera, a professional con artist Josephine Chesterfield (played by Anne Hathaway) is constantly using her charm and sexuality to lure wealthy men into giving money only for them to be cleaned out. With assistance from a policewoman, she has become wealthy and has made smart choices that make her even richer. While on a train, she's seated with Penny Rust (played by Rebel Wilson), a free spirited, smaller con artist who also wants in on the territory. She tries to send her away, but Penny only wants her to teach her.Josephine does her best to make her a better con artist, despite her crass nature and goofy attitude. The two eventually realize that a billionaire tech guru Thomas Westerburg (played by Alex Sharp) is staying at a nearby resort and make him their next target. They agree o make a wager to see who can get money out of him first. If Josephine does, then Penny has to leave. If Penny does, then Josephine has to let her stay. They each try to pull off their charm and wit to see who the better con artist is.I've never seen Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, so I have no idea how close The Hustle is, but I would expect about much of the same. It's clear that the movie wanted to change something by giving it a female spin, though it rarely adds much to the premise, which is okay to begin with. I do give credit to both Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson who get out a couple of jokes every now and then that I did like. Their clearly trying to do everything to have fun with the premise and get out a laugh every now and then. The problem is that I didn't laugh that often.I'd talk about character, but their really isn't much development when theirs nothing to work with. The script sets them both off as con artists and neither really has a goal. Anne Hathaway already seems complete from another movie story and Rebel Wilson doesn't seem to have a lot of investment. If she loses, then she goes back to America...where she'll likely continue scamming the men she was seeing. Without anything really at stake, even for a comedic reason, it makes this for a more dull experience then anything.There were people in my theater that did laugh. They got more out of it then I did. Perhaps what I can say is that it's still shot nice and I do like seeing the French Riviera. And as I said, some jokes did work for me. It's nothing terrible or bad. It's simply a comedy that was written fast, made fast, released fast, and had hoped to make some money fast. It's a bit of a swindle, but a swindle that some people are still going to enjoy. I guess it's merely a matter of the movie not being for me.I'll give this five French Riviera tickets out of ten. If I learned anything, is that movies like The Hustle have an audience. I'm just not a part of it. If this sounds like something you'll like, then you may get something else. Otherwise, avoid being swindled by not seeing this.",The Hustle

It is by far the worst movie I've seen so far this year and it surely manages to make the shortlist of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why? The answer is simpler than you might expect. It's supposed to be a comedy with one of my favorite actresses, so what can possibly go wrong? Everything. And I really mean everything. It wasn't able to bring even a smile to my face, let alone a full laugh, the actresses' performance was appalling, the script was completely retarded and the overall sensation was that it a completely failed low-cost movie with low-cost actors which are searching for a way to make themselves known.It was so long, so stupid and so boring that I'm truly proud of myself for not falling asleep. I cannot understand how they ended up with this abomination, how someone like Anne Hathaway can accept such a role and most of all, how I ended up seeing it. It's hard to compare it with anything, it's even harder to watch it as the only feeling that it was able to transmit was embarrassment.

When ""The Hustle"" came out, I really didn't pay too much attention, and had no idea that it is basically a remake. When I started watching it, I literally rolled my eyes.When a small-time con artist, named Penny Rust (Rebel Wilson), encroaches on the territory of the much more polished and accomplished hustler, Josephine Chesterfield, it turns into all out war between the two. Josephine tries her best to use her wits to get the novice to leave of her own accord, but when that doesn't work, they form a bet on who can be the first to extract $500,000 from a young app developer named Thomas Westerberg.

Having said that though, ""The Hustle"" was better than I thought it would be. I felt they held true to the spirit of ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", yet they were able to give this movie enough separation for it to stand on its own. The comedic routines were similar, but fresh. I thought the working chemistry between the two leading ladies was pretty good.And yet, it still fell a little flat with me. I did say it held TRUE to the spirit of the first movie, but it didn't really capture it. ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is a classic comedy.

Sadly this film soon falls into unfunny territory.
'The Hustle' tells of two con-women, one of high class the other a little low rent.
They team up to swindle all kinds of rich men out of their money.
This could be considered as a remake to such movies as 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' and 'Bedtime Story'. I've not watched either of them but can confirm that this judged as its own movie just doesn't work.
Most of the jokes fall flat.
Even from a seasoned professional such as Rebel Wilson, this for the most part just ain't funny.
It is with surprise that it is Anne Hathaway that gets most of the few and far between comedy moments.
Once again proving that she has it all.
Talent, beauty and now comedic timing.
Her range of accents bring the occasional smile but I rarely if ever found myself chuckling.
It's all a bit predictable in terms of comedic delivery.
Hathaway's laugh out loud moment when her Butler gets shot is perhaps the funniest part of the movie but that's even included in the trailer.
As a matter of fact the trailer has all the best bits.
Just watch that instead!I believe both Wilson and Hathaway could have delivered more belly laughs if the movie was more tightly crafted.
There's a dithering romantic subplot that goes nowhere and by the time credits roll you'll feel disappointed.
This is yet another modern comedy that has no real substance other than the initial premise and that soon wears thin.Sadly despite the films two magnificent leads, this is a film I can't recommend.",The Hustle

57,Magow-Intermean,The Hustle Review,8,23 May 2019,"When two totally opposite con artists Josephine and Penny cross paths they eventually join hands together to rake in even bigger spoils. But to what extent will they be able to pull off their scams?
The Hustle' stars Anne Hathaway as Josephine Chesterfield, an elegant, sophisticated con artist who swindles rich men in the French town of 'Beaumont Sur Mer'. Rebel Wilson is the socially awkward Penny who makes her way here to do her own share of scamming. But Josephine wants no interference in a place she believes is solely her area of operation and does all she can to get Penny out of the way. Which proves to be tougher than she thought. Eventually, as a last resort she takes Penny under her wing to teach her a few tricks of her trade and together they pull off a series of scams conning rich men, using Josephine's mantra of ""exploiting men's inability to imagine a woman is cleverer than they are.""
The film is a remake of the 1988 comedy, 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' with a gender switch (which in turn was remade from the 1964 film, 'Bedtime Story'). Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson here are to what Michael Caine and Steve Martin were in the 80's film. And while this gender switch could have translated into a swish female centric comedy, except for the fact that it simply doesn't take off. The humour falls flat - there are very few laugh out loud moments and some are just cringe worthy. The storyline pretty much sticks to that of 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' so there is nothing new there. At just one and half hours this one feels like a drag after a point.Of course, Anne Hathaway looks ravishing in almost every frame with a wardrobe to die for. And she pulls off the snooty con woman act with an enviable high maintainence lifestyle rather well. Alex Sharp as Thomas Westerberg, an American tech wizard and billionaire is likeable. Rebel Wilson shoulders most of the responsibility for elucidating the laughter but it simply doesn't cut ice beyond a few slapstick moments and some jokes. Josephine and Penny's face offs reduce to bringing each other down and it goes a bit ho hum from there.Director Chris Addison could have pushed this female version of 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' to another level with all the ingredients at his disposal but it simply fails to touch that mark.",The Hustle

The hustle was pretty decent and in no way deserving of its negative reviews. Although it was still far from great. It conflicted me with many things throughout the film lets talk about why this is.Lets start off with the great soundtrack, The upbeat songs used for many scenes really created the correct tone for the film in many places as the lyrics often matched the scenes that were being shown to us. And they just made you have a better time whilst watching.Next my main positive would be the real star of the film Rebel Wilson. Rebel at this point in her career in comedy is naturally funny. She has a natural charm and relatability to her that is rarely seen with comedians as her attitude and her improv relates to people as they are either like that or have a friend like that. She had many funny phrases and scenes in the Hustle which made the film. Rebel can be brilliant in a bad film ( isn't it romantic) and i will still praise her form of humour.However on the opposite side with the main characters i thought Anne Hathaway felt very out of place in this type of comedy film. She did not make me laugh once throughout the film, and she just felt like a down grade compared to Rebel Wilson i think she is a fantastic actress just perhaps not for comedy.Next the film on the most part was very funny, Despite it not being consistent with its comedic tone when there was funny scenes they went all out. I think the scenes that really drew out a proper laugh from me would be When Rebel Wilson/Penny was blind. This was hilarious as it was so obvious to the audience that she was not and she had to deliberately put herself into situations where other people would think she could not see. However i would like to add on to my previous point and say that the humour was not consistent throughout the whole film. Trough the first act of this film there was not a lot of funny scenes or humour which made me thought negatively of the film at first but once it got its required tone about half way through this was resolved.Linking to the previous point this film had bad pacing issues. There was often time where there was not a lot going on or just non interesting dialogue in parts of the film which could be a turn off for some audience members. I just felt the film was to slow and thought the pacing could of been improved with perhaps 10 or 15 extra minutes added onto the film as it was only 1hour and 30 minutesNext i liked the film had a strong message and ideology throughout of female empowerment. It was nice to see women in power and exploiting men as it has been drilled into audiences heads to be the opposite way round. What also helped was the films strong dialogue many things mentioned about what men think of women and what they want in relationships is very reflective of todays society. And was very cleverly put into this film and Rebel Wilson was the perfect person to spread this message due to her mentioning her weight being a turn off for men.One of my main positives for me would be the narrative character development of Rebel Wilson/Penny and Anne hathaway/Josephine. Just to see there frenemy/competitive friendship develop throughout the film was interesting and amusing to watch. Seeing Jospehine being so cold to penny due to her being competition on and then being partners side by side shows that anyone from any class and weight can develop a friendship.However my biggest issue was the film was the stupid change in the plot and its themes. Throughout the whole film the whole message was women empowerment and women being in power with exploiting men for there money. But then Rebel wilson and Anne Hathaway's character decided to change there bet with Alex Sharp/Thomas to fall in love with him. It just felt like they were finally doing something different with a female led spy comedy and then they decided to go with the generic genre tropes and have the women competing over a man this really annoyed me. Also there was a lot of sleazy men with Anne Hathaways character some of the older characters were rude and inappropriate with her and there was one particular uncomfortable scene that i did not like.And finally the film had a pretty good plot twist that i was not expecting. To have Thomas secretly be a con artist as well was a clever twist and to see all 3 work together in the final act was actually fairly fun to watch and left me decently satisfied with the films outcome at the end.Overall the Hustle has got many issues. But overall its a fairly funny but inconsistent comedy with a fantastic lead and interesting but not fully executed themes.",The Hustle

Deze reboot is geregisseerd door Chris Addison, de regisseur van verschillende afleveringen van verschillende tv-series.De film gaat over de oplichtster Penny (Rebel Wilson). Ze weet mannen van kleine bedragen te beroven. Als ze tijdens een nieuwe kleine oplichterij de professionele oplichtster Josephine Chesterfield (Anne Hathaway) ontmoet en te werk ziet gaan, is ze erg onder de indruk. Zo hoopt Penny dat Josephine haar kan helpen om ook een professionele oplichtster te worden.
Josephine wil Penny eerst niet verder helpen, maar realiseert zich later dat ze Penny misschien wel voor haar eigen belangen kan gebruiken. Zo beginnen de twee als partners om rijke mannen van hun geld te beroven. Na genoeg training, besluit Penny Josephine te verraden en zelfstandig verder te gaan als oplichtster. Als Penny dan met een nieuwe oplichters actie bezig is, kruist ze opnieuw het pad van Josephine. De twee leren dat ze achter hetzelfde aanzitten en besluiten elkaar voor de voeten te lopen om zo zelf de buit te krijgen.Deze film begint komisch, maar wordt daarna al snel heel bekend en voorspelbaar. Ze gebruiken veel bekenden soorten komedie zoals vele lichamelijke komedie met Rebel Wilson. Waar ze bijvoorbeeld valt, struikelt of verder grappen maakt over haar gewicht of eten. Daarnaast blijven ze dezelfde grap ook te lang door gebruiken of herhalen. Zo valt er na het begin nog weinig te lachen om de film. Zo kun je het beter bij Dirty Rotten Scoundrels houden of een andere komedie bekijken.Door de bekendheid van de komedie, komt het acteerwerk verder ook niet zo bijzonder over. Rebel Wilson zet weer eenzelfde soort komedie rol neer als ze wel eens vaker heeft gedaan in haar andere komedie films, maar helaas is ze in deze film eerder irritant dan grappig.
Anne Hathaway komt wel goed over in deze film als een professionele oplichtster. Ze heeft in The Dark Knight Rises ook de rol van Selina Kyle alias Catwoman gespeeld een bekend fictieve oplichtster. Met deze rol komt ze wat over als een meer realistische versie van dit personage. Ze krijgt met haar rol in deze film ook de kans om met verschillende talen en accenten te spelen. Helaas is het Britse accent dat ze in deze film gebruikt soms wel wat te overdreven en kans zo wat irritant klinken. Door het verdere mindere script komt haar personage soms ook dom over wat eigenlijk ingaat tegen hoe haar personage is geïntroduceerd en in het begin verder wordt opgebouwd.",The Hustle
64,WalkdenEntertainment,After Watching This Movie...I Feel Like I'm The One Who Got Hustled!,4,6 March 2020,"For those who are not aware, this film is a modern remake of the comedy film Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988). The original film starred Michael Caine and Steve Martin in the leading roles. Now renamed ""The Hustle"", this time the lead roles have flipped gender. Josephine (Anne Hathaway) and Penny (Rebel Wilson) are a pair of quirky female scam artists. The two are very different financially; upper and lower class; and personally. The two continually get on each other's nerves when their scams keep conflicting with one another, leading to the two deciding to place a bet. The bet that is made is not an easy task but naturally both accept. The first person who can receive $500,000 from a selected male wins. Throughout the film, the audience will witness the many attempts of our two leads to try and get the unknown male to either fall in love with them or feel sorry for them in hopes he will hand over the money.As you would expect, Australian actress Rebel Wilson is relied upon to bring most of the gags and she does achieve small grins and giggles, but some jokes land completely flat and are just uncomfortable to watch. If you've seen a film with Rebel Wilson you will generally know what to expect. Anne Hathaway's character is more of a serious one as she is truly skilled in the art of scamming. Anne Hathway's character also carries an accent for the whole film and I truly found the accent unnecessary. As for the comedy as a whole, the two generally worked well together even if the jokes are repetitive and predictable.As for the main plot, it's weak and it saddened me that this film doesn't bring anything new or creative to the screen, particularly in the film's ending. Fans of the original film will relate to my disappointment. Those who have never seen the original comedy may find joy and humour with the end results.Overall, the only people who got conned in this movie is people who watch it thinking this could be something fresh and new. I personally love the idea of fresh talent to remake a classic comedy from the 80s but its end result is mostly painful and annoying even if you do get a couple of chuckles. Considering the talent, I personally hoped for something so much better but the end result was I felt robbed. 4.0/10 - Walkden Entertainment",The Hustle

The actors and production is not cheap so why dip out on any originality, totally ? It appears that the makers severely underestimated the audiences intelligence believing that people would find a pale imitation as interesting or funny as the original, but obviously they're wrong, I suspect even the actors thought it was boring mid production as their performances are pretty flat, Hathaway looks like she wants to be elsewhere and Rebel Wilson simply runs through her rude Australian routine to formula.The one interesting point is how the movie is around con artists, whoever raised the money for this movie certainly pulled one over the investors eyes here, it's fake !",The Hustle

The plot doesn't make any sense, and the movie is too dumb to be funny a lot of the time. Also, Anne Hathaway's accent in the film is simply awful. Why didn't they have her talk normally? Like there is no point to her accent at all. The kid who played Thomas wasn't a great actor either, although the script didn't do him any favors.

It worked , the only part that was slightly poor was Rebel's scary sister role was a poor reflection against Martin's excellent Ruprec character .The script was brought up to date with the inclusion of smart phone technology and cyber crime but it's real charm were the stars both Rebel and Anne were brilliant and played their parts with comic genius .It's following the shift in Hollywood after the #meToo affair of giving stronger female roles and like Oceans 8 it's women who are literally stealing the show .Is it better than Dirty Rotten Scoundrels?

79,MinistryofDoom,Hollywood Hustled Movie-watchers again.,3,25 August 2019,"A remake of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels without the comedy is just a crime. Sure there a few funny bits here and there, mostly related to Rebel Wilson's awkward fish-out-of-water clumsiness but it wasn't enough to keep me enticed for a rough hour and a half. Also I adore Anne Hathaway and generally enjoy most of her movies. She's a great actress but for the love of God, please stop with the fake British accent. It was so distracting. Every time she opened her mouth, all I could her was her faux-British delivery and and it guaranteed without a doubt, every time, took me out of the scene and distracted me from what was going on. I couldn't handle it. Now she's done this accent before in other films but in this one, I don't entirely blame her. From what I've read in the press she was forced to do it by the film's director, Chris Addison, and took her accent through inspiration from Absolutely Fabulous, Stewie from Family Guy, and Julie Andrews. So there's that, I suppose. As far as the film goes, it was boring. I didn't laugh much, which is a disappointment. Rebel Wilson always seems to dial up her films with self-depreciating humor and to some extent she delivered that in The Hustle but it felt tacked on and unnecessarily extreme, as if she was playing a caricature of a Rebel Wilson character.

Ok, the trailer was good, but many movie production pack the best scenes in the trailer. Then you have seen the whole movie and there is nothing new or innovative in it. But no! This movie was surprisingly original and put a female touch on the old boy's story 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrells' (The original with Steve Martin and Michael Caine)The storie was all in all the same, but vice versa. It happened on a female way, which was impressingly refreshing for a dude like me. They really had good ideas for jokes. Even my wife, who despises most of the comedys that are presented in a dozen by each click on Amazon, did like the movie and that means something!

It's only 90 minutes long, but it feels like just a fast paced brush through of scenes that worked better before.it robs it of wit, of funny, and also of any real purpose or sensible plotting, and i'm confused as to who this is meant for other than the Rebel Wilson fan.And speaking of Wilson, is her 15 minutes almost up yet? It's gotta be. She's fine in small doses in those Pitch Perfect movies but insufferable in any kind of leading role.She plays the Steve Martin role here and where Martin was charming, Wilson is deeply, deeply unpleasant. She's gratingly loud, infantile, idiotic, and falls back on slapstick fat jokes way too often.My one defense of her is that she seems to be taking the crap even Melissa McCarthy doesn't want but even still, there are solid comic performers who have shown something even with weak material but she's been terrible so far.Anne Hathaway on the other hand should just know better not to go anywhere near this. Like in Oceans 8, she's a highlight, but she wrongly has to play second fiddle to Wilson.And this is yet another female remake that sets itself up as ""the femaing this to actresses?les are going to get back at the men."" Did these people even know the ending of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels?Even so, these characters here make all the wrong moves. Like the Wilson character even tells the Hathaway character that she's a con artist. Why would you do that?Well the reason she does it here is because she mostly just cons men and she tells the Hathaway character this because of course another woman would sympathize with conning men.This is a movie that also seems to think con artists also need to be knife throwing ninjas. What it never really does prove that either one of these two women are competent enough to string anyone along on a con.And if you thought they wouldn't do a Ruprecht scene, well, they did. And it's not just a pale imitation, it's an embarassing failure in nearly every way.They also do a Dr. Schaffhausen scene and I will say it's probably the one time here where the movie shows some of it's own ingenuity.Overalll the few times where it does try to do it's own thing, it goes bust, and it's plot copies not just yield diminishing returns but make you think why does Hollywood keep doThey sell this is some sort of female empowerment but the movie is not just unfunny, it also doesn't even seem to understand the concepts that made the other movie great.There are people who can write new, interesting, funny stuff for women.

The acting was not the issue rather the script they had to work with. There were only a couple of belly laughs, and others that were funny but not hilarious.
The setting was fine as well. Some nice views were on show.
With comedies they have the opportunity to be ridiculous and far fetched with some superb lines thrown in for effect and to give good actors a chance to shine. A few twists and turns that you cannot see coming also helps. The actors were let down I think.
The storyline needed to be more complex. The very best comedies are multi layered and clever. This one lacked all that unfortunately.
There was little tugging of the heart strings as well. That can be omitted for a comedy but it helps as well.

Unfortunately, the movie decides that's not worthy and throws it away for a plot twist that is mostly explained (Anne explains what happened that night since we're not shown). And what's worse, it gives us for a third act in which there is no climax, no final showdown, which makes it all feel pointless and flat. They back away from Rebel's character arc and just throw the nerdy guy into the mix, suddenly deciding to join the girls he just scammed.

The Hustle did have it's positives like it was indeed very funny and the acting work from Hathaway and Wilson was very well delivered and very entertaining. The storyline however, was very dull and very slow which made for a very disappointing story and for a movie about con-artists, I would have loved more action and adventure to it which it had little to none.

114,MartynGryphon,More gender switching remake nonsense.,1,17 November 2020,"I'm amazed at how many reviews refer to Dirty Rotten Scoundrels as being 'the Original' version if this story, when in fact it was first filmed in 1964 with David Niven and Marlon Brando.....it flopped. The first remake was made in 1988 with Sir Michael Caine and Steve Martin to great acclaim. However, we now have a VERY bad remake of a VERY good remake of a MILDLY bad movie.Call me old fashioned, but I prefer my comedy, well, funny, which this wasn't, in fact I don't think I even raised a smile once.Hollywood has had a knack of knowing what the public wants to see and have been able to predict the type of movie people want to see since the pre 1920's biograph days, but unfortunately, the ability to 'smell what sells' has abandoned them. Otherwise why else would they churn out this bile after being burned so badly with all the other 'gender swap' remakes they have forced down our throats for the past few years.We have had the all female 'ghostbusters' remake and as I predicted, it was a disaster. We've had the gender swap reboot of the 'oceans' franchise and again, as I predicted it was a disaster and the less said about the abomination of the gender switched remake of 'overboard' the better.The people who make these abominations are either too dumb to realise they are not wanted or needed, or they just don't care. What I DO know, is that the purpose of a movie is to entertain and to make money for the studio and when these types of movies do neither, then the question has to be asked as to why they feel the need to continue to inflict them on us? Unless, just like everything these days, it's 'agenda' driven.I'm all for strong female characters on the screen and we've seen some brilliant ones come our way over the years, but has the Calibre of Hollywood writers deteriorated to such a level that they cannot write a strong female character anymore, unless they are ruining established franchises or disrespecting movies that came before?I hope Post Covid, i hope Hollywood FINALLY get the message and stop all this nonsense. If you want to write and make a movie that shows strong female role models that's fine, but don't put yourself on the back foot from the start by making one that will almost certainly be compared and most likely judged inferior to something came before, because we're getting sick and tired at your blatant attempts at woke 'identity' point scoring.Stop, just STOP!",The Hustle

Where are they? Why did those not make it? Instead, we get to watch Rebel Wilson deliver lines in movies with such contempt and little flair that it often olmost ruins the entire movie (Pitch Perfect is a good example). How does this happen, Hollywood? There are some comedians (Will Ferrell, Rainn Wilson, Amy Shumer) out there that I don't find particularly funny. Their style just doesn't work for me.

Nothing against Steve Martin - he is a comedy pioneer and Rebel certainly benefits from all the foundation built by him. I don't think Anne Hathaway was as good as Michael Caine.

So who in their right minds thought to pick up that script, almost do a ""search and replace"" on some of the tags to bring it into 2019 by replacing ""inherited fortune"" with ""internet app designer"" and one or two other simple updates that really, really didn't work purely for the sake of making this yet another millennial ""lets do it for the girls"" flickI like Rebel Wilson, it seems almost to be a trend to dislike her, she has her place in the market for her ""lost all hope, but I am what I am/slob"" character, I think her best film is yet to come with good comedy writers shes not yet had and this film is no exception..I blame the writer who has made no effort to modernized the original drawing on the shift in the modern culture.That would be Jac Schaeffer as all other credited writers stem from the original, it can only be Jac who used her search and replace feature in word and whatever ideas were on the cover of the magazines on her coffee table.
If that's what it takes to be a writer in Hollywood nowadays someone better book me a first class ticket as I can do 100x better!There's a wave of idealism now which is to recreate characters with different requisites so as to create a sense of forced equality as Hollywood tries to absolve itself for the woeful lack of representation of women and alternative races to their mainstream white cultures historically, and instead of allowing a natural evolution of new and wonderful identities that we can say belongs to them, they're just literally overwriting well established characters to the disappointment of all franchises involved.STOP IT!
Make new films, new characters, new worlds where these underrepresented social types can establish themselves. It's almost a reverse whitewash, which just shows that Hollywood haven't learned anything, they think tipping the scales the other way will bring balance...it wont, and you will just get your audience disenfranchised with the whole thing. The mores is crying out for such things, but not in the way you are doing it.With female confidence tricksters and the reversing of the roles sexually, it doesn't work for this film and they have to go to painstaking lengths to fit the dynamics the other way around.Sorry Rebel could not pull off the deviously vulnerable part played by Steve Martin simply because the sexual dynamics the orignal had.
Anne, had the easier role of the straight man originally played by Micheal Cain and it being comedy we wont land any failing at her door for the fact that it was without a laugh throughout, as it will onto Rebels shoulders, this is unfair, they both did what they do...well!Also the development of a connection between the rivals went from none existent to ""were friends"" in the flip of a coin, which left you wondering why they became friends, the original unfolded at a good pace. The army scene was replaced with some mature Essex ladies didn't work. The mentally challenged sibling rouse was replaced with I don't know what, it was the biggest comedy element in the film, left unexplored where Steve's silliness was replaced with Rebel just being clingy and annoying.
Even the scams seemed that the hustlers would need to spend more money in their construction than they could've reaped from the rewards, with subterranean princess palaces behind Hannibal Lecter like containment cells replacing the locked basement in the original.I gave it a 4, but I think that's mainly nostalgia.from the original.this film should NEVER have been made.",The Hustle

Therefore, I won't be voting The Hustle down simply because of a love for Steve Martin. Which The Hustle and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels are actually remakes of Marlon Brando's Bedtime Story, if an elitist comment must be made. Hence the scene where Hathaway invites the club ladies to give Wilson a bedtime story.
Wilson played a similar character that she plays in many movies. As long as she's not tired of being type-cast, I'm not either. Her slapstick humor is entertaining. I usually enjoy Hathaway, in romantic comedies, but could not get past her ridiculous faux accent. I kept waiting for that to be part of the hustle. It was distracting from anything funny she was trying to accomplish. I've seen them together on other projects and did sense a chemistry between them.
(Oh! Speaking of ridiculous accents, what the heck Dean Norris. Breaking Bad geniuous to rodeo clown. Yikes!). Alex Sharp was good until he became an over the top character at the end. I'm not sure comedy is his forte. He should stick with drama or romantic comedy.
Side note: I'm a female in my thirties that's sick of girl-power remakes,too. Single The Hustle out as its own movie, don't compare it the originals and you'll do fine.

Watching DRS, I got a greater appreciation for where the jokes and sequences come from in this movie and it's nice to see this remake pay homage while also updating certain things and flipping them - most importantly the fact that they are now con women conning men and not the other way around.

Yes they are supposed to be very different characters but should find a way to bond. That never happens.I actually liked Hathaway who does the ""semi serious"" part of the movie, playing the well educated, classy and seductive scammer. But Rebel is supposed to carry the comedic part and she fails miserably. She is NOT CONVINCING AT ALL as a con artist.I keep thinking of plenty of female comedians that would have done a better job.

Honestly I've never really thought Anne Hathaway was a great actress but this movie definitely cemented that for me. Her accent was horrible and her acting even worse. Her only redeeming quality was her costumes (I'm gonna need her green silk robe ASAP).
Rebel Wilson is always a pretty cheesy actor (I think that's kind of her M.O.) so she didn't bother me as much. Actually, pretty much the only humor of the whole movie came from Rebel's character. If it weren't for the comedic timing though, most of the jokes would've fallen flat.
There were multiple times in the film where I thought to myself, ""What the hell is this song?"" The music didn't vibe with the scenes and the songs were just odd choices.
The biggest issue, however, is that the plot was all over the place. There were too many story lines that didn't coincide with one another. I literally had to look up the plot in Wikipedia to make sure I was grasping what they were trying to portray. Talk about horrible writing.

267,FilmWriter569,"Has the quality of a junior high school theater class putting on a performance of ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels""",2,14 May 2019,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO DIFFICULT TO WATCH.. It was VERY poorly cast, acted, written and directed. It reminds us how well and professionally-made the previous movie ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" (1988) that this is a remake of, was so well cast, very well acted, and by very talented comedy actors/actresses and professionally written and directed. This movie ""The Hustle"" (2019) felt like a performance by a bunch of junior high school students, or 20-somethings at best, putting forth their best attempt of making their own version of that movie. There could have been a great potential for a women-leading-role version of that movie --- but this one FAILED horribly due to its cast.
I don't even know her name, that's how much I think of her on-screen talent or lack thereof, and how much I prefer to continue NOT knowing her by name, but I'm referring the one who was cast 2nd to Hathaway.. She made this movie absolutely atrocious (I also blame her director who allowed so many scenes to be the final cut, when it looks like they are just practicing in every scene -- especially that person). She was so very difficult to watch. Her acting (I've sen before) is blase, dull, lacking in the utmost way any talent whatsoever -- only moviegoers who lack any eye for comedic talent would support her) and she is certainly not worth the price of any movie ticket. I've vaguely seen her in other movies and thought the same. Then there's Hathaway's un-commanding presence as well as some of the worst use of foreign accents I've ever seen by an actor. It's not her fault.. she was just a poor choice for the role, most anyone would agree, which only proves this movie was horribly cast. The casting is its #1 problem, very poor acting follows as the second worst thing about this movie, and finally, very poor directing/producing that allowed it all to happen. This movie should not have been made the way it was. Where Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a classic, and collectable -- I proudly own it on Blu-ray, The Hustle is downright forgettable (and unforgivable) and no one will remember it by next year.

critics (especially the 1* reviewers here) have no humour?seriously, I dunno, why this movie is rated so bad, this is kind of a movie for smart people that want to have some relaxing, good entertainment;forget the critics: Hathaway and Rebel Wilson don't play in bad movies, and btw is was a big box office successyour experienced Movie Watcher",The Hustle

It doesn't add anything artistically or comedically. It just falls short.It gets a 5 for the fact I sat through the whole thing, I like the actresses and I laughed twice.

Anne Hathaway, showed within this movie, she can be in a serious, emotional movie such as Les Misérables and still let her hair down within a comedic movie and play a character who is hilarious! She played the British con-artist very well! Rebel Wilson states in an interview, she practically was herself in this movie. She doesn't have too be in my opinion as she is natural, casual, yet funny, she could play the same character in every movie and i'd still find her hilarious! I love the fact that she can be herself in the movies she plays in, and enjoy herself through making a living!

""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is one of my all time Top Ten Comedies... this is not. If DRS was The Beatles' ""Rubber Soul"", then this would be the Beatlemania Soundtrack recording. It's clear that the creators (or maybe RE-creators) love the Michael Caine/Steve Martin classic as much as I do, but the women want, and deserve, a chance to score. In general, there have been more REALLY FUNNY movies made by, or featuring women, than men in recent years. ""Bridesmaids"", for example is abutting, if not solidly in the top ten. And, although not cinema, ""At Home With Amy Sedaris"" is, IMHO, one of the funniest TV series ever - like a 9.7 on the Monty Python scale. What have the guys given us? ""Meet The Fockers""? Please give me a break from Owen Luke Wilson Vaughn Stiller. But, back to the point... this is well produced, contains much homage to DRS, and had lots of laughs. Rebel Wilson is FUNNY... only Melissa McCarthy plays these roles with equal ease. The ""Janet aka The Jackel"" character was possible the weakest, but Glenn Hedley was amazing in that role- not a fair comparison. Who didn't fall in love with Janet?

The best way to describe this movie is if Anne Hathaway & Rebel Wilson did a one act comedy show, this would be it with tickets for the show being no more than a tenner. I think its fair to say that we have been hustled by the trailer.
Rebel Wilson delivers her usual one trick pony comedic performance while Anne Hathaway becomes so ridiculously parody, she loses the plot.

This had the ability to be a smart film with smart female lead characters who are also funny, instead the writers were lazy. They have two great actors and they gave them very little to work with. Sure the plot twist was vaguely interesting, but not enough to save the drivel that proceeded it.I'm not sure if writers are writing all plus size women the same, writing for Rebel Wilson or if Wilson is just picking characters that she has already played before (see Pitch Perfect & How to Be Single), but it is getting very tiresome.",The Hustle

362,beyondwords,"Dreadful, dreadful remake",1,1 July 2020,"""Dirty Rotten Scoundrals"" was a light-as-air romp through the French Riviera, with Steve Martin's earnest goofiness and Michael Caine's urbane savoir-faire. This -- travesty -- is a disappointing muck of a much-loved movie that should have never been made. Trying to set Rebel Wilson up as a physical comedian was a disastrous decision. She doesn't have the body for it. That's no commentary on her size, but she just isn't funny. She has the eye-roll down pat, and that's about it. We went from Michael Caine gently explaining fine art and an appreciation for the better things in life, to Anne Hathaway conducting some sort of bizarre boot camp, trying for a few cheap laughs as Rebel Wilson collapses again and again over a hurdle in some sort of ""training"" exercise.Rebel Wilson's turn as a crazed sister who had to be locked away for her own good was completely out of control. Steve Martin was crazed, but in a very controlled and deliberate fashion. Rebel asking to go to the bathroom, and then flinging up her skirts to reveal some sort of medieval chastity belt was frankly offensive. The look on Steve Martin's face as he found relief was unexpected and FUNNY.For someone who was supposed to be a subtle and provocative seductress, Anne Hathaway's attempted seduction of their mark was awkward and embarrassing to watch. And the movie's switchup of making Rebel Wilson's character become the soft-hearted swindler and Anne Hathaway as the victim was an crude misstep in an attempt to distract the viewer that this movie was almost a line-by-line remake, without the soul and cutting humor. And then, the final indignity -- Anne Hathaway as the MUTE?!? Serioiusly? Oh, heck, why not -- the movie had already been ruined, so why not crown the whole mess with a rotten cherry?Don't bother.

I didn't really know they had done a modern remake until i saw this on Netflix and started watching it and thought to myself ""This looks and sounds familiar"".I would class this film in the same category as the following films:Ghostbusters (2016), Birds of Prey (2020), Oceans 8 (2018) etc.Unfortunately Hollywood seems to be intent on forcing specific messages on its viewers these days which is ""women good and strong, men bad and weak"". This along with other tokenism type messages are what are unfortunately ruining Hollywood at the moment.I am fond of Anne Hathaway and i do find Rebel Wilson funny in the odd film so i thought this film cant be that bad and is worth a try. The plot is mostly a one to one dialogue and plot copy of the original film except with the odd change to fit the new actors style and gender. You would classify this film as a remake and not a re-imagining.All of the actors give a fairly weak effort with lots of wooden acting going on, Rebel Wilson is the only bearable one and even she is only giving her 'B' game to this role. Rebel made be laugh on the odd occasion as i am mostly in tune with her humour style. Anne Hathaway was embarrassing with her almost comical (And not in a good way) attempt at a posh accent. She is getting a little too old to now play the vixen role but she still is attractive with a great figure.Id skip this film if you have seen the original as this is neither superior or different enough to make it worth watching. Nobody can replace the comedic genius of Steve Martin and the sophistication of Michael Cane in these roles.",The Hustle

387,deema-92,For Classic-Humored Audiences Only,6,27 May 2019,"There's a purposely absurdist element to this film. This movie went far out to meet ridiculous tones that might not resonate with an audience hungry for deeper, hyperrealist films. If you're looking for a cutting-edge, deep movie, this won't be for you. In fact, this film has similar tones to 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', classic buddy comedy film with a fresh take on the genre through a modern cultural lens.If you're a fan of classic slapstick, buddy comedies, then you might find this film quite charming. Wilson and Hathaway are consistent with their delivery, and don't fail to entertain with the shenanigans and scheming tactics on unsuspecting (mostly) men.The title sequence reeked Saul Bass with notes Laurel and Hardy in its physical comedy. This pretty much set the tone of the rest of the film, which is a clash between two opposing characters that eventually embraced itself as a accented duo.If there was a way to preset this movie before experiencing it - expect it to be light in nature, to pay homage to classic comedies (with some decadence), and to embrace active women in this genre. I think without the right understanding, it will come off as underwhelming, outdated, or not as stimulating as you'd like it to be.

There needs to be stiff punishment for people who spend money on awful movies like this.In all honesty, the world would be a better place if they had taken the money spent on this and given it to terrorist instead of making this movie.Rebel Wilson is not funny- Gross, obese, crass and awful are not comedic-",The Hustle

The humour was alright, not 100% for me but it was there. There were a few weird moments in the movie caused by what I can only imagine as the writers having a mental breakdown and getting high to numb the pain.
Although, admittedly the ending included a redeemable quality which upped my score to 3/10. It had a pretty good twist, which could have been a bit obvious to keen viewers who didn't switch off mid-way through, but it lessened my annoyance of the agenda.

I think that she's stuck to this type of humor because that's what everybody expects of her. I just really honestly feel like this maybe would have been a whole lot better they had chosen someone else besides Rebel. I'm sure she's a great person with a kind heart but tracking does not agree with me at all.Now on to the story itself. I think it's a great storyline if you're really really bored and don't have anything else to watch. I happened to watch this maybe while I was working and things were slow at work. I've initially thought that the movie would be someone entertaining because of the general premise of the movie, but horrible acting just completely ruined it. I really love and though.

Rebel Wilson is the same character she plays in nearly every movie, and Hathaway tries, but is left swimming against the tide with a lazy script.

Not everyone has the same sense of humour of course. Not everyone likes the same actors. But what strikes such despair (in the people that can be bothered to write a review): ""Worst film I've ever seen"", ""drivel"", ""if your IQ is below 70"", ""worst acting ever""... Its strange.
The most venomous comments appear to come from nostalgists who love Steve Martin and Michael Caine - as I do. Yet its exactly the same plot, and essentially the same jokes. So perhaps you could be indifferent, but outrage and hatred?
I just watched Bedtime Story, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and the Hustle on the same day (that's the type of fun things I get up to on weekends). If you like one, I can't understand how you wouldn't like the others. Sure you might hate unnecessary remakes, but outrage and hate?
Which brings me to the inevitable question. Is it just because the Hustle stars 2 women? I hear your howls of protest. Calls of political correctness gone made: ""Can't we just dislike a film starring women without being accused of being sexist?"". Maybe, after all I thought Wine Country was the biggest load of rubbish I'd seen in years and I don't think that makes me sexist.

556,rozraife,Dirty Rotten Hustle,2,21 June 2020,"The Hustle is a rewritten version of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (DRS), starring Michael Caine and Steve Martin.Hathaway was ok as the refined con, however, Michael Caine could dance circles around her. Although she handled the elegance and poise of the part well, she was stifled by the less intelligent script, struggled with the accents, and was not age-appropriate for the part. The role of Chesterfield is supposed to be a con that has played the game for years and massed a mountain of wealth and experience. Caine was 15 years senior to Martin during DRS, so all of the ""your too old to handle this, can't keep up old boy"" jokes made perfect sense. In the Hustle, Hathaway is 2 years younger than Wilson, so any references that Rust makes to Chesterfield's senior age is just plain ludicrous and fall completely flat.Wilson does not hold a candle to Steve Martin as the small-time con Penny Rust. Martin came off as charming and comical, whereas Wilson comes off as cheap and ridiculous. Not for a single second did I believe she could convincingly con anyone out of a single penny. All of the more ridiculous bits expected of the Benson/Rust role had an air of believability while Martin played it, unlike Wilson's take, which often annoyed more than charmed. Rebel played the part like, ""I'm a con, conning you, and in case you didn't pick up on that the first time, I'M A CON, CONNING YOU!"" Martin lived and breathed the role, wore it like a beloved glove, and effortlessly made you believe he was Freddy Benson, small-time con with big-time dreams.Updating DRS and empowering women as the cons was a great idea that was poorly executed. Technically this script is the 3rd go-round, the first being Bedtime Stories, which was a gem in its own right, followed by the even more popular Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. So, a script that has proven more than once it can stand on its own, if not completely destroyed by bad acting and bad revision. If you want to see a movie about women cons, Heartbreakers is an excellent candidate, and fully captures the conwoman vibe while offering a hilarious and intelligent script.",The Hustle

We don't have any indication that anything they are doing is going to ever be particularly violent. Even if they WERE also doing the whole badass assassin schtick offscreen at some point, this is the twentieth century and there are far better things to learn than throwing knives.
Then everything falls apart during the ""Lord of the Rings"" gambit. They went way too far for any suspension of disbelief.

And it's not realistic that this is enough for 4 policemen to come to try to arrest her. I mean it's so ludicrous and demeaning. Also how is it that Josephine ""happens"" to swap a fake replica of some gambler's wife's bracelet... this is just so stupid and convenient. Not understanding the arc at all. Lastly... what was this whole deal with Penny bragging to some old dude that she has a bunch of STDs and throws herself with another man on a plane. Like is this supposed to be funny?

I didn't start this film with any expectations or comparisons. The storyline is simple and easy to follow. Rebel adds her unique flavor to her character as she typically does, so be prepared for some lewd movements and vulgar language. Anne Hathaway is classy, beautiful, and impressed me with her many accents (the German doctor was spot on-I spent 2 weeks in a German hospital and can attest to that). I was completely in stitches during the scene with the blind individual and the German doctor. Funniest thing I've seen in a long time.Everyone is an expert reviewer and nothing is ever adequate (let alone exceptional).

It might have been a profession with class 30 years ago, but I think both ladies did a fantastic job of portraying and representing the sleazy, slight of hand using, lying & and manipulating characteristics of con artists at both ends of the scale. And the fact that they are women simply highlighted that men are not the only ones running scams in the world. It's a great slap stick humor movie. It doesn't take itself seriously while also providing 'sick burns' uncomfortable circumstances that push the boundaries of how far a con artist will go to Maintain a lie.
