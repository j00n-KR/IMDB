0,SnoopyStyle,great character,8,8 February 2019,"It's the last weeks of eighth grade for quiet loner Kayla Day. Most of her socializing is video blogging to her few followers and constantly tapping on her cell phone. She is taken with bad boy Aiden. Popular girl Kennedy is forced by her mother to invite Kayla to her pool party. Kayla meets Kennedy's dorky cousin Gabe. The eighth graders go on a field trip to the high school where friendly Olivia is assigned to her mentor.This is a great character. The plot isn't special but it does have a realism. I got concerned with the arrival of Olivia around the midway point. It felt like it was going away from the awkward loneliness of hormonal teendom until that creepy car ride. I would save the confrontational climax to another target rather than Kennedy. She's stuck up but she doesn't really deserve the big blow up. Also Gabe is not interesting enough to do the Sixteen Candles ending or at least, give him the Rick & Morty connection at the pool. Despite my differing opinion, this is a solid coming-of-age movie for a new generation.",Eighth Grade
1,jboothmillard,Eighth Grade,6,20 May 2019,"Film critic Mark Kermode on BBC News - The Film Review said he loved this film, and that it was one of the most realistic coming-of-age movies in many years, I was looking forward to seeing it after many positive opinions. Basically at Miles Grove Middle School, a public school in the state of New York, Kayla Day (Golden Globe nominated Elsie Fisher) is a thirteen-year-old eighth grade student is finishing her final week before graduation. Kayla spends most of her time using social media, in particular posting motivational videos about self-image and confidence on YouTube, which get little to no views. In reality however, Kayla is very shy and struggles to form friendships, she is even voted ""Most Quiet"" in the student yearbook. Also, because of her reliance on social media, her single father Mark (Josh Hamilton) struggles to connect with her. Kayla is invited to a birthday pool party by her classmate Kennedy Graves (Catherine Oliviere), her mother forced her to do so. Kayla suffers an anxiety attack while at the party, but eventually comes out of the bathroom and goes outside to swim. After meeting Kennedy's eccentric cousin Gabe (Jake Ryan), Kennedy opens her birthday presents, she and everyone has little reaction to Kayla's present, a card game. Kayla tries to leave the party, but her crush Aiden Wilson (Luke Prael) suggests she rejoins the group, she overcomes her fear and volunteers to sing karaoke. Kayla hears that Aiden broke up with his last girlfriend after she refused to send him nude photos, she fabricates that she has a dirty photos folder on her phone, which grabs his interest. Aiden asks her if she gives blowjobs, and unsure of what to say answers yes, she later searches the internet of how to give oral sex and is disgusted. Kayla attends a high school shadow program, friendly twelfth grade student Olivia (Emily Robinson) shows her around. Olivia gives Kayla her number, and later invites her to the mall to have lunch with some friends. They enjoy themselves, but Kayla spots her father spying from afar, she is embarrassed and tells him to leave. Olivia's friend Riley (Daniel Zolghadri) drives Kayla home, and stops to initiate an awkward game of truth or dare. During the game Riley asks Kayla about her sexual experience, he takes off his shirt, and asks her to take hers off, she refuses, and he backs off, and continues to drive in frustration. Kayla returns home and breaks down; her father Mark comforts her. She later makes an online video to announce that she will no longer be making any more videos, she admits she is not the person she pretends to be and feels unfit to give advice. Kayla opens a time capsule she created for herself in sixth grade, it contains a UBS stick with her younger self questioning about her love life and friends. That night she asks her father to help her burn her time capsule and asks if she makes him sad, he says that he is proud of her and she could never make him sad, and she hugs him tightly. At graduation, Kayla decides to confront Kennedy for ignoring her, about her reaction to her birthday present, and acting indifferent towards her despite her attempts to be nice. Kayla later has dinner at Gabe's house, and they have a fun time together. Kayla makes a new time capsule which she and her father bury in the backyard, including a USB with a video message for her future self in high school to encourage her through tough times. Also starring Fred Hechinger as Trevor and Imani Lewis as Aniyah. Fisher gives a terrific naturalistic performance as the nervous and socially awkward young teenager, there are many embarrassing, cringe-worthy situations that the audience can empathise with and relate to, it is a slightly uneventful story, but the teenagers act and talk like real ones, and the use of ""Orinoco Flow"" by Enya is terrific, all in all it is an interesting and worthwhile comedy drama. Good!",Eighth Grade
2,evanston_dad,Cringiest Movie Ever?,8,5 November 2018,"What is that sound, you ask? It's the nearly audible cringing that accompanies every frame of ""Eighth Grade,"" an epic of middle school proportions.It's hard to know who cringes more: the film's protagonist, played in a pimpled blaze of glory by Elsie Fisher, or those of us watching her character navigate the landmine-riddled battlefield of adolescence. The film is painful to the extreme, but painful in that cathartic way that stories are when you know everyone has experienced some version of it. We've all been there and, for better or worse, most of us come out on the other side and live to tell the tale.My junior high experience was nowhere nearly as awkward and angst-filled as the one shown in this film, but I also didn't have to contend with social media and the additional pressures it puts on kids to be popular. As a 43-year-old man watching this movie, I most related to the dad, played winningly and goofily by Josh Hamilton. His father character tries awfully hard but is at a loss for most of the movie, one moment bonding with his daughter over some fatherly advice while in the next having bananas chucked at his chest. Seeing him try his best to make sense of that elusive thing known as the female teenage brain is pretty hilarious.Mostly (no offense ladies), this movie made me glad that I have boys instead of girls.Grade: A",Eighth Grade
3,blanbrn,A youth story of dealing with life and acceptance.,6,5 August 2018,"This recent film called ""Eighth Grade"" is one that's filled with growing pains and fun as it tries to take a viewer back to memories of their school days, when most remember it was a time when most tried to fit in and be popular. As with this tale it's a simple look at the life of a pimple faced teen Kayla(Elsie Fisher) who begins her year of 8th grade, and her life centers around facebook, twitter, instragram, and snap chat and texting on her I phone. And it's clear that she wants to be liked and popular and have friends and find the right boy. All of this is just an underbelly of learning life and growing up while dealing with dad and being a single child. Overall the movie speaks to emotions of life, struggle, and acceptance as that's the issues that all face while growing up.",Eighth Grade
4,Hellmant,I found almost everything presented in the film to be really relatable!,10,3 August 2018,"'EIGHTH GRADE': Five Stars (Out of Five)A comedy-drama about an extremely insecure teenage girl who's struggling with social acceptance, while finishing her last week of eighth grade and preparing for high school. The film was written and directed by actor turned first time feature filmmaker Bo Burnham. It stars Elsie Fisher, Josh Hamilton, Emily Robinson and Jake Ryan. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and I was pretty blown away by it as well!Kayla (Fisher) is an introverted and extremely insecure teenage girl, who's preparing for high school. She doesn't have any friends, but she really wants them, and she spends most of her free time on social media, and making YouTube videos explaining her social issues to others. Her father, Mark (Hamilton), constantly tries to help her, while still trying to keep the distance from her that Kayla desires. The entire film takes place during Kayla's last week of the eighth grade. The movie is a beautiful examination of what it's like to be a social outcast trying to fit in in middle school. I remember what that's like very clearly, obviously not from a teenage girl's point of view, but I still found almost everything presented in the film to be really relatable. It's funny, and completely believable. It's also very heartbreaking, charming and touching; I cried tears multiple times while watching it. I definitely highly recommend it, to everyone.",Eighth Grade
5,cherold,Frighteningly real,8,27 November 2018,"I've never seen a high school movie that reflects my experience as an adolescent, but I've seen two junior high movies that do; the dark, despairing Welcome to the Dollhouse, and the painful but at times hopeful Eighth Grade.Eighth Grade follows a bright, pimply, painfully shy girl as she maneuvers through the real world while creating a confident false front in a series of YouTube videos no one watches. She is, like all young people, narcissistic and mean to her parents (in this case her goofy, likable dad), but she is also admirable brave as she forces herself into uncomfortable situations using a fake-it-til-you-make-it approach I never had the nerve for.This movie feels very real. Nothing big happens, but a lot of little, interesting things occur, popping up like flowers or minefields. The lead actress is absolutely terrific, and unlike the aforementioned Welcome to the Dollhouse, this movie insists things don't *have* to be perpetually bleak, even though it doesn't promise they won't be.I've seen this billed as a comedy, but while it has funny moments, it's definitely a drama. It's also terrific.",Eighth Grade
6,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Gucci.,8,3 May 2019,"Unlike so many of a similar vein, 'Eighth Grade (2018)' isn't about 'kids gone wild' or 'the corruption of a constantly online world'. Rather, it's simply about a good person trying to figure out what it means to be herself. It's both a tender reflection and an in-the-moment snapshot, one that's not fuelled by nostalgia so much as empathy. It's wonderfully authentic and, as such, is incredibly relatable. There's nothing flippant about the flick, either. It comments on the internet, and social-media in particular, without being dismissive of it, never reducing social-media to some sort of blanket 'evil'. It's more nuanced than that, understanding where the root of most problems come from, and wholly accepts the world as it is. It tells a small story with small stakes that sort of seem non-existent - that is, until you remember just how big everything seemed when you were a child. Social anxiety as antagonist is a difficult thing to pull off, yet this does it almost impeccably. It also features one of the best father-daughter relationships I've seen on screen, one which culminates in a truly beautiful fire-side scene. Overall, the piece is pacy, nontraditional and entertaining. It's really uplifting, too. In some ways, it sort of functions as one of its protagonist's self-help videos: no matter how old you are, it tells you that everything is going to be okay. It's delightful. 8/10",Eighth Grade
7,ThomasDrufke,A Beautiful Slice of Life,9,14 August 2018,"The coming of age genre can typically one of two ways. It's either a pile of steeming garbage like The 5th Wave and Allegiant, or it's a profound masterpiece like The Spectacular Now and The Way Way Back. There's typically no middle ground. Eighth Grade is thankfully one of the ladder, and is one of the best films of 2018. Director, Bo Burnham, who is a social media/YouTube star on his own, makes a film about a young girl in the last week of 8th grade as she navigates peer pressure, physical changes, and just about everything else that comes with being in junior high. It comes at a perfect time, when our world is so devoured and obsessed with social media and the opinions & approvals of others, especially our closest peers. Elsie Fisher plays Kayla, the socially awkward but undeniably charming protagonist, and she gives the perfect performance. She balances those two characteristics effortlessly well and brings a certain amount of relatability to Kayla that is truly hard to find in actors. There isn't much plot or unique arc that makes the film as mainstream most coming of age dramas, but it's one of those slice of life films that provides a distinct take on a pivotal time in someone's life.9.0/10",Eighth Grade
8,Cineanalyst,Zits and All,7,30 January 2019,"""Eighth Grade"" is easily one of the most realistic movies that I've seen about teenagers. Largely, this is due to its acne-faced protagonist being played by Elsie Fisher, who, unlike many of the twenty-to-thirty-somethings that have populated so many other teen movies and TV shows, is an actual teenager. Most of the rest of the cast also appear to be age appropriate and, indeed, real middle-school students and teachers were employed as extras. One result of this is that the movie is even able to include a birthday pool party that isn't highly sexualized--thanks to its cast not being perversely populated by full-grown adults in swimwear masquerading as children. And a later sexual encounter comes off as genuinely awkward and creepy, as opposed to the usual Hollywood fare of adults portraying rapey and slutty sex-crazed teens.Such realism has its drawbacks, too, though, as the life of a normal eighth-grader isn't especially exciting to watch a movie about it. A lot of the narrative is merely Elsie Fischer's Kayla listening to music and with glowing face as she relentlessly texts and tours social media on her smart phone and laptop. Nevertheless, kudos to the filmmakers for not vainly trying to make photographing cell-phone and Internet use as supposedly exciting (a vomit-inducing, Emoji-filled scene from ""Crazy Rich Asians"" (2018) comes to mind as a recent example), and, in general, I appreciate the consistent tight camera focusing on the protagonist. As well, I cringed almost as much at Kayla and others' butchering of the English language with sentences that are little more than ""like, but, um, like"" as I did at her nervous social interactions. But, like, um, that's how many people--and not just kids--talk.On the other hand, ""Eighth Grade"" does contain a somewhat traditional arc of the usual girl-meets-boy fluff, including the relatively dorky and non-sex-obsessed boy she's supposed to wind up with (although, to be fair, the movie rather needed him to prevent itself devolving into an indictment against teenage boys in general) and, since she's only a kid, her non-romantic relationship with her father serves most of this usual dramatic function. Anyways, even though Kayla's main interest is motivational speechifying via notes posted around her room and in her journal and YouTube advice videos, which are actually thinly-veiled pep talks to herself, that the kid, at least, has some passion for life makes her a compelling character--more so, at least, than some of her peers whom we only ever see as either zombies interchangeably staring at their phones or offering blank expressions as reactions to others, or they're the sex-crazed teenage boys. Most of all, though, Fisher is excellent, with her authentic mannerisms and nervous habits, and her Kayla's social anxiety, from shyness around her peers to embarrassment over her devoted father, is a spot-on representation of adolescence.",Eighth Grade
9,cricketbat,"I hated eighth grade, but I really enjoyed Eighth Grade",8,25 January 2019,"If there is one word to describe Eighth Grade, it's genuine. This film doesn't try to hit the usual clichés of teen angst movies, it simply tells the awkward (and sometimes hilarious) truth of youth growing up in the modern era. Plus, the performances of Elsie Fisher, Josh Hamilton and the rest of the cast are refreshingly sincere. I may have hated eighth grade in real life, but I really enjoyed Eighth Grade the movie.",Eighth Grade
10,capone666,"Be Kind, Please Rewind",7,4 October 2018,"Eighth GradeEighth grade is that time in a young person's life when they start experimenting with drugs that aren't prescribed for their ADHD. Mind you, the only high the teenager in this dramedy is looking for is the rush of getting Istagram likes.Soft-spoken Kayla (Elsie Fisher) hopes her Youtube tutorials on self-confidence will garner a following beyond her single-father (Josh Hamilton). But as the end of the school year approaches Kayla's popularity on and offline is at an all time low. Excited about high school, she starts hanging out with older kids and experimenting with sex, all in an effort to breakout of her introverted shell.The most authentic depiction of the tribulations facing today's iGen to date, this awkwardly hilarious and aptly directed coming-of-age tale perfectly captures adolescent dialogue, while newcomer Fisher brings empathy to her generation's anxieties.Unfortunately for today's connected youths, it's impossible to ever skip class.

11,851222,Good little movie gem,8,2 January 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Eighth Grade"" (2018) is probably not like any ""coming of age"" stories I've ever seen (or at least on in some years). It doesn't have big moments or speeches or characters or story - its just shows you a moment from a 14 years old girl, who is in that important moment of her life where everything is scary, interesting and just hard. She doesn't have a confidence in her self - but that is just how it appears to her, actually she is amazing. Now this movie is a small one, it doesn't have big names or big moments but it does have its heart in a right place. Directing and writing were very solid, but its the amazing performance by Elsie Fisher (a new face to me) which elevates this movie to higher place - basically ""Eighth Grade"" is a good character study movie but i swear to god i have never seen a character study movie a character which is 14 years old (maybe ""Paper Moon"" 1973 was closes thing to it).Anyway, ""Eighth Grade"" is not a straightforward movie about kids nor its a delightful one. It shows you (reminds you to be more accurate) that difficult moment in our lives we all went trough one way or another. ""Eighth Grade"" is a good, small movie type gem that doesn't come often these days.",Eighth Grade
12,westsideschl,"Like, Ummm, Like ...",8,23 October 2018,"You know you have a real script when a teen's dialogue is centered around lots interjections of ""like"", ""um"", more ""like"", ""awesome"", and dad uses a lot of ""cool"" interjections to be cool of course. Add in her activities centered around the ubiquitous iPhone, Instagram, YTube online advice account, Snapchat, Tweets, and, of course, no Facebook this all adds up to as real as it can get. Oh, make her a slightly unpopular female w/acne, socially awkward w/style to match & maybe a little overweight. Did I mention her room w/little posties of positiveness & hot guy posters. It all equals disaster for this well acted character.",Eighth Grade
13,zkonedog,Something That Everyone Can Relate To,9,4 August 2018,"Everyone has to go through adolescence. That is a fact of life. Because of this, it is a life period that everyone can relate to. While some may have enjoyed it more than others, I'd venture to say it wasn't the crowning achievement of anyone's life, either. The 8th-grade year is in many ways the apex of that entire experience, which is why this Bo Burnham film resonates on so many levels.For a basic plot summary, ""Eighth Grade"" follows the story of Kayle (Elsie Fisher), a pretty typical 8th-grade student in today's world. I'd say more here, but in all honesty it is a bit difficult because the film doesn't really have a defined plot or mission. Instead, it more focuses on just showing the landmark moments of her life during this time period, including learning about sex, interactions with boys, a myriad of self-confidence issues, and relating to her father (Josh Hamilton).The genius of this film is that in order to work, it has to hit these notes perfectly, because it is basically a reflection of themes we've all already lived. It has to be dramatic, because it's entertainment after all, yet at the same time it also has to be close enough to reality to elicit the emotional reactions that the whole premise is built on. Director Burnham does this nearly flawlessly. Even though I am a 32-year old male, I could still understand (and sometimes almost even viscerally feel) what Kayla was going through when she braves the pool party or tries to stand up for herself in front of the ""cool kids"" at school. It never felt like over-the-top ridiculousness, nor did it ever underwhelm.A lot of this is on the shoulders of Fisher, and she is absolutely tremendous in this role. I know this is a very premature statement, but one wonders if this could be the rare child acting performance that garners an Oscar nomination. What makes it even more amazing is that she is only 15 years old herself. ""Eighth Grade"" is the type of movie that wouldn't support a 20-something trying to pass as a mid-teen, so it almost had to feature authentic-aged casting. That's often difficult, though, because how many 15-year old are tremendous actors? Fortunately, they struck gold in Fisher, and she carries this from beginning to end. I never once felt as if it were inauthentic in the least.Also, I really like how the filmmakers don't preach to audiences one way or another. This is very much a ""take it or leave it"" sort of message movie. For example, it would have been very easy to make this a movie about ""how technology makes it so much more difficult to be an adolescent than every before"". That urge is (fortunately) resisted, and instead that topic is approached from a very nuanced way. While Kayla's heavy use of technology may stunt her conversations with her Dad, at the same time it also gives her confidence via her YouTube channel. The same can be said about her relationship with boys. On one hand, she lies to a contemporary about having dirty pictures of herself. On another occasion, however, she doesn't let herself get taken advantage of by an older boy. It's this give-and-take that really makes the viewer think about the issues at hand.Overall, then, ""Eighth Grade"" is another A24-produced success story. That production company can always be counted on to tell a story from a unique angle, and that's exactly what happens here too.",Eighth Grade
14,eddie_baggins,Should be compulsary viewing for teens and their parents,8,25 January 2019,"Who would've thought that one of the most quintessential teen movies of the modern era would be directed by a 28 year old first time feature filmmaker?I'm guessing not too many, but thanks to one time Youtube sensation turned stand-up comedy genius Bo Burnham, Eighth Grade is very much that film.An eye-opening, honest and often downright hilariously on point examination of what it means to grow up in our modern era of phones, standards and a general lack of childlike ignorance, Eighth Grade is that raw type of film that just totally gets and understands its subject matter and thanks to this, should be both compulsory viewing for teenagers and for their parents, that are in many ways likely ignorant regarding what the modern landscape entails for their offspring.Showing incredible skill as both a writer and director and a skill as a director of actors, Burnham knocks it out of the park with his unwaveringly frank look at Elsie Fisher's Kayla's last days in her eighth grade, before moving onto the daunting and hard to fathom high school year's.A large part of why Eighth Grade works so well on many levels outside of Burnham's pinpoint accuracy is Fisher's work in front of the camera.A lovingly nervy and well-intentioned creation who lives with her single parent father and lives a life outside of a large friendship group, Kayla is a creation that we can all relate to in some way as she try's her best to fit in and navigate a pathway for herself to move in where she can be who she is and be happy in doing so.It feels as though Fischer is Kayla and Kayla is Fischer, as the two become one and create one of the most relatable and insightful teenage creations in some time.As Kayla looks to impress the boy she has a crush on, get through unscathed at a popular pool party or make friends with older teenagers, we feel her every emotion, happy, sad, nervous or otherwise thanks to the films almost documentary like realness that is inhabited so well by Fischer.For all the fun and insight to be had from the film, Eighth Grade also deals with some heavy and dramatic situations that may be confronting to some viewers but you feel, if anything, Burnham held back from going too raw and honest for some and viewers scared of the subject matters dealt with here shouldn't be afraid to let their teenagers watch a film that is made for them and important for them to see.Final Say -Eighth Grade is one of the year's most important films, a standout in the independent offerings available and a must watch for those moving into their teenage years. With this debut, Burnham has well and truly established himself as a director to keep a very close eye on moving forward.4 large selections of dipping sauces out of 5",Eighth Grade
15,Red-125,"I expected a great movie, but this film didn't deliver",7,6 August 2018,"Eighth Grade (2018) was written and directed by Bo Burnham. It's a coming of age movie (sort of) about a adolescent girl's last week in eighth grade.Elsie Fisher portrays Kayla, who is trying hard to fit in, but not doing very well. She's morose in general, and antagonistic towards her (single) father. (Her father is portrayed by Josh Hamilton.)Fisher, at age 15, is a brilliant actor. The movie rises or falls on her skills. Without an actor of her talents, the film would be dreary. With her ability, she brings the film up to better than average.Buffy the Vampire Slayer has shown us that high school is essentially a hell hole. Eighth Grade demonstrates that hell starts before high school. Well, maybe, but I don't think that Kayla's problems are universal. However, if you didn't have a good eighth grade year, you will commiserate with Kayla. And, if you raised a sullen teenager, you can commiserate with her dad.We saw this movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work well on the small screen. This film has a remarkably high IMDb rating of 8.3. I can't ignore the fact that most people liked it very much. I don't like to condemn the movie. If it's playing near you, you could do worse.

16,howard.schumann,A Sweet and Touching Film,8,21 September 2018,"All I remember from eighth grade was being shunted from the Glee Club to the Stamp Club because, as my music teacher said, ""it would be a better fit for you."" Better fit or not, it interfered with my plan to be a show biz star in the mold of Al Jolson. Unlike awkward pre-teen Kayla (Elsie Fisher, voice of Agnes in ""Despicable Me 2"") in 27-year-old director Bo Burnham's coming-of-age comedy/drama Eighth Grade, however, I had no smartphone, Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or other social media with which to direct my existential dismay. Withdrawn, insecure, and lacking in self-esteem, Kayla is in her last week of eighth grade before she tackles the dreaded high school, even more of a challenge.Voted by her classmates as ""most quiet,"" Kayla does not talk much and apparently has no friends. She feels emboldened enough, however, to offer a series of instructional videos on Youtube called ""Kayla's Corner,"" in which she gives advice to others on such subjects as being yourself, putting yourself ""out there,"" and turning pretend confidence into the real thing. Stumbling her way through her delivery with a variety of ""ums,"" ""ers,"" ""likes,"" ""you knows,"" and ""whatevers,"" (the way the director must believe all teens speak), the videos offer some good lessons. While they may not be reaching their intended demographic, they certainly hit home to an audience of one, namely Kayla. Living with her divorced, overly solicitous dad Mark (Josh Hamilton, ""The Meyerowitz Stories""), the sullen Kayla resists anything more than one-word answers to her dad's attempts at conversation, preferring to immerse herself deeply in her laptop and smartphone. She reluctantly agrees to attend classmate Kennedy's (Catherine Oliviere, ""The Weaver of Raveloe"") birthday pool party after an invitation from Kennedy's mom (Missy Yager, ""Manchester by the Sea""), but ultimately probably wishes she hadn't. The condescending Kennedy sneers at Kayla's birthday present of a board game which Kayla insists is a lot of fun but fun doesn't seem to be present at that moment. Her stoop-shouldered dumpy look and the fact that she is the only one without a bikini unfortunately does not attract much attention from the boys, except for Kennedy's cousin Gabe (Jack Ryan, ""Moonrise Kingdom""), who is into underwater game playing. Kayla has her eye on Aiden (Luke Prael, ""), but the boy who was voted ""best eyes,"" does not have his best eyes turned in her direction. She perks up later when, at a high school orientation, she is assigned to be high school student Olivia's (Emily Robinson, ""Private Life"") ""shadow"" and feels confident enough to go to the mall with Olivia and her friends Trevor (Fred Hechinger, ""Alex Strangelove"") and Aniyah (Imani Lewis, ""Star,"" TV series). The good feelings are abruptly derailed, however, when she catches a glimpse of her overbearing father peering at her from an upper level like a hovering guardian angel. Her decision to turn down dad's offer of a ride home, however, leads to an even more dicey encounter with Olivia's friend Riley (Daniel Zolghadri, ""Ready Player One""), a ""truth or dare"" aficionado. Remarkably performed with authenticity by Elsie Fisher, we applaud when Kayla takes some halting steps towards maturity as exhibited in her conversation with her dad late in the film. Though their talk lacks the substance of the similar father-son conversation at the end of ""Call Me by Your Name,"" it is still an opening for both to expand their relationship. Eighth Grade is a sweet and touching film that presents the characters and situations as they are without judgment or evaluation. (Unfortunately, eighth graders cannot see the film without a parent because of an R rating for language, though that might stimulate a dialogue between them). While Kayla comes across as innocent and needy and we root for her, unfortunately, her character lacks the nuance or depth that could have taken the film to another level. While we know that it is a struggle for teens to fit in and there have been reported incidents of anxiety and depression among middle school students, Burnham's portrayal of the eighth grade as being somewhat akin to Dante's Inferno ignores the fact that there are other things on the mind of many adolescents besides obsession with their ""devices,"" and that true self-awareness can only begin when you take steps to become involved in things larger than yourself.",Eighth Grade
17,TheMovieDiorama,"Eighth Grade takes the coming-of-age exam and scores a stupendous ""A-"".",8,17 May 2020,"Middle school, the conception of adolescence through external influences, allows its pupils to explore their own personalities at their own pace. To investigate what exactly defines them before transitioning to high school, where the studious focal point of career trajectory overwhelms. Eighth grade, in particular, personifying a last chance to produce an identity for one's self. Friendships, cliques, potential relationships and personal interests. But what if none of them were readily available? What if approaching people was an almost impossible task? For Kayla, her overbearing anxiety and struggles with socialisation, landed her as the reserved personality of her year group, voted the ""Most Quiet"" student by her classmates. Nervously attempting to break this unwarranted mould, she relishes in opportunities to integrate with others, despite the anxious fear initially controlling her reserved nature. Desperately seeking a friend before moving up to high school.The coming-of-age comedy-drama genre is, undoubtedly, saturated. Reason being, they are relatable to almost everyone who winces and the uncomfortable awkwardness of searching ""how to perform good blowjobs"" on YouTube and being disgusted by its contents (no? Just me then? Oh well...). So, the inevitable question is, what does Eighth Grade do confidently to differentiate itself from the likes of 'Lady Bird' and 'Boyhood'? The answer is surprisingly simple. It's abundantly real. No clichés. No overtly familiar character arcs. Just real life dramatised.It capitalises on the modernisation of social structures and how the era of Internet socialisation has decimated real communication. Kayla expends most of her time online, creating motivational videos revolving around confidence and procuring an investable self-image, whilst also scrolling through a selection of widely popular social media platforms. Barraging her unscripted monologues with ""like"" and ""um"" to accentuate struggles in exuding conviction. Yet, she is unable to adhere to her online persona. Her offline realness juxtaposing everything she yearns to be. Eighth Grade refuses to be a standard lesson in self-encouragement though teen angst. It's an examination. A precise investigation into ""Generation Z"", whom only know the world of Internet culture. Thirteen year-olds discussing fellatio, sexting each other and easily accessing desirable images. Concerned about public perception and appearances. Popularity contests determined by the amount of followers on one's Instagram profile.First-time director Burnham comments on the complications social media has injected into maturation. From his own experience as a YouTuber, at such a young age, the clarity to which Kayla's woes and frustrations personify his own anxiety and loss of innocence derives from how hands-on his direction was. The camera never deters away from Kayla at any point. The gleaming spotlight is constantly on her. A tenuous symbolic reference to Burnham as a touring comedian, whom regularly suffered from panic attacks. The montage of videos beckoning for social acceptance. The controversial ""truth or dare"" scene that challenges the pressures of approval through sexuality (admittedly had me leaping out of my chair and pacing the floor...). Eighth Grade is a conduit for Burnham's career, and the personable touches he sublimely inserted within his acute direction were unequivocally refreshing. That man is a walking bundle of talent, believe me.Fisher's performance as Kayla was just as exceptional, perhaps even more so. With the utmost respect, and without belittling her, she was abundantly ordinary. But that's why Eighth Grade works so well. She isn't a hyperbolic representation of both sides of the social spectrum. Fisher typifies the typical youthful member of its generation. Yet there is a power to her character that succinctly provides the necessary drama and relatability this story requires. The emotional fluctuations from happiness to depression. The incredibly poignant panic attacks. Her calm responses during the audacious ""truth or dare"" scene, criticising educational bodies for not exploring consent. There is heart to her performance that ignites a burning flame of vulnerable juvenility. If only Hamilton's parental figure had more time to integrate with Kayla and impact various scenes, the bonfire sequence could've brought out more emotion from both characters. A beautifully performed scene, no doubt. However Kayla's father felt accustomed to comic relief and exaggerated awkwardness rather than adhering to sincere advice, lessening the raw emotionality of that climactic talk. Had the feature extended its runtime by a further ten minutes to establish their relationship even further, well, Eighth Grade could've attained perfect test results.Alas, what Burnham offers is a palatable, palpable and probable insight into life as an eighth grader for the current generation. Propelling the social implications of Internet anonymity for our offline personas, and how it affects the mentality of young girls susceptible to such information. A truly, truly special directorial debut.",Eighth Grade

Fisher, who undoubtedly is playing a version of herself, is so good it's insane. Her plotless story is equal parts hilariously relatable (endearing dinner with nerdy boy) and authentically uncomfortably (truth or dare).",Eighth Grade
19,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Adolescent years have never seen a more painfully true big-screen depiction,9,15 November 2018,"You've never experienced your middle school years thrown back at you with the same acne-covered-skin-crawling authenticity as Bo Burnham's ""Eighth Grade."" Maybe the film's insane relatability factor doesn't climb up to the oldest-living branches on our family trees, but awkward is awkward whether you're a digital native or walked five miles in the snow to get to school.Burnham's standup comedy background surely isn't enough on its own to make a good movie, let alone one that connects so deeply to the collective human experience of adolescence, but great comedians have a way of reflecting the world back at us in a way we inherently understand but haven't yet articulated. ""Eighth Grade"" could have easily started out as a comedy bit that just became too real not to flesh out in greater depth.The story focuses on Kayla (Elsie Fisher) in her last week of eighth grade as she grits her teeth through these last moments of being the person she has been (voted ""most quiet"" by her fellow students) and starts to imagine the person she can be in high school. It's an emotional battle she chooses to go at alone rather than turn to her single father (Josh Hamilton) for any support.What a 28-year-old man can say about what it's like to be a 14-year-old girl today is a fair thought worthy of an eyebrow raise, but from the very beginning of the film, Burnham gives Kayla ownership of her story. She's a video blogger, giving advice to her viewers from her personal experience, a construct that the adults watching will recognize as her way of processing her emotions. Burnham's best script device is interrupting the dramatic flow with audio from Kayla's next video in which she's giving advice that clearly synthesizes the scene we are currently witnessing or just watched. All this preserves Kayla's voice as a character. Never does it feel as though Burnham is speaking to us instead except when he's conveying humor.Fisher has a lot to do with this success. Like any middle-schooler, we can empathize with Kayla just as easily as we can be annoyed at her attitude and lack of perspective. Thankfully we get more of the former; her performance has a way of making us emotionally travel back to a time when we were in her situation, feeling misunderstood, anxious and mad at the world.Burnham doesn't completely swerve away from the cliches we get from movies about middle school, in fact he leans into some of them, but good observational standup comedy works the same way. Similarly but on the serious side of things, the necessity of the of the film's darkest scene will surely be a point of debate. We're used to seeing moments like it in other coming-of-age films, which is reason why you might say it doesn't work - ""Eighth Grade"" isn't otherwise like those other movies.Watching ""Eighth Grade"" you realize the ways most coming-of-age films endear us but reflect a more nostalgic perspective on teenage years. Suddenly those films seem too glossy and polished. And they're made by adults who make assumptions about the younger generations. Burnham could've fallen into that trap, but he's smarter than that. He even takes a number of digs at adults who, for example, think using contemporary lingo is going to resonate with these kids. He celebrates the vulnerability and yearning for authenticity that actually lies behind this new generation's Snapchat and Instagram compulsions. It's simply a different iteration of these timeless truths about the trials of adolescence.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Eighth Grade

Toddles along nicely, yet never evokes any spark.",5,24 November 2019,"Started out promising and quite funny, but this movie got stuck in everyday anxieties all insecure teenagers face without ever getting really funny or dramatic. Everything about this movie is on the safe, predictable side. We have seen and heard all these teenage anxieties all before, so there has to be something extra that makes me wanna watch it. And unfortunately that bit of ""extra"" is missing.Acting is good though by the leading actress, who quite convincingly plays the part of an insecure, introvert teenager without any friends. Her monologues for her facebook videos are endearing and reasonably funny, but as I said before this story is stuck in one gear of niceties about teenager's insecurities. I definitely miss some sort of climax. This movie never evokes any real spark. Best suited for who? Cant imagine young people would like it, although the movie is filmed from the point of view of a teenager, but it still feels this movie is more suited for parents.",Eighth Grade
21,paul-allaer,"Capturing teenage angst perfectly... ""I'm really funny, cool and talkative""",9,2 August 2018,"""Eighth Grade"" (2018 release; 94 min.) brings the story of Kayla, who is in the last week of eighth grade school. As the movie opens, Kayla is making another YouTube video, this one on ""being yourself"". Among others, Kayla explains that, even though she is by choice rather quiet at school, ""the real me is really funny, cool and talkative"". Alas, her videos attract very few viewers. At school, she has few friends, but by happenstance, Kayla gets invited to a pool party by the mom of Kennedy, one of the popular girls. At first Kayla doesn't want to go, but at the urging of her dad, she goes after all... At this point we're less than 15 min, into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the finction movie debut of writer-director Bo Burnham, previously better known for directing stand-up comedy, his acting roles and YouTube videos. All of 27 yrs. old, Burnham writes a script of what it feels like to be a female 8th grader, and all the teenage angst and peer pressure that brings with it. I don't want to pretend that I know what the universe of an 8th grader is like in this day and age, but it certainly does feel realistic and authentic. In the first half of the movie, Kayla is seen spending huge chunks of time on various social media (and that does not include Facebook, which is deemed irrelevant by kids that age). But we have to be honest here: the movie wouldn't be the success that it is if it weren't for the sensational performance of Elsie Fisher, in a memorable breakout role. She captures the at times doubt, confusion, elation, and anger (and at times all of those in the same moment) of Kayla perfectly. Watch closely how Kayla interacts with her dad, and then you come to the realization that the teenage angst of 13 yr olds today isn't much different from when my daughter was that age (in 2003), or when I was that age (decades ago). Just the nuances differ. That is what makes ""Eighth Grader"" such a timeless movie, and one that will appeal to young and old. One can only hope that this crew will reunite in 4 years hence and bring us ""Twelfth Grade""...""Eighth Grader"" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival, to immediate and universal acclaim. The movie finally opened wide this weekend, and the Thursday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati (yes, Thursday is the new Friday) was attended nicely, and with a great mix of teens and all the way up to older folk. It is no accident that currently the film holds an approval rating of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. That's Certified Fresh! If you are interested in (re)uniting with the former eighth grader in you, or are simply interested in a top-notch quality movie, I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion. For me, ""Eighth Grader"" is a WINNER all the way.",Eighth Grade
22,jtindahouse,"Raw, honest, gripping and real",8,30 September 2018,"I think that the movie 'Eighth Grade's biggest strength is that it will connect with a lot of people. Even if you had a perfect school life growing up it is almost certain you witnessed other people that didn't, and unless you're an absolutely cold-hearted monster that likely affected you in some way. Personally I was always pretty easy-going and found life relatively easy, but I used to lose sleep over other people who I knew were having a tougher time than I was. It's a heart-breaking part of life that some people are simply more popular and have easier lives than others, and this film does a tremendous job of exploring that. This is a film all about characters. Obviously we have the lead girl 'Kayla' who we follow for the duration of the movie. Her story is moving, touching and all too real in a lot of ways. The most fascinating and best done part of the this movie though is the side-characters who she meets along the way. Her dad for example, even though he was done in a slightly over the top way to get some laughs and really drive the awkward point home, he was still very realistic somehow. His speech near the end is the single best scene this film possesses. Also a girl called 'Olivia', her character blew me away. It can be easy to forget in this messed up world that there are still genuinely incredible people out there.I really liked 'Eighth Grade'. It never felt forced or the need to include over-the-top scenes just to drive a point home. It was modest and realistic while never losing any effectiveness. It's very much worth your time and money this film.",Eighth Grade
23,Turfseer,Comedian and YouTube sensation strikes gold in his coming of age first feature,8,14 August 2018,"Could Bo Burnham, comedian and long-time YouTube internet star, be the next Judd Apatow? With his first feature, Burnham has done his research into the minds and sensibilities of teenagers stuck in that awkward age just after the onset of puberty and before becoming more independent during the heady days of high school. 
Eighth Grade focuses on his young protagonist, Kayla Day, winningly played by Elsie Fisher, who has been in the acting business since she was five years old. Usually in these coming-of-age stories focusing on school, the protagonist is pitted against a tangible opponent (often a bully) and much of the plot revolves around the conflict between the two. But here Burnham eschews such familiar tropes and hones in on Kayla's internal arc, highlighted by her lack of self-esteem and a journey to assert herself in a world which relies on social media to establish one's social cred.
Kayla is raised by a single parent father, Mark, who thinks the world of her but has difficulty communicating with his daughter as Kayla often feels embarrassed by his awkward entreaties. Instead she holes herself up in her room, creating motivational videos, which she posts on the internet but no one listens to. The videos are actually quite prescient and suggest she has a lot more on the ball than what her classmates give her credit for (she's voted ""Most quiet"" in an awards ceremony at school at the beginning of the film).
Indeed it's Burnham's sharp observations about student life that lift this film way above the clichés of the genre. In addition to the offbeat awards ceremony just alluded to, there are a slew of neat, unexpected activities at the school we're introduced to. 
 For example the students open up ""time capsules"" which they made on their first day at middle school. Now they watch their younger selves speaking to their older counterparts, wishing them good luck on their impending graduation and entrance into high school (at film's end, Kayla creates a new ""time capsule,"" wishing her good luck on her next foray into college).
More unusual and compelling stuff: students undergoing a drill, where a teacher is dressed up as a school mass killer and instructed how to react if such a deadly situation arises (a sorry commentary on the state of affairs in this country at the present time!). Later, the eighth graders are paired up with high school students for a day at the local high school where they gain some valuable ""experience"" in what to expect when they begin attending in the fall.
Eighth grade is not plot heavy and depends on a series of vignettes that chart the protagonist's journey. Kayla is invited to the birthday pool party of a girl whom has snubbed her in school, but attends at the behest of the rival's mother. There she confronts Aiden, a boy she has a crush on, offering to send him nude pictures of herself. The boy counters by asking her if she knows how to give oral sex. This then results in Kayla's desire to educate herself on the subject by watching explicit online videos as well as practicing with a banana (practice which fails to come to fruition, after she's interrupted by her father).
The second act dark moment arrives after Kayla hooks up with Olivia, the high school student she was paired up with at school. Burnham smartly contrasts the older teenagers' more sophisticated banter with some of the more monosyllabic utterances of the younger crowd Kayla has been interacting with earlier.
In perhaps the most harrowing scene in the film (which hardly should be called harrowing), Kayla gets a ride home with Olivia's friend Riley, one of the older high school students, who parks his car, gets in the back seat with Olivia and begins playing a game of ""truth or dare."" He gets as far as taking his shirt off when Kayla makes it clear that she wants him to stop and drive her home. Fortunately there are no real tragic moments in the film but it's a learning moment for Kayla, who finally pours out her heart to her father, after the traumatic event.
If there is one flaw to this film, Burnham has some trouble wrapping things up. There's the overly sentimental scene involving the embrace between father and daughter as well as Kayla rather abruptly effecting her comeuppance of Kennedy, whom she bluntly tells off in the school hallway, right before film's end (maybe not the best way to demonstrate how she's found her confidence).
It's Burnham's observational skills about today's environment permeated by social media, as well as the psychology of the teenage mind, that prove he is a talent to be reckoned with. In addition, with his adroit use of social media and overall clever cinematography (not to mention the great use of music to enhance the drama), Burnham has already positioned himself as a major force in the cinematic world today.",Eighth Grade
24,jadavix,Gucci!,8,10 March 2019,"I was reluctant to watch ""Eighth Grade"" because I thought it might be too painful, but it really wasn't. There is one scene in particular that is pretty gut wrenching, but the movie is really not the cringefest I was expecting, a la Solondz's ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"".But let's face facts here: this was not the only reason why I had reservations. Being 13/14 for me in high school was a nightmare. When you just hear the title ""Eighth Grade"", what do you think of? There's a reason why everybody knew this movie was going to be painful: because the period of adolescence the movie is set in IS painful for almost everybody.There are some really nice touches in the movie that rung true for me. We didn't have Youtube when I was in school, but I loved the contrast between the advice the protagonist gives on her channel and the way she acts in real life. The internet always has been about being who you wish you were.There are other details that really elevated Bo Burnham's first film: the high school girl who is actually really nice - however self-consciously - to the protagonist, and the dad, a guy who wants so desperately to help but just doesn't know how.It's a great movie, and yes, it is painful - but, unlike the work of Solondz, I don't think it's the pain you will remember, but the bittersweetness of it.",Eighth Grade

It felt similar to Lady Bird because both were films comedy-dramas about teenagers growing up. In Eighth Grade's case, the lead character was even younger.Eighth Grade's strengths were its cast and authenticity. Elsie Fisher was a great find for the lead role as a shy and awkward at school, talkative on her YouTube channel, and snappy at her dad. There were some genuinely funny moments. Because of the issues of a young character's struggles to fit in and their hormones running amok the film felt a little like a more grounded version of Big Mouth.

27,CubsandCulture,Nicely observed but pretty flat dramatically (and not very comedic ?),7,10 January 2019,"I went into this film not knowing anything about it other than it was well received. I see that it is listed in a couple of places as a comedy, and it was classified as comedy by the Globes (lord knows that doesn't mean much). If it was meant to be a comedy it wasn't very funny. There are a tone of awkward scenes that can be dramedy in that ""oh ha that is so me"" sort of way. But on that point I didn't feel like the film had a much of comedic tone. I am not really downgrading the film because of this. I thought it was worth mentioning.I am downgrading the film, through, because the fundamentally dynamics of the story fall flat. The large sweep of the narrative becomes apparent once Gabe pops his head of the swimming pool, if not sooner when Aiden looked up in the classroom. The coming age via sexual awakening that the film is structure around simply doesn't engage the viewer the way it should because no sequence or scene fundamentally breaks expectations. Every scene I thought would occur did largely in the manner I was expecting.Nonetheless, the script is smart and there is a ton of nice touches. The Father-daughter relationship, especially, is moving and rings true. The film really does feel like the 8th grade today but of yesteryear as well.

Creating 'how to' vlogs to get through different situations one will encounter, our heroine makes do w/her situation w/an unstoppable positivity which belies the pain she's going through as she has no real friends to speak of & her home life w/her father (the mother has left the family leaving the dad to rear the girl on his own) is no picnic.

34,truemythmedia,Coming of Age for Kids Way Younger than Anyone Reading This,10,19 August 2019,"Normally I'm not a big fan of coming-of-age stories. They are usually dealing with issues that I have settled for myself or, if I haven't yet, probably never will. There are rare exceptions to this rule, however, and it is normally when a coming-of-age film gets a lot of praise from the critical community that I sit up and pay attention.Last year's ""Ladybird"" is a good example of a movie I would never normally see but the critical buzz convinced me. ""Eighth Grade"" is another. Within the first 10 minutes I was hooked.The most important thing in a film like this one, for me at least, is that the main character be likable and relatable. Luckily the Kayla is both of these but in a unique and creative way. Every one has seen movies with the quiet, shy, and nervous girl who seems to always back down to the fears that she has of other kids even though she wants to be cool and fit in. What makes this movie unique is that in between these scenes we also get scenes of her video blog where she gives advice to others on these very topics of acceptance, courage, and being yourself.The juxtaposition of these things makes the scenes between her and the other classmates all the more poignant because we know that the way she is behaving is not the way she wants to be. This sets up, in a very subtle and skilled way, the primary focus of the film. Will Kayla find a way to be the person she is on the inside?As she journeys through this final week of eighth grade there is a little cast of characters that she interacts with who are simply wonderful. She has a visit to the high school where she makes friends with the upperclassman who shows her around, there is a weird boy who she meets at a party who plays awkward as well as Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and don't even get me started on her dad. They are all hilarious and bring out different sides of her character.Her dad is one of the best characters because we get to see them both behave the same way but one of them be scolded for it because she does the things he does in real life through her phone. She is, after all, a child of this millennium so her phone is attached to her hip and the only time she doesn't have it out is when she is on her laptop or swimming. In fact, social media, th internet, and online culture is one of the touchstones of this movie.The film's treatment of technology is probably what made me like it more than the average film of this sort. The movie doesn't scold kids for using phones and doesn't try to teach anyone about them and their dangers. Instead Bo Burnham just lets technology be the way that it is in real life and lets you draw your own conclusions. As a result you get a really balanced film that shows both the positives and negatives of online and IRL (in real life) teen culture.",Eighth Grade

Not a particularly safe haven, but certainly an interesting one. And Bo Burnham's independent film, Eighth Grade, concisely captures the unresolved adolescent emotions, constant peer pressure, social media obsessions, raging hormones and tell-tale acne. The director / screenwriter focuses specifically on the last week of eighth grade before moving on up to high school and tells his coming-of-age tale with much style and skill.We meet Kayla Day, a typically social outcast,. Kayla is preoccupied with creating advice videos to share with her peers. These podcasts are about self-confidence, popularity, and gaining friends of which she has none. She holds her sessions in her bedroom, a fortress of colored lights, teen posters, and private refuge from her doting father, Mark, who is trying to raise his daughter single-handedly and failing miserably due to Kayla's selfishness and mood swings. (If you live with a child of this age, you know the feeling.)The film is very atmospheric, and as character studies go, quite insightful. But plot-wise, it becomes tedious and boring, similar to as Kayla's daily life (and other pre-teens' daily existences). The dialog has an improvised energy, real-sounding, filled with teenage lingo, but far from eloquent. Mr. Burnham creates authentic people and his lead character and her father are point-on. He also depicts the stereotypical studs, nerds, and mean girls effectively. But he strands them all in a dull narrative that has no real conflict for moviegoers to really care.Elsie Fisher plays Kayla and this young actress delivers a natural and believable performance. She conveys all of the angst and awkwardness of today's teenage girls. Josh Hamilton is Kayla's loving dad and he has the only well-written speech about his daughter in the movie. His line delivery is the film's highlight, although his apt words do not match the actions of his tempest of a daughter. Love is blind.As a director, Mr. Burnham is far more successful than writer. Aside from relying too heavily on pop songs to advance the action and heavy-handedly telegraph the character's feelings, he sets up a highly accurate world that young adults confront, a mixed-up universe of ironic situations and troubling missteps. The film displays this rite of passage with unflinching honesty. He makes Kayla vulnerable and shy one moment; unlikable and temperamental the next. A fine balancing act for both Mr. Burnham and the talented Ms. Fisher.Still, there is much to admire in this film, although it needed to expand the plot mechanics to garner more emotional impact.

Elsie Fisher's performance is what I'd refer to as one that elevates the writing. Eighth Grade is ultra-emotional, utterly relatable, and poignantly crafted. Burnham portrays the struggles of Kayla in such a manner that anyone (literally, anyone!) would be able to connect and relate to. At an age where no one older takes you seriously and no one younger understands your troubles, Kayla's transition from middle school to high school is one that's narrated and performed in a very realistic, grounded way.

Sometimes the emotions seemed forced but overall it was entirely convincing.The background story of Kayla was withheld and even then scant details were given. This forced the viewer to focus on the gap between how Kayla aspired to be and how she actually was and her use of coping mechanisms.The daughter and dad relationship Was brilliantly realised.In conclusion, this movie is not for everyone, but it has much to say about the ""ups""and ""downs"" of the smart phone age, (mostly down).

Het vlog clearly is about the Kayla she desperately wants to be. In real live shame and shyness stifle all good intentions.The difference between social media and the real world comes out most purely during a swimming pool party in the house of the beauty queen of the classroom. Kayla hated to visit this party but she did not manage to turn the invitation down. She puts on her swimsuit in the house and then has to run a few meters before she can dive in the swimming pool. During this few meters her (in her own opinion) plump and awkward body is clearly visible for all. It feels just like hell.",Eighth Grade

43,proud_luddite,Accurate in depicting an uncomfortable time of life,7,21 September 2018,"In an unnamed American town/suburb, Kayla Day (Elsie Fisher) is experiencing the last weeks of the life-stage of the title. She is socially awkward and spends a lot of time online with her main focus on posting life advice segments on Youtube.This film is a solid depiction of that most horrible time of life with all of its insecurities and stresses. It can be universally understood by all ages while it is also specific to modern times and the common (and widely accepted) addiction to modern technology. Kayla's trials can be easily understood. She first has to deal with a snooty has-it-all(another phone addict) in the first half; then when her social life improves later on, it is easy to feel her elation after having trudged through so much sludge. One reason the audience feels for Kayla is Fisher's powerful performance. She easily conveys the hormonal mood swings and all else that is typical of that tumultuous time of life. The character of Kayla's single father, Mark (Josh Hamilton) is rather under-developed for most of the film although he does have a solid scene near the end which fills much of the gap. Also, while the film is bang-on in the accuracy of one of the worst years in any typical life, it sometimes goes against itself by being too accurate which sometimes leaves one feeling intensely uncomfortable and even depressed at times. But ""Eighth Grade"" still shows a lot of courage in digging deep into some very awkward life situations. It deserves credit for that.",Eighth Grade

45,gizmomogwai,Smells Like Teen Dispirited,9,2 September 2018,"Eighth Grade is one of those rare movies, particularly out of modern Hollywood, that takes an honest eye to the dawning teen years and pulls it off with flying colours. I'm male, and my worst year was by far ninth, not eighth grade, but I saw a lot of myself in Kayla (who, after all, is going into ninth). You can look at this and say there's no conflict in her life- you have to understand that a story's plot can revolve around internal, not only external conflict. Kayla is a character with a lot of anxiety and a shy girl; she struggles with herself, and we feel her pain. In fact, in some scenes, I downright felt her terror- the truth or dare scene was nail-biting stuff, and the fact that she was the one apologizing for it was so true it hurt. Kayla is sympathetic, but she's a real teen- we feel that in her mood swings, and her awkward relationship with her embarrassing dad. He's a good guy, but she still throws a banana at him after being caught in an embarrassing sexual experiment, no fault of his. We laugh at Kayla, but in a way, we're laughing with Kayla, the 18-year-old Kayla who will be looking back at herself after opening her time capsule from eighth grade.Coming-of-age stories have been done many, many times before. Kudos to Eighth Grade for updating it- the constant social media is something Boyhood (2014) touched on, but didn't explore in-depth. (Having been planned out in 2002, Boyhood's filmmakers couldn't have known the impact smartphones and Facebook/Twitter/YouTube would have.) The school shooter drill, the fact that there even is such a thing, says a lot as well. Passing grades!",Eighth Grade
46,maurice_yacowar,Introverted teenager struggles to connect in smartphone alienated world,10,30 August 2018,"There are so many beauties in this heart-breaking glimpse into contemporary adolescence.
 It opens on Kayla's YouTube video - a halting advice to kids to ""be yourself."" Whatever that is, however to be it, that is the mystery engaged. These videos afford Kayla the appearance of confidence, self-knowledge, poise, success, in which her real life falls short.
 Kayla's day begins with her following a make-up instructional video to put on her face. Only then does she video herself waking up (""Ugh!!""). In scene after scene we watch her facial acne gradually reappear under her fading make-up. The film is about preparing a face to meet the faces that we meet. 
 It's also an anthropological record of the smart phone generation. The teens seem constantly plugged in, whether it's Kayla at dinner or in her bed or the snotty Kennedy and her friend together/apart in the school halls. This constant connection betrays a tragic alienation. 
 Kayla's scenes with her ""shadow,"" the four-years-older Olivia and her friends, replay that dynamic at another level. Olivia needs Kayla to be ""cool,"" ""awesome,"" to confirm herself. Riley's backseat seduction attempt is a harsher version of the needy pretending to be strong. Kayla's humbling there ends her YouTube pretence to grace. 
 Her crush Aiden is the wouldbe bad boy, with his cool swagger, mouth-farts and rep for demanding sexy photos. Happily, Kayla abandons her training to give blow jobs and instead settles into the more civilized dinner party with Kennedy's much nicer cousin Gabe. Over chicken nuggets and fries, across a long dining room table, Gabe and Kayla self-consciously attempt something so old-fashioned, a conversation. 
 This wonderful scene balances the pool party where they met. Kayla didn't want to go to the party that Kennedy didn't want to invite her to. The insistence comes from Kayla's father and Kennedy's mother. 
 At the party Kayla's slow approach to the pool conveys her excruciating fear, her sense of inadequacy, indeed shame. Her disastrous bathing suit emphasizes the inferiority she feels around those carefree, buoyant beauties. Only Gabe shows any interest in her. He challenges her to a breath-holding competition, then shows off his pool handstand. Their dinner date is a hopeful parallel to this scene. 
 As Kayla's second ""time capsule"" box suggests, the struggle for a confident identity doesn't end at any point in school - or any time soon after, as we elders know. Kennedy's mom's apparent interest in Kayla's dad suggest these needs and ploys continue past puberty into adulthood, if not indeed adultery.
 As the film examines Kayla's age-appropriate self-centredness we don't learn much about the other characters. In her scenes with her father he tries to connect and she snappishly rejects him. 
 They finally connect when he helps her burn her old box of dreams. Sensing her despair, he pours out his own emotions. He recalls his old fears about how he would raise her when her mother left them. He tells Kayla how much he loves and respects her and how confident he is in her ability to handle herself. She leaps into his embrace. 
 This connection should sustain Kayla - until her next everyday challenge.",Eighth Grade
47,aciessi,Expand your Spaz,9,4 August 2018,"In Ninth Grade, I had an english teacher who was an aspired blue's musician by hobby. He made it a point to make us study the art of Blues music in his curriculum and asked of us to write a Blues song of our own. For all of us in the class, especially me, afraid of making music or at the very least, singing it to the class, he tried to help us reconsider by repeating the phrase, ""Expand your spaz"". What does that mean? Simply put, to have enough confidence to leave your comfort zone and try something new. It was at that moment I was forced to ""Expand my spaz"", and I totally hated every minute of it. I recited my ghastly crafted Blues song ""Study Hall"" with my back turned to the entire room. I couldn't face my snickering, adolescent classmates. No rhythm, no grace, I read it completely monotone. I felt a light brush hit my back. It was a paper ball someone threw at me. Flash forward to Twelfth grade, when I stared in a Theatrical production of John Cariani's ""Almost, Maine"". When you ""Expand your spaz"" there's no turning back.This is the essence of Eighth Grade, the new independent summer sleeper by Bo Burnham, and it's bound to become one of the most important films I've ever watched. Important because, perhaps for the first time, I can point to an onscreen character and say definitively ""That's me right there"". Kayla, played heroically by a new American star, Elsie Fisher, is a character as close to my personal childhood experience as any film has ever captured. A film that unflinchingly looks into not simply the stereotypical ""awkward"" times of the middle school child, but the enhanced torture it is for someone with crippling social anxiety. Kayla has a big personality and a heart that wants to break free. But she's relegated to the deep depths of social media to express how she really feels. By day, she is the nobody of her high school. The only girl awarded ""Most Quiet"" as a year-end superlative. Trapped and timid is she to find her corner in the non-digital world. For me it was watching movies, for her it is V-logging on YouTube to a nonexistent audience. But with the guidance of her quirky father, she begins taking chances. From the positive, like making friends with a High School senior life coach, to the negative, where a young boy attempts a crude sexual advance during a game of ""truth or dare"". Kayla tears her wall down and let's the world beyond her bedroom in and by the film's end, she learns that she's grown and became the girl she always wanted to be. She feels normal. She is normal.Cinematically, Bo Burnham amplifies the internal anxiety and fear of Kayla so powerfully, it makes it's audience squirm. Every blemish and boil is visible. It's a virtual reality experience without the cockamamie goggles. We live vicariously through Kayla's world and we want her to win, desperately. When she falls, we feel for her. When she cries, we cry. When she longingly looks at the hot boy in school, we revert back to glory days of first love and sweaty palms. There's a little something we can all relate to with Kayla. For millennial especially, it's mandatory viewing. While I didn't go to school when nearly all students were head's deep in their smart phones or substituting fire drills with mass-shooter drills (disgusting that this even has to be done these days), the challenges that Kayla faces are timeless. It opens nation wide this weekend and it deserves the blockbuster treatment.",Eighth Grade
48,rockman182,Eighth Grade (2018),8,18 July 2018,"A24 with another home run again. Hands down, the best production company going today. A gold mine of great films to boot. As soon as I heard about this film I knew this was going to be good. It looked funny, oddly relatable, and like something that was going to be important, especially for today's generation. It was all of that in all honesty. This film is also heralded by an incredibly effortless (but fantastic) performance by Elsie Fischer.The film is really a coming of age film about an eight grader named Kayla Day, as she gets ready to transition to high school. Kayla is quiet and somewhat lonely but is a very expressive person especially through her video blog. She attempts to make new friends, while juggling a relationship with her father, her crush, and everything else in between. You know, the regular middle school stuff. This is the first directional effort from comedian, Bo Burnham.From the minute the film starts its humorous. Kayla is the epitome of a modern day young girl in a way. She's wrapped up on her phone and social media. She has a crush on the empty headed guy in her class. She wants to be friends with the popular girls. She struggles with self esteem issues. However, she's not that simple and is beyond her years. She's actually smart in reflecting on herself, life, and how to learn from her mistakes. Its a fairly interesting character study that is so relevant for today's generation.It is definitely easy to identify with a lot of the awkardness associated with social interactions and growing up in this film. This is an extremely impressive debut for Bo Burnham, really sharp writing and contextual in all aspects. Elsie Fischer is downright fantastic in this film. One of the realest performances of the year. Pretty much a breakthrough performance for her and Burnham all in one. This little effort ends up being one of the best films of the summer.8/10",Eighth Grade
49,cultfilmfan,Eighth Grade,10,5 August 2018,"As I write this review, for me personally, it has been almost 20 years since I was both in and graduated from my eighth grade class. In seeing a movie about what the eighth grade is like in 2018 as opposed to 1999 and 2000, it really is quite amazing at both the similarities of when I was there and also things, particularly involving technological advancements that now play a large role both in the lives of the students, but also in their education as well. This film is different in the aspect that in the classroom, hallways, cafeteria and pretty much anywhere they can, their iPhones are accessible and there seems almost to be a lack of communication verbally between students and their peers and most of the conversation is written down via text messages being sent not just periodically, but frequently throughout the day. I did not have that when I was in the eighth grade and when you look at cell phones from back in that time period, they were big clunky things and only a select number of people had them and it was not at all in pretty much the normal way of things as this current culture and generation has made of it. Facebook was also not invented till I finished college and I have had many opportunities to use it, but still to this day I choose not to and with the recent information that users of Facebook have pretty much had their identities sold for a profit to other companies, I am glad I took the stance I did and continue to not use it. Nevermind the fact that I still believe that a lot of this technology has taken away what used to be a simple everyday thing of actually talking and engaging with one another in conversations. Now it seems like a fine art and even when I see people both at my workplace, or in the local shopping mall, most people tend to have their head bent over and engaging in who knows what on their cellular phone. The main character of this film is also constantly on her phone checking videos, posting videos and basically liking all the new posts, videos and pictures that become available. I am not in school now and nor do I plan to be again, but I can certainly sense that all this liking and disliking and trying to meet your peers approval over social media must be an extremely vexing if not downright depressing thing. Also look over the years at all the bullying that has also been done with this so called great technology. It has lead to embarassment, being ostracized and sometimes even sadly suicide of people who were so young that they barely even had a taste of what their future had in store for them. The whole technological advancement is certainly a big change and I would personally hope that within the school system that there is more done to keep it under control and that people do actually engage in conversations and extra curricular activites because if not we are a society that will not only get dumber, but more and more socially awkward and this is not something that I think anyone would agree is a good thing. Many things after all these years do still stay the same within the middle school and high school years as well and these include such things such as trying to fit in, personal insecurity, bullying, making friends as well as a little thing called hormones which is about to really come into play about that grade. Our main character here is pretty much an ordinary girl going through ordinary situations and emotions and yet because I have been in her shoes so to speak, there were times during the film that I just wanted to give her a hug and let her know that it would all be okay and that those few years we spend in school will not dictate the rest of our lives, but even if I was to say that to my teenage self all those years ago, would it have helped, or would I have believed it? I know of more and more people now who have decided to home school their children and for probably some very good reasons as well as some negative including my fear that it may isolate the children too much and may become a detriment to their social skills as they get older, but I think that most people would agree that there are problems with the current system. Eighth Grade does not try to answer any of these dilemmas and quite frankly sometimes I got downright uncomfortable watching this young girl go from one difficult situation to another, but at the same time it was refreshing in the sense that this isn't new just for this generation, but from mine too and the one before and also the next. This is a film that deals with this subject with great honesty and also has a deep sense of humanity and empathy for our characters. It shows that if we stick it out it may, or may not get better, but things will eventually hopefully come our way and school is such a short part of our lives even though it is so influential in good ways and bad. This is a marvellously astute film that has one of the best scripts in quite some time and the acting is so natural and honest that it ranks with some of the year's best performances. Whatever age you are, you should see this film if you are a student, or parent and it should be a jolt to your senses and may hopefully invoke changes within the schools and more ways to help our youngsters. One of the year's best films.",Eighth Grade

54,Movi3DO,Uncomfortably good,8,20 June 2021,"Good lord my 8th grade ain't like this.A movie about a girl spending her last year of middle school.Since it's directed by Bo Burnham, I wasn't surprised to see some dark and realistic stuff. It was honestly one of the most uncomfortable movie to sit through, in a good way. Although I didn't relate through everything the main character went through, I couldn't help but imagine myself in her situation, and I was pretty sure I would be cringe like her.Also uncomfortable were the short YouTube videos that our main character made. Elsie Fisher was excellent as a shy girl who was naive and lonely. Whenever she was in a social situation, the movie voiced one of her YouTube videos where she attempted to give advices. These scenes, despite seemingly exposing her hypocrisy, emphasized the naivety of many young kids like her.Another uncomfortable aspect was her father. I felt bad for him and how awkward it was for him with a child going through a phase. Sometimes it seemed like what he tried for his daughter just made the situation worse. Near the end, his action sounded contradictory to what I saw in the movie, but at the same time it was sweet and the only thing that the daughter needed.Overall, it was a great movie that I would not see again. 8.5/10.",Eighth Grade

One of the most boring movies of 2018 and, definitely, one of the most boring protagonists I've ever seen. Nothing happens in this movie and I really do not understand how it can be considered one of the best of the year. One of the things that annoyed me most is that all the characters are uninteresting and do nothing creative and stay in front of the phone all day. Do not waste your time on this movie. it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. It was sometimes hard to watch, and at times just blatantly uncomfortable, but I expected more from what I had been hearing about it. The dad was not impossibly perfect; his attempts at connecting with his daughter are painful to watch (not because he has a bad heart, but on the contrary)... He even stalked her in a shopping mall, that was super weird. probably he had impossibly perfect intentions, but a perfect character would be able to be accomplished in such intentions. I think he fell short. I had a different take on the father. I thought he was completely clueless with dealing with his daughter I think there was nothing he could do ""right"" in her mind. He also seems to struggle to find the right words during the bonfire scene until he lets go of this desire to be a great dad and tells her how he truly feels.",Eighth Grade

Her mum is noticeably absent but we never really learn the reasons why, I would have liked this aspect explored a little more.The film works well because the central character is an image conscience girl, like they all are in teenage years.

She goes through so many different and awkward situations in her live just because she wants to fit in, be recognized, be heard. It is so relatable in many ways which made it just great. I just kept screaming at the screaming: Girl dont do that..... because we all know how certain things ended up. And no matter how popular we were at school, we all went through awkward situations.
Elsie Fisher perfectly portrays this coming of age girl with the right charm and depth that is needed for the role. For sure one of the most beautiful performances of this year and one that will definitely go down as the most interesting and memorable breakthrough performances.
Another clap for Josh Hamilton who was simply perfect as her good hearted and wise father. A guy who really understands the trouble of a teenager and tries to make the best out of it and tries to do things right, and even tho he does, he still do them all wrong. A great character and a very warm hearted performance by Hamilton.
A great reason why this film works so good is that it doesnt show you a depressing or bleak view on those hard years, no, the film is actually quite funny and plays well on the thin line between drama and comedy.

62,apryla-58795,"""Uh ok sure like cool yeah whatever""",10,1 March 2019,"Eighth Grade directed by Bo Burnham (The Big Sick) centers around Kayla Day (Elsie Fisher) and her last week of Eighth Grade. Elsie is an awkward teen trying to find her way in life. She doesn't have any friends and is very quiet so she isn't exactly putting herself out there in order to make friends. Elsie's Dad Mark (Josh Hamilton) is loving and supportive and tries to have a relationship with her but because she's a teen girl she wants nothing to do with him. He has raised Elsie by himself as Elsie's mom left when she was still a baby.Elsie makes YouTube videos that no one watches. Most of her videos are her talking about having confidence which she lacks. Her videos make it out to be that she is super confident when she is anything but.The movie follows Elsie as she finds herself in many awkward situations. She gets invited to mean girl Kennedy's birthday party (played by Catherine Oliviere) only because the Mom (Missy Yager) makes Kennedy invite Elsie. She goes to the party and except for a brief exchange with fellow nerdy student Gabe (Jake Ryan) and some karaoke she spends most of it by herself. Her gift to Kennedy is met with unappreciative rudeness. She calls her dad to come get her early.Elsie has a crush on fellow student Aiden (Luke Prael) who shows no interest in her until she lies about having dirty pictures of herself on her phone. He asks her if she can give a BJ and she lies and says she's pretty good at it. Nothing ever comes of their exchange.One day Elsie's class goes to the High School they will attend in the fall to shadow a senior in order to have a high school experience. Elsie is partnered up with super sweet Olivia (Emily Robinson). Elsie really likes Olivia and wants to be friends with her. Olivia invites her to the mall one night to hang out with her and her friends-Aniyah (Imani Lewis), Trevor (Fred Hechinger) and Riley (Daniel Zolghadri). They sit in the food court and talk while Elsie watches awkwardly. When it's time to go Riley drives Olivia and Elsie to their homes. He drops off Olivia first and then pulls off to the side of the road to talk to Elsie in the backseat. He asks her if she wants to play truth or dare. He leads things to the point where he has his shirt off and is asking her to do the same. She is very uncomfortable and tells him so and he makes her feel bad about it. Finally he takes her home. She is distraught and her Dad tries to comfort her.Elsie is now feeling disillusioned and makes a video saying that she won't be making videos for awhile. She suggests her ""followers"" get advice from someone else as she is not the best one to take it from.Elsie made a time capsule before she went into middle school. She asks her dad to help her burn the box. When he asks her what is in it she tells him ""hopes and dreams."" Elsie is realizing that all the optimism and hopefulness she had when she was younger is slowly being erased by learning hard truths about other people and life in general. She doesn't want memories of that naivety any longer. She asks her dad if she makes him sad because she feels like she would be sad if she had a daughter one day like herself. Her dad tells her that she makes him happy. He wishes she could see herself the way he does and he tells her that he isn't worried about her because she turned out so well. Elsie hugs her dad.Elsie gets invited over to Gabe's house where he has prepared a plate of chicken nuggets and fries for her. They exchange some awkward small talk but soon realize they are having a good time with one another. Gabe tells Elsie that he has watched some of her videos and thinks she's really wise. Elsie's dad picks her up and she tells him she had a good time. She is smiling and happy.On graduation day she walks up to Kennedy and tells her off stating that if she wouldn't always try to be so cool she would realize certain things. She walks off smiling - proud that she spoke her mind.Elsie makes one last video to herself that she can view upon graduating from high school. She says that she hopes high school was good and that she won't miss her friends too much when she goes off to college. She asks if she has a boyfriend and if she does she hopes he's nice because she deserves that.My thoughts-I would imagine this won't be for everyone. It is very slow and nothing really happens. It is a very realistic portrayal of a typical teenage girl's middle school experience. It's awkward cringeworthy and hard to watch which sums up middle school life perfectly. Many moviegoers do not want reality when they watch a movie. This does not mean the movie is bad-far from it. It was done very well. It should be required watching for everyone especially Dads who are about to have a daughter enter middle school. It shows the pressure girls have to look and act a certain way. It also shows how sexual situations are presented to them without them fully understanding much about sex. Most of them turn to the internet or friends for graphic information they may not be ready to process. It shows how young boys are motivated by sex and how they manipulate girls into sending them nude photos and pressure them into sexual situations they aren't ready for. It shows how girls have been conditioned to be polite even in situations that threaten their health or safety. If anything this is a great movie for starting conversations with teenage children. Middle school is hard enough without having to worry about mean girls, boys pressuring you for sex or nude photos. This movie shows why it is so important for a child to have loving parents to guide and protect them.Elsie Fisher did a good job but I'm not sure how much that has to do with the fact that she was an eighth grader around the same time this was filmed. It will be interesting to see her career unfold in order to be able to tell if she has range or not. I will say that I like that the director used a realistic girl for the part instead of using an established actress that has perfect skin, teeth and body proportions that they then try to make ugly to fit the part. It wouldn't have had the same effect.I liked the actor who played Gabe. He gave off a real Woody Allen type vibe. That's a sore spot with some people I realize. I'm not saying it's a good or bad thing I'm just making an observation about the actor's mannerisms.Josh Hamilton did a great job as the dad. He acted like a typical dad just trying to make some type of connection with his daughter as she continually pushed him away with a mean surly attitude. Teens are kind of like a dog that has been abused-even though they will growl and bite you they will eventually warm up to you but it takes a lot of time and patience and even after all that you still can't trust you won't get ""bit"" at some point again. Teens act like they don't want their parents around but they also crave the love and attention. They need it at that time in their life the most. The teen years are when kids can become involved in stuff that can really screw up their lives forever if they don't have some kind of guiding voice and example of how to make good choices in all the situations they will find themselves in.This was so spot on. It showed how kids are on their phones all the time. They don't even look up or around or acknowledge others.It's unfortunate that kids have to go through middle school at a time in their lives when they are the least equipped with the emotional maturity that is needed to navigate such uncharted territory. The whole experience is so awkward and in the long run it doesn't matter but at that time everything seems like the end of the world.This movie also did a good job portraying how most people move through life depending or whether or not they win the genetic lottery. Not that all good looking people are uninteresting or that all unnatractive people are interesting but it's more that attractive people don't have to try. They can just sit there and do nothing and people want to be around them. And many of the genuinely interesting people are pushed off to the side. Prime example is the boy she had a crush on. He was a little creep but she thought he was cute so his lack of character was overlooked. She wasn't the best looking and not popular but as soon as she said she had dirty photos and could give BJ's he was showing interest. Shows how boys that age are mostly out for one thing. It's sad cause girls think if a boy shows any interest in them at that age it's because they really like them for them but it's more likely because they want to have sex with them.I think the line in this movie that sums up eighth grade in a nutshell is when Elsie tells her dad, ""Text me when you're here and DON'T come inside!"" Love that.Some might say ""I don't have to watch this...I've LIVED it!"" And that would be correct but if you are removed from it about 20-30 years it's not a bad way to remind yourself that it WASN'T the end of the world, you DID survive AND you made it through.",Eighth Grade
63,elicopperman,Wonderful Commentary on Today's Youth,8,11 August 2018,"It's not easy to come across a film that successfully captures the awkward period of early teenagerhood. Thankfully, comedian Bo Burnham has made a film just like that, his feature directing debut called Eighth Grade. Burnham is definitely in tuned with today's generation that is raised on YouTube and Instagram, having started his career on social media. After seeing the film itself, I guarantee that this movie will speak to many young people like me, regardless if it's rated R or not.The film centers around eighth-grader Kayla Day, who goes through many struggles during her last week of classes prior to entering high school. From the opening scene alone, we understand Kayla's character and emotions rather quickly. The awkward tone is executed brilliantly through Kayla's barely viewed Youtube videos, especially with her using a series of ""ums"" and ""likes"" to collect herself. In addition, Elsie Fisher does a fantastic job presenting the sympathetic side of Kayla and her constant mood swings, showing how relatable the character truly is. However, the most dramatic aspects come from Kayla's relationship with her father, who seems just as anxious about Kayla's strange life as she does, helping to create the right amount of emotional depth.Burnham's screenplay manages to come off as modern without trying too hard, mainly by how it displays the preteen's vocabulary. At some point in their lives, all kids have done immature things, especially when transitioning from childhood to young adulthood. There's a sense of earnest intent through the inanity of the teens' conversations, making the dialogue come off as genuine rather than forced or pretentious. Some films try to display childhood and teen years as upbeat and cheery, but this film knows the truth about pre adolescence, and it embraces it superbly.The coolest visual tricks the film uses is showcasing the abundance of apps that the teens of today are into, and a unique montage of Kayla scrolling past her social media feeds. Both of those methods manage to visually describe youngster's appeal to the likes of Instagram and YouTube. Another neat touch is how Burnham displays the adults desperately trying to get in on the trendy fads, creating a lot of embarrassing humor that comes from old generations being hip and cool without even knowing why. I think the cinematography could've been a little brighter in some shots, but that's just a nitpick.Never have I seen a film that has succeeded in showcasing the media obsessed generation and the awkwardness of late middle school years this well. Bo Burnham seems to have a bright future ahead of him in the movies with Eighth Grade. Even if the film may hit too close to home for some, it's remarkable to see a filmmaker kickstart his career with a film that tackles the difficulties faced by tweens as they enter their later years. I myself relate to this film on a persona level, because I myself went through an early developmental crisis like Kayla. Her shy introverted persona really spoke to me, and I'm sure it'll do the same for you. Give this film a watch to see how realistic of a time early teen years truly are.",Eighth Grade
64,ronakkotian,Hits so close to home!,9,8 September 2021,"Bo Burnham is one of the most talented comedians I know. His recent special, Inside, was one of the best films to come out this year. With Eighth Grade, Bo Burnham continues to show his immense skill.Eighth Grade is about Kayla, an introverted teenage girl, as she navigates her way through her final week in eighth grade.From the coming-of-age tales I've seen relating to school, none of them have managed to capture the authenticity of what it's like going through that period as well as Eighth Grade. If you've ever been an unconfident or shy individual during school then Eighth Grade is going to hit very close to home like it did for me. The level of understanding Bo Burnham has for teenagers of this generation as well as social media is very impressive. There are so many details, small and big, that contribute to Burnham's honest portrayal of an eighth grader's life. It's so good to see actors that actually look like they belong in eighth grade rather than looking like they're in their twenties. I also love how Kayla actually has acne as there are so many films that give teenagers the perfect skin. It's small details like that which make me appreciate how much Burnham cared for this story. Another aspect that many filmmakers don't portray properly is social media. It's so gratifying to see someone like Bo Burnham actually depict social media in the way it is. The amount of teenagers constantly on the phone and the long duration of time they're on the phone is depicted so well and accurately reflects today's generation.Burnham's script is filled with many wonderful and cringey moments. He manages to set up so many relatable situations that look like they're going to work in Kayla's favour but we, the audience, know that's not going to be the case. He merely shows these situations as they are without adding any style to it. It's the sheer simplicity of the dialogues and presentation that make these scenes hit so hard. Burnham tackled the difference in generation between the kids and parents so well with Josh Hamilton's character. Hamilton does an excellent job playing Kayla's dad as he's trying to fit in with today's generation, creating some emotionally powerful moments. All the actors do a great job but I have to give a special mention to Elsie Fisher as Kayla. She's so likeable in the role and conveys Kayla's discomfort and want to fit in incredibly well. She's truly phenomenal here and has a very promising career.I didn't expect to like Eighth Grade this much but I'm amazed by how well Bo Burnham was able to provide a realistic depiction of that stage in a person's life. Directing kids, especially for your first feature, isn't an easy task but Burnham managed to succeed with ease. This is one of the best directorial debuts I've seen and is a film I'm going to keep close to my heart.",Eighth Grade
65,Azanspy,A different attempt in this genre.,8,2 December 2018,I like school life movies. Eighth Grade is also a good school life movie showing the difficulties by outcasts (shy girls).

68,andrewroy-04316,"Uniquely accurate and relatable, a remarkable modern coming-of-age film",9,21 July 2018,"While I was very excited for Eighth Grade, Burnham's direction and Fisher's performance, as well as the general feel of the movie, blew me away. What stands out more than anything in this movie is the exceptionally realistic depiction of middle school and the characters around Kayla. Burnham absolutely nailed what it's like growing up in the social media age, and how that shifts both social dynamics as well as family dynamics. The themes were many and all very real, centered on doing things for acceptance and popularity along with the struggle of being yourself vs being cool. Kayla's videos were very well done, and I loved the juxtapositions of her advice with how she struggles to execute those ideas, and how those videos were as much for herself as they are for other people. The way the movie was shot was excellent - lots of focus on her facial expressions and attention to detail in the shots. Like other extremely well-directed movies, each scene contributed significantly to the plot and had the atmosphere of seeing things from Kayla's perspective, whether discomfort in a social situation or going through social media. It packs humor and lots of emotion and development into a surprisingly short time.The characters around Kayla and her interactions with them are what give Eighth Grade such a genuine feel. First and foremost, Fisher is absolutely exceptional in the lead, with one of the best performances I've ever seen. She demonstrates emotion and nuance in Kayla's struggles to be kind and herself while also popular. Her body language, speech patterns, and responses in interactions are all so consistent and reveal a great deal throughout the movie. Hamilton also does a great job as her father, trying to strike the balance between knowing what's going on and being friendly with giving her space, and not always succeeding or knowing what to say, but doing his best. The variation and dynamic nature of peers she meets also always felt like people she could really meet going through a day of middle school. The script was excellent, and the lighting and music was also appropriate. At the end of the day, it shows the imperfect, frustrating realities of adolescent social life and development as well as any movie I've ever seen, and will always be one of my top picks as a top-notch coming of age story.",Eighth Grade

I was very excited to see this film after all its critical acclaim and because I absolutely love A24. This movie was fantastic. It was real and you could relate to it. Elsie Fisher as Kayla was so good. She was funny, entertaining, and relatable. Her dad, played by Josh Hamilton, was also very good. Bo Burnham did very well with directing and writing. I haven't seen any of his other films but now I'm eager to see them. The score by Anna Meredith was amazing. It captures the tone of the scenes so well and it had this nice techno sound to it. This is a movie that everyone should see. I know they announced that in the U.S. on Wednesday August 8th (tomorrow) that it would be playing free in all theaters it's showing at and the rated r restrictions would not be enforced. It could have been PG-13 had f**k not been used 10 times. The only slight problem I had with it was that it was kind of predictable and we've seen some of the content before in other films, but nevertheless it was amazing. I can see some Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for it. Definitely see Eighth Grade.My Grade: A",Eighth Grade

But, don't let the haters fool you - this is an accurate depiction of eighth grade. Your ability to relate to this film will have a lot to do with your hormone levels and knowledge of the world back in eighth grade, or at 13-14 years old. This should be considered an all-ages film, because the people that most need to see this film would be people younger than eighth graders (to help them cope with life at that age) and the people old enough to be parenting eighth graders.As for the content, at times this film plays like an edge-of-your-seat thriller - this is not a boring kids film.

73,Offworld_Colony,A really artistically sure and universally relatable film for all ages that manages to not feel low budget and is both of it's time...,10,14 February 2020,"...more than any film I've ever seen, and also timeless in its themes.Beyond the obvious and initial reads about social media based on legend Bo Burnham, Eighth Grade manages to cover a hell of a lot of topics revolving around being on the cusp of adulthood and finding who you are, your boundaries and how to like yourself.The YouTube segments are brilliant, as well as all the authentic social media presence and representation in the film, but moreover they are a brilliant device to allow Kayla to speak to herself, something which is evident part way through the film; as she discovers who and how she wants to be.Elsie Fisher is sublime, she delivers simultaneously one of the funniest performances and one of the most empathetic and realistic performances I've ever, ever seen. She had me laughing with every line reading and every tic and every stumble. I fully felt like her Dad in the movie.The Father (looking like Bo Burnham suspiciously) and Elsie's conversation around the fire had me in floods of tears. I wanted to reach out and hug her so much and thinking about her purity and her honestly in that moment has me nearly in tears the day after thinking about it. And then at the end I was laughing and crying at the same time. It's an incredibly cathartic experience for anyone who went through a reasonably traditional schooling experience.Bo Burnham directs this film like a film and not like a documentary, and yet it's intimate, it's not artless.The music is sublime. Underscoring what she doesn't say. It's us viewing her world in ways we know. The soundtrack punctuates perfectly and the pervading sense of anxiety and dread in every frame and in almost everything she doesn't want to do. Anxiety is dealt with in a really earthen and subtle way, true but not triggering.The score underscores the paradoxes of both elation and dread and the film isn't without its dark scenes; when she's apologising after not doing anything wrong it's so painful without being disgusting or twisted. We hope she isn't left with any scars. But what blossoms is the wonder of seeing someone who acts the way they want to because it doesn't matter if she does well to others. But just to her.The film has the air of shortly looking back, not from the perspective of someone in the 8th Grade, but someone perhaps looking back at a time capsule and remembering which is why it's used as such a clever device int he film. It portrays the youth in a knowing but also a slightly heightened way, the kind of way memory works, like Bo Burnham looking back authentically.I was interested as to where it would go and desired for no clichés, and in that it delivers largely, the film is focused on the moments between the drama, that are the real drama. And as a character study, it's so interesting to watch how things can compound and alter a person on a week by week basis. Or when you can't stand yourself, who you used to be, who you are now, and fear who you may end up being. That spongebob moment is a great silent offering of this feeling. And wonderfully and appropriately the film is utter cringe and reminds me of the time I didn't know who I was with aplomb. It evolves to a person finding themselves. And who hasn't had to do that at some point? Eighth grade or otherwise.There's a moment during a later Vlog where in passing she mentions ""...I don't know if anyone cares..."" My Fiance just yelled ""We Care!"" And we do. And anyone who feels alone, should try and remember this.",Eighth Grade
74,ethanbresnett,An open and awkward look into pre-teen life,7,12 April 2020,"Bo Burnham did a fantastic job of capturing the angst of youth in Eighth Grade, presenting a really open, uncomfortable, awkward and charming look into the life of a teen girl on the cusp of high school.Despite the fact that I'm not American and went to school in the UK, a lot of Kayla's experiences and feelings felt familiar. There is something universal about this film that everybody will be able to relate to in some respect. Messages of belonging, trying to fit in by being something you aren't, slowly learning that that isn't the way to be exploring the relationship with a parent. It is these messages that give this film its gravity and charm, producing a very delicate and thought provoking piece of cinema.This film is listed as Drama/Comedy online, and personally I think it is much more heavily in the drama category. I didn't really find myself laughing loads and found the drama and emotion to be the real take away from the film. What comedy there was was very nuanced and situational, this isn't along the same vain as Booksmart etc in its humour.Elsie Fisher was great as Kayla, with her relationship with her dad feeling very believable and real. With reference to my earlier comment, the type of person that Kayla is playing is so real, making the film feel very nostalgic in a sense. This wasn't an overly stylised portrayal of youth, but a very realistic one which I haven't really seen in a film before. Its such a human story and these are always great to watch in my opinion. Full credit to Burnham for nailing his feature film debut.I don't think Eighth Grade will necessarily be for everyone and will perhaps strike a chord more with younger audiences given the context. Saying that I would recommend that everybody give it a go as the experiences of Kayla are not limited simply to youth, but ultimately can be felt by anybody at any stage of their life.",Eighth Grade
75,MovieCriticOnline,I have been looking forward to seeing this movie FOREVER,3,27 September 2018,"The trailer was amazing and had been dying to see it. So I started to watch hoping I was gonna love it. Starts a little slow compared to how the trailer painted it. (The opening monologue is way too long)A few extras looking too much into the camera in a distracting way and overdoing their background work. A few camera shots were jarring and distracting. Minor things, but surprised.Too much music driving the scenes. It almost starts to feel like a music video. As soon as one song stopped and it felt like just being a movie instead of a musical montage, another track started. By the pool that started to get REALLY annoying. Less music and quicker cuts would have been better. Music was also too loud. Whoever was in charge of the music should be fired. What a shame.JESUS!! They literally could not let the movie play for 30 seconds without starting a new track!! It went throughout the whole movie, until toward the end. It ruined it!!No coherent story. Just random scenes that constantly digressed from one focus to another. No one story-line ever really completed. It was almost like it wasn't written, but not in a good way. Sometimes I felt it was overwritten so it was odd.Some of the scenes were a little too forced and unnatural like they were pushing the cringe too much and not creating a balance of emotions. Some were just straight up staged like the hallway where she faces the two popular girls who are ignoring her on their phones.There was a lot of humor inferred in the trailer, but it was actually mostly cringe and very little humor.SO DISAPPOINTED!

Director: Bo Burnham
Watched: 2/2/19
Rating: 4/5Bo Burnham's feature film debut. Reminiscent of a fellow A1 film aeuter Sean Baker. Bright colors, pastels, music is its own character. Soundtrack is tailored to each scene, and often makes the scene.Acting is mediocre with most minor characters, e.g. characters Kennedy and Olivia overdone with the insincere, shallow teenager stereotypes (maybe that was the point). Jake Ryan as Gabe, even with his minimal screen time, was adorable (chicken nugget monologue, anyone?) Josh Hamilton as single father Mark Day was well done; the ineptitude and inelegance he displayed while trying to connect to his teenage daughter, yet one could always see how hard he was trying in his mind, and how torn he was between doing the right thing and doing what he thought would win Kayla over. Elsie Fisher stole the show playing our young heroine. She played the awkwardness, the insecurities, and exemplifies a tween's unreasonable logic beautifully.Everything that irked me here only further went to show how accurate Burnham got the teenage angst and insecurities in this era. Very specific to Millennials, breeded on social media. What irked me? The incessant screens, the use of ""like"" every few seconds, the clear dependence and belief that social media is gospel.From young Kayla Day's perspective, we see and feel an innocent coming of age for today's tween. (It might be important to note here that because it is almost strictly from a first person point of view, we miss out on truly understanding the other characters. Viewers may find themselves wondering about their backstories; having trouble connecting to other characters.) A large part of the runtime was used to play Kayla's videos on her barely viewed YouTube Channels, in which she found herself on her internal soapbox, passing out advice on various topics, from boys to self-esteem- all very relevant to her peers. Most importantly, however, this was the only venue in which she was comfortable to truly be herself, making this an important window into who she really was and how she was really feeling. This was Kayla's outlet, her therapy, her opportunity to ignore any peer pressure and societal expectations. Last but not least, it is these videos- from the first video she makes to herself at the beginning of eighth grade to the last one she sends to the future Kayla at the end of middle school- that truly elucidates to the viewer how much she had learned and grown in the course of the film. Like bookends, they mark the beginning and end of our time with the remarkably courageous Kayla Day. Courageous how? In this day and age, staying true to yourself as best as you can in the intense world of brutal teenagers is a feat.Millennials have certainly grown up differently. Imagine, never knowing anything but technology. MySpace is no longer relevant, the days of AOL Instant Messenger long gone, Pluto no longer taught as one of the planets in our dollar system. All replaced by hours on various internet sites, buying everything from the comfort of their rooms, stalking everyone they know and do not know on The Facebook, excessively filtered photographs on Instagram, baring their souls on YouTube, updating the world and beyond on Twitter in 280 characters (previously 140!). And the list goes on. Though all these things are new, bullying, the fake interactions, the clicks, and the burning desire to fit in are no different in this century than they were in the last. And I can appreciate that Burnham not only understood this, but found a creative outlet in which to express this.Awkward moments are plentiful in this film, making for an uncomfortable 1.5 hours- but guess what? That is what makes it perfectly representative of most teenagers' daily lives. The videos did get a little tiresome, it lacked supporting character depth, some performances and scenes were vexing, and the format of vignettes made for a somewhat discombobulated viewing experience- but, in the end, ""Eighth Grade"" is a refreshing slice of life film that will leave a lasting impression.#FilmReview #comingofage #deathofparent #fatherdaughter #graduation #highschool #singleparent #sliceoflife #technology #timecapsule",Eighth Grade
80,markgorman,Outstanding comedy and understanding of the trauma of being 13.,9,28 April 2019,"I don't imagine many 13 year olds have been nominated for a Golden Globe, although some brief research reveals that Jodie Foster won an Academy Award at the age of 13 for Taxi Driver.Jodie Foster had an important role in the aforementioned movie but she was playing opposite De Niro at his best so she didn't have to OWN the movie.Elsie Fisher OWNS Eighth Grade in a remarkable way and that's why she was nominated this year. Such a shame she didn't win because she deserved to.It opens on an extreme close up monologue of her talking into her laptop's Photo Booth as she records a self help YouTube film that nobody will ever watch. It closes on the same but with the camera on her face.In between we experience her life, not her story; her being, her existence.What's unusual about the opening is that we see Fisher, warts (well zits) and all, nothing hidden. All her blemishes exposed to the world. Later in an uncomfortable scene we see her at a pool party with a similar degree of intensity.It's not pervy, it's just honest.This film steers an excruciating course through everything that we all went through, as a thirteen year old. When I say 'all' I exclude prom queens from the list because they, in their bubbles of popularity, are immune to the absolute horror show that is being 13, shy and free of attraction from (but not for) the opposite sex.Add to this the fact that Fisher (playing Kayla Day) is a single child with a single, male, parent (played sympathetically by Josh Hamilton - he has one moment that's so laugh out loud in a mall that I nearly choked), and the spots, and the puppy fat, and the panic attacks all add up to one hell of an eighth grade (the end of middle school) for Kayla.Fisher's performance is mind-blowingly good.The direction by first time director (and stand up comedian ) Bo Burnham looks like the work of a seasoned pro. It's stunning.But the reason I wanted to see the movie, in the first place, was because it was scored by Anna Meredith and the pool party scene I referred to earlier is presented on top of her epic tuba piece called Nautilus. It's like a cross between Jaws and National Lampoon's Vacation. The music which BURSTS onto the soundtrack is cranked up to the max and does not disappoint. Bravo Anna.At one or two points the movie drops into slightly too low a gear, but when it is performing at its most efficient it is at turns hilarious, toe curling, deeply moving, cruel, redemptory and hopeful.It's a truly beautiful work of art and I urge you to see it, preferably in the cinema on its very limited UK release.",Eighth Grade

Eighth Grade follows Kayla (Elsie Fisher) during her week before starting high school. She's never felt comfortable throughout school so far despite her attempts to get the attention of the 'cool crowd'. With the undying support of her father Mark (Josh Hamilton) and a new friend Olivia (Emily Robinson) who help to encourage her force of will and underlying positivity, Kayla discovers a lot more about herself in preperation for the next stage of her life. I was completely hooked from start to finish! It's filmed perfectly and acted perfectly throughout which is a crucial aspect of what makes it stand out. Fisher is absolutely wonderful; she completely becomes the character and you feel for her to the point of feeling exactly how she is. When she was sad, I was upset. When she cried for joy, I was on the verge of tearing up happily!

It was like a fly on the wall documentary of the average quiet teenager in the class.There were a few funny moments and a quite tame controversial moment but aside from that it was quite a long winded watch.There were relatable moments as a teen and parent but maybe not things we would want to be reminded of, not because they are painful but because they mostly forgettable stuff that happens in those years.",Eighth Grade
86,zac-04879,Growing Up Just Doesn't Feel so Fast,8,9 July 2021,"Bo Burnham has cleverly constructed an excellent coming-of-age story that's just as painful and weighty as transitioning from middle school to high school. Eighth Grade is definitely a film that majority of teens will not only enjoy, but will find all of the film's elements realistic compared to today's generations.This cringe-worthy comedy starring Elsie Fisher is honestly very funny at moments, but is also quite dramatic and challenging. There are some great jokes throughout, but audiences will remember the painfully realistic story of a teenage girl's last week of middle school. A24 movies usually follow the similar style of shooting, quality and music, which is probably one component on what makes Eighth Grade a well-made teen film. However, some people will obviously find the film boring and slow-burning.What needs to be focused on is the cringey but carefully type of acting. Kayla, played by Elsie Fisher, is amazing at displaying the awkwardness of being a teenager, especially when it comes to social life. There are great ideas wrapped in there and the characters are all well-produced, but the film isn't way too gripping.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Eighth Grade
87,darkreignn,"Without a doubt, the best movie of the year so far",9,5 August 2018,"""Eighth Grade"" follows Kayla, played by Elsie ""Give Me The Oscar Now"" Fisher, as she goes through her last weeks of the eighth grade. Because of that, there isn't necessarily a story in the traditional sense of the word - this is more of a slice-of-life style film, but it works so well.I really don't know how to review this film. To be honest with you, the only way I can describe this movie is saying, ""I loved it."" Because I did. It was a transcendental, euphoric experience that literally had feeling frisson (and if you don't know what frisson is, look it up). This is a movie that is so good that words do not do it justice. ""Eighth Grade"" stars Elsie Fisher in a performance that is so masterful and realistic and sympathetic that you'll find yourself cringing when she cringes, laughing when she laughs, and crying when she cries; you'll share in her happiness and her sadness, and you'll be glad to do it because her performance is without a doubt the best one of 2018 - 2018 isn't over yet, but I can tell you with complete confidence that literally no one is going to top her performance this year. She plays a shy, nervous, anxious, confused, scared, and sad eighth grader to PERFECTION - so perfect, in fact, that I found myself cringing in my seat because of just how accurate her performance was compared to my own eighth grade experience. Now, don't get me wrong, all of the performances in this film are excellent; across the board, everyone is amazing, but Elsie shines.Look, I've been sitting at my computer for about an hour and a half trying to think of how to write this review, and I'm having trouble. Does that make me a bad writer and a mediocre film critic? Maybe, but I don't care. From this point forward, I'm just going to write what pops in my head without thinking, so if this review is scatterbrained, I apologize.There are so many reasons why I loved this film. The directing is immaculate, and combined with the music? Orgasmic. The soundtrack of this film is amazing and gave me body tingles (FRISSON). The whole movie has this bright and vibrant feel to it, which only makes some of the more stressful scenes all the more harrowing (just wait for the now infamous ""Truth or Dare"" scene - it's scarier than anything Blumhouse has ever put out). Honestly, I watched most of this movie through my fingers as they covered my eyes, because so many scenes had me cringing in my seat because of the sheer amount of relatable teenage awkwardness. But through it all, the film has charm, mostly because of Kayla. I mean, if you cannot relate to her, you must have not been in the eighth grade. Everything she was going through, I could pinpoint and connect to events that happened to me when I was going through middle school (if you haven't tried to suck a banana, you haven't lived, my friends).And another thing that's incredible about this film is that it avoids all possible clichés at all possible moments that you would expect something cliché to happen. There were so many moments where I thought to myself, ""Oh God, I know what's about to happen,"" but then what I was thinking didn't happen, and the film becomes the better for it. Because, these clichés that you expect to happen would never happen in real life, and if there's one thing I can say about this movie is that it shows an accurate depiction of real life.Okay, at this point I really don't know what else to write. ""Eighth Grade"" was amazing, and you should go see it. It's one of the best films of the year, and it is definitely in my top 5 so far. Will it be number one? Probably. 9/10",Eighth Grade
88,austin0731,"Compact, concise story about teen angst",7,8 June 2019,"Eighth Grade is a movie about teenage angst and coming of age, it is a short movie that tells a story that is to the point and concise. Which I felt was perfect for the telling of this story, it is meant to be a snapshot that doesn't dramatize or make certain things bigger than in reality. It is simply a very realistic study of life as an eighth grader, it's not about some unrealistic teen romance or the other countless teen drama cliches.The star of the show is undoubtedly Elsie Fisher's Kayla Day and her relationship with her father played by Josh Hamilton is also a key relationship. The movie was funny but also heartbreaking at times, as we empathize with the character of Elsie. Bo Burnham, the director really manages to capture the angst and cringe of those early teenage years, trying to figure out where you stand on the complex social echelon of middle school life.Eighth Grade is a wonderful bundle of laughter and tears to audiences.",Eighth Grade
89,youngcollind,Uncomfortably true to life,10,3 September 2021,"While the cringe genre usually brings to mind over the top characters like Michael Scott and Larry David breaking unwritten social rules and making grand buffoonish displays, it rarely cuts this close to home, making you cringe because of how easy it is to relate to. That feeling when there's a conversation around you and you don't know how to jump in. That feeling when you know your lack of confidence is holding you back but you don't have the confidence to do anything about it. While we may carry these feelings into our adult lives, it was the perfect combination of hormones and naiveté that made them hit like a ton of bricks in our formative years. This film is a deep dive into this awkward anxiety that feels oddly personal while being universally relatable. Elsie Fisher is fantastic to the point where you forget she's acting and not just living as the character. The script is equal measures sweet and funny when it's not just downright uncomfortable. Whether or not you grew up with social media (and thank God I didn't), this film will bring you back to your youth and make you appreciate that it's something you only have to go through once.",Eighth Grade
90,jackgdemoss,Captures the awkwardness of middle school but with even less excitement somehow,6,25 June 2019,"Eighth Grade is the truest to the genre I have ever seen a coming of age film be. There is no rising and falling action, targeted comedy, or deviation from the cringe that is maturing. Although I respect that it has set a new standard for realism in a coming of age film, I didn't find it the least bit entertaining. It plays more like a documentary of someone who followed an awkward teenage girl around with a camera for a year, which says great things about the lead actress and writer/director Bo Burnham because I believe that is what they were going for.",Eighth Grade

This was too intensely relatable to my own eighth grade experience-which shockingly was only four years ago! Bo Burnham's artistic direction is presented with a surprisingly-considering this is his directorial debut-mature and realistic approach which will greatly be cherished among cinema-dorks like myself. The accuracy of the film's subject matter is so viciously on point that it's hard not to feel a special/personal connection with the film's presented story. An unexpectedly effective addition to the film was actually the score, which has a psychologically electrical vibe to it that got under my skin at times. Also, the cast is exceptionally vibrant, especially the actress (who should get some type of award!) who plays the main character, Kayla. Some moments made me chuckle, some moments made me heartened, and some moments even made me cringe (in the most positive manner). Eighth Grade is the quintessential summary of the modern-aged teenage experience, and it's absolutely worth every generations time and money. (Verdict: A)",Eighth Grade
92,carlos37andre,"It might be tough to watch, but it's great and simple!",8,10 June 2019,"I'm gonna be honest, this was a really difficult movie for me to watch. Like, idk if it's something common, but I have a thing that I struggle a lot on watching scenes were the character is put on a embarrassing/uncomfortable situation. If you watched the movie, you know what I'm talking about. The pool scene is the main example for me, or even always when she talks with the ""mean girls"".Anyways, but I believe this is a good thing, the only reason I felt this way is because the movie succeeds on passing me the emotions Kayla was feeling. Everything is those scenes work perfectly, the way it's shot, gives you a real ""claustrophobic feel"", the slow pace they have, to make you even more uncomfortable. It's tough to watch, but that was the goal of it, I would imagine.Besides that, the movie is beautiful, it's greatly shot, you love the main character, you feel bad for her, and most important, you root for her. I think one might say the movie is slow, and nothing here happens, and it's kind of right, there isn't really any specific plot point, or issue that needs to be solve, it's just a natural and fluid trip throughout a girl's last year on middle school.
The movie has great performances, Elsie Fisher is great as Kayla, really really good. Josh Hamilton as the father is also awesome in it. You feel the love he always try to give Kayla, even when she avoids it.I also loved the way they deal with the whole ""social media"" thing that today's teenagers have growned up with, and the way really society is today, her YT videos, intercalated with her trying to actually do stuff on real life and failing is a real description of most people are online these days, everyone wants to feel happy, and show people they are happy, or that they know stuff, give advise and etc, when they are actually struggling with those same things in their lifes, we just don't see it, cause the only things that are shared are the ""lightty"" stuff.I don't think there is much more to say, the movie is great, it talks about the little things on a young teenager life's, and it's done for someone who clearly knew what was he was doing.8/10",Eighth Grade
93,harrylosborne,Ambition falls short - but a promising attempt,5,18 April 2021,"O Just because it's accurate, doesn't make it good. Bo Burnham's full directorial debut ""Eighth Grade"" is a walking cringe-fest, full of the embarrassing moments that we associate early teenage years with. This novelty might hold up for some, but only succeeded in boring me; awkwardness is a trait that is neither watchable nor compelling. If kids had anything interesting to say, then there would be far more high school films that weren't just subjects of derision. As a group of schoolkids prepares to 'graduate' from eighth grade (which, by the way, is one of the stupidest traditions I didn't know Americans did), one shy teenager attempts to make some inroads with her classmates, whilst vlogging about her experiences. It's good to see this often overlooked aspect of youth given some attention, and Elsie Fisher does a good job, but the rest of the story just isn't there. This lack of real foundation then devolves into a heavily-sexualised story, horribly uncomfortable to watch, but also totally unprovoked given the concerned age group (at their youngest, 13 year-olds). I think Bo Burnham did show a good eye for a shot, particularly when it came to lighting (or lack thereof). Not normally the focus of teen films, Burnham makes sure to exploit darkness to maximum effectivity, heightening realism but also allowing the viewer to make their own minds up about what is transpiring. I see where the creative vision was in ""Eighth Grade"", and I do commend the attempt to breakout from the norm. Saying this, the lack of a plot I empathise with is damning, as is the skincrawlingly forced sexuality of the film, a combination of issues I haven't seen too many times before, and hope not to see again.",Eighth Grade

It is really good.It is a long time since I have been a teenager (sigh), and I certainly wasn't a teenager during the age of social media, the internet and their influence in young peoples' lives. I can remember though the awkwardness of growing up, of doubting yourself, of trying to fit in and of negotiating life in the orbit of the cool kids. This film captures all the angst, the uncertainly, the awkwardness of that period of life, which it seems is the same in the 2020s as it was when I was growing up.The acting in this is superb. Elsie Fisher does a fantastic job playing the female, teenage protagonist. Your heart will ache for her at times. Amazingly for an American movie, she actually appears to be the same age as the character she plays. All the other actors are fine too. I particularly liked Josh Hamilton as the sometimes-clueless Dad. I suspect many a parent of teenagers will relate to his performance. I note that this is the first time for Bo Burnham in the director's chair. If that is the case then he deserves hearty congratulations and I look forward to seeing more of his work in this area.I would not call this a family film per se, although I have no doubt families will enjoy watching it together, particularly those in the age group featured. It may even lead to some valuable sharing and discussion.I am very pleased to recommend this movie. It is special and maybe even important. It is certainly enjoyable and relatable.",Eighth Grade
98,Jared_Andrews,"Cringe-worthy, Honest and Deeply Empathetic",9,7 August 2018,"'Eighth Grade' is a movie you'll be talking about for a long time. Bo Burnham, one of the O.G.'s of teen YouTube stardom, has given us an agonizingly rich and authentic look at what life is like for Kayla (Elsie Fisher), a shy 13-year-old girl in today's social media obsessed world. Burnham, directing his first feature, doesn't spare any detail and doesn't alter any truth. This film is exceedingly honest. It doesn't depict Kayla's experiences the way we might think they should be for an eighth grader or the way we might want them to be-they're simply presented as they are. Pool parties are a source of unbearable discomfort. First sexual encounters are not always pleasant. Kids with exploding hormones and little impulse control randomly shout unfunny phrases at assemblies in the hopes of earning a laugh.The storytelling has the feel of a nature documentary. We can almost hear the narrator describing Kayla's attempts to navigate her fascinating and frightening terrain. Playing the vulnerable character who's far from the top of the food chain, she's just trying to survive. Kayla, like so many kids her age, is a shy girl pretending to be confident. She posts advice videos to YouTube on how to be yourself, something with which she still very much struggles. As she records one video, she slowly rolls her chair farther away from the camera, indicating a declining level of self-assurance. This mirrors her real-world peer interactions, in which she stammers and laughs halfway through sentences as she begins to doubt herself and shrink with embarrassment, not that the self-absorbed ""listener"" bothers to notice.All the kids stare at their phones constantly. These modern mean girls barely bother to muster up the energy put others down with a passive-aggressive remark because that would involve speaking to another person. Instead, they inflict harm by neglecting to acknowledge an uncool kid's mere existence. 
As cruel as that sounds, these popular kids aren't presented as villains. This is simply their way of handling their own insecurities. There are no villains in eighth grade-they're all just kids trying to figure out their lives and trying to figure out themselves.And the adults don't know how to handle any of this. Kayla's dad wants to connect with her, but is met with constant rejection. He smartly gives her space and only requests her attention to remind her how much he loves her. In one scene, Kayla asks if she makes him sad, and he fervently reassures her that she makes him profoundly happy. Like Kayla, he can't always find the right words, but he successfully expresses the feeling. That scene is a microcosm of the entire film. Its dialogue isn't readily quotable or particularly memorable, and that's okay. What is actually said isn't as important as the meaning behind it. Parents can keep this in mind when they have conversations with their own kids, possibly directly after watching this film. Many kids and parents will likely watch it together since it carries an ""R"" rating (it's ironic that a film that accurately reflects the lives of eighth graders is deemed too adult for them to watch on their own). And parents should watch this with their kids, so they can both understand each other a little bit better. They'll both be better for doing so.",Eighth Grade

I thought it was going to be a cheesy teenage movie featuring a bunch of eighth graders played by 20 year olds doing things that no middle schoolers actually do. But it was actually a very honest depiction of those awkward middle school years. The movie portrays anxiety and loneliness in a very real way that tells audiences that they're not alone in these feelings. It will make you a cringe; not in a ""this movie is terrible way"", but in a ""this used to be me"" way. The movie is also entertaining and funny; while some of the jokes might not make sense in a few years, you'll definitely laugh (and probably tear up) on more than one occasion.

The only aspect I can relate to is Kayla's electronic addiction and naivety. But I just felt she was a drama queen who pushes away her dad and mopes about being called the most quiet (I don't see anything wrong with being quiet). So, later in the film, she tries to fit in by being talkative and outgoing.So, all I could say is the film isn't for me. I guess I was expecting a more light-hearted film rather than a drama about moody, awkward 13-year-olds.

I love the stand-up of Bo Burnham so I figured it would be a smart and funny look at adolescence. Overall I loved the movie for providing a genuine look at such an awkward stage in our social development and mental health issues as a whole.The film follows the middle schooler Kayla Day as she tries to navigate the complexities of 8th grade life. The movie perfectly illustrates just how awkward and difficult adolescence can be when you are that shy kid in school. The film also incorporates critiques on social media and how it can contribute to kids feeling alone and isolated. For anyone who suffers through social anxiety there are so many relatable moments throughout the film.Of course the film is all wickedly smart, funny, and relevent. The dialogue feels completely natural and made the interactions feel genuine. There we're quite a number of situations that were very funny and in no way talk down to people with mental health issues. That is something that I loved about the movie. The movie Illustrated the realities of adolescence without belittling the topics for its audience.The film also deeply explores childhood depression and anxiety. Adolescence can be an alienating and difficult time. The film really shows a young girl struggling to fit in to social situations and the negative consequences of feeling alone. So many moments throughout the film illustrate the very real situations teenagers are going through that can exacerbate mental health issues. With youth depression, anxiety, and suicide rates growing this film really provided a powerful message about the difficulties children are facing growing up in our society.At such an early age of childhood development kids still don't know who they are. The film shows that insecurity and loneliness that can come when you are seen as different by your peers at such a young age. Kayla Day embodies so many culturally relevant issues that children are having a face at earlier and earlier ages. Depression, anxiety, peer pressure, wanting to fit in, the impact of the Internet, and children engaging in sexual activities are all touched upon in the film.One of the major reoccurring themes throughout the movie deals with the influence of social media. The film looks at a generation that was born with social media as an integral part of their life. The film asks the question is that a good thing or does it only further serve to alienate and exacerbate mental health concerns? It's an issue that is all too real to be ignored.I am absolutely blown away by Bo Burnham's directorial feature debut. For a first time director to make a relatable movie with such depth is rare, but he also wrote the script. It is amazing what happens when you let genuinely talented funny comedians make movies.I was also genuinely impressed with the acting throughout the film. Elsie Fisher was of course the standout starring role of the film. In a film like Eighth Grade that revolves around the genuineness of its scripts having an artist sell their performance is vital. Elsie Fisher was absolutely amazing. She completely convinced me she was that character and had lived through those struggles. She absolutely deserves the Golden Globe nomination she just received.I don't have a lot of negatives to say about the movie. I really think this is one of the best movies of 2018. I suppose at times the film could have been a bit tighter. There were a number of important concepts being juggled around so it's understandable that not every points gets looked at in detail. I didn't have a problem with the pacing of the film, but I could see some viewers complain that the film was slow. Anyone wanting a artificial plastic Hollywood look at adolescence or wanting a straight no brain comedy will certainly be disappointed.The film doesn't sugarcoat anything. It is an absolute perfect realistic coming-of-age film that is a must watch for 2018. It illustrates the hurdles of growing up in the digital age while also providing a stark and brutal look at childhood hental health. The script was smart, funny, and compelling. All around the movie was a great mix of drama and comedy while never talking down to its audience. For a first time director there's nothing more you can ask for. A great film with a lot of heart and empathy. A 9.25 out of 10.",Eighth Grade
106,blrnani,A very sad experience,6,14 February 2019,"But hopefully a very positive enlightening one for schoolkids of all ages, since it reveals in painful details the tribulations and insecurity of a thoroughly decent young lady who is going through the process of learning about life and is acutely aware of how little she knows. That is made all the more difficult by the impression that other, more confident kids, all know so much more than her, when that impression is basically a front created to appease a competitive education system that demands the kids know so much or at least manage to fake it.
One of the most moving scenes was when Kayla's father, concerned that his daughter is burning her box of what she describes as her hopes and dreams, tells her how proud he is of her because he, a divorced single father, hasn't really had to do much in the way of parenting since she has demonstrated an innate ability to grow up nicely as a smart, sensitive well balanced young lady. That admission does wonders for her confidence and for their relationship, at a moment when both were very wobbly.
What bothered me most in the film is the revelation that, at a time when people have the most amazing communication tools humanity has ever conceived, actual communication appears to be breaking down, with deep and meaningful discussion replaced by a standardized set of empty sound bites. Hopefully, this film will encourage kids to talk to each and to their parents a lot more and a lot more meaningfully. A good place to start would be to have more collective occasions such as mealtimes - among the family and among friends - and banning mobile devices for the duration of that moment. We all need some time offline to be able to think for ourselves and to relate to others.",Eighth Grade

Director/Producer/Writer/Actor/Comedian, and one of the initial YouTube series sensations, Bo Turnham provides a realistic view into and around the life of eighth grader Karly (the adorable Elsie Fisher ""Despicable Me and Me 2"") and her single dad Mark (Josh Hamilton ""Manchester by the Sea""). Through her own YouTube Channel, quiet, reserved and acned Karly shares her years of wisdom with her followers (follower tally TBD), while continually flipping through Instagram, Snap Chat, YouTube and any other ""keep in touch"" social media platform, all the while sharing very little with her caring dad. With headphones and phone an additional appendage stuck to her body, and those of her fellow classmates, we get a clear view that phones are taking up too much of our youths time and energy. Barely surviving all those youth oriented Middle School issues, Karly befriends High School ""it"" gal Olivia (the bubbly Emily Robinson ""Behold My Heart""), only to realize jumping forward to quickly may not be the best move. Fisher and Hamilton have a terrific scared father - scared daughter relationship, that provides an honest look at both sides of being a child and bringing up a child.

Kayla (the terrific Elsie Fisher) is thirteen and plowing through early teen traumas that don't exist in any other world. She is riddled with acne, an awkwardly changing body, a hovering dad, social media pressures, and a debilitating shyness. Loneliness is universal, but the middle school version can be devastatingly paralysing.Scripted and directed by Bo Burnham, ""Eighth Grade"" is not the comedy expected from such a manic source. Oh there's plenty of laughs, but most are of the painful variety, some of the relief variety, and only a few of the generic funny variety. This is a very serious movie, even if it is only seems so from Kayla's point of view. Mundane life bumps are Mount Everest climbs, full of horrific, tension-filled drama punctuated with explosive electronic music blasts. A pool party? Holy crap! Message received, loud and clear.In spite of obvious cinematic techniques carefully orchestrated to lure a willing audience, this movie really triumphs with a striking realism as we get inside Kayla's realistically uncomfortable skin. Like ""Boyhood"", it sharply captures defining life moments with an ugly-beauty reverence all too rare for Hollywood. The best thing you'll see in quite a while.",Eighth Grade
110,Semisonic,"Realistic, but, like, bland and, like, boring... yeah...",5,26 January 2019,"So, you remember last year's Ladybird, or The Edge of Seventeen the year before? If you are already an adult then those movies probably made you cringe and shiver - because they go hard on displaying all those typical teen things you feel extremely embarrassed thinking about when you get older. The realism of the typical traps of the age is as annoying as it's astounding.Well, this is the coming of age genre for you. Adults watch these movies because they help them re-connect with their kids (or reconcile with their younger selves), and the teens watch it because they are actually able to see their own kind on screen.So, in a sense, such films have become a no-brainer for the industry: just show a bunch of kids doing their kid stuff - and you have a cash cow you can milk till your hair goes grey. And, after so many years during which this formula worked like a charm, it began turning into the genre's bane.You see, this film indeed shows young humans doing the things typical for their age, and they are indeed as cringeworthy as ever. But Eighth Grade simply forgets to add anything else besides the cringe - anything that was making the characters in other films interesting or intriguing or at least somewhat original.And without that not-so-secret sauce Eighth Grade feels plain boring and lame. With the characters as complex and multi-faceted as their speech (meh), the dialogs that make porn talks sound artistic, and the plot as predictable as the flicks of the aforementioned genre, you end up trying to grab onto at least something of interest, failing, and suffocating in the mundane routine.Childhood sucks, kids are cruel, and being a teen is awkward. We get it alright, we either have been there ourselves or are right there at the moment. What we wanna see in the films are the hard choices (Me and Earl and the Dying Girl), controversial situations (Perks of Being a Wallflower) or the sick fun you're still entitled to have while you're young (Superbad, The Kings of Summer and the rest of the legion). But if you cannot come up with anything remotely distinctive - just save your breath, because a plain mirror all of us have at home for free.",Eighth Grade

113,PotassiumMan,"Deeply uneven film about growing up, but ultimately rings a chord",7,16 September 2018,"It took a while to get into this film. It's the story of an awkward, somewhat neurotic teenage girl who tries to navigate the deep pitfalls of adolescence as she nears the end of middle school. A protagonist who comes into her own, as does the film as a whole, is portrayed flawlessly here, very much true to life. We watch her efforts to fit in with other kids in her grade and those a tad older and the dynamic between her and her loving father. The most amusing part is how she confronts the intrigue and challenges of her ongoing (and perhaps first-ever) crush. As a grown man, I found a lot of truth in this film. My only real complaint would be a soundtrack that is excessively voluble and overheated. I realize it's meant to portray the roller-coaster of growing up at that age, but I found it more of a distraction. Otherwise, a wonderfully touching coming-of-age film. Recommended.",Eighth Grade
114,torrascotia,Another teen cringe movie.,6,8 April 2019,"I managed to catch a preview screening ahead of its general UK release and was encouraged by the positive reviews.
This is another coming of age movie which focuses on an eighth grade (another girl movie? Cant recall the last one from a boys pov?) girl towards the end of the academic year and about to go into her new phase of schooling.
The movie is set in current times so alot of the story revolves around social media and the IPhone with the protagonist spending much of her time without peer group company.
She lives with her father who struggles to engage her in any meaningful conversation due to her obsession with social media where she tries to develop friendships but misses the potential of company in real life.
She has a side project where she gives out life advice, despite not having any observable skills in that area due to her social anxiety. Irony alert.
These are movies which are aimed at those people who experienced the social scene at school from the sidelines. These movies are so these people can say ""oh that was how I was at school etc..."" Not everyone does however so these experiences may not chime with you unless you were an angsty teenager. Some people actually enjoyed school, there I said it.
The movie does have some funny/cringey moments however there are times when you just wish the father would lay down some discipline and some boundaries. At times her huffy behaviour is difficult to watch as is her cheek and the fathers tolerance of behaviour seems crazy.
The score for some reason I found deafeningly loud, it could do with being turned down.
This a movie is all about a socially inept girl with anxiety issues struggling at what is after all low level first world problems.
No lives were threatened in this movie. It was enjoyable however being a male in my 40s its obviously not aimed at me.
I am sure it will resonate better the more closely you identify with the main character so reviewers really should point this out. It doesnt have the universal appeal of Heathers or Mean Girls, nor the heavy social commentary of The Florida Project.
Probably fantastic for females, less so for males.",Eighth Grade
115,ninjaalexs,Making The Grade - Solid Coming Of Age Film,7,15 November 2021,"I'm not sure what to make of this one. On one hand it is a very good movie with powerful performances and looks a lot more expensive than its paltry (by Hollywood standards) $2 million budget suggests. On the other I feel a bit disappointed and as though I've seen it all before.A teenage girl, Kayla (Elsie Fisher) posts Self-help and motivation YouTube Videocasts\V-Logs; subjects like ""self-esteem"" and ""making friends"". In real life we learn she is socially anxious and a bit of an outcast. Meanwhile her Dad (Josh Hamilton) is a smothering and finds it difficult to bond with her, mainly because she is getting older.I'm not sure how much of this film is based on comedian Bo Burnham's own life. Bo is absolutely massive in USA, but in the UK very few people have heard of him and would probably think he was mainly known as a film director; I don't know the British equivalent: David Baddiel maybe?The acting is believable and it manages to be less annoying than most teen movies. Juno I found irritating due to clunky dialogue. Eighth Grade manages to just avoid ""this is how teens talks"". I've seen very similar plots in American Beauty with Mena Suvari's subplot, but this is less of a boot in the face in terms of impact. One can't help but be reminded slighted of John Hughes films as they are pretty much the prototype; Eighth Grade is less sugary and more open ended.It's a solid film with solid performances, but for me it just lacks the magic touch.",Eighth Grade
116,Oktay_Tuna,Eighth Grade is Maybe Too Realistic,8,28 December 2020,"Eighth Grade is about a girl who has social anxiety, that's literally it. She is our narrator, and most of the movie feels like it is real footage, too real maybe. In some parts in like literally every two seconds, I stopped the film, walked around my room, resumed for 2 seconds, and again walked around my room. It is so real that it makes you cringe, you feel like the narrator. Elsie Fisher did a great job at making you feel that way and her being around 14 years old when this film was filmed just explains why it felt so real. From the opening scene of the class, I felt like I was in middle school. Yes, it was exaggerated for comedy or more drama but at its core, it is so real. You sympathize with, everyone in this film because you have been every one of them at some point in your life. You have been weird, shy, ignorant, naive... You have been a teenager. The 1st part was okay, it was similar to most films like this. It sets up the characters and develops the plot with funny scenes but the 2nd Part wasn't funny at all for me(which is actually a good thing). I couldn't find it funny when it felt so real. Even the obscure scenes felt real because at their core they had the same emotion to it. The movie also had some slight issues. The pacing dragged around the middle of the film. The development in the story was important for the conclusion but it could have been constructed way better. Also as I said some scenes were so real whereas some of them felt like they were from a movie like Booksmart(2019). Sometimes that created an imbalance between emotions. Other than that, Eighth Grade is an original entry in an overcrowded genre. It is not original because it tries something new/weird, it is original because it was one of the most authentic films I watched. Kayla Day doesn't feel like a fictional character. (Also the music choice in the movie overall was very innovative. The score changes in anxious moments fit perfectly with the overall story)",Eighth Grade
117,justinwfirestone,Light entertainment,6,21 March 2019,"Yes, eighth grade sucks, and Eight Grade does its best not to suck by painfully reminding us of all the awkward moments we all had around puberty time, whether they involved hating bananas, kissing someone for the first time, getting hair ""down there,"" or having your dad tell you he loves you very much and is proud of you a lot.The stand-out lesson here is that what annoys us most about other people is almost always those same characteristics which we cannot or will not recognize in ourselves. This resolves into a simpler statement, that people are hypocrites, even pre-teens filled with bright-eyed optimism or adults burnt out by the harsh realities of life. Nevertheless, parties are, like, super-fun, right? And older people are cooler than you unless they're, like, super old and smell funny.Although advertised as squarely fitting into the genre known as comedy, Eighth Grade fails to garner genuine guffaws. Instead, it serves as a grinding reminder that transitioning from youth to adult is an awkward process that has no handbook of rules, guidelines, or even suggestions about how best to progress. In some ways, it feels like a miracle that any of us survived that process and went on to become fully functioning adults who can make movies about it.",Eighth Grade
118,domtaylor,It's easier to appreciate than to love.,6,13 July 2019,"'Eighth Grade' is an undeniably good film; it has a great script, excellent performances and, above all, manages to successfully capture the zeitgeist of the modern age. Burnham truly manages to craft an experience that feels real - his casting of age appropriate actors really helps this. However, it doesn't really have a strong narrative. It's one of those films that seems to be a collection of loosely connected events in a key characters life, rather than a traditional 'narrative' experience. This isn't such a bad thing and does, clearly intentionally, add to the authenticity of the piece, however for me it limits engagement. It's never boring, but there isn't enough to keep you truly engaged throughout, and this is where it falls a bit short for me. Saying that, it's superbly crafted and an important watch (especially for any teenagers who are having a similar experience to the protagonist), and although I didn't enjoy it to a great extent, I would happily give it another go. As it stands though, I think that it's an easier film to appreciate than to love. 6/10",Eighth Grade
119,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Hello Future Life,8,9 June 2020,"Not what I was expecting at all, as I anticipated a similar high-school romp in the vein of Booksmart, not a rhetorical look at the awkward pain of the years beforehand. Perhaps I should research film titles more?It was quite slow, meandering and I was guilty of checking my watch a couple of times, but sometimes engrossing nonetheless because of how terrified I was at that age to any exposure in class, going bright red and cowering into my hole of personal despair. Please don't mention my name or draw any attention to me or I will surely die, but laughing at a boy with a hard on in sex education while praying that I wouldn't get one myself.Yes, other kids are horrible, just as I was horrible in my ignorance to some of them in turn, and thank God we didn't have social media back then or it would have been even worse, with no privacy or holes to hide in.And the anguish of being exposed as a virgin, obviously, and not even knowing how to kiss is terrifying when thrust into nauseating and massively exposed pool parties and back-seat car misadventures against your own will, which is massive justification for the fight for teenage survival. The whole world feels on the precipice of doom, yet with fundamental amazement at what is yet to come, which is what this film is all about: horror teenage survival with tantalizingly bright lights at the end of the tunnel.Although Eighth Grade is not a dazzlingly entertaining film, it is a poignant and sensitive one that touches on the precarious years between dormant childhood and waking adulthood and how scary and bizarre it all seems at the time..",Eighth Grade
120,Doublej20005,A New Personal Favourite,10,2 January 2021,"Man did I connect with this film. Kayla is just such a fantastic character on nearly every level, and I just really related with most of the situations she was in. I too am just really introverted and I'm tend to not connect with 'normal' people in my class. Thankfully I have an amazing group of friends and haven't really been in situations as extreme as hers, but I do get the loneliness that Kayla feels, and it's her emotional journey over the course of her finishing Eighth Grade that is the driving force of the film. Elsie Fisher is just pitch perfect, and nails all the quirks that I genuinely recognise from different people in my class, including myself. And I think that it is this realism to what teenagers actually do and say in real life that made this film as gut-punchingly honest and beautiful as it was. Bo Burnham really does understand the issues that our current generation are going through, with social media and changes in expectation when it comes to teenagers. It honestly feels like we are meant to be like the second coming of Christ by the age of 12, and the amount of pressure put on us, not only socially by those around us but also by teachers and by the education system as a whole is just completely ridiculous. This film shows that just getting through your teen years is an achievement, and that you should just be proud to be yourself every day without worrying about what other people will think about you. That scene where she lets everything out at Kennedy just might be my favourite moment of the entire film, because it puts further emphasis on the idea that you should just be yourself and not change to try to please anyone else or to try to 'fit in'. And I haven't even talked about the fantastic direction, mesmerising lighting and cinematography, great score and perfect pacing, meaning that even in scenes where 'nothing' was happening I still just felt completely engrossed. Her talking to her dad at the end is just so unbelievably heartwarming, and that final scene is the cherry on the cake. Overall, I just really connected with this film, and I definitely recommend checking it out. Whilst it might not be a perfect film, it's one that I resonated with on a deeper level than any other film in months. I can't wait to see what Bo Burnham makes next.",Eighth Grade

123,cappiethadog,IDollhouse,10,10 June 2019,"Will Kayla Day(Elsie Fisher) be all right? We hope so. Like her dad says, Kayla is easy to love. But will somebody, anybody, love her back? There are no guarantees of a happy ending in the real world. Life is not like a John Hughes movie. Andie Walsh(Molly Ringwald) should leave the prom with Duckie(Jon Cryer), the boy who really sees her, not Blaine McDonough, the man of her dreams, in ""Pretty in Pink"". Although ""Eighth Grade"", the debut feature by Bob Burnham, ends on an optimistic note, Kayla, the middle school misfit, doesn't get the faerie tale ending. Like Greta Gerwig before him, Burnham, too, unwittingly or not, razes the house that John Hughes built to the ground. Aiden(Luke Prael), named by his class as having the best eyes, doesn't ask Kayla, the eighth grade superlatives winner of ""Most Quiet"", to be his girlfriend, because opposites don't really attract. For the most part, unrequited love remains unrequited; that's life, and that's the difference between studio and independent films.Christine McPhereson(Saroise Ronan) makes the driver stop the car. The Dave Matthews Band song playing over the radio makes ""Ladybrid"" come to her senses. She chooses Julie, her best friend, as her prom date instead of Kyle, who doesn't like ""Crash"", their song. His friends are simply too cool for school. They don't like The Dave Matthews Band either. Kyle is just some guy in the band. Julie(Beanie Feldstein) is her true love. Gerwig gives ""Pretty in Pink"" the ending it deserved. Andie will soon learn that Blaine is just some guy, too. The Noah Baumbach protege, like everybody else who ever had their heart broken, was rooting for Duckie. In ""Eighth Grade"", it's Gabe(Jake Ryan), the goofy cousin of a popular girl Kayla meets at a pool party, who is categorically dismissed as a potential romantic interest. He does handstands. He stages an underwater breathing contest. Nothing works. She still pines over Aiden. On graduation day, Kayla, lined up backstage with her peers, goes for the Hollywood ending one more time when her secret crush passes them by. Following advice from her self-produced YouTube videos, Kayla ""puts herself out there""; she gets out of line and follows him, then stops, realizing at last that ""all the yous that make up the real you"" is not somebody Aiden would be interested in. Kayla is neither ""funny"" nor ""cool"". Earlier in the film, as she approaches the house of the queen bee, Kennedy, whose mother forced the birthday girl to invite, we hear the disconnect in Kayla's voiceover. The only ""you"" that is applicable to Kayla is the unspoken ""you"", the ""nervous you"". Still, the motherless girl aspires to be Olivia, the high-spirited, well-adjusted high school senior who, on orientation day makes her ""shadow"" feel like she could belong, providing Kayla with well-meaning, but, perhaps, futile hope for a brighter future. The potential assault, a game of Truth or Dare gone awry, which Kayla puts a stop to in the backseat of Olivia's best friend's car, on their way back after a night at the mall, could be foreshadowing, or not, of a high school experience that will be indistinguishable from her middle school nightmare.Dawn Wiener(Heather Matarazzo) was in seventh grade. Todd Solondz's ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" introduced us to a bona fide geek, not some customized geek who was charmingly weird, but just plain weird. Dawn's awkwardness made the audience cringe. Good god; those outfits! She was not lovable; she was not particularly likable either. ""I want to be popular,"" Dawn tells Ralphie, her best friend by default, with yearning. Ralphie, an even bigger misfit than ""Wiener Dog"", was a friend of convenience; a sickly-looking boy who did nothing to aid in Dawn's aspiration to be socially-accepted by her peers. Even worse, a potential boyfriend, Brandon(Brendan Sexton III), an outsider in his own right, whom Dawn witnesses being humiliated for his poverty by all the pretty girls in the school hallway, is passed over for Steve, an aspiring singer with Jim Morrison-like looks who plays in Mark Wiener's band, because the alleged drug-dealer, she knows, won't get her invited to pool parties. Dawn, in spite of having no agency, is a social climber, too. Likewise, it's not hard to figure out that Kayla would dump Gabe in a heartbeat, both as a lover and friend, if Olivia proves to be right about this purported metamorphosis that the gawky tween will undergo as a high school freshman. But she doesn't know Kayla. The eighth grader is sad all the time. She can't put together a coherent sentence, even in her happier moments. Kayla had undiagnosed social anxiety. Dad(Josh Hamilton) should see it. At home, his daughter is sullen, monosyllabic, and pulls a disappearing act in plain sight on the dinner table every night, lost in the glow of her IPhone. The depth of her sadness is bottomless. The father, too, must live in this same abyss, because he can't see the forest for the trees. As they watch Kayla's sixth grade time capsule burn in a small fire, the audience learns that Mrs. Day abandoned her husband and daughter when the latter was in diapers. Contrary to what Mark, Kayla's father, says, more than ever, he should be worried about his only child. This millennial, living in the age of social media, is neither popular at school nor online. Nobody subscribes to her channel. When Gabe texts the cyberspace nobody, following a retirement announcement in her latest and last self-help episode, she realizes it's Kennedy's weird cousin responsible for what little YouTube hits she garners. Kayla doesn't have the strength to answer. It's like an online version of Dawn Wiener's ""Special People's Club"". She also has only one follower. And although Kayla isn't outwardly cruel like Dawn, who hurls indirect slurs and other hate-filled obscenities at Ralphie as she implores Missy, her younger sister, to hang up the phone, the blank screen that Gabe stares at, must be equally devastating. ""Eighth Grade"" transfigures the ""Special People's Club"" into a cult YouTube channel. Both girls, Kayla and Dawn recall Groucho Marx's most quoted witticism: ""I don't want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.""Did Dawn Wiener survive junior high? Yes and no. Which film did you see? ""Storytelling"", Todd Solondz's third feature, was halved by a ""Fiction"" and ""Non-Fiction"" section. And maybe that is the club to the filmmaker's resurrection of his most beloved character in ""Wiener Dog""(2016), starring, improbably, Greta Gerwig, as Dawn, who died twelve years earlier in ""Palindromes""(2004). Mark, the older brother, delivers a double-edged eulogy that recounts the tragic events which leads to her sister's self-inflicted death. Unlike Kayla, who has a father that adores her, the deceased lived without the saving grace of familial love. Quite pointedly, Missy is not in attendance. And nobody bothered to adorn the austere white casket with flowers. Mark's tribute to his sister, which includes details about her obesity, bad skin, assault, and pregnancy, arguably, serves as a practical way to dispense exposition to the audience, but more than likely, it's a cruel parting shot to a girl who could absorb only so many verbal shots to the system. Dawn's parents spill crocodile tears. That's non-fiction.In ""Wiener Dog"", it's not Dawn, a veterinarian tech, but a dachshund that gives the film its name. ""Wiener Dog"", of course, was the pejorative nickname Dawn's classmates taunted her with. The female Lazarus, predictably, is single, but gainfully employed, and the brand-new owner of a wiener dog, when she smuggles the abandoned canine, scheduled for euthanization, out of the clinic she works at. The meet-cute, or rather, anti-meet-cute with Brandon, the boy Dawn spurned, occurs at a convenience store. Their conversation is marked by awkward starts and stops, but amiable enough, although disappointing from Dawn's vantage point, since Brandon doesn't want to keep in touch. He leaves the store. Once outside, however, Dawn catches Brandon in the act of playing with her rescue, named ""Doo-die"". ""As in ****?"" he questions her in amazement. Metaphorically speaking, Brandon falls in love with ""Wiener Dog"" all over again. It's a motif. A fourth wall is broken. That's fiction. Solondz, you could say, dabbles in fan-fiction by presenting the best possible version of Dawn's post-middle school life. Brandon invites her on a road trip, in which we learn that Mr. McCarthy died and his mentally-impaired brother got married. The motif continues. All the couple eats are hot dogs. April, Tommy's wife, feeds a wiener dog to a wiener dog. This segment, the second of four, ends with Brandon reaching across the stick shift and lays his hand atop Dawn's hand. Brandon gives her a second chance. Later in the film, however, to illustrate the point that Dawn, habituated by universal enmity, can't recognize love when it's right in front of her, Solondz utilizes Dawn's four-legged proxy. In the film's final segment, the wiener dog runs away from Nana and is mowed down by a truck, because the dachshund thinks there is something better on the other side of the road. When Dawn leaves ""Doo-dee"" behind with Tommy and Missy, the filmmaker describes his protagonist's self-loathing, since even ""Wiener Dog"" didn't love the wiener dog.Over the soundtrack, we hear Kayla making small-talk, but in an indirect way; it's with her phone. She talks to ""Kayla"", the girl in the selfies, mugging at the playground; the Kayla that lives in her touch screen. Kayla wants to be her. But she, this ""her"", is not real. Samantha(Scarlett Johannsen), an A.I. virtual assistant, in Spike Jonze's ""Her"", is not real either, but Twombly(Joaquin Phoenix) can't tell. Samantha evolves. ""She"" vacates her unit. If Kayla doesn't evolve into the girl with the wide grin, flashing the peace sign near the playground equipment, this other ""her"" will leave, too, via delete.And then what?",Eighth Grade

125,Equalizer16,Burnham knows young people.,10,9 May 2019,"Eighth grader: Kayla Day (Elsie Fisher) is in her last week of middle school before joining high school, and she's trying to get herself out there in her school before the end of the year. Posting different videos on her blog discussing how to be more confident in being yourself, Kayla challenges herself to be brave in the scary digital obsessed world of the middle schoolers, from connecting with her current class mates to meeting new ones and trying to impress the boy she fancies.For Bo Burnham's directorial debut, Eighth Grade is a masterful coming of age film, beautifully engrossed in the modern day and age of the current young generation. Burnham's age is no doubt his strongest benefit for taking on a coming of age project in this period, but his inter-personal study of the character Kayla demonstrates a heavy level of understanding of the teenage mind. Although myself, I am under the term young-adult, I can say that the issues dealt in the film are just as real and applicable to a universal audience. And it really comes down to the genius of his writing, a screenplay undeniably over looked by the last awards season, (but who needs to listen to awards after this year anyway). From the smallest details about pop digital culture to the playful and awkward dialogue between the kids, Burnham's script envelopes an outstanding 21st century world. Simply put Burnham knows the lives of young people.The heart and joy of the film is a fantastic Elsie Fisher a definitive teenager, embodying the true isolated and lonely middle school anxieties, we can all recall. I saw a lot of myself in her. From her blank shyness in the class room to the her more self-confident identity alone on her blog, Fisher is a fully 3-D dimensional character. At one-point Karla comments on the fact that if people got to know her, they would see she's a fun person, and that I think is the sort of wisdom that prevents us, even grownups from engaging with other people. There's no way to prevent yourself from being caught up in this sympathetic and charming girl, her shyness makes us care for her, but the world she's facing is just as daunting. There's a more than promising future ahead of this one.Josh Hamilton as Karla's dad: Mark is the loveable but embarrassing parent that cares deeply for his daughter but is at a long distance to understanding her fully. During critical conversations between him and Karla like all parents he is the rock of her strength and love. Between their wise cracking arguments and social boundary on the dinner table and in the car, Hamilton is adorably funny, and yet magnificently true as a parent. Burnham handles his characters with precise care but strong realism.What Eighth Grade gloriously takes hold of is a weighty atmosphere antagonised through the sound of the music and song choices that perform in great coordination with the feelings of stress and angst. Or when Kayla stares at the boy she likes and the same slow-motion dramatic music plays, its ticklish and delightful.With a sincere recognition of the digital world that is consumed by the young generation, with the faces and minds absorbed by their phones. One sequence with some superb editing techniques captures this engrossment almost too perfectly, through a montage of white screens.Intelligently funny, engaged with the its culture the film is entertaining not just for its own audience but for adults alike, with an incredible lead performance of pure teenage social anxiety, Eighth Grade is a glowing gem to be seen.",Eighth Grade
126,mycannonball,Different Perspective,6,19 November 2019,"This film had a lot of critical hype. I went into it with high expectations. And did the filmmaker manage to capture the feel of a painful 8th grade experience? Yes. BUT - that doesn't change the fact that it was really slow. Almost too realistic in that real life is boring. Still, it's nice to get an adolescent movie that isn't all glossy with black & white cliché characters.",Eighth Grade
127,ccamp89,"Authentic and insightful, if somewhat inconsistent",7,12 August 2018,"Eighth Grade certainly stands out as one of the more authentic portrayals of what the millennial middle school experience must be like. It primarily examines the profound impact social media has had on the preteen and adolescent experience and does a frequently wonderful job of weaving social media into the fabric of the film. Early on comes an excellent montage of our socially inhibited protagonist sitting on her bed, earbuds secured, face illuminated by her phone, colorful and bright social media app images superimposed over her vacant, even troubled expression, likes and comments flowing through her fingertips, pop music blaring. It's a great example of a director harnessing the film medium to make a statement which would've otherwise needed a mass of words to properly articulate.The film is at it's best when it's in this headspace, capturing the experience of today's middle schooler with both insight and humor. Take perhaps its best sequence in which Kayla apprehensively attends a scornful classmate's birthday party filled with kids she doesn't know. Here the film fires on all cylinders and offers a barrage of effective choices and moments: use of voiceover from Kayla's YouTube channel to add weight to the harsh reality of her loneliness, cringy and effective humor in the awkward interactions between her and her crush, the way in which Kayla is constantly framed as separate from the mass of kids enjoying themselves, and that absolutely painful moment of silence when her classmate opens up Kayla's birthday gift which has to be one of the most potently uncomfortable scenes I've watched this year. As a whole this sequence not only entertains, it builds empathy and is executed with a realism that forces you to stew in Kayla's discomfort. Perhaps it'll even bubble up emotions from a similar experience you may have had growing up.But there are times when the film veers somewhat off course. It may simply be a matter of taste, but some of the humor just didn't land with me. So much of the film's strength is in its authenticity and the comedy at times becomes overblown in a way that detracts from the realism. The banana scene, for instance, or the somewhat forced conversation between Kayla and her crush under the desk during the shooting drill - these are moments that feel more like SNL sketches than genuine middle school experiences. Too often the movie overreaches for laughs when restraint may have served it better. It also struggles to fully satisfy narratively with later would-be ""climatic"" moments which feel somewhat unearned and abrupt. A great example of this is the scene where Kayla confronts her condescending classmates towards the conclusion which comes out-of-left-field and feels like it was shoved into the film for the sake of providing some sort of unnecessary ""closure.""In the grand scheme, these shortcomings aren't enough to overshadow the film's many successes. It stands out as a notable and insightful film on the subject and is certainly worth the watch even it doesn't stick every landing.Strong 3.5/5",Eighth Grade

131,vsks,Relive the mortifications of adolescence--the pain! the hope!,9,21 August 2018,"Comedian Bo Burnham wrote and directed this debut comedy about a girl approaching the end of eighth grade. Seeing this movie makes your present life look pretty darn good! So while it's funny, it's painfully so. Been there. Or someplace similar. While American adolescence has been typically miserable for generations, today's added dimension is the unrelenting pressure of social media.
The awkward, socially ignored Kayla creates self-help vlogs on topics like ""putting yourself out there"" and ""growing up."" They are mainly a way for this suburban teen to articulate her own confused thoughts and give a pep-talk to herself, because at some point we see her usage stats. No one watches them. 
Though New Yorker critic Richard Brody complains that the introvert Kayla has no friends and seems to have no interests (forgetting her participation in the extremely forgettable school band), he's overlooking not just the video production, but also the way constantly scouring social media dominates Kayla's day. There's no time left for swim team or cheerleading practice or piano lessons. 
Elsie Fisher does a remarkable playing Kayla. In fact, all the kids are perfect, including ""mean girl"" Kennedy (played by Catherine Oliviere), for whom Kayla is a non-entity or worse. Message from Kennedy to Kayla: ""hi so my mom told me to invite you to my thing tomorrow so this is me doing that."" Kayla is reticent, slightly hunched, but moving forward doggedly, whether to class, a pool party, or, well, life. You have to admire her, including her drive to help others. 
At one point, a boy makes a pass at Kayla. Women watching this film will see an all-too-familiar dynamic when he turns what happens into her fault and she ends up apologizing.""Sorry,"" she keeps saying, when of course she should have punched his lights out.
Contrast this role and performance with that of Tom in the much-hyped Leave no Trace. Unlike director Debra Granik, Burnham gives Fisher plenty to do, and she does it, with all the stumbling and uncertainty of a thirteen-year-old trying to live up to expectations, but not quite sure what those are. 
Kayla's relationship with her father, a single dad (Josh Hamilton), is what you'd expect. He reaches out, but most of the time she's too absorbed in her own world to think he's anything other than embarrassing. Points for hanging in, Dad.
To quote Kayla, ""Growing up can be a little bit scary and weird."" Absolutely.",Eighth Grade
132,LilyDaleLady,Disjointed and ultimately phony,2,1 March 2019,"Though I am umpteen times the age of the protagonist here....probably nobody knows more about ""being unpopular in 8th grade"" than I did. So while the intention here is good, the film just flounders. I don't think a male director/writer can possibly really know about a girl's experiences. I wonder why he did not focus on the awkward BOY here instead.First off -- and I read the rapturous professional reviews, 99% positive on Rotten Tomatoes (just a hair off of ""Lady Bird"" for cripes sake!) -- this structure here makes no sense. We only learn AT THE END, that Kayla's dad is divorced from her mom. That means her mom is ALIVE!!! I was sure from everything prior her mom was DEAD, and she was a grieving girl -- and that the happiness in her 6th grade ""time capsule"" video was because her mom was ALIVE back then. Obvious but .... nope. He's divorced, and we have no inkling if this was when Kayla was 2 years old or 12 years old. Where is her mom? NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES. She's alive but has ZERO interaction with the girl -- the dad doesn't even call her to ask advice about their desperately unhappy, depressed daughter!So is the mom an opioid addict? run off with another man? locked in a mental hospital? NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES. Kayla never refers to the loss of her mom, yet isn't it THIS that is making her depressed? not her acne or lack of social skills? wouldn't your MOM, another woman, be the one you ask for advice about clothes, hair, makeup, boys? So the dad has NO GIRLFRIEND, all these years of parenting alone? Kayla has never seen a therapist about the obvious pain of NOT HAVING HER MOTHER around? No aunt? no grandmothers?Can Bo Burnham be SO DENSE he does not realize any of this? this is a classic ""dead mom"" story, like so many sitcoms, where mom is eliminated because it suits the storyline and yet nobody is bothered, or grieved or notices! (NOTE: the superiority of ""Lady Bird"" is precisely because she does have a mom, and her relationship WITH her mom is at the very crux of the storyline. And true also of the superior film ""Edge of Seventeen"".)Another painful flaw: any girl who looked like Kayla in today's world (2017-2018) would be focused on her weight and dieting. Though not obese by any means, she is clearly 20+ lbs overweight. (I wonder if the actress gained some lbs for the part.) She has bulges, and a big pot belly. Such a girl would NEVER EVER show up at a pool party, except maybe under a big cover-up. She'd be in anguish over her lack of fashionable skinniness. Yet does Kayla mention dieting or her weight for one second? Nope. (Does she ever consider that her lack of stylish clothes or makeup acumen are maybe because SHE HAS NO MOTHER to consult? Nope.)Also: having run this gantlet (see my first sentence), the refuge of most such girls is a close, intense friendship with one or more OTHER awkward unpopular girls. Yet Kayla has zero girlfriends -- zero. (At the end, she makes friends or a boyfriend with the awkward unpopular BOY she meets at the pool party.) She doesn't even approach a girl like herself. Is her school literally made up of all cute popular (rude) girls plus Kayla, the ONE outsider? REALLY? no other fat, awkward, pimply girls with braces or something? NOT ONE?Lastly: in a way this is a horror movie, about truly awful dependency young people have on their phones. Pretty or popular, homely or fat...NOBODY should be living life through a phone, constantly taking pictures of one's self or making videos about one's self! letting kids do this borders on child abuse. Yet so many viewing this movie do not seem to see any of these things.Troubling.",Eighth Grade

While he might have a promising career in cinema ahead of him, here's to hoping he doesn't leave his performing career as he is definitely a unique voice that would be missed.What it lacks in Burnham's signature style of comedy it makes up for with a heartbreakingly beautiful central performance, with Elsie Fisher inhabiting her role in a way that made it seem like she wrote the part herself.Watch it if you were ever young and awkward or if you have a heart.",Eighth Grade

139,johnplocar,"Realistic, smart, funny, and touching. Solid work!",8,24 November 2018,"This is the second directorial debut from a comedic actor I've seen this week and this was also, in my opinion, a solid effort. ""Eighth Grade"" does a terrific job capturing that awkward part of puberty that I think we've all gone through, while also showing how difficult it can be to establish relationships in today's society with the youth constantly obsessed with being on their phones and what's going on in social media. It also finds the humor with a girl just getting into her high school years such as the rocky kinship between her and her father, her going through having a crush on the 'bad boy' in school, figuring out certain things about sexual interactions, etc. Bo Burnham has always been a talented comedian, but I think he proves that he has more range in his talents here; he shows that he knows what he's talking about with being young and lacking confidence in oneself because of those awkward phases.""Eighth Grade"" centers on Kayla Day, a young girl who is in the very last week of her eighth grade year. In preparation of going into high school she goes through an arc of trying to figure herself out while also attempting to overcome her own personal anxieties such as being afraid to speak out and simply put herself out there so people can get to know her, trying to get the attention of the boy she likes, or even finding a way to make friends with some older kids that she finds to be cool.What I really appreciate about this movie was that it felt like a story that someone personally went through, as if Bo Burnham had held onto his pre-high school experiences and wrote them all into his script. That is what this feels like to me and I dug that about this movie. I do remember feeling awkward at that time, honestly throughout most of my time in school, feeling the want I had inside of me to be more confident and put myself out there yet lacking the confidence to do so. It's tough at that age and it's made all the more difficult nowadays with the increase in technology integrated into our everyday lives, especially with teenagers. The movie does a really good job showing that puberty is confusing and more awkward now more than ever because we somewhat lack true human connection because the majority of kids now are consistently having their eyes focused on the screen of their phones rather than actually having a conversation in person with someone right in front of them. It also shows how much that has kind of driven the kids that feel left out to seek friendship and attention out in the world wide web whether it be via posting videos on YouTube or liking everyone's picture on Instagram. We all seek a connection in some way and that's what today's youth has pretty much been led towards to find it.But when the youth finally comes across a human connection, what happens? This movie goes into that territory too. Kayla has opportunity after opportunity to interact with her father and she squanders it because that's not really the attention we want at that time, right? We want the cool kids to like us, we want the cute boy/girl to notice us, we want a million people to listen to what we have to say and hopefully like us for who we are because we want to feel special. Kayla has her father right there telling her right to her face that he believes her to be special, yet she blows it off. Why? Because at that age we're arrogant and stubborn. We want anyone who isn't family to tell us that same exact thing because somehow that makes it real. That awkward search feels fully realized in this movie.I also like how this feels like Burnham's eighth grade equivalent to a film like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"". In certain aspects, particularly in the comedy and certain 'inopportune timed' moments, it was very reminiscent of what ""Fast Times"" would do with its characters that wound up in sticky situations. I laughed quite a bit in this movie, pretty hard at times as well. There's one specific running gag with a soundtrack choice that would play whenever the 'bad boy' would show up that really made me laugh every time. Although, like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", it may be a funny movie but it also can get serious quick. With this movie there is a scene with Kayla and a high school boy that she meets and while it doesn't necessarily go into anything outright disturbing, it does get somewhat intense as things in the scene progress into a very uncomfortable level. And it doesn't feel out of place or tonally inconsistent, it feels natural to the story and captures that terrifying feeling when you're alone with someone and things just aren't quite right. The drama is also handled very well, in a way that feels realistic and believable. Especially with the scenes between Kayla and her father that seemed to understand how hard it is for a dad to talk to his own daughter in a way that reaches her without being too weird, but usually failing.With a movie like this it could be really easy to make a teen girl that lashes out and acts moody most of the time extremely unlikable, maybe even downright irritating. Luckily with smart writing and a great performance by Elsie Fisher, the character of Kayla is relatable and I really routed for her to find her place in life or at the very least be happy. She made me laugh, she warmed my heart, she made me worry for her, Fisher does a lovely job and I am looking forward to seeing her in the future.If I were to name any complaints, I suppose that maybe it would be that the film lacks focus at times. Not terribly so, but the structure could have had a more solid foundation. There are also some subplots and scenes that probably could have been cut or shortened. But at the same time, this movie was made to capture the feeling of the early teen years and how life kind of comes with its own set of random events, sometimes those events don't add to more than just 'well that happened and it's over now'. I had a good time with this movie; it's smart, has good commentary on social media/technology, downright funny and touching writing, quality acting, and a pretty decent soundtrack. ""Eighth Grade"" is entertaining and I strongly recommend to check it out if you haven't already!",Eighth Grade

I guess that's what typically happens in real life but it doesn't make for a great movie, in my opinion. Burnham definitely knows how to make you cringe, which is a vital ability when making a film about an out-of-place eighth grader, but the script is lacking. The film is carried by superb acting on the part of Fisher and that is the only gratifying thing I really got out of it. It is often out of touch with the reality of eighth grade (a student asking another if they do blowjobs during a shelter in place comes to mind). The music choice was also questionable to say the least.",Eighth Grade
141,severindringel,People who judge the film for its cringeworthiness have no clue about this generation,8,30 April 2021,"Bo Burnham initially made a splash on YouTube until he rose to comedic genius a few years ago. In the 2018 coming-of-age comedy Eighth Grade, the ""American-Darling"" tried his hand in the director's chair for the first time in combination with writing the script. 13-year-old Kayla is about to jump into high school and tries to distract herself from the dreary school routine by making her own lifestyle videos. Kayla is a victim of the new generation, who is heavily adolescent in her search for her standing in it.Elsie Fisher in the lead role of Kayla represents how we felt at least once a few years ago at this certain age. Everything is bad, we have no chance in this world and we are surrounded by exclusively disgusting personalities. The character is insanely relatable, especially in the beginning, and you can totally understand her difficulties and behaviours. As soon as she leaves her comfort zone, which isn't really one given her struggles, Kayla too realises that the world does have something in store for her. This kind of overcoming is communicated in an enormously human way through Fisher's mature and realistic portrayal, and holds a lot of warmth despite some cringe worthy dialogue and action. If you think the film's specific subject matter is only for people of this generation, you'd be wrong. Josh Hamilton adds the important touch of the responsible father and adult to the often very infantile and naive plot. Our parents struggled with us in the same way during this period of our development. But if they did their job well, it didn't change their unconditional affection for us. This is exactly the parental figure Hamilton plays, clueless when it comes to dealing with his daughter but always trying to understand and reach her better. More often than not, this doesn't work, but when the two get up to operating temperature, the film hits on sugary sweet and heartfelt scenes. What Burnham has also understood in terms of the casting is to put real young actors in the roles of the eighth graders. As a result, at no point does the film seem fake or forced, but simply natural.Burnham's signature is clearly evident in Eighth Grade. It is very funny and deliberately cringey in large parts because let's face it, from our point of view that was pretty much all that was going on around us at that time in our lives. This may seem completely absurd to people who don't know about all the insiders and trends among teenagers, but it's actually the reality. It would be no wonder if Burnham had incorporated some of his experiences as a student into the lead role. It is sometimes too obvious that in addition to the chaos, the dramatic elements must also serve, which is sometimes excellently told (especially a scene in a car), but then also too generic. Here you realise that Burnham's strength is in the comedy sector, even if the drama aspect is definitely necessary in a coming-of-age film like this. Many sequences feel out of place and drag, making the pace of the plot a little all over the place at times. All in all, though, Eighth Grade is a fine little piece that excels with a cracking script, its terrific lead performance and, above all, its down-to-earthness.",Eighth Grade

However, one quickly realizes that it's through these monologue-style social media vlogs that Kayla is really speaking to the audience, and in turn, the socially awkward and conflicted eighth grader that resides in all of us.Burnham's crystal clear characterization of pubescent life is to be expected. His magnificent camera work, however, is very much a pleasant surprise. Numerous static shots are perfectly composed, while other times the camera's movement adds to the emotional zenith of a scene, such as the apprehension one would inevitably feel in joining a middle school pool party.

But the way a large number of people so negatively react to this film is a testament to how powerful it really is, and perhaps says more about the film than those reviews themselves ever could.We live in a world that hates the truth. And ""Eighth Grade"" is pure truth. The most remarkable thing about the film is how it refrains from dramatizing how young people today grow up and interact, and instead tries to simply show things how they are. You can argue how successful they were in this attempt, but I think they got it pretty close. And some things about growing up are timeless. While the technology may have changed, all of the things Kayla did in the film, I also did at that age. I also came from a broken home and background of trauma, and I was also not popular. One review said that you had to be a loser to like this film, and maybe there is more than a nugget of truth there. The kid who was head of the class in Grade 8 might have a tough time relating.The film does very little to explain all this to the viewer, and does not make any attempt to show why Kayla is how she is. This is fascinating because that is exactly how our society, and in particular teen society, works: it is blind to why people are how they are, and simply ruthlessly sorts them into categories such as attractive/popular and ugly/unpopular. It seems that people who are used to going along with this way of thinking are puzzled and unsettled by the film.What ""Eighth Grade"" ultimately is, is a mirror.

It's uhhh, a little tough when your like the least most popular girl in school but uhhh, like just be someone you aren't and in the end like it might help you. See you next time, Gucci!So you've come to this review? For a film about the last week of school in the shoes of an awkward wanna be cool girl. This problematic premise wasn't as strong as I had hoped and it really was just disappointing.I'll be doing something different, going major scene by major scene.So act one followed our protagonist obtaining one of those ""from the past"" boxes with some Hobby's and interests she used to like. 
Also there is a weird scene about sex anatomy and some kid is jacking off while the woman on the video says the cringey lines of ""it's gonna be lit,"" and a scene if a teacher dabbing(why?). 
She is clearly quiet and socially awkward and is invited by this girl's mother to a b day party. At the b day there are some kids playing at a pool including the b day girl's brother and this one kid she crushes on, she has a brief encounter with him later on and then they unbox the presents. Doing the typical socially awkward kid she presents her with a card game which the girl clearly gets confused by.
Zooming on they do this weird school shooting play(?) Or drill(?) And she is staring at her crush. This girl near our main character then says he is a jerk and that he had tried to ask for nudes to this one girl.
This girl being stupid during a drill tries to seduce him with the thought that she has nudes and he gets interested.
Then the focus shifts to her shadowing a senior and then later on she decides to meet with her. They're having a good time when her father shows up to which the protagonist yells that she can get a ride.
She gets a ride and is all alone with this guy to which they eventually play a game of truth or dare. He dares her to take off her shirt after she says she'd hit 2nd and 3rd base. She says no and goes home crying.
The next day she goes on a dinner date with the b day girl's brother and they enjoy each other's company.
Then there's a scene of her older and it's basically another ""from the past"" video. The end.Firstly, theres this one scene where the father walks into her room and she throws the phone at the wall, breaking her phone. Who in their right mind breaks their phone over there parents walking in? All she did was going on Instagram past her bedtime.
Secondly, I don't know a single girl who's that socially awkward.
Third, why would she lie about her sex life.
Fourth, I heard that this was written or directed by a father of a daughter(so what I got was that what guys are only in for is sex).

For some reason there are certain adults who automatically become enraged at the sight of a kid on a smart phone; I think those adults stopped paying attention to the story well before they could figure out what it's really about.Regardless of the superficial trappings of the ""modern world"", protagonist Kayla has the same struggles 13-year-olds have endured for centuries: she doesn't know who she is, or how to fit in. We're all seeking human connection; social media is only the latest manifestation of that basic need, with its own positives and negatives.

The characters for the most part are cardboard, and glaringly obvious that this is a portrayal of what a comedian thinks being an eighth grade girl is like. This character doesn't seem to have much wrong with her life, meaning that the movie has no conflict, so the film as a whole seemed to drag. The plot line was incredibly eventless and dull. My eighth grade experience was so memorable because so much happened to me without any effort on my part. There was no bullying or psychological torment in this, a staple of being a modern eighth grader, in addition to little to no foul language on the kids' part. Why wasn't there constant swearing by the students? Thats all anyone does in eighth grade, and the film is rated R, so why was it played so safe? There is no excuse for this film to not be taken to the extreme.

156,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Beautiful and Awkward Bliss,8,8 August 2018,"A fantastic interpretation of the life of a middle schooler. From beginning to end this film captures a feeling not normally associated with the cinema; awkwardness. This is not your typical comedy, not your typical drama, it almost lives in its own world of heart wrenching awkwardness that is griping. Bolstered by one of the most impressive performances I have seen this year in Elsie Fisher, which acting only a few years younger than her age may not be too impressive to people. However, to capture awkwardness in a way that isn't cheesy or cringy is hard to pull off. 
 Secondly, a huge opening to Bo Burnham career. A man high up in the comedian's world, took a gamble in the movie industry; which proves over and over again that it is not as easy as it looks, even the tried and true professionals screw up. But Burnham came into the scene with a poorly timed band concert and won over our hearts. He definitely will be getting phone calls to run it back for whatever his next venture may be. Even if the follow up isn't very good, you can't just hit it and quit it on a movie this well made. 
 Overall Eight Grade may connect with only a somewhat small sample-size of 20-30-year old's who lived through the awkward middle school years in some part of the internet era. At the end of the day this is Burnham's take on not necessarily his childhood, but one he can understand well. This is a highly recommended film from myself, even if it isn't your cup of tea, it is definitely a movie to watch and to feel awkwardness to your core for even the first time.",Eighth Grade

This movie brought back so many memories of how awkward it was to be in junior high, where everything seemed like a social horror movie and parents were the ""absolute worst.""The movie isn't too heavy on plot, more of like a ""slice of life"" portrait similar to Boyhood, but that doesn't really matter since it's entertaining, incredibly funny, poignant, and even terrifying at times.It does tackle some very hard topics too, especially when dealing with characters who have no idea how to handle certain difficult situations-it makes for a tough watch in parts. And I think that's what makes this movie so good: it doesn't shy away from an honest look at how tough it was for kids to navigate middle school.

The depiction of the immense social pressures that modern teenagers have to endure is scarily realised here.

The ending didn't feel like it resolved everything. There still felt like more that could have been done. The amount of pop culture references and modern calls took me out of the film every now and then.

The film's dulled by the general dullness and inarticulateness of its protagonists and those around her. Its quite evident effort to impute this dullness of mind and speech to stultifying influences of the characters' social media and, more generally, electronic culture has a thrust that appeals to me, but comes off for me as cover for a lack of insight into nuances of personality and interpersonal interaction that cannot be so absent in any actually existing world as this film suggests that they are.This is not to say that the movie was not engaging enough to keep me, in the theater or does not occasionally spring to life or that it is without cautionary value for parents, teachers and thoughtful kids.",Eighth Grade
166,TheJohnnyPHreak,The Teen Comedy Drama All Teens Need To See,9,22 December 2018,"Many of us have been that awkward kid in school. Many of us have been the shy, not easily approachable kid at the party. Life is all about experiences, learning from those and overcoming them. It takes time, it takes putting yourself out there. And it's definitely not easy. Especially in the US, many of us struggle with fitting in. I know I did. It took me a long time to just fit in. I had friends but in school sometimes those friends on the surface are not the friends that you share the real experiences with.Bo Burnham has captured in a perfect shot the teen life as it is now with Eighth Grade. The story follows the last week of school for Kayla Day (Elsie Fisher) before she goes off to high school. She's had a rough school year. This last week she's trying to make it through to bigger and maybe better things in the future. Kayla as a video blog on youtube where she gives advice to people about all things in life. The most fascinating part is Kayla's online persona is everything she wants to be in life. She's strong, thoughtful, caring, funny, introspective and interesting. But in life, Kayla is none of those things.Elise Fisher is such a standout in this role. Without her star-making performance, there's no way this film would be so emotional and endearing. She portrays both sides of so well. At times it's hard to sit through. If you were that kid in the school, you'll almost instantly relate. (I know I did) Some of the awkward cringe-inducing moments may bring out dormant feelings you may need to reflect on. I was so on board with her character and just rooting for her. I was at times so into the movie I was talking to the screen and had to avert my eyes. But the feels (as they say today) will take over.Burnham with this script has gotten for teens now down. The dialogue feels so real, the interactions don't feel forced. The way the film is shot takes the viewers into the lives of these teens. Not feeling staged, not feeling preachy, the film just comes off as we are stepping into their life and then stepping out. Not only does Fisher give an outstanding performance but Josh Hamilton might go down as the best dad ever. He loves his daughter, he's so proud of her, he wants her to be happy and will do anything he can to help that. There is a monologue he has during the end of the film that won't just tug but rip at your heartstrings.Eighth Grade is the teen comedy-drama I wish I had when I was a teen. It never pushes an agenda. It displays life as it is. There are moments of struggle, awkwardness, and hope. I think that's the best thing about this film. It may not pretty. It might not be shiny and happy. But life, when you go through it, will change you. Sometimes if you push yourself outside of the box, it can bring wonderful things. I hope that this film during this award season gets some love. Because Burnham's screenplay deserves some Oscar love. Elsie Fisher's performance deserves some acting love.

173,littlemankazoo,THE FILM for this current generation,9,22 July 2018,"Full disclosure: Middle school was the worst years of my life and nothing will ever change that from being the case.That's perhaps why I find myself so baffled by what Bo Burnham has accomplished with his writing/directorial debut and the newest of A24's heavyweight lineup of independent films.Bo Burnham, using some sort of voodoo magic and perhaps an animal sacrifice or two, has managed to not only boil-down all of the awkwardness, unsureness, experimenting, anxiety and emotions of this period of life down to a science, but he also has managed to write what is quite possibly one of the most honest and realistic portrayals of a teenage girl that I have ever seen.To preface; I absolutely adore Bo Burnham, but I was fairly skeptical entering a film that he himself directed and wrote. With all the creative decisions of a pretty small film under him, this could have easily devolved into disaster if he didn't have the chops.But, to perhaps no one's surprise, one of the most creative stand-up comedians in the game right now debuted with one of the best portrayals of our teenage years and this current generation, which figures coming from the man who's career began from humble beginnings in the early ages of Youtube.""Eighth Grade"" is the story of Kayla Day, played by unknown-until-now Elsie Fisher, and her final days in eighth grade and all the awkward, weird, joyous and miserable ways those days can transpire. These are presented to us in perhaps slightly disjointed manner, but they almost feel anecdotal in their manner. Plus, as I can attest and ANY middle schooler can attest, all those days and experiences eventually blend-in at some point...What I feel the need to point out immediately is the absolutely incredible performance by Elsie Fisher, who executes what I think is THE GREATEST portrayal of a teenager I have ever seen put to film. She doesn't deliver lines like an actor, but instead with all the unevenness and unsure feelings one would come to expect. She doesn't look like a supermodel so you buy every single second of her self-doubt, her nerves and anxieties. Even as a 21-year old male, there is so much in her performance and the character she creates in Kayla Day that I STILL related massively to her. I absolutely think this is a star-making performance, and if Elsie Fisher doesn't get an Academy Award nomination, the Academy will have egg on their face.In addition to Elsie Fisher, we get wonderful supporting performances from the likes of Josh Hamilton as her father, along with a bundle of other teen actors who are just as honest in their interpretation of adolescences as Bo Burnham's writing is. There is not a single performance I did not buy in this film, which makes all the emotions and ways you can relate to this that much more visceral in their nature.To go off of that, Bo Burnham's screenplay is something of an odd beast that ends up working anyway. Rather than character arcs or any real setups, this feel ends up feeling staggered in its way it tells various instances and scenarios Kayla goes through, which works to its advantage in the way it easily weaves. In addition, as I said before, the way all of these teenagers are written is the complete opposite of the over-blown and silly portrayals we see in work like ""Mean Girls"" or any other Disney Channel or Young Adult work you could find. This is HONEST, and Bo Burnham seems to have found a seemingly John Hughes-esque talent of capturing what this current generation is all about and how it operates.Which perhaps brings me to this film's most powerful aspect, but potentially also its only real weakness.This film is going to be THE cult film of a generation. Specifically, this one. The ""Smart Phone Generation"", as some derisively call my generation and the ones after us.So much of this film paints a portrait of these kids growing-up in a confusing time with an even more confusing climate of the internet and social media floating around them. Granted, I don't believe it is touched-on quite as well as last year's ""Ingrid Goes West"" (Which completely DESTROYS the foundations of social media and critiques it viciously), but it holds its cards close to its hands as it shows Kayla and everyone growing-up in a previous generation that is trying its hardest to keep up and understand them, while they continue to move at light-speed and learn everything, repeat everything, and see the world from their smart phone screens and laptop screens. It's an understated theme to the film, and I think that's what truly makes this film an ESSENTIAL film for the Millenial generation to witness and relate massively to, and know that there is someone out there who understands and can tell stories they can connect to. If any film taps-into the culture of today from a child's perspective, it's most certainly this one.That said, this is a double-edged sword. This film could potentially become a time-capsule and soon become outdated and lose its relevance with how timely it attempts to be. While all the smart phones, social media sites and Rick & Morty references are working in the wheelhouse here and now, it has the potential to become VERY outdated and seemingly tacky in about 10-15 years, and I am a firm believer that a truly classic film should remain timeless in some aspects. My fear is that this film could potentially end up dating itself, which isn't a terrible fate for a film that is so definitively THIS GENERATION, but that's perhaps a slight negative.Along with this, there's obviously a few odds and ends that come from the fact that Bo Burnham is a first-time director. He attempts visual motifs with his cinematography, but they eventually recede as the film progresses and we get odd choices of handheld camera work instead. It feels hardly artificial and genuine, for certain, but it lacks a real punch and artistry that I think was needed to push this even harder. Along with it, I think he pushes towards ""breaking points"" in certain scenes of the film that could really create powerful, effective scenes of drama, but it seems he's afraid of going just that extra length to punch us with the emotion of it. If you see the film, you will know the exact scenes I am describing in this fashion.All of that said, and all of my concerns aside...this is a truly spectacular film for all it does right. It feels personal, it feels like it is made from the ground-up for this generation and understands it better than an Hollywood screenwriter could, is acted honestly and never shies away from trying to articulate EXACTLY what these years of life were like.And for me to see the worst years of my life interpreted on the big screen...that's a pretty good feeling.Pretty terrifying and awkward and cringe-y. But pretty good.",Eighth Grade
174,jg_1977,So accurate it hurts,9,29 July 2018,"Being a big fan of Bo Burnham's stand up, I was very curious to see how he'd do behind the camera. I'm pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. Eighth Grade is a simple, yet effective character exploration of a 13 year old girl trying figure out who she is through the turmoil of the last week of eighth grade. Kayla (as portrayed by Fischer) absolutely sells this movie. She expertly portrays her emotion through her facial expressions rather than her words, which is one of the recurring jokes/themes of the movie; she is too young to truly be able to communicate what she feels, so we the audience are left to infer her emotions through her eyes. This was a bold strategy, but due to Fischer's skills, it absolutely paid off and made the movie grounded and realistic. Much of the humor of the movie is derived from how accurate and at times awkward Burnham portrays middle school life. From teachers clunkily trying to use middle schooler vernacular, to kids not understanding social cues, to kids being glued to their phones, this movie really captures that time in everyone's life and puts a comedic spin on it. Surprisingly, this movie also had some incredibly done moments of tension and heart that I wasn't expecting to see in a 90 minute comedy about a middle schooler. There was one scene in particular that had me on the edge of my seat like I was watching a Mission Impossible movie. Anyways, Burnham absolutely nailed his feature film directorial debut, delivering a movie that is relatably cringy, funny, tense, and heartfelt.",Eighth Grade

She was not portrayed as interesting or special, other than through her awkwardness and isolation (but most of us are not), and had a lot of extremely annoying habits. That is the point. Each of us needs to accept our differences and still find a way to thrive. Some of the scenes, such as the banana scene, were purely derivative and unoriginal, but there was enough new stuff to keep it enjoyable. Some may find it too whiney, as the girl's only real problem seems to be that she is average. As far as I could tell, she was never really bullied, abused or traumatized to an extreme extent. Although her mom is out of the picture, her father is portrayed as very loving. Thus, it is really a movie about the difficulties of being average and slightly awkward, with a loving parent, rather than about the difficulty of dealing with more serious issues. However, I guess that makes it more relatable to the average person. True outsiders, however, may find it a bit trivial.",Eighth Grade

I found this to be one of the most realistic movies about this age (i.e. middle school). This film is more brutally honest about that period than any other movie I can recall. Interestingly, a lot of the negative reviews on here assert that the movie is slow or boring (or ""yawn""); but that's sort of the point. In order to be true to reality, it must by definition be somewhat slow. Real lives are not filled with action-packed scenes and high drama. It's just ordinary, every-day life stuff. If you were fortunate enough to be the popular people or the athletes or cheerleaders in school, then you might not get this film. But for the remaining 80% of us, this is a great depiction of those years. And there is a story and a plot; not earth-shattering, but it's there (e.g. love interest, conflict with popular girls, relationship with father). As someone who has now reached the age of having his own children, I can also relate to the role of the father in this movie, which is very well done.

I haven't seen that many high school movies, not even them on the list, but those I could remember was: Grease, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, Mean Girls, Superbad, Booksmart, 21 Jump Street (half high school movie), American Pie, Not Another Teen Movie, and there's even one more movie Eight Grade is associated with: The Edge Of Seventeen. Except for the plot, both movies look alike. They're both teen dramedies about a teenager who's struggling with a hard life. Some of the scenes looks very much alike, but I won't spoil them.Usually, I want to talk about the cast in the movie, but this movie contains almost no actors I had heard of before. This movie is still good. If I had wanted to make a teen movie, it would be something like this. The difference is that I would have changed some of the scenes, or add some new scenes to the movie. I love the beginning of the movie, but when the movie is over, I sat there expecting something else to happen. But teen movies doesn't actually have an end. They just end when it suits them to end.This is still a good movie. It's not one of the best teen movies I've seen, and it could have been better in several ways. But after all, this is worth a watch.",Eighth Grade

You just don't see many people making their passion projects anymore. Something close to their heart, where they can take an honest and deep look at the subject matter. It's all studios ordering movies they know will sell and no genuine, weird, different, lovingly made works of art anymore.Great acting, great writing, great directing all around. Almost every single actor was fantastic but the girl who plays Kayla gave me goosebumps. She made it so real it was uncomfortable to watch her sometimes. Perfect pick of child/young actors, truly wonderful job.This is not a chick flick, it's not a feel good high school movie for teens, this is a no bs look at growing up in America today, and how hard it is to be an insecure, 13 year old girl, trying to find a tiny bit of confidence, a little hole she can fit in, any hope for a better tomorrow, all the while making the dumb mistakes we all did, thinking it's the end of the world for her, taking all her anger out of a parent.

Being a kid is not easy, from trying to make friends, to doing well in school, to just trying to find out who you are as a person. Bo Burnham captures these moments perfectly.For not having a mother figure in her life, it really effects a young girl. This movie may only touch on this moment briefly, but that shows how strong Kayla has to be, but also how hard it is for her to navigate it by herself. These moments I completely relate to, and I love just how sweet her relationship with her dad is. really showing that father-daughter embarrassment we all have, but no matter what at the end of the day - your dad is there for you and loves you completely.a really well done coming of age film that a lot of people can relate to. also touches on how social media can actually help with confidence and trying to come out of your shell.

So if the film is intended to help anyone of the same age, they can't watch it. And anyone meeting the age restriction has already passed this stage of life. I was expecting it to be funnier than it was. It's a pretty accurate depiction of what a teenage girl is like, moody and rude. I blame the parent for part of this, as she seems to be in charge more than her father. When she's on her phone at the dinner table with he headphones in, giving her father attitude, it's the fault of the parent for not disciplining her, rather than let her walk all over him. So that annoyed me, other than that it's merely just a diary entery of most teenage girls. May be useful to those of the same age who can relate but again it's rated R, sooooooo",Eighth Grade

It is a good movie, with a simple but involving story and a great grasp on what being a teen is about.The acting suffices, as you mostly see teenagers being teenagers.

In the era where kids are hooked to smartphones, tablets and social media, the film's depicts Kayla's struggles in getting to grips with her life, her peers and her emotions. The film feels very real, which is great credit to actors involved. You are immediately immersed into Kayla's world and instantly invested in her introverted nature and self loathing outlook.

198,BlueFox94,Young Teens & Bright Screens Flock Awkwardly in Eighth Grade,8,25 August 2018,"Hey, guys! It's Renard, back with another review.Um...""Oh my gosh, look at that fluffy unicorn! He's so fluffy I'm gonna die!"" Thus spoke youngest sister Agnes from the 2010 animated comedy Despicable Me, winning the hearts of viewers across the world. Now, eight years later, Agnes' voice actress Elsie Fisher gets her first live action star role in Eighth Grade, the writing-directing feature debut of the young yet seasoned entertainer Bo Burnham. Burnham complements his exaggerated yet nevertheless first-hand knowledge of his story's subject matter with technical crafts that surprise in their modest precision and comedic timing.One week of eighth grade stands between thirteen-year-old Kayla Day (Elsie Fisher) and starting her social life afresh in high school. Kayla has long struggled to make friends at school, while the motivational videos she posts on YouTube receive little to no attention. Kayla shares a remote connection with her single father Mark (Josh Hamilton), who proves no match against the bright screen of her phone and social media. Between a pool party hosted by popular yet vapid classmate Kennedy Graves (Catherine Oliviere), trying to catch the eye of her scrawny and steely-eyed crush, Aiden (Luke Prael), and impressing high school senior Olivia (Emily Robinson) during a high school shadow program, Kayla still hopes to make this last week the start of a brighter future.Audiences will take note at once of Eighth Grade's forest of mobile screens and many empty ""likes"", ""totallys"", and other filler words that have become all too common in the up-and-coming social culture. To put a sharp lens on this isolated environment, writer-director Burnham, cinematographer Andrew Wehde, and editor Jennifer Lilly lock onto Kayla and her immediate surroundings. Kayla participates in the attention-seeking, electronic, and social media-centered routine of her peers, clinging to it while also aware that it has yet to benefit her like it seems to have done for everyone else. Ms. Fisher, undeterred by social interaction in real life, commits to the role of Kayla beautifully.No one likes an awkward moment, and all of the adults featured - save for perhaps Kennedy Graves' kind mother (Missy Yager) - manage to surpass the teenaged characters in their awkwardness. It would not surprise me if Burnham devoted little to no rehearsal time with the adult actors, to keep them as unpolished as possible and with constant misplaced and embarrassing confidence in the eyes of teenagers. (*pause for lit dabbing attempt*) No adult here is more awkward than Kayla's single father. Despite having even less of a spine than Ron Livingston's Drew from Tully, Josh Hamilton's Mark does his best to relish the pride he has for his daughter, even if she feels that her failings so far in life have outnumbered her successes.Between Eighth Grade and Lu Over the Wall from a few months ago, 2018 has succeeded like no other year I can remember in offering a candid and sympathetic mirror for those still looking forward to high school and beyond. Eighth Grade in particular returned me to a moment in junior high at Holy Family School in Seattle when, sitting in the back of the class during a lesson, I could see all of my classmates texting each other underneath their desks. (That was the post-Motorola Razr, pre-iPhone era of mobile devices.) Whereas last year's Lady Bird powered through high school senior year and left viewers at peace by the end, Eighth Grade reminds its audience of a less stable time growing up - a time when what we all needed the most was the reassurance that we were going to be okay. Given the R-rating of writer-director Bo Burnham's dramedy, it appears that many adults today desire that same reassurance. No film can substitute for a human or divine relationship, but for now, Eighth Grade can and does suffice in helping one look forward to the person they will become.I can't wait!(Parental Note: Eighth Grade has been rated R by the MPAA ""for language and some sexual material"".)R.N.B.",Eighth Grade
199,javomed88,Truthful but boring movie,5,21 January 2019,"Eight Grade gives an accurate and empathetic depiction of the Z generation in the American context, with particular focus on an introverted and insecure teenage girl. The film has unique style and develops a coherent narrative. However, I found it difficult to watch as it is very boring and predictable. I believe any teenager experiencing similar situations to the main character would find this film fun and even useful. The problem is that the dialogue in the film is so primitive, that is extremely difficult to remain interested in the story and the characters. I believe this is one of the most over-hyped films this year and don't see any resemblance to Lady Bird, which was also very overrated in my opinion.

205,nikhilmanahs,Heart-warming Beyond Measure,10,2 October 2018,"Being a big fan of ""coming-of-age"" movies I am always looking forward to watch movies of this genre. When I saw the trailer of the movie, I had a feeling that this would be very similar to the ones I have already watched, but boy how wrong I was!The feel of the movie is very quiet, real, nervous and familiar to what we all have gone thru. I personally felt very close to the character depicted in the movie who is self-conscious, confused, introvert and creative. As we grow many new things we encounter which teach us a lot and lend a new meaning to our lives. We have so many wishes, dreams and when harsh reality hits you in the face, we learn the biggest lesson, but that's not a bad thing.Fact that this movie has been directed by a 28 year old Director is both surprising and understandable for he was able to bring out the soul of a quintessential teenager. The different type of people we meet along out journey towards adulthood are shown without making them too stereotypical. Realism of the movie is what stands it apart from other similar movies.Protagonist has done an outstanding job, it feels she is playing herself in the movie as the natural flow is easily visible. The nuances and subtleties of the character are played with utmost perfection. Her Dad is also marvellous. Overprotective, easy going, loveable character with certain past baggage but unconditional love for her daughter is exuding everywhere. Wish more Dads were like him.Movie focuses only one year and it doesn't try to show a lot but go in depth of the main character and her feelings, hopes and desires.

Eighth Grade connects on so many levels. But first, a standing ovation for the lead actress, Elsie Fisher, as Kayla. Such a performance worthy of her Golden Globe nomination. Watching this movie was like watching a documentary. Josh Hamilton also turns in a note worthy role as Kayla's father. In the beginning of the movie I felt frustrated with all the teens buried in their respective phones, wondering if this technology is apart of what ails our culture, but in the second half of the movie Kayla redeems that fear by opening up to her father and figuratively putting the iPhone down.

207,silverpinkcity,Points for being Realistic...Take away points for lack of Personality.,6,27 June 2021,"Yes, this movie feels realistic. It sort of just ""sucks you in,"" like you're a fly on the wall of this awkward 13-year old girl's life. And being a fly on the wall is deliciously satisfying, for some reason.Like...her insecurities and awkwardness make you feel a little better about your own lack of confidence. Yes, it's very cringy. It's often embarrassing at times. It also involves a ton of social media. But it's definitely worth a watch...whether you are this age, have a daughter close to this age....or ever WERE this age!Now, for some negatives: The main character is a bit dull. She seems to have no personality.... ZERO! Along with not one single friend, which is very weird for a girl this age. I mean, even if someone is a total nerd or a geek...they will have other like-minded total nerd or geek friends...or at least ONE other like-minded friend.Also, Kayla (the main character) has absolutely NO interests or hobbies! She doesn't like music or art or writing or sports or cats or mermaids or ANYTHING! Evidently, the only thing she cares about, is what OTHER PEOPLE think of HER! This is a very bad way to be...and yes, I understand that middle-school brings that aspect out in people more than any other age. But even if you are that way in school, there are usually other aspects to your personality, like maybe you're a good swimmer or you care about dolphins.I think if a parent is watching this with her daughter, maybe she could bring that up. Then the movie could act as a good ""teaching moment."" Like...don't base your entire existence on what other people think of you.I'm not saying the main character is a bad person...just someone who has put all the power of her happiness into other people's opinions of her. (And those cringy videos she makes...yikes! Why wouldn't anyone be talking about those? Maybe that's NOT so realistic, after all).Anyway, Kayla's dad is a nice guy who cares, but is totally clueless. He even comes across, at times, as being ""not too bright."" Oh well. No movie is perfect. And, like I said, this one is definitely worth a watch. No, it's not great, like the movie SPEAK.

211,nimdude,I could not relate to the film in any way but it is decent,6,1 October 2018,"First of all I love Bo's stand up work very very much and now I am a fan of him as a director. Not so much as a writer.
I thought about it a bit and I'm pretty sure the reason why I didn't like this film is because I could not relate to it in any way. I am currently in College and I can safely say that I never had social anxiety, depression and in general I was never awkward. So maybe I'm not biased enough to like this movie, or maybe its just badly written.Bo's directing is actually pretty good. The scene that opened my eyes and made me say ""Boy Bo knows how to move a camera"" was the close-up to wide pan scene involving a pool. He doesn't have his own style yet, his directing is more of a series of ""directing tricks"" to make people go ""oh he's a good director"" but hey, fooled me.Elsie Fisher was actually the best part of this movie. She was given a tough role because of some pretty cringe-worthy scenes she needed to perform. The film would be pretty bad without her.The writing. Ah the writing. I'm very sad to say that the writing is pretty bad. The way the scenes are written is fine, but the dialogue is very often full of clichés and suffers from the ""teen movie dialogue"" syndrome. Again, maybe it's just not targeted at people like me, who enjoyed school, but very little of the dialogue is believable. I know that some movies that try to convey messages don't need to or just shouldn't have super believable, real life, Manchester by the Sea dialogue, but if you're trying to make a movie about teens in school and want to convey a message about being yourself then the dialogue should be believable. 0.001% of teens in school have conversations like most of the ones that take place in the film. That doesn't mean that the things that happen in the movie aren't realistic, just the dialogue. 
Writers need to stop making montages of teens using social media. We get it. People are on social media too much. Whenever people watch a scene where characters who are obviously over using social media use social media they watch it thinking ""Yea hahaha stupid movie character, you're stupid for using stupid social media you stupid person ahahah"" and feel this huge moral pleasure for no reason because THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. Almost everyone uses social media these days and most people do it way too much but WE GET IT. WE'VE SEEN 10000 OTHER MOVIES OR SKITS OR INFORMATIVE ANTI ADDICTION VIDEOS THAT SHOW US THE SAME THING. STOP ADDING MONTAGES OF PEOPLE USING SOCIAL MEDIA TOO MUCH AS A WAY OF CRITIQUING IT. Same thing with scenes of the main character talking to a character that is considered to be a ""mean bit** character"" but the mean character is looking constantly at his/her phone. Its so so overused. Alright now the story. The main problem with the story I have is the journey the character takes from the beginning to the end. What I took from the conclusion is that even though people around her don't like her, its because they are bad and not her, oh yea and she should also be herself, also every man on the planet sucks. (What is up with the modern movie trend of making every male character in a movie an idiot, a perv, a creep, a weirdo or a hot stupid guy that is also a perv but the main character likes her type-character). I get that people should be themselves and that some people have a hard time doing it, but I didn't find this to be a satisfying story at all. She didn't have a real arc in the world that is written. She just had a introspective character arc by... I guess ""accepting herself"" or something. It's again, an overused narrative cliché and I thought Bo was better than this. Nothing about the story was new or exciting or fascinating in any way.Bo tried really hard to make the audience cringe, and he succeeded. Not much to add there. I cringed. And everyone will. Why? Because it's cringy. BOOM 90 META-SCORE.... NO! You cannot just make characters say GUCCI and LIT and get praise because you are a genius at cringe comedy. Its not comedy. Its just cringy. Writing characters that say GUCCI and LIT frequently without any comedy is AS BAD as actually un-ironically saying Gucci and lit frequently. It doesn't serve as a plot device, it doesn't serve to show a character trait, it doesn't serve to do anything but make people cringe for no reason. The ""cringe"" in this movie is to comedy what cheap jump-scares are to horror movies.On one hand this movie has a few things going for it but mostly its just a bunch of cliches and it makes me cringe for no particular reason.

214,aaronlbacks,7/10th Grade,7,7 August 2018,"As a fan of Bo Burnham since he was posting rap songs on YouTube, I am proud to say he made a pretty solid directorial debut with Eighth Grade. Firstly, as anticipated, this movie is hilarious as hell, and the comedy written in is quite smart as well. And even though the comedy is sharp and witty and IMDb classifies this film as a comedy, I don't think Bo's intentions were to make the audience guffaw. To me, it felt more like a drama with comedic elements thrown in, and I really like that decision. It gave the appearance that he had a message to get across to any struggling eighth grader out there, or even any sort of adult because the theme is quite universal (and kind of trite in the way he portrayed it, but I'll discuss that later), that hope always lays on the horizon, and I'm glad that he was passionate enough about this message that he didn't want to smother it in comedy, even though he could have done so quite easily. While I'm praising the writing, I ought to applaud Bo on the fact that he has a really good eye for watching and scribing how people interact, and teens of this age are so complex to write, especially of this age, it's honestly a miracle he was able to portray them this accurately and consistently for the entire movie. Like I worked at a Boy Scout summer camp for the entirety of this summer and by being around kids this age for like two months, I can say he really hit the nail on the head with how they act - the memes, the social media, the cliques, all of it. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie is seen as a sort of time capsule of this era for future generations, similar to what Dazed and Confused is today. But regardless of all the trends that will inevitably pass, the relatability of blossoming human emotions at this age, and coping with who you want to be in life is explored beautifully and will definitely stand the test of time. I definitely felt for Elsie Fisher, who plays Kayla Day, the eponymous eighth grader of the film, and does an amazing job for such a young actress, as she stood in the bathroom working up the courage to enter a party of strangers who thought she was weird. Or as she called to have her dad pick her up early. Or as she explored crushes, and her boundaries in an incredibly frightening scene towards the end of the movie. (I'd like to address this scene as I felt it was incredibly well done and made me feel super anxious as I'm sure Kayla felt in the moment. But the downside is that its inclusion confused me a little bit? I'm sure it happens in life, but if you take the scene completely out of the movie, it doesn't affect anything, which it definitely would have in real life. This is the one major pit fall in the writing.) Generally just the sense of trying to fit in. And while the film was enjoyable while it explored this theme, it did it in a very lowest common denominator way which was quite disappointing. I found that even though this movie was only an hour and a half long, it started really dragging at some point because there were so many scenes I had seen a million times and the end was so predictable. And compounding on that, the shot composition of the film was quite bland too and that likely contributed as well because the visual department was lacking. Swiss Army Man from 2016 explored many of the same themes of self-discovery in a much more interesting way and it ended up becoming one of my favorites from that year. It's a fine line that needs walked when handling a message that's been used since Shakespeare (""Above all, to thine own self, be true.""). And that's a little disappointing coming from Bo Burnham because I know what he's capable of and I feel like he could have done so much more with this movie. But maybe I'm expecting too much out of his debut because it really isn't that bad. I hope he learns a lot from this movie and perfects his craft in the time in between his next movie. Watching him evolve and accomplish so much at such a young age is incredibly inspiring and I can't wait to see what Bo does next!",Eighth Grade

220,tatbtsisb,A pretty good teen movie,7,4 November 2019,"I'm a teenager myself and this movie is what middle school is really like. I guess the writing of this movie is purposely trying to make some scenes cringy or awkward as the protagonist struggles socially and I think they did great with that. But I really feel like there's no main narrative to this movie, no main conflict really. Just feels like a hangout movie and that kind of made the movie kinda boring and mediocre. I'm not sure what message the movie is trying to convey. But other than that, I think it really depends on culture to relate to this story, non-Americans kids might not relate to this. I am not American and in my country, people are friendly and everyone just enjoys their time at school. So overall, I think this movie really nails the awkwardness of middle school but overall fail to convey a theme or message. And I'm giving this a 7/10",Eighth Grade
221,tdh_fbi,"Not what I was initially expecting, but in a good way",7,2 November 2018,"""Eighth Grade"" is a coming-of-age movie for this social media-obsessed generation of kids about a girl named Kayla Day, played in a very realistically relatable and adorable way by the talented Elsie Fisher. Kayla, though not at all shy or sullen, has trouble relating to her peers and despite her obvious intelligence, is still somewhat naïve in her view of the world.One of the things that really stood out to me was the blanket of anxiety and detachment in which Kayla seemed to hide during the first half of the movie. It's not until she's paired with a high school girl whom she is assigned to temporarily shadow that she starts to come out of her shell and think for herself, which I though was a really truly genuine experience for our main character to have had.I admire Kayla's reluctance to degrade herself by taking nude photos or performing oral sex on her crush, Luke Prael's selfish and more-so naïve character Aiden. She initially considers doing these things to try and win him over, but I'm glad she decides against it in the end. I appreciated that part of the story because it's issues such as those that I think these young kids today have to struggle with.
I honestly expected ""Eighth Grade"" to be a little more heart wrenching and raw than it actually was. However, I'm glad that all the issues it explored were portrayed with warmth, empathy, and honest realism without having to be heart wrenching or raw after all.",Eighth Grade

224,Blogger66,Needs More Movies Like This!,10,9 July 2019,"When I recognized the ""Eighth Grade"" coming out in theaters soon, my thought was making connections to the movies that I enjoyed very much, such as ""Thirteen"" and ""Springbreakers"". The positive reviews and even Obama mentioned this as one of his favorite movies in 2019. It's a bitter that it didn't show in many theaters nor find the DVDs at stores. The shackles finally broke through when I found out that it's showing on Amazon Prime.The impressive part of this film is that it's portraying the realistic of life in middle school for teenage girls. It's an essential reminder for the parents and teachers to be aware of what it's like being a teenage girl. It's no surprising that the research has shown that teenage boys have easier journey in middle school than teenage girls, but the shocking part is that the teenage boys with disability (deaf, blind, or else) are also above them. I can voucher for that because I am profoundly Deaf who's attending mainstream school, and people look at me weirdly when I say that 6th and 8th grades are two of my favorite school years.It's been a problem for teenage girls, but the suicide rate has been skyrocketing than ever before, since the social media became a factor in our life. The director, Bo Burnham, recognized that issue and wanted to spread the awareness. One interesting part during the process of making the film is how he chose Elsie Fisher to be a main character. He looked for someone who's clearly faking her confidence during audition. He pointed out that the majority of females who attempted, and they tried to fake by not being confident. It's being said that it's required a savant to succeed in making a film.Few insights from the film that I can relate: 1) Elsie created Youtube videos to share her advices regarding social anxiety for the reason of her journey experiences. It's typical of someone to share for what they're going through. (Social media didn't exist during my time, but I used AOL chatrooms to vent my feelings about what happened in school almost everyday. Even though I had great days most of time, there's always little negative things that crossed in my mind)2) It's common to feel rejected based on appearance regardless the efforts you put in, especially in middle school. However, the benefit in the end is that you manage better with your circle of friends than popular students in the future. (I don't know how attractive I was, but I know that I was attractive enough to be in part of cliques. But, I'm Deaf and the efforts I put in were unforgettable. The efforts were beyond enough to the point where I barely get educated.)3) ""I love you"" is a powerful statement, and it's important for the parents to be open with their kids regardless how they react to it. (I brushed them off, but when I looked back, it's something that I needed to hear.)4) Playing Truth or Dare is very common for teenagers to find excuses to portray their sexual desires. (Yes, it's how I got my first kiss and that girl told everyone that I kissed like a fish. I don't know how I managed it through)5) Like Elsie, I used to lie a lot in order to be liked.That film brought me a lot of flashbacks and developed my empathy for the students. It's worth watching and highly recommended!

Its portrayal of interactions between the teens - both online and offline - are very realistic, many times cringe-worthy yet not cheesy. Some scenes are so relatable that they might actually remind you of some cringe-worthy memories about your teenage years.

Although the acting and writing were definitely the highlights, the cinematography was great as well as the soundtrack. I cannot explain how amazing the music was handled and composed, in fact, shortly after watching the movie I downloaded the entire movie soundtrack onto my phone. The cinematography also lent an extreme amount of realism towards the movie which I highly appreciated. Moving onto the acting, this movie had some of the absolutely best acting that I have seen in a movie all year. Elsie Fisher did an amazing job as Kayla, she stole the show and has honestly given the best performance from any actress I have seen all year. Everyone in the movie did an excellent job in the acting department, nobody in my opinion stood out as a ""bad"" actor or actress. The writing in this movie was outstanding, Bo Burnham knows how to write an extremely realistic movie filled with hilarious moments, heartfelt moments, and shocking moments. Watching this movie was like watching the main character's life play out, which I thought was amazing, every single line of the movie felt extremely realistic and exactly how a teenager or an adult would behave in modern society. The way I see it, even though this movie is by no means an original concept, it is so well directed, well written, and well acted that it blew me away regardless. This is going to end up being one of my favorite movies of the year I can already tell. I hope to see many more movies from Bo Burnham in the future, the man is a genius.",Eighth Grade

I don't consider myself one that suffers from anxiety, but for 90 minutes there was an invisible iron grip on my stomach as one awkward venture after another progressed. Bo Burnham finds a way to transport you back to adolescent days with uncomfortable accuracy, and the film is all the more impactful for it. Even if you weren't spending hours on Instagram a day or dabbing when the feeling came, the pains and fears are universal to every generation. Not all is doom and gloom however, as there's sporadic moments of hilarity and a father-daughter conversation as affecting as the ending monologue in Call Me By Your Name.

Obviously, for a movie like this, a lot of teens would watch it.If you're an adult, watch this movie immediately. It is handled perfectly well, and doesn't become nonsensical in any scenes as a lot of coming of age stories will have.It's quite realistic. There are no 'miracles' that occur, no punch the bully in the face scenes, no wild car drive with the kids screaming into the abyss (as if that's what every kid experiences). No. Most kids go through a normal life that is mundane. This movie is exactly that. It is mundane. Nothing surprising. But what's entertaining to watch is the emotions involved with the girl. It's very familiar.

242,sean3240,An incredible directorial debut from Bo Burnham,10,15 November 2021,"I'm watching this for the first time after having read a couple drafts of the screenplay, which only helps to show how well crafted this film is and how the vision from the initial screenplay developed into what we now get to see.It goes without saying at this point that despite only having one feature to his name, Bo Burnham has established himself as an incredible director in any medium he has put his talent to thus far. From the unique and personal way he directed both Jerrod Carmichael's and Chris Rock's most recent comedy specials, to 3 of his own specials, all with a unique feel while also developing the stage persona character he has created through the meta-performance style of show.Transitioning to film adds so much more layers of complexity to getting your vision across, which is why it's incredible that he has managed to triumph in this medium aswell. Everything is pretty much perfect, not just on a technical level, but by overall just having the right feel. The cinematography is a huge stand out, it's nice, it's subtle and doesn't draw an excessive amount of attention to itself like a-lot of other A24 films, where it almost distracts from the work. In this, it compliments it.The score is great too and fits perfectly into the film, it was particularly well used through a couple of sequences where the music plays along with a voiceover. At times this would create an uplifting feeling, and other times a more chaotic feeling, but always fitting the tone of the scene. It's also a nice touch that all the music is electronically produced, which fits in well with the overall digital feel of the film, specifically as a result of the internet playing a huge role in it.There's a lot of ideas this film tackles, but not directly, everything is resultant of who our lead character is.It's a film about Kayla, and what this film really does best is stay true to that character and making everything feel as real as possible.It'd be pretty easy to just watch this film on the surface and not take much away from it, as on a narrative level not much happens so you're not exactly going to struggle following it. It could be an enjoyable surface level watch, but just digging a little deeper leaves you open to be completely immersed by this world, which we are really seeing through Kayla's eyes.With that, we can see what's really important to her, what she's focusing on at any moment, what she's worried about, how she feels about anything that happens to her. And even though our feelings often line up with Kayla's own, there are times we will deviate slightly. For example, she'll be sad in a scene because she's worried about something, which will make the audience sad, but not for the same reason. The audience instead sees her as a victim of her own naivety and feel bad she is worrying about something she doesn't need to be. Other times however we are right there with her in all the awkwardness and stress and situations she faces.A whole range of ideas unveil as we discover more about her character, we see themes of self image, loneliness, self consciousness, performance, expressing yourself.This is something I find really interesting as many of those themes aren't something Bo Burnham is a stranger to, most prominently as seen through his stand up specials. Yet he manages to have a fresh take on these ideas as he takes the approach instead of conveying these feelings through realism, as opposed to through the 'aware-of-self-awareness' performances that we all know and love.Can't really reference any conclusions without spoilers so I'm just gonna end this by saying that this is a good movie and you should watch it.",Eighth Grade

244,raphaellecat,what a tumultuous period,10,29 March 2019,"The rarity that Eighth Grade manages to capture is the very time period to which the tittle suggests, conveying how anxious, horrific, wondrous and full of change that particular chapter in our lives can be. The story centers around introvert teenager, Kayla Day, as she struggles to weave through the last week of eighth grade year. A fairly simple yet terrifying premise, depending on what may have triggered you during this relatable time, it achieves an incredible amount of specific and relevant experiences that a teenager goes through in middle school. The harsh, relentless, often times bewildering nature of kids that age is showcased in the most honest way, and much of this is credited to its director/writer Bo Burnham and star Elsie Fisher, who are catapulted into the ranks of up-and-coming faces to watch out for.Eighth Grade will have you almost share or renew some of the feelings Kayla Day experiences which Elsie Fisher portrays with such attention to detail, whether it's her anxious pacing of excitement from befriending a high schooler for the first time or establishing her first relationship with the potential best friend during dinner, a scene that still rings incredibly true in my mind.A story that is as tumultuous as it is beautiful, Eighth Grade is a true telling, one that deserves more than one viewing.",Eighth Grade

The score is incredible, the performances (Particularly Elsie Fisher) are great, and for a first-time director, Bo Burnham had some amazing directing skills.

As I watched the movie I just couldn't believe how incredibly well it understands the way kids are today. This is EXACTLY the way most teenagers are today, and yeah, it's horrifying. Maybe this movie isn't relatable to older generations but it's the most realistic movie I've ever seen, and I think every middle/highschooler should watch it. It's hilarious at times but it's also just incredibly REAL the whole way through. All in all, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

251,madonnakp89,Good Montage of life as an 8th Grader in,3,19 April 2020,"Although I was in middle school and eighth grade in 2003, I am not tone deaf to how kids have it now. I see their instagrams and twitters and the things they post. I have family who is growing up in this age. I think this movie serves as a great time capsule for this time period.It is very relatable. I was just as insignificant and ignored as the main character. I had anxiety too. I didn't socialize much so most of my life in middle and high school was completely quiet like the movie. And there was always the random invite to a pool party where you weren't really friends with any of the people there. No one cared about looking perfect. I was in high school when social media was just beginning too, so all of the mistakes teens are making now, we made them in the 2000s. We were the pioneers, so this movie reminds me of my high school years and it's an annoying nostalgia I'm feeling watching this. It's absolutely horrifying.My biggest critique is the lens this movie is wrapped in.
First, music:
The music is out of touch with the movie. We are looking at a movie from 2010s, nearly 2020s, and we're getting generic stock music from the 80s and 90s. There was clearly no budget for music. The director had a chance to display the music and creativity that is coming from these 12-15 year olds from tiktok and youtube. They could have featured up and coming young artists. But no, they completely dropped the ball.
The 13 year olds:
We're getting kids who have absolutely no personality. One clip of a kid saying ""Lebron James"" is played in every school scene. Kayla says ""Gucci."" Other than that these kids have no dialogue that link them to their time period. They all speak in monotone, have no energy, they are staring at their phones all day. As if schools let kids sit on their phones all day! As if kids aren't balls of energy all day! As if kids aren't stressed about their school work all day! And the girl's crush is this complete pinhead. I know we all liked silly dumb people when we were in middle school, but this kid is sticking gum in his nose. Kids aren't this stupid. Kids don't have conversations with other kids the way they do with adults (by staring at their phones the entire time). It's hard to believe someone my age directed this movie because it's so out of touch. The kids are put in the right environment, in the correct scenarios, with the correct media and entertainment but it is done in such a strange way and is a missed opportunity. The director dropped the ball and were there even writers?! This is like what a parent thinks their kids does all day. But we have teens like Greta Thunberg and kids like the ones on tiktok and IG creating dance trends and showing off their skills and this movie doesn't do any of that.
Eighth grade:
The movie is called Eighth Grade, but we're seeing the last week of eighth grade, which starts with a 6th grade time capsule then dives right into ""let's get ready for high school."" When we finally get some dialogue that could give us a clue as to what this movie is trying to accomplish, we're thrown into this awkward commentary from high school kids who are talking about how overexposed 10 year olds are to apps compared to them. They are so self aware that we see this issue again where we're clearly getting these tone deaf adult point of views. Then the drive home with the high schooler. What was that? High school kids who are old enough to drive don't look at middle schoolers like that. They just don't. I get that kids in their early teens start to explore the idea of sex and their sexual attractions but it just made no sense and could have been done in a more realistic manner.Overall:
It is relateable but this movie is just average. It has no storyline. It had no greater message other than ""this is life"" now in this day and age. This is a peak into this modern coming of age. It is more like a documentary and psychological horror, less of a comedy and hardly any drama. I can feel the second hand embarrassment. So it's serving it's purpose perfectly if it's supposed to be more like a mockumentary, but doesn't mean it's enough. This could have been wrapped up in a 10 minute short film since they aren't giving us any story to wrap this around. This movie is like all of the scenes that happen around a story just randomly stitched together. It's so empty.",Eighth Grade
252,dupamiaza,Kill It With Fire,2,5 October 2018,"Why those kids can't express themselves? Why can't they talk like normal people? This movie creates a false impression about pre-teens.

I typically has a very good memory for movies that I have seen. That does not say good things about the film. It's not terrible, it does touch on some themes that are important for younger girls, but the presentation is so dry and the pace is so slow that it makes for a completely unmemorable watch.

But the movie just stagnates a bit until the car scene towards the end that dramatizes the story all of a sudden but doesn't really leads us anywhere, leaving us questioning what it's purpose was.

She's very awkward (intentionally I'm sure) and she comes across as someone you wouldn't want to be around, let alone be friends with. None of the other characters are enjoyable either, especially the male crush she has (dude who flexes and tries to get her topless). I get that sex happens in those years, I had sex as an 8th grader, but it wasn't ANYWHERE near as stupid and awkward as they made it out to be.There just wasn't much happening here.

Luckily my Daugther always has been very social person with lots of friends ( not including the mean popular ones m) but still I'm sure she related to some parts and this movie was helpful for her.

It is a strong debut for both director and the main actress, but it's hard for me to understand how it has gotten such insanely positive reviews and won awards from prestigious film festivals. Probably more edifying if you are an older adult who didn't grow up with social media, maybe that explains the hype from professional critics. As a 20-something, it didn't feel that different from my own teenage years, so while it does get some point for realism it was not a revelation.",Eighth Grade
267,ThatGuyReviews,"""Cringe"" Done Right",8,27 November 2018,"In his directorial debut, Bo Burnham proves that he has more to offer outside of his comedy routines. Known for his outlandish musical performances, Burnham shows diversity here at the helm of a more serious drama that uses its comedy to aid in expressing the awkwardness of our developmental years through the lens of our protagonist, Kayla's, last weeks of middle school.
On a technical level, this movie is nothing completely revolutionary, but it still delivers as a solid narrative exploration of what it means to ""grow up,"" focusing more on its storytelling than other aspects of production. Besides this, Eighth Grade encapsulates that unusual transitional phase between childhood and ""teenage-dom"" a way that only someone with experience being picked last for every sport ever could. Everything about this film is passionately imagined and helps to put the viewer back into the shoes of their younger selves. Many moments in this film induce cringe, though purposefully and in such a way that it causes self-reflection on the viewer's own embarrassments. The film is very much handling modern struggles of a thirteen-year-old and could serve to interest as a period piece for future generations, still it somehow manages to relate to those outside Generation Zed through the connective tissue of our common experiences growing up in Western society. The emotions drawn out by Kayla's character are the same that most of us (Americans especially) felt as inbetweeners, of either gender, and helps us to confront and accept ourselves in the same way that she does. This film may have its flaws here and there, but it shares an important story and shows significant potential that will hopefully continue to be exploited by Burnham in his future endeavors.Eighth Grade Letter Grade: B+",Eighth Grade
268,abbywhiting,Painfully Accurate,8,29 January 2019,"""Eighth Grade"" portrayed a mirror like image of my eighth-grade self, and I graduated from middle school almost 5 years ago. Like shown in the food court scene, it is so easy to start a conversation about the foreignness of a younger generation, but this film did an excellent job of leaving no preteen experience behind. I always tell myself that younger generations are morphing into unrecognizable drones, but the truth is that I was that same awkward introvert who was seen through a small lens throughout middle school 5+ years ago. Social media has changed apps and Internet frenzies have varied, but my middle school experience was just the same. Bo Burnham's film struck a major chord with me, and like it or not, I (and probably many others) can relate to the protagonist almost spot on. 8/10 stars for making me cringe harder than any other movie, but in a strange way, I appreciate the brutal honesty and candidness shown in this movie.

She's not the most popular girl, yet she makes YouTube videos for <5 followers. She tries to be nice & include everyone but people just don't vibe with her. She has a super sweet dad and we don't see the mom at all but it doesn't matter.When she's invited in to the pool party, we are shown an amazing view into the life of an unpopular girl entering a cool party. Actually, even the first scene, an honest and raw vlog, is so good - - complete with her 'um's and unsureness. Furthermore about the pool scene, what an awesome time to use a slow motion scene. It draws the scene out but in a really good way because it makes you feel the panic & terror that she's going through entering the party.There's a nice Lebron James vine reference in here. Also a nice Dab reference. IDK why i capitalized a dab.This girl does such a good job playing the slouchy sad girl and, who knows, maybe she is sad like that, but in interviews she presents as well spoken and confident, so I'm gonna' say she is a good actress.

Ugh, I feel depressed now. However, it got much better in High School and then especially in College.So if you are having a cruddy time it's only temporary. Even if everyone ignores you or hates you. You will probably never see these people again. And if you do, they aren't even the same. They change too and most of them don't even remember middle or high school. Some of them do stay horrible and you just have to feel sorry for them.Life seems like forever until you graduate 12th grade but then it flies by.

The actress who is cast is herself just a teenager and this must be the first time I have seen in the movie where a teenager has pimples on her face, not a view. Usually, they cast kids who look cool. So that already shows how realistic this movie tries to be. And that's not a good thing here, because it's not realistic in other parts. Like seriously are kids these days in their phones 24/7 and have no idea about sex in that age still? I'm not that old myself to tell that they went over the top with a lot of things, least I hope so. This movie is too much a message to the kids that its totally normal to be shy and not to look like everyone else and all the boys are weird somehow. There are just too many unrealistic characters. Take for example this older highschool dude who seems normal and then he wants to have sex with eight graders who she just met and isn't even physically yet attractive.

291,dfjwebdesign,A thought provoking indie film,8,5 June 2019,"I don't understand why anyone would assume that this is a film who's intention is some nostalgia trip down memory lane, regarding their own 8th grade experience. It's exactly the opposite. In fact, I can't believe this was written by a guy. The R rating may mislead some (honestly I'm surprised this isn't rated PG-13, there's no nudity or sexual content really, just some language)... but to that point I believe the intended audience is teenagers who can directly relate to this now. Also, I think women of all ages could relate to this movie as it's focal point is a young girl who's awkward and introspective in her daily life, but has a more confident and engaging personality via her social media. As I said it's really well written considering it's written by a male comedian. But as far as relatability, I was surprised how little I related to the characters in this movie, but that's what kept it interesting and fresh.The reason I found this thought provoking is that it deftly illustrates the pressures of being a young female, and beyond that a young female coming of age, and further still: in this day and age of active shooter drills and ever evolving digital age. You're not supposed to relate to it (if you're over the age of at most 20), you're supposed to learn from it. Adults realize that high school problems aren't real problems, but when you're a kid that it's everything in the world. And nowadays kids are bombarded with information, expectation, social/image standards and are expected to process it all faster and more efficiently than any generation before, and how much of a heavy load that is to shoulder. And how constant contact with everyone, and having immediate access to near limitless amounts of information is both a luxury and a burden. It's a whole different set of pressures.As far as the plot in concerned, this is what's known as a ""character piece"". It explores the world of a young girl during her last week of 8th grade. She's quiet and introspective, attempting to make sense of it all. But there is definitely an introduction, arc and resolution. As far as I'm concerned, Burnham is grabbing his generation (and older generations) by the back of the neck and saying ""look at this!"" Life is more convenient and full of ""safe spaces"" than its ever been, but it's left kids without a need to develop coping skills; but the resilience is there in the youth of today. It's beautifully shot and paced, and well acted.It's a nice change of pace from explosions and people jumping from helicopters. This is art... and definitely worth a watch.",Eighth Grade

But this film I feel also works very well for all ages and how things that people say they do or try to do for others sometimes doesn't always work out. The main actress (Elsie Fisher) does a fantastic job in the film, and also the father in the movie (Josh Hamilton). They help bring the movie to life and really show how real and hard life can be. Though sometimes the story beats can feel similar to other movies the movie helps bring it up above others. Many laughs and tears will come upon you during this movie but it always feels genuine. Such a amazingly written and directed movie. Overall this film is Great (8). Though the strong characters and commentary on how tennagers see the world and how it is always changing, this movie really feels like it was directed by a 8th grader. In a good way!

But if you've been born in the 90s onwards, in 'Western culture', you will relate to the themes in this film. And I am sure many people born long before the 90s would also very much relate to certain aspects of the story. I was never a teenage girl, I did not grow up in the US, but found this painfully relatable, in a way no other coming-of-age film has.This film is about family, growing up, and those early teenage years where one strives to create themselves, to become the person want to be -- with all the hardships, fears, anxieties that come with. The film follows a year in the life of a teenage girl, nothing more nothing less. There is a storyline, but it is an organic, natural, 'life-like' one, rather than a story full of plot twists and turns. This is an honest look at the troubles of early adolescence, and if that sounds interesting then it will be anything but boring.And, to answer other reviews: it is deliberately cringe at times, because that is how teenagers are. It is also incredibly realistic. Anyone saying otherwise is simply unaware of the existence of the issues this film deals with -- they are depicted in an extremely accurate way, and just because a reviewer has not lived a particular experience doesn't make it 'unrealistic'. And finally, anyone saying this is boring has spent a little too long in the Marvel Universe.",Eighth Grade

This film is acted by an Eighth grader and written by someone who actually gets today's teenagers. Besides that, this movie's music, cinematography are just very special in their own way making it remarkably memorable.

This movie makes me want to sit in a corner in peace and quiet and stare at a wall. It took me 3 hours to get through this 1.5hr movie. Feels like being in a trash compactor, and the longer you watch the worse the pain gets, and you just have to continually pause it to relax,stop the pain, and distract yourself.I feel like if I had to do it everyone should have to. I want to give it a 5 star rating to increase viewership, but I can't harm sentient beings like that. This movie hurt me. It hurt me deep. At first it was rubbing my face with sandpaper, and I would pause it to let my face recover. But then it stuck its hand in my mouth, continued to shove its way down my throat and into my chest cavity where it pushed my heart down into the bottom of my abdomen, then grabbed it and ripped it out through my mouth. Then started slapping me in the face with it. Thanks a lot Bo.I feel like I'm being forced to give birth while you're just sitting there playing piano while I'm screaming in pain. I didn't even want to have this baby!!! Why are you making me do this?!?!Oh my god, what a tremendous rush of joy and liberation when it ended. Like this massive weight crushing me so flat that even God could not separate my flesh from my soul, was suddenly lifted.

314,mosestorres-05766,Almost too accurate,8,1 August 2018,"As someone who was in eighth grade not too long ago, I can say with upmost certainty that this film is extremely accurate to the life of an awkward, quiet eighth grader. The writing, acting, sets, casting, and even soundtrack all immerse viewers In the mind and actions of a girl who wants to fit in. That being said, some older audiences may not quite get the same affect that I did out of the film. The comedy is amazing to me, but some of the situational comedy is specific to a certain audience, and may come off as extremely cringy to others. 
The praise that this film is already getting the most for is the acting from its two leads, and for good reason. Elsie Fisher is perfect as the lead, with her mannerisms and delivery of lines. Josh Hamilton as her father is also great, showing great comedic and dramatic timing. 
The cringe humor is also perfect being as hard to watch as I'm sure it was to shoot and perform. This is Hapiness levels of cringe, and it's done beautifully. 
In terms of complaints, I don't like the vlog scenes, which I know are supposed to be her thoughts, but other than the one in the beginning and the two at the end, seem unnecessary and slow. The music is also occasionally a little too loud, not that it's bad, as it really does make me think of an awkward teens playlist.
 Bo Burnham clearly did a lot of preparation for the writing and casting, as he really nailed those aspects, and the direction is solid for a debut, with some tracking shots, and smooth transitions. 
Overall, I think it's a movie that will be entertaining for everyone, but should hit really close to home with a specific age group. Definitely one of the years best so far, and hopefully A24 keeps making great art.",Eighth Grade
315,marsardonia,Relatable; Painfully & Reassuringly,10,6 August 2018,"I made an iMDB account just so I could write an extravagant review on the realest adolescence film I've ever seen. 
Going into this movie with my mom, and my 8th grade brother, I expected it to be more relatable for him rather than me. However, within the first 10 minutes, the thoughts Kayla had hit home closer than I could have ever imagined. Between her go-get-em approach to confidence and the painful reality of awkardness, I felt as if Burnham had written this script entirely for me. I experienced this even more so as my mom and I viewed the conversations Kayla and her father had. It truly felt like there were cameras inside propped up inside of our house, because their talks were nearly spot-on to us.
The hardest, and honestly rawest scene to watch was Kayla burning her old memories (her old ""self""), claiming it to be ""her hopes and dreams."" Watching her break down and explain how she feels like a burden, asking her father if ""she makes him sad"" felt more legitimate than any cinematic scene I've ever experienced. By the end of it, I couldn't help but audibly sob into my mom's shoulder.
That may be sidetracking but truly, this film is something else. It connects the brutal legitmacy of awkward adolescence to bravery and maturity, which I personally found very reassuring.
Overall, ""Eighth Grade"" is not a Hollywood movie- it's real. I highly suggest you go out and support it.",Eighth Grade

322,False_Nostalgia_Reviews,Intended Audience is Key,5,5 June 2019,"As someone born in Generation Z who is not a teenage girl, but still is very present in the world of social media (both key aspects of this movie) I was split on how I was supposed to feel during my viewing. There were moments where I would say to myself, ""yes, this is absolutely what kids these days are like,"" and other times where I would say, ""that would never happen."" I was constantly left to question whether the selfish actions and motivations of the main character were meant to be sympathized with, or to be critiqued and viewed as someone who knows better. Again, he/she who is watching this and their age in proximity to eighth grade will have different reactions.The so called ""cringe"" factor so many other reviews like to point out was, I felt, entirely meant to be eye-roll inducing; used to point out the desperate lengths adults and teens alike will go in order to be ""relatable"" and ""hip."" Moments like these should be taken at face value.What actually made me uncomfortable during this whole film was the painfully awkward main character. There is showing a character being shy and awkward, and then there is having a character so bashful and bumbling to the point of being unrealistic. Our protagonist is the latter. The slow pace and lingering camera angles don't help to liven up the scene either when characters are stumbling and meandering through dialogue. There is such a thing as too awkward.All in all, it's hard to recommend this film simply because it's hard to figure out it's intended audience. Actual middle schoolers are too young to see it themselves (being rated R after all) and adult parents will be left groaning at the portrayal of the social media centered world of teens that clearly was not meant to relate to them in the first place. Those in between, like myself, were left scratching their heads wondering what it was exactly they were meant to feel at all. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. Unfortunate, considering Bo Burnham is a very funny and talented comedian in his own right. Better luck next time, Bo.",Eighth Grade

I say this because even growing up in a different generation and gender, this film didn't just remind me but also made me feel all that awkward uncomfortableness in vivid detail.There lies the true beauty and understanding of this film and why it resonated so much with many people. It's an ageless, timeless and completely ubiquitous experience that nearly anyone can relate to. But instead of just a passive viewing experience, Bo Burnham has encapsulated and distilled the very essence of what was a uniquely difficult time for many people.Even though some may find this film slow or uncomfortable, I think those of us who remember this time in our life with any degree of honesty will likely come away from viewing this movie with a nostalgia that will bring memories and emotions back that are so deeply engrained in us that several either forget them entirely or ignore them to the point they no longer affect us.However, depending on your own life lessons, problems and even perhaps good things that occurred during this period in life; you WILL be affected by this cinematic gem. Even if it just gives you a moment of remembering that awkward feeling that loomed over nearly every day when you were in eighth grade then I believe the movie has accomplished what few other ""coming of age "" stories ever get right.And that alone is worth the time spent watching this great snapshot of tween existence.",Eighth Grade

I had heard so many people rave about how good this movie was, so I had to sit my friend down to finally watch it with me, only to turn the TV off after about 20 minutes of turning away due to extreme second-hand embarrassment.

336,weepingtudor,Essential viewing for every young person today.,8,9 June 2019,"Growing up is never easy. Ask anyone and they will tell you the woes of childhood, creeping into adulthood. It's different for everyone, though there are telling similarities between us all.Comedian Bo Burnham knows a thing or two about viral success. Here in his directorial debut, he offers up a telling portrayal of those intensely awkward years. At times feeling like a slice of real life, his script is also filled with absurd dialogue from teenagers and the desperate, at times cringe worthy attempts for adults to connect with them (I scoffed when the Principal who dabbed). The performance of Elsie Fisher as Kayla Day is what makes this film so special, who utilises Burnham's words, with a highly relatable photo realistic vision. We feel for her in her uneasy moments, with one right of passage after another throughout the film. Her advice on her YouTube channel paradoxes her real life encounters, though she does try and practice what she preaches.Fisher is so real in these moments, we empathise because we went through similar endeavours: the crush at school, the desire to make more friends etc. The optimism she expresses through her videos make her shine for the brief time she films them. Whilst her views on Youtube appear minimal, it appears to be the act of actually doing the videos that creates catharsis for her in order to deal with the everyday. We see a brief moment of her playing cymbals as part of the terribly out of tune brass band. Perhaps this demonstrates her skill in being the loudest part of the players, yet also the most accessible, a statement about her as a person.Some questions we might never know within the film. Where is her mother? Why did Olivia, her older helper in school leave her with a male friend? Would she really go through with sending a nude picture to her crush? Though perhaps not knowing makes the film more allusive. It's refreshing to see a single dad (played by the fascinating Josh Hamilton) working through the trappings that come with a teenage daughter. The scene with an older boy making a pass Kayla, is a heightened moment of unease, an issue which does not find resolution, nor do we see Olivia again, someone who should have looked out for Kayla. The extra sting is here is just how well Kayla and Olivia hit it off as friends, leading to her being introduce to her gang of friends.The choice of music is also inspired. Mostly comprising of Anna Meredith, we also get nostalgic trip from Enya, though the blasting club music is what piecers through the film adding absurd moments of soaring drama. On line stays with you though. She would end each video with ""Gucci!"" and does the Ok hand sign over her face, summing up the superficiality of being a YouTuber and also the branding in which they choose to create for themselves.",Eighth Grade

Accentuating the worst parts about middle school: talking to love interests, being in a group of people you don't know, trying to be something you are not.

That's probably because I couldn't step out of the movie and separate myself from the story. Like a lot of kids reviewing this film, I was still not capable of viewing the film: I was feeling it.
However, once you are actually capable of doing it correctly, watching this movie is awesome. I don't know abput you, but my middle school experience was not good. I related to a lot of things in this film. Not all, though: which just makes it even more interesting. We don't go to the cinema to see our life. We go to escape from it for a couple hours, and if possible, learn something in the meantime.

There was a time when growing up had a lot more to tell than, a complex emotional journey with a lot to tell. The shallow sensitivity and the big ""theme"" that everyone wants to be special and different, is pictured a lot.
The only thing that made the protagonist special is that she had a lot of problems without actually having a problem and maybe a broken iphone. The reason I am writing this review is that I keep wondering, how this movie can be considered as a Masterpiece when the culture of this so-called new generation has no philosophic background and just float behind a screen on a 24-7 basis.

It was a presumptuous attempt of capturing what it's like growing up in the millennium age, when it's simply not accurate. The entire 94 minutes was an exposition that never progressed. The only enjoyable aspect of this film was Josh Hamilton's performance, and even that was an inaccurate portrayal of real life. Who's father is that perfect?

351,chakornc,Reflection of Our Childhood,10,4 December 2018,"Eighth Grade is brimming with heart and authenticity in every frame. The simple story of Kayla (Played by Elsie Fisher) who is weeks away from completing her middle school years and entering the summer before high school. She is extremely introverted and awkward, only able to find her voice when recording her YouTube pep talk videos or Snapchat. The shy nature of our protagonist made Burnham smartly uses the YouTube videos often as voice over to offer better insight into the kind of person Kayla would like to present herself, sometimes contradicts with the real-life version struggling to find her place and sense of self. This is a great film that talks with authenticity with the trials and struggles of modern teenagers in the information age, where small screens are an escape to the real world but it is also a gateway to finding who you really are. Fisher is a terrific lead, perfectly capturing the understated sense of a real average teenager. Because of her introverted nature, it does take a while to fully embrace her as a character. This is the one real aspect that holds back Burnham's film. You'll feel for Kayla, oh you'll feel a lot of things, but it isn't until later that you'll engage with her. Like its heroine, this is a powerfully awkward movie with several cringe-inducing moments both comic and scary. It's hard to watch at times but it feels completely relatable with the cool gadgets for the kids these days. In fact the movie is pretty restrained with its vision of teenage uncertainty. I did enjoy the synth wave leitmotif that would pound whenever Kayla caught sight of the boy she was crushing on, communicating the beating of her heart in a cool, modern style. The climax involves a heart-to-heart with Kayla's dad (Played by Josh Hamilton), a man struggling to navigate the changes in his daughter and respect her privacy and curiosity. This film is a great reflection of much school has changed within a couple of years, I realized that this the protagonist can be compared to my friend right now who is in high school. The director did a great job. His choices are determined by his story, and he draws out completely natural performances from his troupe of talented actors. The director did a great job talking about the social issues and issues in school everyone is facing today. For example, I like how there was a school shooting simulation which this is a big issue in schools today. And also the issue of social media because the protagonist can be seen becoming less socially active with the outside world to the viewers and that is great. Eighth Grade is a sincere, deeply heartfelt, and awkward movie about an awkward time most of us would like to skip or times that we might have regretted in middle school. I suggest that everyone should watch this especially students in middle school all around the world. And if you're an adult, YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.",Eighth Grade

Middle school is awkward, especially when you struggle with being social. Kayla has social anxiety, but she tries to portray confidence on social media. She is, however, rather uneloquent in her videos, which get very few views. Most people are faking confidence, and some people do a better job than others, and that's okay. Be you.The only problem I really have is the sound editing. I was unable to see the movie in the theatre, so I am watching it on my home TV.

Honestly I was so bored and frustrated with the film I wish I hadn't bothered. There's no real connection with the main character and she isn't made to be very likeable so you don't warm to her or feel any real connection to her. You don't root for her as I'm sure you're supposed to. None of the other characters are memorable either, and although there are some brilliant films where 'nothing happens', this really WAS a case of nothing happening....",Eighth Grade

The clueless dad is interesting only in his omissions: single moms, teenagers' privacy, *any discipline whatsoever, and why he left his daughter's teeth so twisted into high school. Fail. 
Dads win custody so rarely IRL, in fact, that the omission of any Why is radically unrealistic.

The way the protagonist (as well as her peers) struggles to verbally express herself reminds you how difficult it is to be 13 years old, full of thoughts and feelings you don't have words for. Experiences that never meet expectation. An outward facade that never reflects the inner world. The literal horror of going to a pool party. The use of music throughout the film heightens those feelings of anxiety.The character's experiences with boys is definitely enough to turn your stomach. The way Burnham portrayed a girl having enough sense of self to say ""No"" but the fear and insecurity and self-blame that follows is devastating.Your feeling by the end that things will improve after eighth grade is tempered by the fact that every high school boy character you've met is garbage, so she has a lot more hurdles ahead of her.

Almost all her speaking lines where she wasn't making a YouTube video just made me cringe. I pretty much loathed every character in the entire movie except Olivia. Kayla with her humpedback ogre walk whenever she made a fool of herself made me want to throw a shoe at her. If I ever have a daughter like Kayla I'm dropping her off at the fire station.

370,proudpakistanii16,An accurate representation of teenage life,8,18 December 2018,"The problem with most coming-of-age movies is that teenagers are played by perfect looking 20 something actor and actresses. When teenagers don't see themselves properly representated on screen, they fail to relate with the story. Casting Elsie Fisher as the eighth grade student Kayla Day was the first win for this movie.
The realistic representation of issues faced by the teenagers today is commendable. Kayla is finishing middle school in one week. She's not perfect. She has pimples, she has anxiety, and she is addicted to social media. If you read some of the plot of this movie, you might think it's another of the typical teenage movies but it's so much more than that.
Kayla is extremely relatable, not only for teens, but also for the adults who grow up with similar issues, those who still struggle to be confident in social gatherings.
Bo Burnham and Elsie Fisher deserve all the praise they're getting because this is one of those rare movies about teenage life that's too real to be considered fiction. We have all lived some parts of Eighth Grade and that's why we will love it.",Eighth Grade

373,alexthegreat350,"Real, sweet and cringe inducingly accurate!",10,4 February 2019,"Eight grade was one of the most realistic, grounded and cringe inducingly accurate movies I have ever seen. I am 16 which I feel puts me in a really good demographic for understanding this film. I'm in 11th grade and still remember the awkwardness of 8th grade well, but 3 years ago seems like a lifetime ago. 14 to 17 fes like a huge age difference and I have changed a lot since then. I am also at the age where when I was 8th grade my whole grade and I were on social media so I know what it's like to go through that very awkward stage in life with Snapchat and Instagram. For example in some of the scenes where Kayla was browsing Instagram, some of the posts looked extremely familiar to what pops up in my feed, 8th grade or 11th. With that out of the way, I wanna talk about the films style before I get into the characters, dialogue and stuff like that. I loved the kind of shots that director Bo Burhman used, my favorite being the long shots that were used frequently. Scenes where she was lying in bed and all u saw was here bored face on one side of the screen and her Instagram never bored me, but that could be biased cause of my age and how much I do that myself. There was this one shot where she was meeting up with some people at the mall(keeping it vague) and it showed the friends eating at a table and all the way in the back you can see her walking to the table from far away, and you can see her approaching the table for a solid 40 seconds and it almost worked as some form of suspense cause I was thinking how they were gonna react to her. This all worked very well with the quiet and soft spoken tone of the whole film. But the style wasn't the only real strong aspect of this film, I was also in love with the characters, and the way they were able to show what kind of person Kayla was without and obvious characterization, made it really easy to care about her. Not just that, the way she and her fellow classmates acted just got very close to home on how kids talk, which makes it very easy to get into the plot. Some scenes of dialogue just sounded very realistic, like they were written by an eight graders, or someone who is very good at their job. This movie was extremely cringed at some point every hard to watch, but that adds to the sheer authenticity and realism of this film. Overall Eighth Grade is a touching and relatable that I recommend to anyone who can stomach some realistic cringe and appreciate films for their sheer authenticity. A great film overall 10/10!!",Eighth Grade

I know people somewhat akin to the main character, and honestly, her inability to express herself is realistic.

Bo Burnham took a trip to my subconscious and came back with pages of material. While I never tried to offer people advice in YouTube videos as the main character does, I strongly relate to the character in the following ways:A fear of being labeled as quiet (anxious people just want to fit in). Highly agreeable to the point of ridiculousness.Writing out bullet points of how to improvesocially 
Attempting to say or do anything at parties while having crippling fearsWhile some of the feelings in the film are universal, it got all the specific fears of anxious kids down to a t. Something I have learned since the struggle of middle school is that some kids are genetically more sensitive than others, and this can translate to anxiety as a person gets older. If you have a child who notices and feels more than his or her peers like the girl in the film, research high sensitivity and see if they possibly have it. It can do wonders for self-esteem to reframe the past knowing they have a unique trait.",Eighth Grade

Kids should watch this to better understand themselves and that they're not alone in the teenage struggle. I wish i was able to watch this at her age to know it's normal to be nervous and feel left out. John Hughes movies were great but kids today are different cause the world and society is different.

I would have hoped Kayla to have told Olivia or Olivia's friends what Riley tried to do, but to not avail. I at least wanted to see Kaiden's (?) reaction to Kayla calling her on her behaviour, but nope!Others have mentioned Kayla's disregard of her fathers feelings, and how she took no responsibility for it, she is THIRTEEN, for gods sake. Teenagers and preteens act rudely, they're going through a lot! Did you watch the movie? Not having friends or being in a awkward situation may seem insignificant to some, but for a child this is the worst thing they've experienced. They haven't been alive long enough to compare these situations with anything worse, but even then, no matter how small /you/ think it is, it's not you going through it, its a 13 year old, insecure teenage girl.I would recommend this movie, as it does truly reflect life nowadays, the things mentioned above do in fact happen often; unanswered questions and ties removed.

As a Gen Z girl who grew up with major depression and anxiety (middle school being absolutely the worst years for me) I really related to it. So much that it made me start tearing up thinking about how accurate it really was, even the smallest details. The people hating on it are either older and have no idea what life in Middle School is like now a days, or people who don't know what it's like to have anxiety and depression (which the main character clearly has). It definitely is cringe worthy but it evokes emotion and you feel for the main character. What middle schooler ISN'T cringe worthy? It did everything it was supposed to do, perfectly. Big props for actually using normal kids (with acne and everything) instead of unrealistic 20 year old models acting as kids (like most movies choose to do). It's realistic. It's not always cute and not always comfortable to watch, but that's how life really is.",Eighth Grade

It's so cringey to watch Kayla trying to fit in desperately with her crippling anxiety. But at the same time it's also so hard to watch it if you had experience with these. The way this movie pushed me into my school years again was unbelievable. People who call this movie boring and pointless probably were Kennedys back then.,Eighth Grade

But I'm overjoyed to finally see a movie that accurately portrays teenagers. I liked that Elle was not conventionally attractive. I liked that she was awkward and shy, as most teens are.

So...The film is good. It's not great, not 10/10, but good. Ok, so maybe I'm not the target audience but this is what I thought...The acting in the film is very good all round. The relationship portrayed between father and daughter particularly so. There's certainly plenty of truth in this film...the awkwardness, the confidence crises. It paints a poignant, bewildering, upsetting picture.But unfortunately what makes the film watchable is what stops it from getting a higher rating. I buy she's lonely, uncomfortable, yearning for more from her teenage years. But the squeeky mumbling tittering around others. I've never known anyone who couldn't at least mutter a few words loud and clear enough to be understood.And there is NO WAY a girl such as her would turn up at the pool party. She knows her place, and it aint with the cool kids. That ain't brave, it's dumb!And do high school leavers really jump at the chance to get a middle schooler out of her clothes!Yes, maybe I'm not best placed to judge, but I didn't buy it!Still though, better than a slow drudgy boring film about a loner!",Eighth Grade

Kayla struggles expressing herself and her awkwardness is uncomfortable to watch. Her YouTube videos are full of 'ums', 'likes' and 'yeahs.' She's got ache and isn't traditionally pretty or thin. AND I LOVE IT. I felt like I wasn't just watching a movie. I was being transported directly into Kayla's life.

I have John Hughes and Little Miss Sunshine on my mind, because they were an original take on the classic coming of age film. Ones that leave an impression because they have heart and originality. But really...it's the unexpected love story that got me.. the love story that so frequently isn't told. The one about really learning to love yourself. We all know, the world can be an awkward place sometimes. The film is wonderfully acted, with many moments of such cringe worthy honesty you can't help but find yourself falling in love with the characters and enjoy being swept along in the story.

411,crazyman5123,Garbage,1,13 June 2021,This film was awful. The father daughter relationship is so cringe. The father assimilates with his rude and dismissive daughter only furthering her poor communication and disregard for him. She seems to have little to no personality and wants to just appease everyone she meets. She then wonders why no one wants to be her friend. The characters were underdeveloped leading to the viewer having little to no investment in them. Where is her mom? Is there something wrong with her? The story line was non existent and bland. She was also almost victimized by a boy in the back seat of a car and we have no conversation about that or even an internal monologue and I find that a bit problematic. Over all a wast of time and frustrating to watch her and the poor treatment of her wimpy weak father.,Eighth Grade

I wanted Kayla to not try so hard to be someone she wasn't. I wanted her to spit out a sentence with fewer than ten ""ums"", ""likes"" or ""you knows"" and to look someone in the eye. I wanted to reach through the screen and give the girl a warm hug. What that really meant is that I wanted to reach back three decades to the girl I was, the exact same girl I was watching in this movie, and let her know she's ok just as she is.Now if you'll excuse me...I'm going to dig out my grade school & high school journals for some further cringing.",Eighth Grade

I liked the movie because it shows how the social media affects people especially when they are young. Everyone tries to understand the world and how it works. When it comes to kids, parents and school must have an important role in their life. However, in the last decade it is really hard to protect kids from bad sides of social media and internet. In this case, they start to learn from these environments, and it makes hard to find the true ethics.

419,HippoPie,be kinder to each other and yourself,10,23 July 2018,"This film reminded me not only of all the awkwardness and anxieties of growing up, but that kids experience/feel/know more than we often give them credit for. As someone in their early 20's, I remember trying to learn about sex on the internet as a teen and talking about sex in crude ways as early as third grade. But somehow, when I became a youth mentor my first impulse was to believe that they're innocents and to protect them from things that they're definitely exposed to more easily than ever (note: the high school mentor character was painfully accurate). Yes, you'll cringe, but every cringe-moment was purposefully cringey. You'll also definitely laugh, if you're like my friends you'll cry. If you're like me, you'll sob. Bo Burnham has demonstrated a sensitivity for what it's like growing up as a young girl in a way that's relateable across generations while also being very specific to today. I feel that he's also done a fair representation of what it's like to be a grown-up trying to speak to young teens, and how to speak to a young woman as a parent (especially as a father). I think it's important for young men and men in general to see this film to understand her anxieties and the pressures on her, and to reflect on their own anxieties and pressures while growing up and interacting with the women and girls in their life.

I'm 28 and I did, the scene at the pool party hit hard. I felt that pull of anxiety in my chest, remembering my own awkward teenage self who would have hated being there too. It was a quiet, reflective movie that mirrored what some people may have felt during that uncomfortable part of growing up.

422,cherbut,40 year old and childless. I could still relate.,8,27 January 2019,"I gave this movie an 8. The writing was sweet, awkward and relatable. Elsie Fisher was adorable. The dialog was a bit lacking. Everything's ""cool"" and everything ""sucks"". But, the storyline was real.Critics are saying main character is boring and one dimensional. That's the point. In 8th grade, who isn't? You haven't learned enough about yourself yet to be confident, independent or interesting. (The cool kids were pretty boring too.)I could relate to this girl. I've been this girl. I've been to that pool party wearing a one piece when the ""cool girls"" strutted in their bikinis. I was a band geek and for a while, itwas hard to make friends. I was a complete dork trying to talk to my crush. Somehow, you will relate to this movie.The movie is a little slow, but some parts were poignant and heartbreaking.**Little spoilers**The car scene with Riley was sad and real. I'm sure that has happened to a lot of girls, if not all. They want to ""grow up"" and experiment and want men to like them. Girls are pressured, manipulated and guilt tripped. Teen girls should watch to learn how the sleazy guys act and be prepared.The fire pit scene with the dad also stood out. She asks her dad if she makes him sad. She says if she were a mom and had a daughter like her, she'd be sad. I started bawling. This is how I feel and why I'm a childless woman at 40. I just didn't want to pass on certain things to a child.If you want to relive middle school, or have teens that are shy, coming out of their shell or have trouble talking/expressing themselves, watch this with them. It will help start a dialog. It, might also help them realize they are being jerks constantly on their phones and pay attention to real life sometimes.Parents with daughters, should watch this for the car scene alone.

424,reid-varney,Another Comedian Strikes Gold with a Perfect Film,10,15 August 2018,"Like Jordan Peele and John Krasinski before him, Bo Burnham creates a film that has no business being as great as it was. Eighth Grade is exactly the kind of film John Hughes would make if he were alive today. The actors really shine here. I can't think of even one line that wasn't delivered perfectly, which is even more impressive when you consider the fact that there's only one major adult character, the rest are all kids. Can we attribute that to Burnham's direction or are these actors really that great? Who cares? Neither answer changes the fact that Kayla is more relatable than just about any protagonist in 2018 film as a whole. Equally as impressive is the technical quality of Eighth Grade, which contains some of the best cinematography I've seen all year. Burnham and cinematographer Andrew Wehde seem to have had a lot of fun with this film, throwing in long zooms akin to 70s horror films, dramatic superimposing footage, and a nice mix of dolly work and handheld. The electronica music also fits perfectly with the tone of this film, which is elated and hilarious at its height and absolutely soul crushing at its lowest. All in all, during my screening of Eighth Grade I delighted in and suffered through my fair share of flashbacks to middle school despite having graduated six years before this film is set, which (to me) demonstrates the timelessness and accuracy of the writing and the film as a whole. After discussing this movie with a few friends I decided that I could not find one thing I didn't like about this movie. This is the closest thing I've seen to a perfect movie in a long, long time.",Eighth Grade

426,mennjr,Eight Grade Review,6,11 December 2018,"The movie Eighth grade is a symbol of what is expected in a normal teenager's life. With that, many of these symbolisms allow the audience to travel and memory lane, and remember what their life was like when they were a teenager. Bo Burnham is the author behind this comedic and intriguing movie. He is remarkable, because Bo Burnham is only 28 years old, therefore, it is easier for him to connect with his teenage life, thus able to convey several and basic, general idea of what some teenagers go through. These include, mood swings, being bullied, love-life kicks in, etc... I believe that this movie is a good representation for the adults watching to make sure to take care of their child, otherwise they will do something awful to themselves. However, it is also comedic due to the fact that many slangs were used, by teachers as well trying to fit into the community of teenagers. On the other hand, some people may find this movie disturbing as there was a lot of harassment going on throughout the movie, however, once again, it is a clear image of what teenagers go through, when their parents are not around. The actors within the movie were crystal clear on conveying the image of what it is like to be a teenager as well. Through the use of language, such as, slangs or taboo words, this allowed the audience to explore the teenage war, in just a couple of hours, which I personally, find very fascinating as it really represented the actual meaning of the movie. The mood of this movie creates a strong feeling of excitement, as we tend to want to find out more of what will happen to the girl. Furthermore, it also creates a sense of suspense as we are unsure if what is to come or again, what will happen to the girl. I also believe that this is another movie that can be connected to the other movie, which is ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"", however, that movie contains much more humor, and can be predictable in some events. In the movie, it shows the character Kayla, an assumed loser at school, and Aiden, a popular and hot guy who has nice eyes. This shows that within the teenage world, there will be many category of students, in the school. Personally, I found this movie very humorous, but at the same time, very ""cringing"", due to the fact that the movie was bringing back trends that were extremely popular a couple years ago. Overall, the movie is an amazing visual representation of a normal teengaers life. With the uses of previous trends, and the use of language each character was given, as well as, the settings of where the movie was taken, it is clear that the author's main intentions were to make the life of a teenager more visual for the audiences.",Eighth Grade

The story follows Kayla, a girl almost finished with her 8th grade year at school. The film touches on the ideas of insecurity, hormones, fitting in, and everything in between. The storytelling is woven together through Kayla's advice help YouTube videos which is a fresh idea no movies have ever tried. A majority of the actors and actresses are children and they stand toe to toe with most adults in the industry today. The conversations are so natural and awkward, it's like this is a natural occurrence. Kayla is a wonderful person who just wants to fit in, and we can all relate to that. This is the most realistic depiction of being a teen in schools today I've ever seen without walking through the front door of the building. If you're in these years, see this film ASAP.

Eighth Grade gives the perfect illustration of what that is like, and how much more intense it is with the social media generation. As a recent high school graduate, I can tell you that this movie is the perfect representation of middle school for our generation, spot on. From the first scene you are put inside Kayla's anxious and socially-awkward brain and you stay strapped in for the whole ride.

It can be a tough watch at times witnessing the struggle of some of the situations she finds herself in, and at others you are literally cheering for her triumphs. It's not often you see an audience react to a scene by clapping in encouragement, but that is the kind of reaction this film provokes. You root for the main character, played with such wisdom and maturity by Elsie Fisher, because she has a gravitational pull of relatability. We can emphasize with her because we all know what it is like to be 14 and lost.

Extremly cringe worthy moments like a teacher dabbing, use of the word ""lit"", overuse of ""like"" and ""ermarghad"". Achieves nothing in terms of a storyline.

It's cringey, and awkward, and extremely uncomfortable and those emotions are conveyed very well to the viewer.
The scene that really sticks out for me is the one where Kayla's driving home with the high school boy. I could instantly tell when her friend walked out of the car this was going to be hard to watch, and it was, extremely hard. This scene made me so uncomfortable, and I can only imagine how horrifying, and uncomfortable that situation was for Kayla.

451,alicefuller-26975,"Hard, But Beautiful and Accurate",8,11 May 2018,"Eighth Grade, directed by Bo Burnham, is a candidly witty and honest film about the life and times of super-relatable, awkward eighth grade student, Kayla, as she lives her way through her last weeks of middle school and prepares to enter the world of high school. From the beginning, the moviegoer is pulled into an awkward teen video blog being shot by Kayla, in which she discusses, with all of the stammering teen lingo, the importance of being yourself to her very scarce amount of viewers. After Kayla stumbles her way through this vlog, a bright, electronic, loud song comes on as we see Kayla walking up the sidewalk and into her school. Immediately the song pulls one into the story with its bright, vivid, upfront song, which abruptly ends as soon as the scene switches to Kayla sitting in her classroom. As can be seen throughout the movie, the music in this film is designed to be not background music, but foreground music, playing its own role in the film. The music lifts when Kayla is lifted, builds the tension in her anxious, nervous moments, and stops abruptly in big moments, as though the audience is personally in and experiencing the moment with Kayla. The plot line of the movie takes even the most 'popular' people back to middle school in that the awkwardness and pain of trying to fit in, as well as the joy in figuring out who you are so relatable that it hurts. The camera work with awkward close-ups, immediacy of confusing acts caught in slow motion, and montages that represent the sporadic-ness of the middle school girl's mind follows the actions and thoughts of Kayla in such a way that the audience feels like they are reliving middle school with her, and maybe even through her. Much unlike other middle school or high school coming-of-age stories, the film beautifully and accurately explores the eighth grader's journey in trying to figure out who they are and find their identity as a person with all of the awkward, painful, triumphant and hopeful moments that come with this stage of life. The moviegoer struggles with Kayla as she tries to find herself amidst trying to be someone she's not. All in all, this movie can be hard to watch, but I think that that's because it is honest and truthful about what eighth grade can be like. I think some will relate more to it than others, but ultimately, it's a really well-done take on the struggle that is middle school.",Eighth Grade
452,offscreenbabble,Completely Relatable and Hilarious,10,28 July 2018,"After seeing this movie, I can't stop thinking about it. Its a great story about a eighth grader's last week in eighth grade. It goes through the awkwardness of being that age but it also deals with social anxiety.
The acting is amazing and I would love to see more movies deal with characters and stories like this.

Sure it has a modern take, but what makes it so great is how while adults can look back at their middle school experience, ore teens can look ahead at their future. This is a must watch summer movie and should have been rated PG-13",Eighth Grade
454,authoralexa,Horrible movie,1,4 August 2018,"The movie was not comedic. It was very bland, there was little to no character development, and within the first 30 minutes I want to leave the theater I would have if I could've gotten a refund",Eighth Grade
455,bmiller-96961,Comedy????,1,5 August 2018,"First comedy I ever went to and never laughed once. Never heard anyone in the theater laugh, either (there were only 7 in the theater). Good acting but what a horrible story. The girl had no friend (singular). Almost everyone has some friends. And why no ridicule for her video postings. Did nobody see them? Eighth graders would be all over that. Very disappointing. I was also looking at my watch and counting down my exit. Put me in a sour mood. I can never get back my time wasted on this movie. Save yourself!",Eighth Grade

457,hollowpirapple,Capturing Anxiety,9,10 August 2018,"Holy hell this movie will dig deep into every insecurity you've ever had, and make you remember all of it. The movie makes you remember what it was like to attend middle school, with kids acting like cutthroats and trying in every way to be the most popular kid in school. Bo Burnham found something with this movie, something about the American psyche that is changing, how much we rely on others opinions to feel good about ourselves. The lead actress is someone that found a way to confidently show off awkwardness and anxiety with some simple facial expressions and even the way she breathes in a scene. So much emotion was shown in every second. Just completely blew writing out of the water.",Eighth Grade

463,meggiemootwo,It's not for everyone but it was for me,9,28 May 2020,"If you didn't like it then congrats, you probably didn't experience a middle school experience like Kaylas. It's not a fast-paced action adventure and nor should it, it's honest and gives you the raw details of what growing up in this age is like, filled with technology and separated families, nasty girls at school, the sketchy older boys and the true friends you find along the way. Shed a tear or two as well",Eighth Grade

465,thinleyshome,Review for Eighth grade,9,6 December 2018,"The 2018 movie ""Eighth Grade"" directed by Bo Burnham was fun to watch. Filled with moments of joy, lament, thrill, wonder, and excitement the movie takes the audience on a journey along with Kayla our protagonist for this movie. The movie was fun to watch as it showed the struggles of an eighth grader who is about to graduate and go into high school.The movie is about an eighth grader who is about to graduate middle school and move up to highschool. It shows the audience the struggles and the triumphs of the protagonist and later the realization of one's true self worth. This movie was interesting to me as it kept quite close to real life. The showed how kids are being bullied in school, although not physically but through their actions towards one another. It also shows how friendships are created or destroyed in a matter of seconds.My favorite scene from this movie is when Kayla goes to visit the high school and meets with her shadow buddy, someone who shows her around the school and explains to kayla how high school life is. They instantly click and their friendship stays strong.Another thing I liked about this movie is the cinematography. There are many great shots such as over the shoulder, tracking, wide shot. All these shots are structured masterfully that it fits the mood of each scene well.",Eighth Grade
466,nuchchayaas,"authentic, interesting, genuine",9,8 December 2018,"I really enjoyed the movie Eighth Grade. Written by Bo Burnham, this heartfelt comedy/drama film tells the story of Kayla, a shy and awkward middle schooler in her final week of eighth grade. Awkward and cringey as it was in certain parts, I found the movie wonderfully honest. It was meant to be awkward, I think. It was meant to be cringey. After all, what middle-schooler isn't? Eighth Grade accurately portrays life as a young teenager in the twenty-first century. Social media is ubiquitous and inescapable, a ruling force. Kids lead double lives; everyone is forced to pretend to be someone they are not, someone cooler and prettier and happier. Phones are everywhere, all the time. Burnham commentates but does not condescend. The movie, I think, tried to empathize. I appreciated this. I also appreciated the memes. In the fast-moving nature of such things, many of the meme referenced in this movie are long-obsolete. This was filmed in 2016, after all. Still, I was entertained all the same.Elsie fisher, Kayla's actress, has recently graduated eighth grade herself. I found her performance very authentic. The fact that she is actually fifteen probably helps. Kayla feels like a real person. She's anxious. She fumbles around with her words. She's very young. This is especially apparent in how she speaks and interacts with some of the older kids in the movie. You can see Kayla is, almost, frighteningly naive. She's struggling to find her bearings and her place in the world, as all of us have done once (or are doing now).Another thing: Kayla is average. You'd be hard pressed to find an 'average' character in any teen movie or book these days. The protagonist is always a bit of an outcast, a social recluse, a nonconformist. Sometimes they're extremely intelligent or very artistically or musically inclined. Many of these protagonists are the school bullies' usual victims, always getting trash-talked in the hallways or getting stuffed into lockers. It's old hat. Kayla isn't any of those things. She's just an average student who leads an average life. She wants to have friends, she wants to be cool and well-liked, she has inspirational post-its stuck to her dresser. Kayla is never really bullied, just looked over. In most movies, people like her are background characters. NPCs. As much as we believe otherwise, many of us are Kayla. Many of us are average. And that's okay,Eighth Grade says. Kayla is worthy of a story. We are worthy of a story, too. The movie just rings true in ways that a lot of high school movies don't. It's message is universally relatable.Her youtube channel, though, is wonderfully meta. She gives advice on ""How to be yourself,"" or ""How to put yourself out there,"" all things she's struggling to do in real life. It's almost like Kayla is subconsciously trying to convince herself to be able to do these things. I loved how these youtube videos are interjected intermittently into the film.Several times throughout the movie I found myself commenting on the score. I absolutely loved this movie's soundtrack. I am listening to it now while I am writing this review, and it is making me very happy. Anna Meredith did a wonderful job.Overall, I found Eighth Grade to be a very good movie.",Eighth Grade
