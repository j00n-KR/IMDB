0,SnoopyStyle,fine finish,7,22 July 2021,"This is the last part of the Fear Street trilogy. The series goes back in time to 1666 to discover the truth behind the Sarah Fier curse and its effect all the way to 1994.This is a fine finish. I've never read the books. I like what the story is trying to do and it solves an issue I had with the second part. Maybe more could be done with the Goode family as a bigger part of the show. I know it's the books but it may work better if the Goode family is the omnipresent overlords of this one dark town instead of splitting the place into two separate towns. Overall, this is able to bring this series to a fine conclusion. It stuck the landing.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
1,nogodnomasters,Party like its 1666.,7,22 October 2021,"Deena (Kiana Madeira) is able to see back into time and she is in the role of Sarah Fier. She parties like it is 1666 without the proper time period words and accents. Once she discovers the truth, she know what needs to be done to break the curse. Then they show a rerun of ""Chopping Mall"" on steroids.I enjoyed the series even with the confusing timeline titles. The witch hunt used some McCarthy words.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
2,kosmasp,Fier of the witch,9,20 July 2021,"No I did not write that wrong - and you didn't read it wrong either. I went with the name of the character that we have heard so much about in the previous movies ... and we finally see her here. With familiar faces ... when you make a paranormal and fantasy/horror movie, there are certain things you can play with. Like bringing characters from the current (1994 that is), to the past. So no they are not the same people, but you are giving a whole cast of actors the opportunity to play different characters - and the audience feeling or seeing someone familiar - kind of.Having said that and name puns aside (you'll understand once you watch), we finally get to know so much more about the origin of the ... I reckon you can call it myth. And once again, there is so much more than meets the eye. And while I was thinking ""but how does that make sense with the rest"" ... it actually does. Still suspension of disbelief is more than necessary.Now maybe I should have mentioned this from the start, but I have not read the novels this series of movies are based on. So I did not have any previous ""baggage"" or ideas how certain characters are supposed to look like and I don't know if or how many differences there are book to screen. What I do know is that this is a pretty clever assembly of movies. And this is culminating and bringing it all to an end ... and apart from the added scene during the credits (which I reckon you almost have to have in a horror movie), I approve of the characters and the story I got served here.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
3,Sleepin_Dragon,It's a good final film.,7,18 July 2021,"The third and final installment, here we get to learn how and why Sarah Fier came to be.It's a pretty good film, good to see members of the cast mixed up, and given something better to do. Better than the first, perhaps not as good as the second. It's a worthy conclusion, and gives us lots of answers.Some great production values here, great buildings, and some fantastic costumes.One gripe I have here, the shocking accents, it was hard to tell if they were trying to be Irish, Canadian or something a little more obscure.Perhaps the single best scene of the three movies comes here, the moment of terror inside the church with The Pastor, it was incredibly macabre and unnerving, it certainly did shock.Enjoyed it, 7/10.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
4,lee_eisenberg,every horror has a beginning,8,22 July 2021,"We now go back to the colonial-era settlement to learn the origin of the horrific events plaguing the town. I found ""Fear Street: 1666"" a satisfying conclusion. I guess that the trilogy's point is that we can never truly know everything about our history.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
5,Tweekums,What really happened in 1666,7,17 July 2021,"In the first two film we learn the legend of how the witch Sarah Fier cursed the town of Shadyside in 1666; here we learn what happened all those years ago. Having reunited the body and hand of Sarah, Deena sees what happened in the town of Union in 1666. One day many of the younger townsfolk hold a party in the woods; Sarah and a couple of friends take some strange berries from an exiled woman some consider to be a witch. In her home Sarah sees a book which appears to tell how to summon the devil. The next day things start to go wrong in town; animals die, the well is tainted and the pastor kills the town children... surely it is witchcraft. As Sarah has been seen kissing another girl it is assumed they must be involved. As she flees from the mob Sarah learns a shocking truth; a truth nobody will believe.Back in 1994, Deena now knows that truth; she knows why Shadyside appears to be cursed and Sunnyvale is blessed; she also knows who the true evil is. Along with her brother, Ziggy and Martin, a fairly minor character from film one, the head to the mall to confront this individual and hopefully end the curse once and for all.I rather enjoyed the first film, really enjoyed the second and feel this comes somewhere in between. The first half was impressive as we are shown what happened in the past; the small township surrounded by woodland had a good claustrophobic feel. This only increased when everybody started searching for Sarah. There is less on screen violence than one might expect but the aftermath of the pastor's activities are pretty disturbing without needing to see him doing it. I liked the explanation as to why Union split into two very different towns even if the identity of the evil isn't a huge surprise. The action in the mall is fun enough but for a slasher film the death toll is rather low. The acting is solid; I know some aren't too keen on the accents but to be fair we don't know what the accents of over three hundred years ago sounded like. Having the same actors play parts in both 1994 and 1666 seemed an odd choice but I soon got used to it. Overall I found this to be a solid conclusion to the trilogy.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
6,BA_Harrison,Tales from the Shadyside: The Final Chapter (I hope).,4,29 July 2021,"The first hour and a quarter of Fear Street: Part Three - 1666 is precisely the terrible Netflixified version of The VVitch that the trailer suggested: it's dreadfully drab, unnecessarily drawn out, and features the same all-inclusive cast as clichéd pilgrim characters (puritanical elders accusing innocent youngsters of being sinful, superstitious idiots, and a town loony called Mad Thomas!). The script delivers the same boring emotional drama that made me dislike the first two parts.In the 17th Century settlement of Union, teenage lesbian Sarah Fier (Kiana Madeira) cannot hide her feelings for the comely pastor's daughter Hannah (Olivia Scott Welch). So, when the town is blighted by inexplicable and terrible occurrences, it is sinful Sarah who is suspected of witchcraft. However, in reality, it is Sarah's friend Solomon Goode (Ashley Zukerman) who is failing to live up to his surname, having made a deal with the devil: a few people's souls in exchange for prosperity and success. This deal has been passed down the centuries to Goode's descendants, all the way to 1994, which is when the second part of the film takes place.Now I'm wondering whether director Leigh Janiak (wife of Stranger Things creator Ross Duffer) made the first half of her final Fear Street film incredibly dull on purpose so that the predictable mall-bound finalé would seem pretty good by comparison. She almost had me fooled until The Offspring played on the soundtrack, when I was reminded of just how formularized, calculated and commercial the whole Fear Street experience has been, borrowing heavily from other recent (and not so recent) horror successes: part one was Stranger Things plus Scream, part two was Friday the 13th plus Blair Witch, and this part is The VVitch plus Stranger Things plus Stephen King's IT. Not that I would have minded so much had the result been less bloated and hadn't rammed 21st century wokeness down my throat, but after five and a half hours of supernatural horror and slasher fun swamped by teen drama and lesbian strife, I can safely say that I don't want any more (sadly, the end credits suggest that more is exactly what we're going to get).3.5/10, rounded up to 4 because you can never have too much Pixies.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
7,paul_haakonsen,A fulfilling backstory and conclusion...,6,12 August 2021,"Well, I must admit that I have been thoroughly enjoying both of the previous the ""Fear Street"" movies, so of course I was looking forward to watching the third part, titled ""Fear Street: 1666"".And director Leigh Janiak definitely brings the legacy of Shadyside to a fulfilling closure, and provided me with an entertaining and enjoyable movie experience.The storyline told in ""Fear Street: 1666"", as written by Phil Graziadei, Leigh Janiak, Kate Trefry and R. L. Stine definitely proved to be entertaining. And I enjoyed the way that the storyline brought to life the backstory of the ancestors from the first two movies.It was certainly good to see returning actors and actresses from the first two movies to act out parts in the third movie as well, as it gave the movie a broader sense of connection with the previous two movies.Visually then ""Fear Street: 1666"" was quite good. There were lots of good effects, though the movie wasn't quite as visceral and brutal as part two. But still, it was more than sufficient for a seasoned gorehound such as myself.I can warmly recommend the entire trilogy as the three movies turned out to be rather enjoyable.My rating of ""Fear Street: 1666"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
8,Calicodreamin,the finale,6,17 July 2021,"The first part was not great, the accents came and went and felt unnecessary. The storyline felt dragged out and was a tad predictable. The second part was much better. The battle royale worked well for action and cinematography.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
9,kannibalcorpsegrinder,An enjoyable if somewhat flawed conclusion to the series,9,25 July 2021,"Living alone with her family in a small village, a young woman who gets caught up in the hysteria for a witch-hunt to determine the cause of a series of supernatural antics maligning the village and when a curse is enacted based on a grave secret the couple in the present day try to force that secret out to end the curse.Overall, this one manages to generate some highly enjoyable elements. One of the strongest aspects here is the generally enjoyable build-up that places a lot to like on this kind of build-up focusing on the relationships in the village. Getting a good look at the general interaction within the set of friends who are in their own cliques which resorts to bullying those they deem unwarranted, their secret lesbian dalliances that are to be kept hidden from everyone else, and the general air of fear and paranoia that emerges between the villages as the events start to unfold provide the film with a highly impressive early starting point to the later supernatural actions. Given how well these tie into the characters so far in the story, it allows for a rather fun setup that gives us a great introduction to everything. Once those actions start to emerge, the film is an immaculate build-up of genuinely terrifying actions that are utilized incredibly well. From the discovery of the poisoned water, the discovery of several dead bodies around the village, and the events of the church involving a possessed member of the village brutally mutilating others before turning the same act on himself, this is all graphic enough to be a worthy cause to start the inquisition around the rest of the village. These scenes are quite enjoyable as there's the mad and aimless witch-hunt trying to corral those that they deem to have proffered the incidents without cause, leading to some tension and plenty of close calls as they go throughout the area trying to find her which makes for a lot of fun while stuck back in the old days. When it shifts back to the modern-day storyline, the revelations that have been learned about the real town curse and how it's affected everyone which unburied quite a lot of impressive story-telling here, the film manages to inflict some rather enjoyable action throughout here. Focusing on the race to the mall where it all started and to enact the plan to stop the multitude of killers that appear to stop them from carrying out an end to the curse, this section of the film is action-packed and has tons of fun chasing, numerous confrontations through the .building and a grand conclusion to everything that uses the action to conclude the storyline in a fun fashion. These aspects are more than enough to hold this one up over its mind flaws. This one doesn't have a lot of issues but they are somewhat distracting. The main problem here is the somewhat uneven amount of time spent on the various timelines here since the distribution is quite uneven. The stuff from the past, which represents the discovery of the curse that's been affecting the town, is immensely cliche and predictable without much in the way of any kind of originality. The attempts at the persecution and setting the curse into motion in the town are nothing new from dozens of other witchcraft efforts and make this segment feel far too long for its own good, especially since the rest of the series never had these issues which tends to downplay the start of the film. For the most part, this is the biggest factor against this since it's a fun conclusion overall.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
10,trashgang,less than the other parts but towards the end gore comes back,7,19 August 2021,"Going completely back to the dark ages and the way the witch was born or formed. Part 3 of the franchise who brought back the slashers and gore.Just when I thought, okay now we do know and where's the horror I'm waiting for the flick ends and you get a flashforward to the other two parts, picks up speed and gore...again.Not the best part but still a must see for the horror geeks.Gore 2/5

11,Cineanalyst,The Crucible,3,17 July 2021,"The two prior ""Fear Street"" entries cribbed other horror films hard. ""Part One"" being ""Scream"" (1966) mostly, and ""Part Two"" was ""Friday the 13th"" (1988). Here, though, it's ""The Crucible,"" Arthur Miller's McCarthyism allegory of a book, for which the most well-known adaptation to film was in 1996. One of the villagers even claims to have a list of suspected communists--I mean witches. Not really a horror story, but it does demonstrate that the trilogy was never really about classic horror cinema. This is young adult fiction, and everything in this juvenile, solipsistic genre is formulaic. The M. Night Shyamalan of a lazy twist this time reveals what should have already been expected all along, because it's the same simplistic allegory that seemingly underlines every other one of these kiddie fantasies: the rich are eating the poor. Quite literally in this case--well, OK, drinking their blood, rather. ""Hunger Games,"" ""Divergent,"" ""Alita: Battle Angel,"" and probably others that I haven't seen--they're all the same.After an hour of playing with old-timey accents in the dull ""Crucible"" for dummies, ""Part Three"" returns to the 1994 timeline to replay yet another one of the kids' goofy monster traps. Because two of those in the first installment--at a school and a grocery store--wasn't enough, I guess. Everything from ""Carrie"" to ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964), or ""Back to the Future Part III"" (1990), more likely, is stolen from. How this gets 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, from professional entertainment critics for whom one would at least assume have seen enough movies to know when they're being fed recycled refuse, I don't know.Politicos, too, could have, and may very well be having, for all I know, a field day with this series. I mean, the big reveal, after all, is that a white policeman feeding the rich by killing the poors is the villain, and only people of color, women and lesbians are the heroes left standing at the end, to rescue the historically disadvantaged. White male privilege or what have you as Faustian bargain. That'd be too bad, though, because the ""Fear Street"" trilogy is fundamentally awful beyond whatever the political or representational merits of its message. Like everything else in the trilogy, it's a hack job.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
12,A_Different_Drummer,Each entry worse than the previous one,3,6 September 2021,"Which is an extraordinary achievement even in today's upside down world. The first in the trilogy was so good I sat through the second and third, parts of my life I will never get back. Whichever exec greenlighted this disaster should find a new line of work.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
13,UniqueParticle,The least good of the trilogy,7,31 October 2021,I held off on watching this one and now I can't decide if I like it much I still think it deserves a decent rating. Definitely understand the hate for Irish accents they are pretty bad and there's bad acting in most of it; part one and two were best! I must say I really like the way this was filmed the horror is pretty solid. I did have trouble sleeping maybe I'd enjoy more with better rest but I doubt it Fear Street:1666 is cheesy in a bad way!Edit: The last half is excellent and makes the movie so much better!,Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
14,Thanos_Alfie,Very good ending...,6,6 October 2021,"""Fear Street: 1666"" is a Mystery - Horror movie and the third movie of the ""Fear Street"" franchise, in which we continue our journey in the past. We are now back on 1666 and we watch how all started and how the curse of Sarah Fier released.I enjoyed the third movie of this franchise the same way as the previous two. The plot continued to surprise me since there were some plot twists that I did not expect and made the movie even more interesting. The direction which was made by Leigh Janiak who made also the direction for the previous two movies followed the same successful way. The interpretations of Kiana Madeira who played as Sarah Fier / Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Henry / Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Lizzie / Kate and Olivia Scott Welch who played as Hannah Miller / Samantha Fraser were for one more time very good. All in all, I have to say that ""Fear Street: 1666"" and ""Fear Street"" franchise was simply amazing and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it. I am sure that if you are a horror movies fan you will simply love this franchise.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
15,cruise01,Crucible meets slasher thriller ends for a bloody showdown.,8,30 September 2021,4 out of 5 stars.The second film was a bit of a letdown with its uneven direction. The third film does end the trilogy in a good slow direction that picks up in a bloody showdown third act. The film takes the characters back in 1666 to give an origin story of the witch. When a village of settlers in the town. Gets cursed and people starts pointing accusations towards girls who seem out of place. Without giving away spoilers. There is a twist which turns the film direction into a bloody third act. Where a few teens try to hold up in a place to face against a variety of killers while trying to kill the evil.Plot is good. The cast ensemble is good. It took awhile to get used to the same cast playing different characters in 1666 which felt weird at first. Especially the accents they were using. But the story keeps you engaged. The thrills is good. And the third act is bloody entertaining. The film holds back a soundtrack with spending more time on a music score.The film does give it a proper conclusion. While leaving a mid credit scene for more possibilities.,Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
16,eddie_baggins,Saved the best till last (despite wigs and accents),7,25 July 2021,"Over the last three weeks we've had the Scream like opening 1994, the Friday the 13th inspired 1978 and now with the final instalment in Netflix's surprisingly good R. L Stine based horror series The Witch feeling 1666, a film that acts as an entertaining and even genuinely surprising final piece of the puzzle around the cursed town of Shadyside.With the two previous instalments laying the foundation and providing backstory to what Fear Street is all about, 1666 doesn't have to provide us with much in the way of set-up as we are thrust into the life of hanged supposed witch Sarah Fier (played by 1994's lead Kiana Madeira) as we join her and a collection of badly wigged co-stars (complete with a slightly suspect array of accents) in a small settlement village that starts to experience a series of evil occurrences that townsfolk attribute to the dark arts of witchcraft and devil worship.Despite the fact this Ohio set location didn't have villages of this kind in the time period, much can be forgiven in 1666 as director Leigh Janiak does a great job dialing things back for the first part of this experience as she gives us a far less slasher inspired horror that lays on the dread and mystery thick and fast that culminates in a great twist, one that in turn leads us towards an innovative and gloriously ridiculous finale that is just what the doctor ordered.Filled with some unnerving and spine tingling moments of horror (a pigs pen or church sermon with a difference are ones to keep an eye out for) and some great work from D. O. P Caleb Heymann and a trio of scorers in Marco Beltrami, Anna Drubich and Marcus Trumpp, 1666 also feels like the most polished of all three films in Janiak's series and gives one a feeling that should she and Netflix wish to do more work under the Fear Street banner, there's reason enough to get excited by the proposition.While in a genre sense there is no real new ground being covered by any of these films, with each owing a debt to not only R. L Stine's work but classic horror outings that have come before them both a long time ago and also more recently, Fear Street can be commended for not always being totally predictable, unexpectedly dark and gruesome and also fresh enough in delivery too feel worth ones time and while many have bemoaned the lack of quality horror in Netflix's original offerings for good reason previously, Janiak's three films have showed just what can be achieved for the streaming platform in this area with the right minds and creativity at work.Final Say -Rounding out one of the years most surprisingly entertaining offerings with the best singular effort yet, Fear Street: Part Three -1666 is a memorable way to wrap up one of the most consistent horror trilogies in recent memory.3 1/2 piglets out of 5.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
17,ZegMaarJus,Fear Street Part 3,7,27 August 2021,"Fear Street Part 3: 1666 is a Slasher Horror Movie. We go back to 1666, the story of Sarah Fier. Sarah kisses with Hannah, Thomas saw it.

19,matthewssilverhammer,Just glad it's over...,4,17 September 2021,"1666 is the best of the bunch, with the brutality finally fitting the tone. Still, I just can't get over how cheap and unimaginative the filmmaking is throughout, but especially when we get back to the 90s, and it's just bad-Stranger-Things again. This whole trilogy just felt like a chore assigned to me by Netflix. And because I'm a dutiful son, I did my chore. But that doesn't mean I have to like it.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
20,southdavid,"The Liar, The Witch and the Homophobe",7,21 July 2021,"The third and (potentially not) final addition to the ""Fear Street"" trilogy sees us spending an hour or so in 1666, discovering the true origins of the town and it's curse, before heading back to the 1994 to discover whether the survivors can truly do anything about it.With Deena (Klana Madeira) having reunited the full remains of Sarah Fier (Elizabeth Scopel) she is told the truth behind the hanging of the witch, and why the devil was welcomed into Union and by whom. She sees this with her friends and family standing in for Sarah's, so Sarah's brother Henry appears as Deena's brother Josh (Benjamin Flores Jr.). Finally, with the knowledge of the truth, Deena knows what she needs to do, so they return to the Mall for one last stand.The series overall problem is that (necessarily for the plot) it plays its strongest card first, and the 1990's inspired first film is better than either of its's successors. If I was disappointed that part two didn't lean into it's 70's vibe, that isn't the case here. As though there are plenty of films set during the witch trials, it's something we've leaned further into in the UK than in America, so there aren't really that many classic films to homage.Plot wise it's OK. I doubt that the revelations of who is actually behind the curse will come as a total surprise to you when it's revealed, but as reveals go, it makes sense with what we've seen before. Back in Shadyside mall for the climax, logic is a little ropier. As with the first part, they never can quite nail down that idea that the resurrected murderers are only after whomever has the blood on them, as some bystanders get it again.Despite the second and third films only really being 'alright' I'd actually quite like to see this story continue on - and not just in the way that the post credits stinger suggests - there are a number of other murderers we've seen whose back story we didn't get to spend any time in. We can bring these stories up to date and see what the survivors have made of their lives.It's a shame the series as a whole couldn't make a bit more of the time jumps it had available to it or remained a bit more knowing, like the first one, but overall I don't regret my time spent watching them.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
21,subxerogravity,Solid ending to the trilogy.,7,17 July 2021,I've seen better part threes but not many.Fear Street 1666 had to change the speed of the horror genre in order to complete the trilogy which made this a different feel than the other two and to be honest I felt that they left out things that made the other two movies very good.If you think of 1666 as the end of something it works very well for the Netflix event that had me locked down three Saturdays in a row.However 1994 and 1978 are two movies that can be seen individually 1666 not so much. Its not a bad thing cause its not a bad movie but the fact that it can't stand on its own does make it the weak link in an excellent trilogy.As a whole worth every minute.,Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
22,Stevieboy666,1666 is better than 1994 but 1978 is best,6,9 August 2021,"The final part of the Netflix ""Fear Street"" trilogy is a movie of two halves, 1666 followed by the concluding 1994. 1666 was quite interesting as it explains the origins of the story but in terms of the characters, as other reviews state, the accents were unconvincing. This was also a time of slavery yet that does not appear to be the case here with the village's mixed ethnicity appearing to be all equal. As with each part there is are a few very gory moments, and once again the no nudity sex scenes are between a lesbian couple. Finally we are back to 1994 for the frankly rather disappointing finale, bit of a let down but it was adequate. Amongst the soundtrack is the wonderful ""Live Forever"" by Oasis. I am glad that I watched the series, however overall I'd rate it a slightly better than average 6/10.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
23,kevin_robbins,The primary story and premise was kind of blah to me,6,25 August 2021,"Fear Street Part Three: 666 (2021) is currently available on Netflix and continues the storyline of the back stories and how the curse began that triggered the events of the first two movies. Once the curse is established we fast forward back to the events of the first two films and wrap up the storyline. This movie is directed by Leigh Janiak (Fear Street 1 & 2) and stars Kiana Madeira (Dark Matted), Ashley Zukerman (Manhattan), Gillian Jacobs (The Box), Benjamin Flores Jr. (Ride Along) and Randy Havens (Stranger Things). This film does a good job of setting up the history with great settings, props, attire and backdrops. The gore remains fantastic as it was in the previous two pictures and the cinematography was solid too. This does do a good job of tying all of the films together. The ending scenes are very entertaining and I liked how it tied all the killers together. The flashbacks to all the murders were good too. However, the primary story and premise was kind of blah to me. Oh, and I love the Pixies as the soundtrack, good choice. Overall I'd say the second film was the best, this film is second best, and the first film is kind of a disaster. I'd score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once. This series fell short to me and reminded me a little of Bly House with better special effects and more gore.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

26,henry8-3,Fear Street Part 3: 1666,6,17 July 2021,"The trilogy reaches it climax by looking into the origins of the curse of Shadyside and the creation and 'destruction' of the witch in 1666.Managing to bring the whole thing together with the bulk of the story set in 1666, this is handled actually very convincingly and avoids pretty much, the horror and humour so prevalent in the first 2 parts such that you can't help but feel that The Crucible and The Witch are filming in nearby villages. Gears do however shift later in the film as truths come out and everything is nicely and brutally pulled together, leaving plenty of room for 3 more. An enjoyable horror trilogy that has been funny and gory in equal measure with appropriate respect paid to earlier horror classics and delivered with great tracks from the relative period and fine soundtracks. The second and third parts were the best but the whole thing sits nicely together as a whole / destined for cultdom.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
27,yusufpiskin,Amazing,8,16 July 2021,"Only such a legendary ending would suit this story. The third part was even better than the first two combined. The soundtrack, the costumes, the sound engineering, the book and movie references... it could be Netflix's best production this year. I hope there will be more stories like this.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
28,cjonesas,[6.6] Don't do that (two halves) ever again!,7,26 July 2021,"A nice mumbo jumbo after the very good 1978. As far as the 1666 was concerned, I was sort of jumping up and down my seat, praising whatever was shown on the screen, which was good acting, ""witchy"" 17th century photography & bleak atmosphere and of course Red splashing around with tendons hanging. Unfortunately, that was short-lived, cause I was introduced to 1994-part 2 that I thought would be trying to bring it to nice closure. Pouff!, it only managed to completely destroy the brilliant flow of the first half of the movie, splashing fluorescent paint all over me and backstabbing me with devilish grins and sadistic happiness.Despite that, with sleepy eyes, I give it a nice 6.6, a sort of magical redeeming factor, AVG summing the two 1666 parts together and bring the trilogy to an average (mediocre) end.Rest in peace and don't open that book again, whoever you are.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
29,Pairic,Great Finale,8,16 July 2021,"Fear street Part Three: 1666: So we go back to the very beginning, 17th Century life is re-imagined in the Village of Union, bringing The Witch to mind. The local teens party, a few of them daringly enter the hut of a reclusive widow and see a book of magic but are chased out. Two of the girls are lovers, something which is anathema in those days. The next day adversity strikes Union, food rots, animals die, the well is poisoned. But worse is to come. The preacher Cyrus Miller is Possessed and kills twelve children, plucking out their eyes and his own. He is swiftly dispatched with a pitchfork. Hysteria then takes over the settlement. The two lovers, Hannah and Sarah are accused of being witches, the events in The Crucible are an exemplar of justice in comparison to what occurs here as the mob are consumed with bloodlust. Again disturbing scenes of horror predominate over jump scares. It's how the pile of eyes on the floor are presented, a severed hand, hanging, the incremental scenes adding up to a sense of existential dread. Secrets are revealed, what really brought the curse down on the community and why it has echoed through the centuries. The film returns to 1994 for the denouement and another battle royale with the serried ranks of reanimated mass murderers. Directed and Co-Written by Leigh Janiak. On Netflix. 8/10.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

31,masonfisk,BRINGING IT HOME STRONG...!,9,28 July 2021,"The slam bang finale from Netflix in their Fear Street trilogy. Taking the narrative right to the beginning where we meet Sarah Fier (the witch in question from the previous outings) we see her & her brother tending to their farm & more specifically their pig which has just given birth to a litter. Taking one of the runts to a customer/confidante who lives on the outskirts of their village, we find out the youths of the village are starting to rebel from the puritanical vice grip the elders have on them by having a drink & drug soiree later that same night. Once at the party we start to get a sense of a power structure amongst the young people as some proclaim their love & some others are shot down. From a secluded vantage point an unknown figure sees Sarah kissing another girl which prompts them to stop when they fear they're being watched. The next day things turn for the worse as atrocities start to mount (animals killed, wells poisoned, etc.) culminating in hysteria (the town deacon plucks out his own eyes & many of children, killing them & himself) culminating in Fier being accused of witchcraft, even though she protests her innocence but still ends up being hanged. Flash forward back to 1994 where the final pieces of this grisly puzzle are revealed ending, where the film began, at the mall where the remaining good guys band together to win the day. Smartly having the cast play their own ancestral counterparts (series lead Kiana Madiera plays Fier for the audience even though her reflection to others is of the another actress) keeps viewers plugged into the story w/o having to learn new faces. As w/the other entries, this is not a flick for the squeamish as it celebrates its gore (w/ample second & third helpings of the red roux to be had) w/the actors stepping up to the plate quite enthusiastically rounding the bases to its conclusion. I hope this will become another tent-pole for the streamer so fingers & toes crossed, we'll get more.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
32,aidanratesmovies,"First half is a bore, second half is great",7,16 July 2021,"A bit uneven, but decent nevertheless- Fear Street Part Three is a great conclusion to the horror trilogy...for the second half. I just want to take this review to say how misleading the title is for this film. While Fear Street Part Two had some of the moments towards the beginning and end still set in 1994- this film only takes place in 1666 for the films first half. The second half of the film takes place in 1994 again, and I have to say, I enjoyed that half much better. Although the cinematography is good, as well as the costumes and performances of the first half- the story is incredibly dry, and the pacing is incredibly slow. It's also just rather predictable and besides some haunting imagery and its conclusion, is hardly worth the watch. The second half of this film is an absolute blast. It's entertaining, lives up to the potential of its parts, and is easily one of the most satisfying endings for a film i've seen this year. You'll be on the edge of your seat, cheering for our main characters in their quest to stop the curse, and it's just so much fun that it makes the other films worth the ride. In the end, Fear Street Part Three 1666 is uneven, with a slow start, but thankfully is able to get to the roots of its material it's based on and provide for an excellent and very entertaining thrill ride.My Rating: 7.3/10.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
33,vengeance20,An Ok Conclusion,5,15 September 2021,"So after the Part 2 which while was better than Part 1, comes Part 3 of the Fear Street Trilogy. This one was mixed with me, it had good bits but bad bits in it also.The film follows the origins of the witch which started off the killing spree from 1666 all the way to 1994. The first parts sees the origins, while the lateral sees the group from the end of Part 1 putting an end to the spree once & for all.I found the film to be mostly alright. It's not amazing & dose suffer from pacing & length issues, at 1 hour & 45 minutes, the film is long & the deaths weren't all that, the ending was quite a mouthful, but somewhat clever in how all the films play a role, though it would've been nice to see the other killers get their own films, you saw a couple of others in there that looked good. The story for the film is alright, but too drawn out & then a major mouthful at the end. There's some funny bits here & there along with some eye candy, Emily Rudd again...!Overall, it's an ok conclusion. But don't expect too much.5/10.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
34,elliotjeory,Wasn't that great tbh,5,19 July 2021,"I liked the first one, the second one was better, this was below average.

35,arungeorge13,The trilogy comes to an end pretty neatly! [+60%],6,19 July 2021,"Fear Street: 1666 is a satisfying final piece in the Netflix supernatural/slasher trilogy, the enjoyment levels of which are totally subjective (as a horror enthusiast). As a film that ties up loose ends from its predecessors, 1666 does a pretty solid job. Director Leigh Janiak splits the film up between the 1666 and 1994 timelines, providing closure to the lead characters in a fun, albeit perfunctory fashion. The 1666 part of the film is indeed notable for its slow-paced build, captivating aesthetics, and a pretty unexpected twist. By the time the film moves back to 1994, the novelty of the first film (which rode high on nostalgia) gets a bit worn out. We return to the Shadyside mall once again, in a foreseeable finale that comes across as a quick wrap-up exercise. As far as the kills are concerned, 1666 has some exciting ones but none particularly memorable.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

37,gianmarcoronconi,The best movie of the trilogy,8,20 July 2021,This is undoubtedly the best of the trilogy because it mixes the tension of the second with the irony of the first showing a horror very mature even if for boys. This is the perfect conclusion to a high-caliber horror trilogy.,Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
38,gedikreverdi,It has come full circle,7,16 July 2021,"Ruby the psycho school girl and the doll face killer are really creepy and they should have their own spinoffs. When Deena touches the body of her, she saw what really happened back in 1666. She and her lover who's the daughter of the pastor of the Union was seen when they were making love in the woods and they wanted to hang them because they were sinners and brought the curse on their Union. Sarah Fier lost his hand down in the caves while trying to get away from Solomon who looked like a good guy but killed the widow in the woods to make a deal with the devil thru the book she possessed. And his first killer to shed blood for the devil was the pastor himself. He locked himself up in the church with the kids and gouged their eyes as well as his. The scene was very gory as the kids were sitting in the rows as if they were listening to him preaching. Then Sarah took the fall and she said she tempted Hannah too so the pastor's daughter was spared but they hanged her. Then it cut back to 1994 which made me really happy. Deena and her brother along with Ziggy made a plan in the mall to lure all the killers and lock them up in the stores so that they can kill Nick Goode who's the great grandson of Solomon. Nick was killed down in the caves by Deena and she came out of their Goodman house in Sunnyvale from the cave system. The curse on Shadyside is gone and bad things started to happen in the formerly flawless Sunnyvale. But the incantation book was still down there where they found the killer Goodman and it was taken from the crime scene by an unknown person. I doubted they'd mess up with the ending but they really did a good job and everything made sense and it was really enjoyable.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
39,hnt_dnl,"OK trilogy, some issues with Part 3",6,24 July 2021,"FEAR STREET Part 1 was a mildly entertaining callback to 20th century horror movies. Part 2 was a perfect homage to 70s/80s slasher films and on it's own a solid entry to the genre. So what did I make of Part 3, set in 1666? Overall, it was a nice conclusion to the trilogy, but I have a few problems. The good news first. Although a lot of fans seem to have a problem with her, I thought Deena was a strong protagonist for the trilogy and liked Kiana Madeira's acting, especially in this final movie. Also, the whole vibe of the 17th century village was pretty well done and convincing.Now to the issues! First, the accents of the characters in 1666 were hard to take, which leads me to my second point and that I really wish they had used a different set of actors for 1666 instead of just re-using the same cast from 1978 and 1994. I get what they were going by having familiarity and instant love for the same faces we got to know earlier, but I think it was distracting with the bad accents and also, 1978 had a whole new set of actors different from 1994 and that worked out perfectly. Yes, it was by necessity, but again, it worked. I think a new set of actors in 1666 would have made the 3 movies more mysterious and dynamic.Then there was the teamup in Part 3 with Deena, Josh, C Berman, and Martin. Much like Part 1, I have mixed reactions to the team. Other than Deena, I just really didn't care for the team. At least there was Simon in Part 1 who I liked in addition to Deena. But I still don't like Josh in Part 3. I found him pretty useless and 1-dimensional in this one. I guess he had to survive because he's Deena's brother. I also didn't think much of C Berman and thought the 1978 teen version of her was much better. Also, Martin was supposed to be the comic relief but he was the least funny character possibly in all 3 movies.But my biggest gripe was probably that Solomon had to end up a villain. He was such a likable character and on the way to becoming my favorite character in Part 3 much like Simon from Part 1 and Cindy from Part 2. And the ""twist"" became painfully obvious to me as the movie wore on. I don't understand how someone so enlightened and seemingly good and selfless as Solomon would end up the bad guy. It also opens up a can of worms for the earlier parts, especially Part 2, since all 3 films are connected.Overall, the trilogy was a good ride with Part 2 easily being the standout movie. I hope the filmmakers consider doing some future standalone movies on the various Shadyside killers, but hopefully the writing is more the ilk of Part 2, not Parts 1 and 3.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
40,thekarmicnomad,The weakest of the 3 by a long way,3,5 August 2021,"I don't like horror films set in Witch Trial times -
I find they tend to be slow, long and pretentious.As this is.The first half of this movie is very slow and dull and consists mainly of people accusing each other in poorly lit rooms - but accomplishing very little..Then we go back to the 90's
Where we uncover the big reveal.As true to form with most slasher moves it is pretty lame.Then we have the boss fight.This is pretty stupid - but this is a slasher movie and the endings were always pretty anticlimactic.The problem here is we have been watching for hours and hours so when it all culminates in a bunch of teenagers running around screaming it falls flatter than it should.I really enjoyed the other two - this was just boring.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

48,SoumikBanerjee25,"Speaks of Love, Sacrifice and Acceptance!",7,20 July 2021,"Okay, this could take a while! There's a lot to tell, just bear with me, alright?This time we travel further back in time; 1666, to be precise! On having a quick look at the teaser; the majority of the viewing audience was presuming that it would fall in line with one of the most talked-about Horror movies in the last decade i.e. The VVitch. Well, let me tell you this right off the bat; That is not the case. It is not even in the vicinity of that Cult Classic by Robert Eggers.Although, that doesn't inevitably mean the film was bad! It's quite the opposite. All I'm saying is that the creators have obviously taken a handful of inspirations from Eggers' work; However, in due course, they shaped it in a way that suited them the most. Medieval clothing, thick accents, ecclesiastic ethos; have to say, they spared no effort to consummate the much-needed ambiance. But the all-around setting never really reverberated with the aurae of dread or desolation; two of the most sought-after facets of medieval storytelling.In contrast with the previous chapters, I now have grave reservations about its technical capabilities. First off, why is there a significant number of hand-held shootings? I am perfectly aware of the fact that hand-held/shaky camera movements can very well be beneficial in certain situations but they resort to this approach far too many times. Begs the question, was that really necessary? And what is going on with the Score? It is highly Inconsistent, uneven, and unreasonably loud.By all accounts, its greatest strengths lie in Writing. Which intently mull over the inhuman practices that happened time and time again during the middle ages. Infamously known as 'Witch-hunt'. Not only countless innocent women have suffered misfortune, but they also underwent indescribable torments & agony; owing to baseless superstitions or self-seeking conspiracies done by Men. Just goes to show how filthy and disgraceful the history of our human civilization is.Furthermore, the storyline also speaks of Love, Sacrifice & Acceptance. The liaison of Deena & Sam (Ably portrayed by Kiana Madeira & Olivia Scott Welch respectively) holds the key to this entire narrative structure. Characterization is another critical aspect that has ensured that it all comes off naturally and does not seem contemptuous.When all is said and done it would be up to you to arrive at a conclusion. Your mentality, your point of view will eventually determine the final judgment. Not trying to push you or anything but dare I suggest keeping an open mind and try to see this through compassion and empathy.If two people truly love each other, who are we to judge? Regardless of their sexual orientation, irrespective of the color of their skin, or the distinctive cultural backgrounds they belong to; Do these things even matter? Loving somebody with all you've got; Tell me, what's so wrong with that? Love without conditions, love without reasons; is that a 'Sin'? Could it ever be? Should it be the case; ask yourself, aren't we all 'Sinners' then?""I don't fear the devil. I fear the neighbor who would accuse me. I fear the mother that would let her daughter hang.

The second part of the movie felt a little more formulaic, but it offered as satisfying a conclusion to the trilogy as anyone could hope for. I give Part Three an enjoyable but flawed 7/10.

Fear Street Part 3: 1666. The origins of Sarah Fier's curse are finally revealed as history comes full circle on a night that changes the lives of Shadysiders forever. Wow what a way to end this fantastic trilogy.My first few positives would be the clever idea. Chemistry between the cast and great performances, as well as the great set locations and tense and uncomfortable tone. This film was very clever, having the final film be about the origins of the character was definitely the right decision for the final instalment, and having the actors from the previous two films portray the characters here was also a fun and creative idea, as well as a good challenge for the actors. I thought that the cast had fantastic chemistry here, just like with the previous two instalments the cast worked excellently. Particularly Kiana Madeira and Olivia Scott Welch, whose relationship was believable, well explored and gave Sarah Fier as a character a lot more depth and development. The performances from the whole cast were also excellent, Kiana Madeira really stepped up with her performance here, she delivered an intense and passionate performance for both roles she played and showed her versatility off well, the whole cast did great with other standouts being Gillian Jacobs, Keil Oakley Zepernick, McCabe Slye and Olivia Scott Welch. I also thought the set pieces were excellent, the film did an excellent job at bringing this particular setting and time period to life. With old farmhouses and wells for the locals. It very much felt specific to that time period, and it also set up a fairly creepy atmosphere for the film to play around with as well. This film also had an excellent tense and uncomfortable tone that was slowly built up well over the first act. This film did what I loved so much about the second film. It built up its tense and uncomfortable tone slowly as the film developed in order to create more atmosphere and impact. I loved how the first act was constructed, with things slowly going more and more wrong as more reveals about Sarah Fier were happening, they were both very cleverly connected, and it made the film's tone have more of an impact.My next few positives would be the great cinematography. Character background and set up for Sarah, the strong themes expressed. As well as the rising of tension and use of gore. This film had excellent cinematography, what I really loved is that this film once again provided a slightly different horror tone compared to the other 2. With the use of low-key lighting and shadows, the cinematography was more targeted towards a supernatural tone which I really loved. There were some excellently crafted scenes, using the set locations and scenery to there full advantage. Next, I also loved the character background and set up for Sarah Fier, knowing how she lived her life and the already apprehensive and negative views towards her in the town, was a good way to establish her as a character as well as her relationships with the other characters, I also really liked the set up for her character. Having her be a gay character was an interesting element, due to the time period being in the 1600's this was considered a sin, so this raised important themes whilst also balancing it out in a positive way with more intimate moments between Sarah and Hannah Miller (Olivia Scott Welch), this increased the tension with the town and due to the strange events happening the links with witchcraft were set up well. I also liked the use of gore and rising of tension. As the reveal and set up for the town's hatred increased the tension slowly built, the film turned into a massive manhunt for Sarah, and due to the background and new connections made with her character, it made the film very intense to watch as you realised what truly happened to her character, I also like the use of gore it had impactful due it not being overused. With the barn scene leaving a particularly big impact.My next few positives would be the sound design, character designs. Development to the plot, great Jumpscares. As well as the building of mystery and the plot twists. I thought the film used sound excellently in order to build tension and to create a scary atmosphere. The film often used jarring sound, or effective uses of fast tapping especially within the church scene that really increased the tension of the film well, I also like that the film also focused on scenes for longer with little or no sound designs which helped to build the same effect, as well as well-timed and startling Jumpscares that weren't overused. I also like the creative killer designs, just like with the previous two entries the film introduced multiple new killers. All of them were creative, detailed, and disturbing. My favourite had to be the town's priest, despite it only being a short scene it had the most impact. With his hook for a hand and raking the town's children eyes out was particular gruesome and very effective scene. I also loved the development to the plot and how It was structured, I think the film developed Sarah and her character excellently, filling in the audience into what truly happened. With all of the events explained in the previous two entries finally being explained in an intense second act, and I loved that it ended back in the present day in a full circle. I also loved how the film built its mystery, as the film slowly revealed what truly happened to Sarah Fier, I found it a great twist to find out she was innocent, and the film did a good job at building its mystery of who the true killer was and the events that have been taken place very well, it took the franchise in a strong and unexpected different direction. This led to the plot twist being excellently executed, it was well written, unexpected, and set up the final act very well. Tying all the loose ends very well and having Nick Goode as the true villain was an interesting and great twist as we learned about his descendants. This just really made the worldbuilding of this film really strong, it managed to balance tying up the loose ends and explaining the plot holes whilst also building on its own world and the different killers and characters within it excellently.I only had a few nit-picks with the film. There were some dodgy Irish accents, I would have liked more background into Sarah and her relationship with her family, and there was some annoying exposition. As someone who is part Irish, I can safely say that there were slightly poor and off-putting attempts at Irish accents from certain actors. It was slightly forced, and they slipped into their normal accents on a few occasions, it was only a small issue for me but something I still noticed. I would have also liked a little bit more background and development into how Sarah lives her life and her relationship with her brother and father, this would have helped the connection to her character be that little bit stronger. Finally, there was a couple of instances where unnecessary exposition was used. The film had already visually explained the twists to the plot and it was clear when watching what had happened, so when the characters went on to explain everything that the audience already knows it was just slightly irritating and something g I don't like within films.My final few positives would be the clever final third. The excellent final act, the rising of stakes and the satisfying character arcs. I thought when the film did fear street 1994: part 2 it was a fun and clever twist and set up the final act excellently. The final act was fun, entertaining, and intense, raising the stakes for the characters excellently, I genuinely cared about what happened to the characters, so the film did its job. It ended in a satisfying way where all the characters arcs were complete, and you really felt like the characters had made piece and were happy which was nice to see. Plus, the little end tease made me want more!Overall, Fear Street Part 3:1666 is a clever, intense, and fun final outing for this fantastic trilogy. It was well written and tied everything up perfectly, and for me was the strongest of the trilogy. I want more!Overall score 96/100.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

65,zac-04879,"A Surprisingly Ominous, Enjoyable and Fulfilling Ending",6,16 July 2021,"Netflix's disappointing trilogy closes with a surprisingly gripping tale, firmly marking Fear Street Part Three: 1666 as not only the best section of this R. L. Stine story, but the only watchable section. 1994 and 1978 were undeniably terrible. The critics were crazy whilst overrating them as gory but great slashers. Although 1666 mainly features bad acting and a satisfactory pace, what makes it more enjoyable than the first two parts is how solid and unexpectedly entertaining the whole story was.Since Fear Street 3 is the closing to the trilogy, you'll definitely be satisfied and the entire mystery ends up making a lot of sense. Honestly, why couldn't the other movies in the trilogy be just as moving and exciting as this? The climax is also a heck lot better than the climatic moments of Part One and Two. It finally gets to the reasoning of the mystery with a handful of elegant twists.The producers of this instalment knew exactly what they were aiming for, and they hit the target! It's great how Part Three was genuinely enjoyable, but it doesn't make up for the slowness of it, as well as the other flat movies. Those who have enjoyed the trilogy's other stories will adore this fascinating tale, but in conclusion, Fear Street is just a flat and pretty pointless trilogy on Netflix.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
66,parkerbcn,The worst of the trilogy,5,23 July 2021,"The last of this summer teenage horror trilogy feels a little exhausted and the worst of the bunch. Even when plot wise things kind of resolve, both the olden days setup (that again copies from all the witches and Salem's movies before and most obviously from ""The VVitch"") and the awkward second part (continuing on from the first movie) lacks real interest and energy.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
67,darkreignn,The best of the trilogy,8,21 October 2021,"After watching the complete ""Fear Street"" trilogy, I kind of regret giving the first film in the series a 6 out of 10 rating. While I stand by that score when it comes to taking the movie as an individual motion picture, now that I've watched all three films in close succession and have gained a complete 360-degree viewpoint as to the narrative, I am starting to enjoy the first film the more I think about it. That said, there's no denying that ""Fear Street: 1666"" is my favorite of the trilogy.Once again starring Kiana Madeira and Olivia Scott Welch (who are both fantastic in their roles), ""1666"" takes us back to the 17th century. Kiana plays Sarah Fier, the so-called witch who is named as the culprit and instigator of all the troubles that occur in the first two films. A closeted lesbian, Sarah shares a secret night of romance with Hannah, played by Olivia. However, when their rendezvous is seemingly witnessed by someone else, both girls start to panic as a blight comes over their town - the very day after their forbidden kiss occurred. Having been raised in a strict Christian village, they begin to wonder if God has cursed them for their ""sin."" But is something more sinister happening beneath the surface that no one yet knows?""Fear Street: 1666"" is by far the most interesting of the trilogy when it comes to plot progression and narrative structure. Because we've already spent two movies with most of the characters that have been introduced, there's no time wasted in setting up reasons for why we should like them - because we already do like them. Because of this, ""1666"" jumps right into its story, one that is full of forbidden love, mass hysteria and mob mentality, black magic, and deals with the devil. It's all very engaging, especially since the overarching story has already been introduced to us in the previous two movies, allowing us to simply sit back, enjoy, and let the truth of the matter be revealed to us.While I'd say ""1976"" takes the cake for slasher fun and creepy visuals, ""1666"" just has a certain charm about it that's unmistakeable. The story itself is already very riveting, especially if you find the religious hysteria of that time interesting. However, there's a certain air to this movie that elevates it above your average teen slasher. Perhaps it's the undeniable energy to the performances and scenes, or maybe it's the incredible score that enhances the intensity of the scares; whatever it is, it's almost infectious in its ability to engage and entertain.""Fear Street: 1666"" is a lot of fun, and in my opinion, the best of the trilogy. Each of these movies tell an individual story while also coming full circle to complete an overarching narrative. It's very clever, and makes for compelling teenage horror. If you're looking for a bit of creepy fun this October, you can't do a whole lot better than this.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

70,gabriel_sanchez,Good conclusion to the saga,8,28 September 2021,"If you got this far, congratulations. It is a long ride, but I enjoyed most of it. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it too.We are now in 1666 (of course.) Deena is reliving the last few days of known witch Sarah Fier. What will she find out that can save them in the present times? This is what kept me going throughout the full series.By now we know Shadyside is cursed and we want to discover how can the main characters stop the curse. This concept is nothing new if you compare it to the catalog of slasher movies: in the Halloween movie series, we eventually get to know about Michael Myers' curse, explaining how he can endure so much damage. In the Blair Witch series, same thing: seemingly witch cursed the land, you can't look her in the eyes...The plot following a known concept is not a bad thing. As I think, the horror genre is overdone. Actually, Hollywood in its entirety is overdone. We usually see different deviations of the same main concept, which is fine if done right.Did the Fear Street series do it right? I think so. It is not a masterpiece, but it is entertaining. I guess the only complaint I have is that the movie seems to not be serious at some parts. Hell, I don't see puny jokes in The Grudge (2004) or The Ring (2002). My point is I guess I prefer serious horror movies rather than comedic ones. Sorry, Ash Williams.The credit scene is just what I expected. I was not surprised.I'm happy to see the slasher and horror genre getting a new look again. Although I prefer a more serious tone, I liked this movie. It has its flaws, especially if you start to nitpick into every aspect of the year this movie takes place and whatnots, but it's fiction, so I don't care that much.I can't recommend this movie as a standalone because you need to watch the series. I recommend the movie and the series as a whole, but only to fans of the slasher and horror genre. I'd recommend this movie if was asked for a light-horror-themed recommendation. You won't get desperate, horrified, or deeply scared. You'll get some jumpscares, a lot of gore, and a cool storyline to follow.Hopefully, they don't do a Fear Street 4. 3 is the magic number, better stick to it.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
71,mr_bickle_the_pickle,The best out of the 3.,7,28 August 2021,This one I thought was the best of all 3. The story was the most interesting to me. And I liked the tone/atmosphere. And the characters (while maybe not all good people) were at least interesting. The one main downside to the 1666 part is that their accent work was a little spotty. I dont know if they believably felt like pilgrims. But despite me liking the 1666 part of course it has to go back to the 1994 to tie up everything. And it was back to the characters that I didnt like too much. And their weird convoluted plans. Like you dont need some Home Alone set up. There are easier ways to kill someone.,Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
72,dormesher-21565,Fear Street Part3 Review a solid conclusion,8,18 August 2021,Fear Street 3. A solid final chapter in this great horror trilogy that concludes this story in a great way.This is a satisfying ending but leaves you wanting more from this Horror Universe.The story in this one is great and its also split into 2 parts which I found interesting. The first part focuses on the origin of Sarah Fier and how the curse started which was an interesting story in my opinion and there's a great twist on who the real villain of the story is.The second part focuses on Deena and the others stopping the curse which Is my favourite part.The characters are great once again and it's interesting seeing how everything connects in the universe with the curse.I also like the idea of seeing the past through Deena's eyes its a great way to tell the story in my opinion.The Kills are great nothing as cool as the Bread Slicer kill from Part 1 but still great and The Pastor was a great villain and really creepy in my opinion.My only issues with the movie is they make it really obvious there is going to be a twist with the reveal of who is really behind the curse its a good twist just a little obvious.Also I'm not a fan of them copying story elements from the first installment the fact that Sarah is in a secret relationship like Deena just felt lazy to me it worked for the movie just felt a little lazy.I also felt like the acting was a little off mainly in the past part it just felt a little wooden and you could tell they were doing accents.However this was a great horror movie and satisfying ending to this Fear Street trilogy and I enjoyed this one just as much as Part 2.Verdict 8.5/10 a great movie and a solid conclusion to this trilogy.An interesting origin for Sarah Fier with a great twist in my opinion.Some predictable moments and wooden acting but nothing that ruins the movie just as good as Part 2 in my opinion.,Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

Why Irish accents anyway?I do love the story and the twist, which I found surprising. Also love the climax, I thought it was entertaining and there were a few sad scenes as well. I really feel sad for Sarah Fiers, it reminds me of the victims of the Salem witch trials.Anyway I recommend it.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
75,Mivas_Greece,"The best and more mature film of the trilogy! Darker and more serious, I wish the other two were like this one. Great Kiana once again! I wish for a sequel of this level!",7,24 July 2021,"Thriller / Horror Movie. The last part of the Fear Street Trilogy is probably the best and most mature than all. It does not have the action and the entertainment element of the 2nd, but it goes into darker style and occult, sacrifices, and possessions and becomes more horror film, while splatter subsides. Deena with her brother Josh of the first 1994 film, learning the events that happened in 1978 in the 2nd film, trying to find the body of Sara Fier in the forest. There, Deena as it finds it, sees a vision. She sees the life of Sara Fier through her eyes and everything that happened in 1666 when everything started and so the whole truth is revealed. This vision is also a large part of the film. Several of the protagonists play some roles in 1666 too, although different from 1994 and are thus, are more familiar to the watchers of the trilogy. Deena literally sees herself in the life of Sara Fier, since she plays in the role of Sara Fier too. Her brother, Goode's ancestor, her friends and many others of the first 2 films play in 1666 too. As in 1994, same in 1666 there is at the core of the story the love of Sara with the daughter of the priest, but without a strong immoral element such as the first film. Possession, summoning, sacrifices and all the dark and gray style of this part make the thriller more intense. With the revelation of truth, the last part of the film continues in 1994 that with the new elements the protagonists know what they have to do to stop the curse. They will once again fight against dead demonized people from other times/slaughters until they stop the curse. In 1994, two teenagers, Deena and her brother Josh, but two adults who were teenagers in the 2nd film in 1978, were combined in the 2nd film in 1978, survivor Ziggy and the current Sheriff Goode. The last and best film of Trilogy combines the protagonists of all films as their stories in a sequential timeline, where they do not seem to have changed so many things. Kiana is very good, really keeps all the trilogy in good level, of course, many of the other actors too, but I would like some more experienced and talented in the role of Sam. In the social part, beyond some propaganda, I will keep the words of Kiana in the role of Sara Fier as a movie quote, maybe the best lines of all the trilogy ""I don't fear the devil. I fear the neighbor who would accuse me. I fear the mother that would let her daughter hanged. I fear Union. They lead us like lambs to the slaughter and they expect us to just follow. They will see I am not lamb. "" Combined with a very good background music that fits perfectly with the moment.The 3rd film is the one that stands out from trilogy and raises it. I wish they were the other two mature like it. I would personally want to see a sequel and the last film leaves a small margin of one, as soon as it stays closer to the style of the 3rd and not in the style of the other two. Totally recommended to the fans of the genre!",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

77,FKDZ,Wrapped up nicely.,7,17 August 2021,"I have to say I enjoyed this trilogy or whatever you'd call it a lot more than I initially thought after watching part one. Whereas the first parts are definitely more faithful to slashers, here we get a final deep dive into the story.Once again, just as the other two parts, the directing, acting and sound is on par. It has some great shots but sometimes feels a bit over stylized.This movie is really about the main story, much less slasher. So it starts up much slower than the previous two. That said, it's okay because the setting its in, 1666 make's for a pretty amazing set piece and a small little world to immerse yourself in.Once you get to piece it all together, though, not as satisfying as I'd hoped. The finale comes and finishes the series pretty well. It's a great ending set piece and the tension is done well.In the end it actually wraps up nicely, tying up most loose ends though not all.1666 definitely feels the most different to the others. Being again, a little more mature. Part one feels off more and more now that I look back at it. It rarely took itself seriously versus part three.I'd recommend this. I think in general the entire trilogy felt a bit overextended though. It could've done with some trimming here and there. Especially in part one.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

I mean, first of all what was the deal with the supernatural once alived killers? It was said they wanted to attack who bled on the bones of the witch that's why they were after the girl who looked to be constipated all the time.. hannah... but and later on it's said and it also happened at the school that they would just ignore you to pursue their target.. but it's not true.. didn't they butcher everyone at the hospital too?Didn't tommy kill everybody at the camp? Didn't he himself kill cindy with like 10 axe blows to the chest at the end of movie 2? Wat... made no sense at all this logic but whatever..now let's talk about the actors.. my goodness, the lead kiana madeira is just awful and her character is a pain the ass completely unlikeable in the first one and ok in the third.. her brother is ok but the other two, lizzie was alright but Isaac was the best one in the first movie.. both got killed off and then just had cameos in the third.The trio of the second movie just made it real good. Sadie Sink. Ryan Simpkins and Emily Rudd. But unfortunately, ryan wasn't even used in the last one and sadie and rudd just had cameos in the third movie.. which was very sad and like another reviewer said, even tho the second movie was the best it pretty much became useless when goode was revealed to be the villain.. so the second became just one of the massacres with no real influence in the sequence of events and ziggy being the only survivor didn't really help much to develop the story.. since she just survived because nick had a crush on her.. and performed CPR to make her come back to life after being stabbed 4 times in the gut... yep that part made as much sense as the supernatural killers killing everybody and then just ignoring some.I think netflix should've used the female trio of movie 2 instead of madeira, the brother and constipated girl.. even that other girl who got knocked out in the bathroom by ziggy and then completely ignored by tommy and everybody else.. what was her name.. let me check.. Chiara aurelia and she played sheila the bully.. she was good and she's got 2 tv series that are intriguing.. just started cruel summer and she good in there huh.. anyway.. like i said, use the trio and even chiara and people would be not complaining about madeira's lack of acting skill and the boring lovers angleanyways, the ending with the book just lying there at the same spot that good died and the police had been to.... had it been hidden somewhere and someone getting to it would've made more sense but like i mentioned earlier.. trying to make sense wasn't one thing the movie cared about much.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

82,hoernkeem,"Fear Street part 3: 1666 (2021, Leigh Janiak) Third film in series provides a satisfactory finale",6,8 November 2021,"This is the third and final part of the 'Fear Street' trilogy directed and cowritten by Leigh Janiak. The films are based on the R. L. Stine book series of the same name. The three films were shot back to back to back with the intent of a theatrical release, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic they ended up being acquired by Netflix and were released on that platform one week apart in the summer of 2021. '1666' concludes the story from the first two films regarding the curse of Sarah Fier who is supposedly a witch that has haunted the community of Shadyside since her death in 1666.In the first film we were introduced to Deena and Sam as well as the curse of the Fier Witch who appears to possess people who then go on a killing spree. At the end of that film Sam is seemingly possessed by the witch. In part 2 we go back to another such killing spree at Camp Nightwing in the 1970's where they learn a bit more about the witch and the curse. At the end of that Deena winds up reuniting the witch's severed hand with her body and all of a sudden Deena is transported in a vision to precolonial America and is now inhabiting the body of Sarah Fier. The primary focus of the third film is the back story of Sarah Fier and the origin of this Shadyside curse. One night she and some other young people have a party in the woods. After that strange things start happening in the town as water goes bad, food spoils, and animals start acting strange. The town thinks they are cursed and fingers are pointed at the kids who partied in the moonlight cavorting and making deals with pagan forces emulating, to some degree, the real life Salem witch accusations. Sarah and her friend Hannah are specifically targeted due to being lesbians which back then was about one step away from laying with the Devil himself. Before being corralled and hung Sarah uncovers a secret about one of the town's residents that explains the curse that would emanate from her death all the way to modern day, and as the vision ends and Deena returns to herself she knows how to end the curse and restore some sanity to existence. This leads to a 1994 climax portion which wraps up the whole story.'1666' is a solid conclusion to this interesting, fun trilogy. This is a solidly decent film and series. I know that doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement, but this is one of those films that just exists right in the middle. You are not going to fall in love with it and clamor to see it again, however, you can watch the three films and be entertained. The films do contain a decent amount of representation which, more and more, is just par for the course these days, and also not that the film is bloodsoaked but when gore does come around they aren't afraid to lean in with an exclamation point. The ultimate climax may feel a bit predictable and easy, but once again that just feeds into the idea of this being solid and decent. This movie was directed well and had good overall feel and tone and if the story had taken more chances there could have been something more substantive here, but ultimately I feel that nice and alright are just fine for this conclusion and ultimately this trilogy.Eric's Grade: C+",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

85,theredsky,Fear Street Part Three: 1666 Review,6,21 July 2021,"I really loved the first half of this film but the second half fell flat on its face. The first half had some really great moments in it, it felt much more restrained with its themes and ideas which I really loved. The set design and costumes looked absolutely incredible and I loved the reincorporation of all of the main characters throughout the two other films. The horror moments hit a lot harder than in the other two because of how little it showed. I do like the excessive violence in these films but sometimes it felt a bit much and I liked how this felt more calm except for one scene which was absolutely brutal and terrifying. These sequence of the film was very well shot as well. The exploration of the beginning of the curse was very engaging and interesting. It did have a twist that I could see coming from a mile away but it still was a good and interesting twist on the story and what we have been told. Then the second half of the film starts. The second half goes back to the 1994 setting which I find really boring and it goes back to these uninteresting characters. It goes back to being blandly shot with very limited camera angles and movements. We see the conclusion to these stories and it's fine. Some of the logic behind it is very very confusing and the film's only explanation for it is ""curse broken"" which didn't do enough for some of these moments. The first half did so much right while the second half just fell back to the same quality as the first film. The only reason I like this film better than the other two is because of that first half. Definitely check at least the first half of this out but if you didn't like Part 1 then you might feel disappointed.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
86,el7,Bit of a subgenre twister.,7,16 July 2021,"In the tradition of movies like From Dusk 'til Dawn, Reincarnation, The Victim and The Boy, Fear Street: 1666 begins in one type of horror subgenre and ends in another, and it also plays its cards close to its bloody chest as to who is the bad guy and why.The movie starts with Deena having an intense vision that puts her directly in the shoes of infamous witch Sarah Fier. The 1666 cast is filled with actors who populated the first two movies, which is either a reference to their later counterpoints being descended from them, or possibly reincarnated from them, or maybe even both. The hints are subtle enough to leave it up to viewer interpretation. The movie proceeds as a period piece about witch scares, with the tropes that you would expect from that subgenre, including the bloody work of animal husbandry, communing with wild women in the woods, tripping on nature's bounty, and the kinds of interpersonal tensions that always exist in small isolated populations, especially when some of their members are neuro or otherwise divergent from the general populace. In this story, those tensions escalate rapidly after the town preacher goes cuckoo and kills all of the village's children. Sarah and her ladylove, Sam's ancestor Hannah, are quickly accused of witchcraft, but plot twist: they didn't do it, not even by accident. It turns out to be a predictable suspect who initiated the killer curse, but the specific individual responsible and the reason he did it turned out to be less predictable, at least to me. I was expecting the reason to be greed if it was a member of that family, but not that particular member. I was also starting to suspect that particular member might be motivated to resurrect someone, but I was not expecting him to be morally bankrupt. It's a nice twist on the idea that what looks on the surface like sincerity might have nothing behind that aw shucks smile, though. Real pillars of society are fully capable of that act, so I commend the movie for pointing that out, even though I kind of still feel like some drama was left on the table for that choice.So, two curses were made in 1666 not just one. Sarah is responsible for one of the curses, but not the one that threatens the lives of Shadysiders. Deena comes back to the present armed with this knowledge and gets a few people together to set up a showdown at the mall. Kudos on the soundtrack, this time they got the timing right. Best use of 'Come Out and Play' ever. The running, hiding and fighting is good, though not quite as spine tingling as in Part Two. Still, the ending is satisfying, including the mid-credits gotcha. If you've enjoyed the first two parts of the trilogy you will want to see the last part.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
87,witra_as,Original approach to seal this trilogy nicely,8,17 July 2021,Quite an original approach to seal this trilogy in best possible way. Fier's story completed all missing points in the curse itself. Some horror tropes were mixed nicely from different eras.

91,BijeshNagesh,Cream of the Fear-Crop,9,17 July 2021,"""Fear Street 1666"" is, hands down, the most gripping movie in the ""Fear Street"" trilogy. A brilliant period-horror aura practically haunted every frame during the first hour of this film, and it worked its own spellbinding magic on my senses.The rest of the movie was brilliant as well, with all plot-points neatly wrapped and tied with a bow.The performances were excellent to the point that at times I did not quite feel I was watching a movie that was based on a bunch of children's books. Everyone brought their A-game in the 'original colony' portions of the film - including the new characters - and none of them left any 'convenience' trails in their wake.Special shout-out to Ashley Zukerman (who played Solomon Goode), Lacy Camp (who played Grace Miller), and McCabe Slye (who played Mad Thomas).Kiana Madeira made every scene she was in worth watching. She enlivened the character who has been at the core of the ""Fear Street"" films story - and on the forefront of our minds - namely Sarah Fier. She plays out the real Sarah Fier's (played by Elizabeth Scopel) life and experiences leading up to her unjust witch-branding and consequent mob-driven hanging.Her role as Deena - in ""Fear Street 1994"", with story-connecting appearances in ""Fear Street 1978"" and finishing-up sequences in the second half of ""Fear Street 1666"" - was in itself amazing. But her performance during the 'memory recall' of Fier's past life takes the proverbial cake.In similar fashion, other 'familiar' cast members from the previous two films also stood in for unknown original colonists during the first hour of the movie. Deliberate nod to the real 'witch' - a 'deal with the Devil' passes down from bloodline to bloodline, apparently. I don't feel right sharing specifics about this particular spoiler in this otherwise detailed review. Those who know, know.The witch-hunting vibes (stigma, discrimination, bias) were meticulous in their perfection. The story twisted in the least expected of ways. I absolutely loved what I didn't see coming!""Fear Street"" Netflix seems to have found the perfect team of 'Production Design', 'Makeup', 'Music', 'Sound', 'VFX', 'Cinematography', and 'Costume Design' professionals. Each of these categories deserve some kind of awards-attention for the sheer detail they utilized across all three ""Fear street"" movies.The cast even got the accent right! Although it wasn't exactly the pronounced accent typically used during the original American colonist era, the actors/actresses managed to pull it off regardless. A YouTube video titled 'Declaration of Independence-18th Century North Virginian Accent' may provide some idea concerning the accent.Despite having relied on cinematic styles and themes (occultism, superstition, etc.) found in films like ""The Witch"" (2015), ""Midsommar"" (2019), and a handful of others... Despite incorporating a steady M. Night Shyamalan element... Despite everything, ""Fear Street Part Three - 1666"" (2021) somehow managed to come across as original and a period-horror piece in its own right.The second half of the movie (i.e., Part 2) beautifully connected all the events that unravelled in ""Fear Street 1978"" and ""Fear Street 1994"".Leigh Janiak is a name to watch. She did exceptional work directing the ""Fear Street"" trilogy. Leigh also wrote the script along with fellow screenplay writers Phil Graziadei and Kate Trefry. Much love to the attention and artistry they brought to this IP.Being a major R. L. Stine fan - particularly the ""Goosebumps"" series of books - I felt his writing style and storytelling technique were given new life through these cinematic 'reincarnations'.I humbly suggest that Netflix carry this very team over to potential future adaptations of the ""Goosebumps"" books by R. L. Stine.The ""Fear Street"" movie trilogy was not based on any particular book or three.A similar concept can be applied to the sheer wonder and brilliance contained in the ""Goosebumps"", ""Give Yourself Goosebumps"", and ""Goosebumps Series 2000"" books, all of them sourcing from the beautifully twisted mind of one of my all-time favourite authors, R. L. Stine.With ""Fear Street 1666"", Netflix lived up to the hype, delivered on the chills and thrills, and superbly wrapped up the trilogy in a splendid silken shawl of scintillating excellence.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
92,evilnigga,My brain hurts,1,7 September 2021,"First off what is that accent, its really bad I mean really really bad, it sounds nothing like an Irish accent and it hurts my brain. The plot doesn't even make sense and it keeps contradicting everything that has been established in the first two movies. I don't expect your movie to make sense but please can you be consistent. The lead actress is annoying as hell, watching her acting is a physical torture. She basically ruins every single scenes that she's in and that one scene where she gave a speech in the mall oh god please, is probably the worst. I will make sure that I won't be watching any of her future movies.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

94,matrixdukenukem,Triumphant!,9,16 July 2021,"Fear street: 1666 takes you to where it started. A small town of migrants, ignorants, hypocrites, superstitious folks do evil deed which is the real horror. I liked how, even though you know the outcome, writers take you on a ride. With a few twists here and you find yourself at the root of all this.I appreciated that they didn't try to over do the 1666 vibe. World building was small enough to be believable. At first the dialogues felt wierd but I got used to it. There is perhaps less gore this time but there are plenty of call backs to our favourite horror films. Everyone has acted well and the second half is more campy, fun like 90s horror.Background score, practical effects, make up, VFX is all great. Editing was little wierd and patchy in the end. There are couple of plots here that I wish was given more time to cook, but either they ran out of time or didn't know what to do with it. Thus resulting in unanswered questions and a very rushed end. But I can forgive it for the terrific first half.I will surely be watching out for this director's future works.

While the first two movies appeals for the classic slash movies, the third one seems to have no conection at all with that. It seems odd, even if it keeps the same characters of the first.

97,ryanpersaud-59415,People are WAY too hard on these movies.,6,2 September 2021,"The Good: 1666 is a tale of two movies. Literally. You have one fun, inventive, and legitimately tense mystery with a killer twist and then you have...1994 Part II. Unlike most people, I prefer 1666. It's a cute homage to The Witch and I think paralleling 1994 with the events of the past was a legitimately good idea. The best sequences are in this part: the ghastly church scene and the sneak around scene are standouts. Oh and that twist? That twist that recontextualizes the entire thing? Fantastic.I also thought it was a great idea to have the cast come back. I'm a fan of Madaira in these movies and I think she does a really good job here (yes, I'll get to it) all things considered. She's very expressive and it's easy to empathize with her.The Bad: The movie sorta declines when it goes back to 1994. I wished it was a 15-20 min finale and they wrapped it up that way. The way they actually end up doing it, we get this overlong extended climax that doesn't really do anything particularly special. There are COUNTLESS logical issues with this. From the killer's inconsistent rules, to the overly elaborate plan, to the convenient ending. Couldn't it just be a final showdown with Goode?The Ugly: OKAY FINE. The accents are awful. But who cares? Honestly? If everyone is speaking in the same British-Irish nonsense what does it matter? A bad accent only really matters if an actor sticks out like a sore thumb. Hence, the accents didn't really bug me that much. Also, let's stop pretending like any of us ACTUALLY know what 17th century settlers sounded like, okay?",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

This series start with a good note though its little bit a fast phase but still quite like with a different idea. In middle it's seems pretty average as the second one is totally predictable but the finale of this 3 part series is worth a watch. If you wanna know the exact story of a witch and it's seems so cool that how they used the same characters in the different story that just make you more excited. Love the performance of the cast and the bgm was too good with some amazing cgi works.If you wanna watch some different kind of horror with some unique twist and turns then this it enjoy the 3 part series and I'm sure you'll love it.

Parts 1 and 2 were meh, to be honest, but with 3's backstory and exposition everything comes under a new light! Freir, the witch the stories centre around, is cast in a new light, where instead of wanting to light the match that would burn the stake she's tied to, you are left wanting to lend her a hand. So wrongfully treated by those she loved you wish her revenge reached further than the feuding neighbouring towns! Aptly named Sunnyside and Shadyville, the seperation of Union which created them, has an underground labyrinth glimpsed in the first two parts, and fully explored in this one. It rounds the films off superbly, and casts previously empty characters as full blown heroes or villains, appropriately. Part 1 a slasher, Part 2 a possessed killer on the loose, and Part 3 a delve into darker themes and witchcraft that will make your skin crawl!Don't watch just one!And ignore Netflix's LGBTQ label as it is like saying Road Trip is Heterosexual!Now...do I go back and review parts 1 & 2 or just rate them and hope people read this review before giving up on them???",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
109,Blazehgehg,"An uneven movie, but a solid end overall.",8,2 August 2021,"There are some very interesting allegories to be seen here, and the way the movie plays with its ideas is fascinating. Particularly the LGBTQ's gravitation towards ""witch"" iconography, but that's a topic heavier and broader than a simple movie review.But 1666 itself? Well, thankfully, there's more to it than meets the eye. The first half of the movie is a bit dour and, well... dry. That's sort of on purpose, but that doesn't make it any less predictable, I suppose. It's important in the broader context of what the previous two movies are setting up, too, so I guess it's a necessary evil.Things pick up more in the second half, getting back to the fun, cheesy vibe from the very first movie (Fear Street Part One: 1994). It may not be as scary as Part Two, but it's definitely entertaining, and brings the trilogy to a deserved closure that left me feeling good about all three movies as a whole.It's not the greatest trilogy ever made. Parts of it, especially this movie in particular, start to feel a little pandering. Sometimes, it's okay to be pandered to, but there are turns this story takes that are clearly more inspired by modern viewpoints, to where I kind of forgot parts of this trilogy were supposed to be a tribute to 1994. It felt way more distinctly 2021 instead, leading to some momentary -- but genuine -- confusion when it began to reference concepts specific to the 90's.Regardless, stepping back and looking at the big picture, of the Fear Street trilogy as a whole, I found it to be enjoyable, and I'm curious to see if they have anything planned next. Though this movie closes the book on this particular Fear Street story, there's clearly enough room for them to explore more in the future.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

112,tiffanytallent1981,I Enjoyed it Almost as Much as 1978,8,21 July 2021,"If you haven't seen the first two parts of the trilogy, I recommend you do that before watching the last part. It'll help everything make more sense!! This final installment starts where the second part left off, with Deena burying Sarah Fier's hand with the rest of her bones. Sarah is the witch causing all of the murders, so this should stop it. Right? Nope. As Deena is burying the bones, her nose starts to bleed, like anyone who touches the remains. The blood lands on the bones and Deena has a flashback to 1666. The entire first hour of the movie is set in the past, when Sarah Fier was alive. The actors from the first two parts are also characters in the past. Deena represents Sarah Fier and sees everything through her eyes. She and another girl are found guilty of witchcraft and condemned to hang. But it turns out that they were only a scapegoat for the real person who summoned the devil: an ancestor of someone Deena knows in the present. I'll let this be a surprise for you. Apparently though, there is a long line of a certain family who has kept this devil worship alive throughout the centuries. Deena learns who it is in the present, from who the ancestor is in the past.Now the movie goes back to 1994, with Deena still at Sarah's bones. She goes back to C. Berman/ Ziggy's house to tell her and Josh what they have to do to stop the murders. They have to KILL the present day member of the original demon summoner. They come up with an elaborate and risky plan that barely works, but is still very entertaining. I definitely had a few laughs throughout.It was strange for the first half of the movie to be so serious and scary. Then the second half was kind of comical in a way. But I still think it worked. I know this third installment wasn't liked as much as the second by many people. I think it's all about what type of horror franchise you prefer. Part one (1994) gave me Scream vibes. Part two (1978) was similar to Friday the 13th. And part three (1666) was like The Witch and The Crucible. So it makes sense that the first part (1994) was more campy. And that the second half of 1666 was also. It also makes sense that the 1978 and first half of 1666 were more serious and dark, given which movies they are similar to. I enjoyed the third installment (1666) almost as much as the second (1978). However, 1978 could be a standalone movie, which makes it my favorite.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

I loved the first half of this movie. It hooked me from the beginning with learning the origins of the curse and all the events that went along with it and it was just perfect.Horror is just as good the previous two. Very entertaining.Characters were all intriguing in this one which was really helped by the fact that all the characters I didn't like from the previous two parts were no longer involved and it made the characters more appealing overall.Mixed:
I'm going to put this in the mixed because it could just be me not fully understanding but it still bothers me. How is Sam alive why is it that all the other killers and possessed people died at the end except Sam I don't comprehend that aspectBad:
I felt like I was watching two movies that were both an hour long and it made for a awkward watch. The first half I loved with all the mythology and the origins and I also really enjoyed the back half with the final showdown and the rap up.

Still not properly explained, though, serial killers was not the only problem Shadyside had.The 1666 section, ignoring the accents and line delivery, was by far the best of anything the trilogy had to offer. It was actually good. The 1994 half, not so much, but at least the plot was finally going forward.I don't understand how that person in the end was revealed to the community to be a serial killer. What evidence did they find? He didn't even kill anyone personally, he barely did anything, just read from a book.This may count as spoilers. I found that the person that cut a deal with the devil was completely ripped off, they should have their lawyer present next time.

This perfect film to round out this trilogy.This film is more of a slow burn than the previous two films, but once actions are put in place, the pace picks up. The core cast really pulls you into the story and bring resolve to the Shadyside curse. There are nice call backs to the previous films and the creativity in the third act made it enjoyable.This is not a perfect film, with some lighting issues being my main complaint. At times, the period accurate accents miss their mark and a lack of consistency amongst background actors can take you out of it if you dwell on it.The director, Leigh Janiak, and the team behind this film and the entire trilogy knocked it out of the park. Any fan of horror, or casual fans at that, should watch this film.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
125,jseynopsis,Brilliant Finale!,9,30 July 2021,"I really enjoyed the trilogy. Finally the truth is out about the witch, no twisted surprise here but story is decently good. The 2nd half of it was like watching a horror version of ""Home Alone"". Honestly, I don't get the zero or 1 star ratings. I believe everyone has their own preference but it doesn't make any sense for movies like this to be rated zero or 1, furthermore packaged with hateful comments.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
126,DrCCat,Missing from the budget - lights,5,11 August 2021,"Like the 2nd movie the scenes were so dark I could only guess at what happened because of the squishy blood sounds that were made when someone got killed. There was zero tension because of the over acting. The jump scares failed to land because things were so dark.I think they were going for an American Horror Story atmosphere, but it felt so rushed. It would have worked better as a TV show & not ran through the same scenes.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

Just a thought.Part III was a good ending, or beginning as it may be... You can't expect a Boxing Day release type feature filmed by the late great Wes Craven, just enjoy this trilogy for what it is. The storey is fine, and you can't always figure out what's happening which is good, or why.You gotta remember that straight to Netflix is the equivalent quite often to the old straight to video, B-grade as it were...

129,willcrabbe,Disappointing after the improvement of Part 2,4,16 July 2021,"After Part 2 I had some hope that this trilogy could be salvaged. Unfortunately, Fear Street Part Three: 1666 just serves to hammer the final nail in the coffin of the series.The period setting felt like a mix of The Crucible and The Witch but didn't succeed at the style of either. The accents were awful as well. At least the production values were better than other period horror pieces I've seen recently (*cough* The Reckoning *cough*).Mercifully, the obscene number of obnoxious needle drops is dramatically reduced from the previous two instalments (there aren't many bangers released during the 17th century to be fair), but they still manage to squeeze them in where they can.The film does manage to link together everything into a full overarching narrative, but I can't help but feel that Part 2 was almost pointless to the overall story. This is quite ironic given that I thought the second part was the strongest part and the high point of the trilogy, but ultimately it'll just serve as a mildly entertaining interlude within a highly mediocre set of films. I wouldn't waste my time watching this trilogy, I didn't even really get much entertainment out of it and it felt like one giant slog.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
130,adotson-98233,"The weakest entry, but still was a good finale.",7,17 July 2021,"""Fear Street Part 3: 1666"" is the most different out of all the movies. It's got a better sense of it's time period and takes a bit more of a serious approach. What I liked about this third installment was the setting. They did a great job making you feel like you were in 1666. The acting as well was also very good, and there were a lot of very disturbing images in the first hour. The last 50 minutes also were very entertaining, and I thought it ended very well.However I did find this to be in my OPINION the weakest of the three films. What I didn't like was that while the first hour sets up something interesting, it's kinda dragged on and can get a little boring. Also the choice to have previous characters play these old characters were a little confusing to me. It worked for Deena, but I felt like they should've casted different people to play the roles. Also after the first hour it's shifts back to 1994 and that shift really kinda made the movie a bit more messy, cause it starts off as a serous film, then the last 45 minutes turns back into fun slasher.While ""Fear Street Part 3: 1666"" suffers from some pacing, and casting choices, it's still a pretty good final movie. The last 45 minutes did make me like the movie more than I would've originally.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
131,Fortressofdoors,Amateurish series,5,17 July 2021,"Typical Netflix dreck they have been producing for some time now. Part 1 was bad. Part 2 was better, but nothing great. Part 3 is just as bad as 1 if not worse. There are more ways to show that your film is set in a certain time than stuffing period music down your throat every 6 minutes. Thankfully part 3 couldnt use it as a crutch, at least not as much. Filled with characters you couldn't care less about, CG blood and stories that keep you watching just because you have already invested so much time in, that you may as well finish it. These are good examples of why Netflix is becoming the last place I end up visiting to find something to watch. I think this may have been the final nail in the coffin for me. I'm sure by this point they are relieved that they made the choice of muting their customer's voices and did away with the user reviews and star ratings.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

This one is for adults in my opinion.The entire series acts like only LGBT+ people are discriminated against. This one especially missed the mark. There's no reference to what black people were going through in 1666. Slavery was bad. Talk about it, since the series is about wanting freedom to be yourself.The entire series overall kind of misses the mark on diversity. They have two black characters, Henry and Martin, but Martin really gets the short end of the stick development wise. Martin was great in movie 1, but they don't have him at all in movie 2, although for myself I picked out a camp counsellor that could have been his younger self in 1978. Martin is also mostly just kind of a goofy guy. Henry, the other black character is more developed, but he's presented as safer, since he's a nerd, and must be adopted or a half sibling, since his sister is either mixed or white.There are some good moments for the back characters though. There's a nice bond between Martin and Henry at times throughout the first and third film. If there's a fourth film I would like to see both characters develop much more, and for their struggles with racism to be discussed. Especially since both towns appear to be majority white.It was a fun watch, but it needed more.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
136,ryanwesthamfan,A Good Conclusion To The Trilogy,7,3 August 2021,Fear Street 1666 is the final film in the Fear Street Netflix trilogy. As we learn about the origins of Sarah FeirThe Good- I like how it was executed in the first half by using the cast of the first film. There is definitely a pay off from the original film in this film. Sarah Feir was a character I was expecting a lot from and I got what I wanted from her. This film gives you the conclusion that you want from the finale of this trilogyThe Bad- The way the story played out you can probably predict what happens. Some of the lines of dialogue is cheesy as you expect from these films. Some of the actors didn't quite nail the accents that you expect from a film set in the year 1666.Overall Thoughts- The final film in this trilogy gives you the conclusion you want while also having a few terrifying scares along the way. Overall I'm going to give 'Fear Street: 1666' a 7/10.,Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

140,ulex_stovetop,The best of the 3!!!,7,4 August 2021,"'1666' is by far the best of the Fear Street trilogy, apparently inspired by the works of R. L. Stein??!?!??!!? The flashback portion in the first half is by far the most intense of the franchise. Something about the setting lends to a unique feeling of discomfort for one trapped in a setting where everyone is illogical has nowhere to turn. My only complaint is the accent can be a little hard to understand from time to time, but turn on subtitles and you'll be fine.Things get a little more generic in the second half, but still carries the momentum of what comes before. The twist, while not wholly original, is very impactful and kept me fully engrossed until the last second. It does however leave me with one important question.WARNING: The next paragraph DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS
So the finale of this film concludes with Deena killing the Sherif to end the curse started by Soloman. It is stated that one person from every generation has selected a person from Shadeyside to sacrifice to the Devil. It is mentioned that Sherif's brother has kids so couldn't one of them continue Soloman's curse? I suppose the idea is it has to be a direct line of father-to-son, but perhaps this could be explored in further films.Overall, this is an amazing final act to one of the best LGBTQA+ stories I've seen in a long while. Although I am intrigued by the proposition of this becoming a new horror universe, I'd be satisfied with it all ending right here.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

142,srutimisra,A perfect end of this triology,8,17 July 2021,"Movie: Fear Street 1666
Part: Three""Fear Street 1666"" is an American supernatural horror film which was released yesterday on Netflix. It is the third and the final part of ""Fear Street"" trilogy. The triology is based on R. L. Stine's famous teen horror """"Fear Street"" book series.From the previous two parts of the movie, we got the idea that there's a curse on a town named Shadyside and people are constantly dying because of it. In this part, the root behind the curse will be discovered. We will get to know why do the people of Shadyside become victims for centuries? Is there any other way to end the curse or it'll never end?First of all, the storyline and the detailings are really impressive. While the other parts of this triology are purely slasher flicks, this movie is mainly based on witchcraft. The plot twist is very satisfying. It's an engaging and a must watch movie.If you haven't seen this movie yet, do watch the ""Fear Street"" triology in this weekend.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
143,laurenjfree,Disappointing,5,17 July 2021,"What's that quote from The Good the Bad and the Ugly? ""If you need to shoot, shoot. Don't wait"" (or something like that). Clearly these characters aren't a fan of Sergio Leone, because they continuously passed up the opportunity to kill the antagonist. Instead, they chose to create some elaborate plan that only succeeded in risking everyone's life and making things more complicated.The trilogy had so much potential. Sadly, they didn't know their audience and we're afraid to take any risks. When you're making a movie about a satanic curse and homicidal zombies, your allowed to not be so....

144,courtneypedersen,Amazing Conclusion,10,18 July 2021,"I just finished watching the conclusion of the Fear Street trilogy and I can honestly say the third was the best! It's rare to find a trilogy that gets better with each movie and Fear Street is definitely in that category for me. About halfway through, a surprise twist happened and I actually had to pause the movie to wrap my head around the implications.I really enjoyed the 1666 part of the movie and when it went back to 1994, I was a little disappointed but also understood they had done everything they could with 1666. They did a phenomenal job of tying all of the elements back together and I really enjoyed how they used the same actors in the 1666 part that they used in 1994 and 1978.There were some reviews that said the accents in 1666 were horrible but I didn't pay them any attention because I was more focused on the story. There were also some reviews that say this movie was nothing but a vehicle for lesbian drama and man-hating rhetoric but I don't feel that way. The lesbian aspect of it makes more sense to me after watching the third part and I don't see how the movies were man-hating when females and males were equally good and bad. However, some people will find any reason to hate on something and that's their choice.If you like horror movies and want to see a truly unique horror trilogy, I highly recommend Fear Street.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

156,thecanadian-23317,"Not a home run, but still a solid end to the trilogy",8,18 July 2021,"It's a really interesting conclusion to the trilogy, and I liked how the story played out. However, the movie definitely suffers from some logic issues.I won't get into spoilers, but let's just say that you definitely to suspend your disbelief in order for the latter half of this movie to work. Unless I missed something (which is entirely possible, in which case ignore this point), the movie seems to be a bit loose with the ""rules"" for the trilogy. Part 1 seems to establish ""this is how it works"", but Part 3 seems to change it to ""well... it also sort of works like this too"". It also has a very neat and tidy ending and I just don't understand how that could logically happen, but I can't get into the specifics without getting into spoilers. The other issue is with the first half of the movie, the Irish accents are pretty bad. Some of the actors have passable accents, but for the most part they're pretty cringe worthy.Still, if you can set aside the accents and logic issues, I still found it to be a really fun movie and a solid end to the trilogy. Part 2 is still definitely the strongest of the 3, but I liked this one better than Part 1. I also really enjoyed the score for this movie. Since so much of it takes place in 1666, they didn't have to fill up the soundtrack with songs from its era, and the orchestral score is really quite excellent.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
157,Naive-fox,"A fitting end except for... well, the ending",4,17 July 2021,"'Fear Street: 1994' was a stylish and promising horror thriller. Sure, it wasn't all that 'thrilling' at all and it was hard to care for the cheesy characters without any background at all, but its neon 90s vibes and a decent production made it stand out and hope for an improvement in what we already knew would be a horror trilogy. And that improvement came immediately in the second part, if not by much. The fact that it was a gorier, more solid 'slasher' as we understand the genre and that the links between the story and the characters and events we already knew from part one made us care more for them made it a more pleasurable run. It still lacked something big, the most important part of a story, specially if you plan on telling a story through three whole full feature length films. It lacked a meaning, an explanation, a purpose. Fortunately the cliffhanger from 'Fear Street: 1978' made it pretty clear that's what we were getting in the last instalment.And that's where the reviewed title comes in, with a really conservative take on the origin of it all. The first half of 'Fear street: 1666' is nothing but your mainstream17th century witchcraft tale with a little twist to spice it up a little. The gore and violence are quite tame, the action is almost lacking and the atmosphere and tension, while present, are miles away from similar titles like 'The VVitch'. It still provides a satisfying and effective explanation for the mistery surrounding Shadyside and having the cast from the original two films playing the characters from this origin story works really well for making us care more for them and display some interesting similarities with the relations the characters plaid by those actors have in the future. But explaining the reason behind Shadyside's curse isn't enough, we need to put an end to it.And that's where the movie derails. Back to the future, back to 1994 and immediately the shift in the visuals and the tone is so abrupt it instantly takes you out of the movie. The story reintroduces some really goofy characters for comedy relief, the vibe goes back to the first film with its overly preteen 'Goosebumps' thriller like atmosphere and the soundtrack (while undeniably good, gotta approve seeing 'Pixies' getting some love) is one again so overly present it doesn't help at all to soften the abrupt transition. The only welcome change is the return to the stylish neony cinematography, and even that is just a matter of personal taste. So after some poorly executed climax battle scenes where the alleged driving force for the mindless killers to chase one victim or another seems to change freely to accommodate the script we get a bleak -although still fitting- happy resolution that feels too unsatisfying after over 5 hours of run through the whole thing. Impossible to let this end without a cheesy after-credits -or is it inter-credits- cliffhanger scene where an unknown character gets his/her hands on a vital plot item that despite being evidence for a multiple homicide lies marked but unguarded in the middle of a cave -good job police!-. Homage to the classic 90s' slashers or an open door to a follow-up? Surely very few are hoping for the latter.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

In the flashbacks it is so diverse that the historical accuracy of the time could be argued, which is to say, VERY diverse. Racially, gender identity wise, sexuality wise, socioeconomic, religion, you name it. From what I can tell (and have heard from others), the diversity is well represented.Second, plot. I love this movie. I love the flashback and I think it was highly necessary. I liked the ending, but I have some moral reservations with it. (That's not bad. That's just how I think.)Finally, there are so many layers. I have so many aspects I'm going to look into. There's allusion, metaphors, and probably more that I'm forgetting.

Decent acting with a good plot and a good soundtrack.Edit: I see a lot of people don't agree with my opinions. For the record, I never said it was bad, if I thought that I wouldn't of given it a 7This movie is really broken into 2 parts. The first half being 1666 and the 2nd being ""1994 Part 2"" as they call it. Because of this, you are basically watching 2 separate movies in one, similar to how Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom felt. The issue is that the 1666 half is mostly boring so getting to the 1994 half, which is good, might be difficult to do.The 1666 half starts off interesting but confusion doesn't take long to settle in. With the way Part 2 ends you assume that Deena is stuck in Sarah's body. This isn't the case. She is really just watching Sarah's story unfold. The thing is, they never tell you that and instead leave you to figure it out yourself. You keep waiting for things to happen but they never do. Also why do so many of the actors from Parts 1 and 2 play villagers? My assumption is that they are the characters ancestors, but you never really get a true answer. The confusion of all this takes you away from the story and causes you to lose interest.My biggest issue with the 1666 half is that it's just boring. We are watching a story unfold that we have been told about already in Parts 1 and 2 so we know what's going to happen and as a result there is nothing interesting about the 1666 plot. Once the 1666 half reaches its climax though, things do get very interesting and the movie draws you back in. However, getting to that point could be a struggle for some.After the 1666 half, we get 1994 Part 2. This second half of the movie is way better than the first half. You get thrown right into the action with a great plot twist that you won't see coming. After that, it gets going very quickly into the finale which was executed well. Everything they needed to do in the finale they did and it leaves you with a satisfied feeling.The acting was good in this movie as well, better than the acting in Part 1 for sure. There were some lines that could've been better but it is never bad enough for me to complain about. I also enjoyed the soundtrack and personally think it's the best soundtrack out of the 3 movies.I did have 2 big issues.1. A lot of the movie could've been easily avoided. Certain decisions and things characters do in the 1666 half are so dumb its infuriating. I won't spoil anything major, but basically the entire Shadyside curse could've been avoided if Sarah just told the truth.2. The movie is way too dark. The 1666 half takes place at night and I could hardly see anything. A few times it was so dark I literally couldn't tell what was going on.Overall, not the best in the trilogy and not the worst either.

163,mmyilmazyurt,Satisfying conclusion.,5,16 July 2021,"One of the good things about the trilogy and its finale is it did tied up loose ends, and gave a story of over a hundreds years of terror.Only if Part1: 1994 did not started poorly the trilogy would have been so much more decent as 1978 and 1666 really did good performances with their settings and much more better acting.As I am not a native speaker, I can not make a comment on accents in 1666 but I found them tolerable at least. Even if, it is a problem, its setting, make up, costumes and harsh tone makes up for it in my opinion.If it were the whole of part 3, I would have give it 8 or 7 out of 10 in a heartbeat.Yet, again we go back in time 1994 and its just does not cut it. It does not have the emotional richness of 1978 or 1666. Ashley Zuckerman and Gillian Jacobs' characters see each other for the first time in years, after all that is occurred, I would have wanted to see an actual confrontation instead of just what we've seen.Or when Benjamin Flores' character says he needs to save his sister. This could have been a moment of bond between two characters since former lost hers in 78.There were some clever techniques at the mall scene, like paint-blood, trap strategy or etc. But it does not have the actual spirit, balance in tone that will give its characters more dimensions.Note: Some ""Reviewers"" are giving bunch of 1's without any constructive criticism and nonsense reasons. This movies are nowhere near ""1"".I gave 5, 6 and again 5 respectively for 1994, 1978 and 1666 but it is just my own rating perception and I could see people giving much more higher ratings to this movies but not less.So please stop spamming this section or any other on this site with giving 1's to these projects without any constructive criticism.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
164,rminicoop,"Not bad, but not good",5,25 July 2021,"In my opinion, 1666 is the weakest of the trilogy.Positives:
Costuming, set design, and casting of supporting roles were are all well done. The score was creepy enough and the best of the three.Negatives:

The 17th century setting was a breath of fresh air to me, and I loved that they were finally exploring the backstory of the witch. The cast was doing a really good job and there were a lot of great scary scenes. Then the second have takes a dive. The writing begins to plummit, characters start making stupid decisions, and the suspense carried from the first act starts to sizzle out. This film probably had the weakest climax out of all three films, and since this is the last one, thats not a good thing. I enjoyed the first half, didn't like the second.

170,Kerry_Bradford,A very lackluster finale,6,8 October 2021,"Fear Street: 1666 is the weakest installment of the Fear Street saga. I do love the old timey setting however, it's instantly refined as the characters from part 1 are the main characters here. I get that Ruby is basically seeing first hand what happened to Sarah Fier but it could have been executed much better. They should have had a whole new cast much like they did in Fear Street 1978 and possibly had glimpses of Ruby in that story watching things unfold. It would have been immensely more enjoyable and not have taken me out of the movie so quickly.Once they are back in the present, I didn't like the inclusion of the comedic character as he threw off the overrall vibes of the situation at hand. The way everything wraps up is also a bit messy and extremely confusing. Again, this is my least favorite of the trilogy but I still do appreciate the effort that went into making the three movies in general and connecting them all together pretty well.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

172,MadMark96,Disappointing end to a great buildup.,5,22 July 2021,"I very much enjoyed parts 1&2. Classic old school slasher films with a very intriguing over arching story. Great soundtrack, Fun characters the whole 9 yards. But the last entry to wrap everything up was just incredibly dumb all because they felt the need for there to be some big twist that actually just makes the story really really dumb. To go over the positives, there was no quality drop the story and everything up until the twist was really solid and all the performances were great. The scene where they had all the killers fight each other was extremely awesome. But the twist is what ruins the movie for me. When she goes back in time and relives Sarah's memories and it shows Sarah clearly has a chance to reveal Salomon is the one who really conjured the evil in the town... why didn't she just tell them to look under his house? He was right there with her it wasn't like he would've had time to cover it up. She could've lived happily with her girlfriend, could've saved the town 300 years of pain and suffering but instead CHOSE the option where the villain got to live, his family got to flourish, and all she got was hung and tortured by evil for the next 300 years. If the whole point was to ""expose the truth"" why didn't she just tell him to look under his house and she could've saved herself? There was no point to any of that LMFAO. Not to mention Sarah is supposed to be represented as some ""misrepresented"" character who actually didn't do anything and was wrongfully accused meanwhile she was gonna use the book to do... exactly what Salomon did with it. Extremely weak ending and so disappointing for a series that started off so strong.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

Better overall characters and a more intriguing plot and setting helped me forget if accents slipped (they did-a lot) or if the dialogue included some anachronisms. The second half doesn't quite live up to the first, but it does a decent enough job tying things together and closing out the trilogy.

Both 1978 and 1666 could have fit into a 30 min flashback instead of 2 films. It would have been better as a TV show. Also what happened to Dinas stab wound witch Sam gave to her at the end of 1978?!?!? It magically dissappeard.

For what it's worth,it does much better than other SLASHERS but I felt I could have been more interested if it was different actors.

I just don't feel the chemistry from these two actresses. I was also confused as to why, after Sam/Hannah had freaked out about somebody seeing them kiss in the dark woods, she would kiss Deena/Sarah in the middle of the town & illuminated by the fire.I hope they do a movie or series on the murderous kid with the baseball bat though.

Others have mentioned the terrible Irish accents all-around which takes away from the seriousness.The 2nd half flashes forward to 1994, we now know Officer Goode is responsible for the witchery, being handed the power generation to generation since the 1600s.And ok....what was the point of Pt 2 1978? To show he had a soft side? Getting back to 1666(1994), it really takes suspending belief. First we have the Scooby Doo gang saving the day, but how did they make it seem Goode was the serial killer? I'm pretty sure there needed to be hard evidence, which we never see.The ending during the credits leads us to believe there might be another installment to come.

This one for me sits in the middle. I love my horror films, and each film has ups and downs. The first film was in my opinion a horror version of Riverdale, where as part two had a nice feel of a classic 80's horror film like Friday the 13th. As for part three I was happy to final hit the conclusion of the three part film series. They hit the typical horror/slasher film Tropes in all three films and they did not lack on the kill scenes. I would definitely say if you are interest in this 3 part movie series to check it out and you definitely has to watch all three to actually get the full story. I will also say that each film does a good job at picking up where the other one left off. Just be aware that Part 2 is the better of all three and that yes 6 hours in total is a lot but at the end of the day a decent horror film that is harder and harder to come by these day.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
185,Tibbletoad,the mix of sub genre's doesnt hit it off.,7,17 July 2021,"This closing piece of the Trilogy is really predictable. Don't get me wrong it is not a bad movie, it is quite a fun movie but it also is not a good movie either. Its a fun one.I loved the second movie and had some hopes that this one would be more like that one as well, as there the sub genre of horror kind off blended well between the "" haunting"" and "" Slasher"" Sub genre's mixed with a more modern type of horror.This 3rd movie is more like the crucible and the vvitch but just doesn't capture it well enough.The trick of having most of the same characters play different "" ancestral"" roles in the 3rd movie was a neat enough trick, that also kind of felt like it was done for budget reasons, but hey budget reasons can lead to great ideas.Sadly ideas is where this movie lacks in. Like i said i liked the 2nd movie the most, but in the larger scheme it just felt like a misdirection, just a vehicle to make people go "" oh i remember that from the 2nd movie"" you could have cut out all the summer camp stuff, and put the before and after within the other 2 movies and there would have not been lost much, and that is a sad thing as fear street part 2 1978 is a hell of a lot of fun just doesn't add much besides some unanswered questions.The biggest problem is the twists, they are not that clever,oh no the sheriff named Goode is a bad guy. The witch Sarah Fier is not bad at all, but a good person sacrificing her self.The plot holes the "" revelation"" opens up kinda sucked me out of it,why did the sheriff save Ziggy? Sure i think he really loved her, but why would he still go evil. And why was it him and not his brother also ? I mean ...they could have done an excellent fake out, with he sheriff not being bad all together but unable to resist the evil of the family.But nope as soon as the MC finds out the witch is not a witch but innocents the sheriff turns around and goes "" Lets go full on evil now. He is almost mustache twirling evil.So many story ideas, not used with a conclusion of the family going "" Oh no we never knew he was a serial killer"". The movie doesnt issue many rules as to the devil thing, sure the ancestor of the goode family says that its a couple of kills every couple of years, but we don't know if that is a minimum requirement, why not just, go to the altar do the thing, and say a name ?Once again i might be ripping on the movie, but it is not a bad movie, it is a fun movie that will not change much, or be like a high point in sub genre blending movies,the acting was not that bad (although the accents of the 1666 time kinda were, but it was clear they all had accent coaches working with them.I still give it a 7 out of ten as it felt like a fun watch, just bogged down a little by much to "" save"" story telling.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

And there's even actions scenes between the Killers towards the end that really scratch that slasher itch just a tad.Even though the first half seems a bit boring at times, the way this movie just kind of adds to the lore and ties up loose ends was a brilliant form of story-telling and is a satisfying ending to the Journey..Or is it ?",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

The storyline that continues to go nowhere from the first film adds nothing really here of any interest. Tbh you could have started at 2, finished at 2 and got the best this trilogy had to offer.Lots more boring talking and walking, teen relationship dramas that seem to just drag on and on despite supposedly being side plots? Not a lot actually happens here. You set everything up already, part 2 was an okay slasher movie, but no we're back to the really mundane and ridiculous first movie 'period style'. It doesn't even stay in it's suppose time zone.The promise was we'd go to 1666, meet 'the witch' and learn the truth. Why would you set that up and then not make it? It's baffling to me.As I say Could have been good, could actually have been the best with all the lore and such established, but went down hill as soon as you find they're just reusing characters from the first two films playing literally themselves with different names and costumes. So ridiculous.So what did we learn at the end of this? This trilogy should have just been a single 2 hour film... or given to a different director/writing team. Re-cut the first movie down as much as possible to explain the witch, keep the second movie, and ... I dunno.... Reshoot some of the scenes from the third movie with different actors and insert as flashbacks and you'd have a good slasher movie with an interesting lore.You'd end up with about the same amount of action they managed to eek out across three whole movies that were really just hours of characters talking about anything but the main storyline for the most part.I saw it, I don't recommend you watch it really - it's not offensive, just a waste of time - and I hope they stop here before they end up with same characters in caveman times talking for 2 hours about cave furnishings.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

It's a breathtaking, horrifying, beautiful, tragic, and innovative hour-long period queer horror drama, and they pulled it off in spades.The mythology-building continues to be excellent and I couldn't help but appreciate the other two films even more knowing what I know now.And they just NAIL the ending.

The first was bad, the second was ok, but this one was completely atrocious. The first half was flat out boring and could've been summed up in 20 min. All of the characters from the first movie were so unlikeable so it's hard to be happy for them when I've hated them this whole time. I understood the ""plot twist"" the writers were trying to do but I really didn't want Nick to be the villain. The villain was more likable than the main character in all honesty. The second movie really plays no part in the curse, which almost renders it pointless, but it was the best of all three. Overall, these movies are very confused about the story they are trying to get to/ convey and don't know what the strengths and weaknesses are. If you are going to watch this trilogy- don't.

Then the good guy suddenly becomes the bad guy because his ancestors were bad... Guess they aren't any good people on sunnysideBut don't worry, it's better than the Death Note live actionThe devil was chilling. Then some guy made a deal with the devil via a book, poorly guarded by a woman in the woods (unless she wasn't guarding it but actually the witch). Anyways, so the guy gives the devil names and the devil make those names into serial killers. Great, so why does the devil care what lives the serial killers take??? Why were the serial killers going after specific people connected to Sarah Fray. Why does the devil care who blood he gets? Sarah's blood was never sacrificed to the devil. And if the devil can reanimate the corpses, why does the guy not give the devil the names of deceaseNow how does the new recruited guy knows what is he fighting when the possessed girl is tied up? Why is the MC giving a speech?? So unnecessaryNon of the places they go to never seem to have security guards there, conveniently. Why is the MC's blood being used now? Of course the mc has the final showdown with the villain. Even when there is someone right there with a long history with the villain.It would've made more sense if the killers went after where had the most blood cause sam runs after the mc anyways. Why did possessed Sam run after the mc instead of jumping the killers right next to her?So the mall didn't have security cameras? So they didn't find the footprints leading to the stabbed sheriff? No one gets jailed for pre-meditated murder? Sam doesn't sacrifice herself, like Sarah did 300 hundreds years ago? I guess notEveryone lives happily ever after? YupThe movie felt very white male privilege bad, woman good. But nobody takes any accountability. Annoying characters. They didn't show the father once. They didn't seem like they were affected by everything happened, gay couple went on a date and brother seems unaffected by the girl he crushed on.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

I throughly enjoyed watching it.I was excited to watch the 3rd....for the first half I was wondering if I was watching Drunk History...I watched five minutes of it. Then played on my phone, it was dull and I wasn't really invested.The second half.....I just assumed that the writers were bored. I spent most of my time confused as to why characters did what they did. Then decided to take a shot every time someone got stabbed or sliced..",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
203,TVfiend69,Utterly pathetic painfully boring laughable mess,1,16 July 2021,"This one was even worse than the first one. Like, abysmal.Absurdly stupid, amateurish lazy writing.I legit think they couldve stuffed this ""origin story"" into a 5 minute flashback scene and put it into FS:1978. Carry over the ending from 666 to 1978. Get rid of a lil bit of walking and talking so it gets back down to 2 hours. I promise you the viewers wouldve only gained from it. Part 2 was actually pretty decent - it was a slasher with classic slasher elements. It seems 1666 was done purely to get more streaming money and they simply didn't care about the quality of the movie.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
204,karlakreso,Really lame ending,5,25 July 2021,"I expected a lot more from part 3. But as with many other horror movies, the plot was carried by stupid characters. ""Carrie-ing"" Nick was a dumb move, especially doing it with a bucket knowing the blood can get on Ziggy and of course he's going to catch her and get blood on her too. Why not just kill him instantly and avoid potential accidents. I also didn't understand why the killers killed those two cops since they should be only after Deena. And those three trying to kill them after they wasted all of the bood was just dumb since they know they will just come back to life. Also why just leave the book? They should've BURNED IT. Deena knows it all started with the book and she just leaves it there? And how come all of it ended with Nick's death if he still has a brother? Why can't he continue the curse? And those Goode-evil puns were just lame. Oh and Deena's armour made of Fear Street books... idk what to think about that.I'm sure there's more plot holes and dumb scenes but I'm too tired to try and remember them. Netflix could've done better.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
205,odmorales,Finally! A closure,7,18 July 2021,"Fear Street ends with an interesting twist, and it made me appreciate the first film a little more. The thing is that in part 3 takes place in 1666, puts us in an era of which I'm not a fan of, salem witch trial'esque.The story falls into a combination of two films, that aren't much my cup of tea, The Crucible and The Witch. Although, it doesn't evolve from it besides having to hit some homage to other films which are done better, but it sure tells you more of what is happening in the curse town, Shadyside.The side characters didn't bring much to the table, they were just there. At least this time, the lead to the first film wasn't much of annoyance. What is sad is that her character evolved much towards the third film, but it doesn't save the first, 1994. It may take me some time to see the Fear Street Part 1, again.Its good to hear some original music, and not having every scene filled with songs of the 90s back to back. Obviously, they still have some songs play in certain scenes. Good thing they learned to not overwhelm the nostalgia music. They tone it down. Although, towards the end they sure were bringing the 90s music hits back, but it work this time around.It's funny to mention 90s music which the title says its 1666, but the film has two parts which is a bit confusing, especially when the first half takes place at another time: witch trials. Then the second half of the film you're taken back to 1994. This is where the movie falls under. It's hard to get involved, put into the movie when everything is all over the place. The title is definitely misleading. You'll notice this yourself if you ever get the chance to see 1666.Furthermore, it didn't add much layer, but it did it's part. The whole trilogy just revolves around a love lesbian story which got a little tiresome towards Part 3. Good thing the twist helped me get more intrigued through out. And still didn't feel much of the chemistry between the two leads. Not convincing. Oh well, it was FUN even for being a tad long in it's running time.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
206,alexlittle-81215,Moderately satisfying end,7,16 July 2021,"The first half of this is excellent, like truly excellent.

210,samuelwha,Fear the Worst,3,17 July 2021,"In some ways, it is difficult to pinpoint where the Fear Street films go wrong. They are pleasant looking enough, with that typical Netflix-cinematic look that is neither offensive, nor interesting. The story also is a similar brand of innocuous typicality, despite the series' penchant for homage often leaning a little too far into imitation. And while the films are never scary, they do bring an atmosphere that might seem vaguely appealing to horror fans.Let me rephrase.In most ways, it is difficult to pinpoint where, if at all, the Fear Street films go right.""Fear Street: 1666,"" concludes Netflix's Fear Street trilogy in custom with the precedent laid out by the earlier two films; with a sloppily strung together mess of half-baked scares and substandard performances that never manage to elevate the lacklustre material.It feels awkward to approach the Fear Street films with such scrutiny-they're just Netflix movies. But perhaps someone should have told that to writer/director Leigh Janiak before she developed these films into the unpleasantly self-serious entities that they are.All three films, ""1666,"" much included, never really figure out who they are intended for. In Janiak's heart of hearts, she must have wished to create the trilogy as a love-letter to the book series, and accordingly, to the now largely adult readers. This is apparent in the use of gore, sex and drugs that is distastefully smattered throughout the series in the most graceless of places. In any other manner however, it seems as though the films must be aimed at pre-teens. That is not to say that pre-teens would ever find themselves enjoying the mangled plot line that is only ever propelled by incessant teen drama, nor would they appreciate the performances and dialogue, which always seem to be in a constant race with one another to be the worst aspect of the film. And certainly, nobody would find themselves scared. But left then is the question of who is this series for? It is too gratuitous to be appropriate for younger individuals, too petty to appease older generations, and too insipid overall to satisfy just about any horror film enthusiast.I've got a lot to say about Fear Street, but only so many ways to say it. The films are bad. In their aspirations to echo the slasher films of the 80s and 90s, they manage only to mimic the the carapace; in Fear Street's efforts to emulate, it unflatteringly juxtaposes itself against films that it has not the wit, charm or soul to compete against.To the merit of ""1666,"" however, this was the only film in the series wherein I felt that I could finally relate to the characters and story. After nearly six amalgamative hours of ""Fear Street,"" films, it was reliving to finally have this moment, for as the credits rolled, I exited Netflix, turned off my computer, and realized that the three weeks were up, and that there were no more ""Fear Street,"" films to come. In this way, I felt that I too had finally cast out a great evil that had plagued me for far too long.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

222,Siobhan7485,"Horrendous accents aside, this is the best one",7,24 July 2021,"This is my favourite of the 3. Part 1 was pretty bad - not sure how I managed to finish it. Part 2 was really good but this one was absolutely the best. So much happens in the first hour, when the first part of the movie started wrapping up I thought ok, it must nearly be over - I checked the run time and it had only been going for just over an hour! I felt like it had been much longer than that and I wasn't even ready for it to finish yet so I was glad there was still a good 50 mins to go. I liked the endings for the characters and I liked how it returned to the original timeline.The only thing that bothered me was the accents of the people in 1666, which sounded like very bad Irish accents.. which is very bizarre as people in this time (the first settlers/pilgrims/puritans) were originally from England.. not sure if the accents were supposed to be accents from the west/south west England in those times but they didn't sound like it - the only one that sounded English was ""real Sarah Frier"" although her accent seemed to change to the bad Irish accent at the end of the film. With that being said, even though I thought that was going to ruin it in the beginning, the rest of the movie made up for it so I can overlook that and still give it a 7.

224,sharkoucan,"better than part one, that accent though...",5,21 July 2021,"I thought overall, part 3 1666 is the most story-driven one and draws a decent conclusion to this story. I'm not saying I don't like pure slasher fun, but I felt if the focus is to be campy and gory, the first one didnt succeed in that department, not enough gore or kills.The acting was mediocre at best, but I don't expect any top-notch acting from them so I'll let it pass.My biggest issue with fear street part 3, however, is the accent. Clearly the actors arent familiar with what Irish accents should sound like and they are embarrassing themselves, and insulting the audience. I've seen SOME people, mostly audience from the US, saying they thought they did a good job regarding the accents. Well have you guys actually been to Ireland and have heard what a proper Irish accent is like, or at least, have some common sence?

Imo the series went from 1: average slasher movie , 2: good teenage type horror with twists & jump scares 3: witchcraft, human betrayal & brutal attitudes along with an excellent depiction of how being anything but straight at that time was not just frowned upon but deadly. Also a great explanation and tying up of all those loose ends from the first 2. For those who gave bad reviews because of the accents, that is ridiculous, who knows what the Irish settlers' accents actually were back then, they have changed through the years plus they weren't that bad anyway. If you watch the first & are not too impressed, it's worth carrying on and doing all 3, just gets better.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
229,ec1994,Loved the origin story!,9,18 July 2021,"I do not get the negative reviews. A lot of people said that it is abysmal to have a lesbian relationship in 1666. Yea guys thats why they condemn them in the first place. It is not like the whole community accepted and welcomed them. That's the whole point, being labeled and sentenced to death. If you read the negative comments, you can easily understand the reasoning and the people behind them. They are unhappy with a white male villain and so called lqbt promotion.About the trilogy- The first one was pure trash but the sequels got better and better. 1978 was a great homage to Friday the 13th and with 1666, the trilogy hit its peak. It was by far the best of the three. I loved the origin story so much that I didnt want to go back to 1994 timeline- Deena might be the most annoying protagonist ever played in a horror movie tbh...So called Irish accents suck, especially Madeira's is unbelievably bad. Overall, the worst thing about the trilogy is its heroine. Other than that, the trilogy is great and much better than expected. It brings a fresh air to the horror genre. Just hang in there while you watch the first one, then it only gets better and better. Definitely recommended!",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

It's not as good as part two but it's still very well done. The main actress who's absolutely gorgeous really did a amazing job. All the actors acting was great. They really portrayed a witch hunt well. This series definitely had a lot of social commentary for the LGBTQ community. Which I thought was well done as someone who identifies with that community.. All the actors who acted in the puritan society stole the show. This was a fun series that I definitely recommend to those who enjoy slashers and happy endings.,Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

(even though the music was way off in the 94, in this third part I did not even notice the soundtrack; except offspring).This was different kind of story telling and gave the answers needed. I was kind of hoping the actors to be different in the 1666 part but..🤷‍♀️The mall scenes were cool, looked nice and gave me a tiny bit of Stranger things - vibes. I would have chosen a different actor to play adult Ziggy though (Red head.. Come on) but it wasn't such a big deal.All and all a nice combo. Could have been better, but an okay watch.

If you want to have the characters as irish immigrants then at least be sure they can do the accent.

237,thatvikingchick,This is not RL Stine,8,19 July 2021,"I see a lot of misconceptions written here and these need to be cleared up before reviewing the film. First, those aren't ""Irish accents"" that the actors were doing. The Irish didnt come en masse to the US until the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The actors were doing (or trying to do) early American accents from the 1600s. If you look up the way British and the first American settlers spoke during that time, you will know that the r's were rhotic. Was this a little ambitious for a teen horror movie? Sure. But it is a far cry from Irish. The second unfair criticism is about how the film is somehow ""anti-cop"" or having some other kind of political agenda. This is a teen horror film...don't read too much into it. There were good cops in the movie...there were also really terrible townsfolk who did awful things who weren't cops. Third, these movies are indeed loosely based on the Fear Street Sagas, which didnt come out until way after a lot of millennials stopped reading the books (late 1990s).Now that that is out of the way, I thought the trilogy was ok. It didn't completely capture the spirit of R. L. Stine's books in my opinion. There was some gratitutious gore and the plot and characters weren't as developed as his books are. A main feature of Stine's books are that each chapter ends on a cliffhanger and that it never goes too far, especially with gore. His books are PG-13, but these movies were R. The movies (all three) were without a doubt too graphic at times for RL Stine. Some of the horror also seemed senseless and didn't work to move the plot along, as they do in Stine's novels. Janiak completely missed the spirit and creativity of these books...that a lot of the thrill of reading them was psychological and all in the suspense and mystery. In the movies, there was very little mystery. If you take the movies as being separate from Stine's books, then they are ok. The acting is decent...the young actors clearly did their best with the material they had...but the screenplay is all over the place and the dialogue seems forced and convoluted at times. Several people pointed out gaping plot holes.If you are expecting nostalgia and that Fear Street wonderment that you got as a kid from reading the books, then you will be disappointed with these films. Aside from the music, none of the movies seemed to truly capture the era they were set in. You can tell that the director either was never an original fan of the books before deciding to make these films or she read them and decided instead to use the popularity of the books as an excuse to make an unoriginal slasher film...taking the easy way out. With the bad screenplay, awkward pacing, forced music, plot holes, and deviation from everything that was good with the original material, I blame the director for a lot of what went wrong with the Fear Street books-to-films adaptation.I give it 8 stars because if you forget that this is supposed to be RL Stine, the films are a decent time waster for a lazy weekend. I also respect the novice actors for the work they did in carrying off such a terrible film. But the rest of the movie deserves maybe 5 stars at best.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

The acting was overall better in this movie than the rest. The plot through the movie felt disconnected. They had a brilliant set up for a good ending but when it went back to 1994 it was like the writing plummeted and it felt as bad as the first movie.I have a few critiques i found during the movie that i could not get out of my head. First, its 1666 in America, why are there Irish accents in the main cast. It's a historical mistake. Then there is also no mention of flint lock guns in the beginning which felt not historically accurate as well(this is just a nit pick). Lastly, What the hell was that scooby doo trap set up for the monsters, it felt so lousy and cheap in the writing.Overall, I would not recommend this series as a whole.

The trilogy is okay to watch if you have free time and like this type of movies. But why are these kind of movie characters so dumb.

246,JackWeyland,A confusing Conclusion,5,28 August 2021,"The third and (hopefully) final movie in the Fear Street franchise. I thought this movie might be a 7 star with the part taking place in 1666, however they regressed back to poor writing when they went back to 1994. This movie had significantly less jumpscares (3, as compared to 2's 11 and 1's 28), which is cool that they didn't have to rely on that. I think the acting was probably the best out of the 3, but the 1666 part did not do well with the accents. This one only had 1 sex scene and it felt kind of necessary to the plot as apposed to the first 2 movies with the unnecessary ones. The series is a bit more thought out than I expected. There was a lot of foreshadowing all along towards certain things. I think as a whole this movie really pulled the series together into a kind of plotline, but it's not like the evidence wasn't always there. There were less awkward music changes mostly because the movie takes place when there wasn't really music. Finally, at the VERY end of the first credits, they kind of tease like they might make another film in this series, and I really REALLY hope they don't.

Luckily, that's not too much of a problem because, unlike the first 2 Fear Streets, Part 3 is a slog throughout. There's very little story, lots of filler, noticeably bad acting from the cast of Part 1 who inexplicably are characters in 1666 now, and virtually no payoff other than a somewhat mediocre twist halfway through the movie.I couldn't finish it, particularly when I realized the last 30 minutes was going to be an entirely predictable action sequence.

257,ChromeDrifter,A Good Conclusion To An Enjoyable Trilogy,8,22 July 2021,"This provided a solid conclusion to the trilogy, which has been enjoyable throughout.The acting was decent, cinematography on point, good special effects and an interesting plot.It's not without criticism - the first act is a little wayward in what tone it wants to set, and some conclusions feel a little rushed - but they don't ruin the film.Warning - Possible Spoilers Ahead
The usage of the trilogy cast has been clever in this film and provides good continuity of characters, which helps the viewer to understand the lines of ancestry much easier.I didn't have any issue with the usage of the Irish accent to portray 17th Century settlers. Some actors pulled it off better than others, but it didn't present any issues in understanding the plot or locating the characters to the period.The ending may not be a huge surprise, but this is a horror film, paying homage to many parts of the genre. This is not an adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel.It reminded me of the feel of HP Lovecraft, at times (Case of Charles Dexter Ward comes to mind), and It.Overall, it is watchable - not as bloody as the other films, but still grim enough - and the story has enough substance to support the trilogy throughout.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

259,HDDeer,Waste of 6 hours,4,29 July 2021,"The downfall of this entire series was when they killed off maya hawke in the first 2 minutes of part one.After that we were thrown into a mix of politics, and a failed attempt to put a spin on other classics and twists we've seen a million times.The first was overall at the very least tolerable, id argue however that the last half of part 2 was by far the best in the trilogy, but even the first half of that film bored me.Part 3 was a complete abomination, it took me out of the story considering all relationships between the main cast from the 1600s to the 1900s were essentially all the same as the first and second, very distracting and not good for keeping me engaged.The main actress was atrocious, and we had to tolerate her for two full films. Id argue that Maya Hawke had the best performance in all of part 1 and she was in the film for two minutes. It doesnt help the fact that the character was written poorly and walked around with an entitled attitude the entire film and obnoxious facial mannerisms.Id be willing to argue that 2 was more entertaining, it didn't do much for the main story and that in itself makes the trilogy feel dragged out and definitely couldve been done in two movies.Or arguably a two hour film and cut a lot of the filler crap out, as thats what 80% of these films are.I do not recommend these in any way, does not reinvent slashers at all, if anything it makes them worse.I dont believe any film is a 1/10 as i find theres always some aspect of movies you can enjoy.Netflix was out of their minds to make this a 3 film series.

263,Zac_124,A decent end to the trilogy,7,17 July 2021,"This was definitely the best film in the trilogy. While the first two films had some good moments when it gets to the slasher sections of the films, the rest felt mediocre due to a cliché and predictable story and uninteresting characters. 1666 still has an issue with forgettable characters but the plot went to places that I did not expect it to go. There were some surprising moments and good ideas that were executed decently. The slasher elements here were solid too with some good kills here and there but it was not as strong in that area as 1978 was. I also wish that in previous films they developed Nick Goode more as the character could of been much more interesting here.Overall, the film ends an otherwise mediocre trilogy in a fairly satisfying and in an unpredictable way. It is still flawed in a few areas and could be a lot stronger but was still a decent time once it gets going.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

It's a low budget Netflix movie with teen actors. It's also really a lot of suspended disbelief as the plot makes no sense for the eras in which they are set. I'll just leave it at that since critiquing what actually made no sense is not allowed. Just no. Don't waste your time. Part 2 was pretty good but this finale made no sense. The acting was not good.

283,hrlanham,I thought it was actually pretty good,8,26 July 2021,"Me and my boyfriend watched this whole series together. I was out of state when the final movie dropped and so I decided I just was to take a quick glance at the reviews. Sadly they were all pretty terrible and I definitely didn't expect all that much when I actually got to view it. I ended up even tell my bf that we shouldn't expect much as everyone was saying it was pretty bad.Throughout the whole movie I was in disbelief at the ratings. I actually thoroughly enjoyed watching it, there were some really great shots & I actually thought our main characters acting got better since the first film (were I absolutely hated her).I do understand the problem with the accents, they weren't all that good but I honestly didn't really mind that much. I wish we got to see more of the actual Sarah fier actress but it makes more sense to have Deena replace her since we know the relationship she has with the other cameo actors from the previous films. I was into the twist of Sarah not actually being a witch but I was even more interested in how the story got flipped when it came to her hand being cut off by Solomon instead of how in the myth she was the one to do it to curse the land. I also think they pulled off some really great references to the other movies with the kicking of the floor to break out & later the book vest to avoid being stabbed.Once we get into the 1994 part 2 section I was very pleased with the setting & mood we were given. I also was super into getting to have a closer look at different past killers that this movie didn't focus on. The whole time I was like ""Omg they're terrifying I would never be able to pull this off"".Overall I definitely don't think 1666 is a bad movie, I honestly place it above 1994 as I think the characters are a lot more tolerable.

Part 2 was enjoyable and even managed to produce some tension. Part 3 entirely undoes the good work of Part 2, shoehorning a twist that is not compatible with the previous movie. SPOILERS: Nick Goode is THE bad guy, yet in Part 2 when he was all alone, with no reason to be scared for his life or shocked by the unfolding events, he's hiding and sickened by the gore in Part 2. In Part 3 it's revealed he unleashed said gore and knew that at no point was he in danger. So what was the point in his play acting? Just to fool us viewers for the big twist at the end!

288,Sophiaphage,"Ideology, not art",5,10 November 2021,"While the second movie was good, this movie suffers from an unlikable lead, Deena. In the first movie, I was willing to overlook that Deena was aggro at everyone for no reason; I was willing to overlook her selfishness for wanting Sam to remain in a miserable life in Shadyside, instead of Sam finding happiness in Sunnyvale; Deena aggressively stalking Sam; Deena nearly killing a Sam and her boyfriend (and facing no consequences); Sam immediately forgetting her dead boyfriend and hooking up with her ex. I would have overlooked all that if this had gone somewhere interesting, but it didn't.The third movie reveals that the witch was never supernatural, but somehow had supernatural power in the first two movies; e.g., bleeding on the bones caused flashbacks for no reason. Furthermore, a book was written about the witch for no reason by an unknown author-a book with intimate knowledge of the cave system...that no one should know about except Solomon Good. And why would he write a book that explained how to end his so-called reign? These issues are hard to ignore, but the worst is they took a likable boy who saved the life of a likable character, Ziggy, and made him the villain for no reason other than him being a white dude antagonist to a mixed-race lesbian character.This series had much potential, but the lack of good moral judgement, consequences, and very poor story logic make this a hard pass for me.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

It carries on from the same quality as the previous two films, but tries to tie up loose ends. However, it leads to further plot holes. If you look past this then it's still a decent watch.There is less of an emphasis on the serial killers this time, all of the focus is on Sarah Feir. If the serial killers were your favourite and you don't have much time, you could give this a miss but overall it was a decent conclusion to the trilogy.

Clearly is trying to be aligned with American Horror Story by recasting the original cast in an older setting. At first i was genuinely excited, but the cast/ story is not strong enough to uphold the original movie or to keep the interest of the viewer. This series in general is a complete waste of time and wouldn't even bother having it play in the background with the usual cult classics around halloween. I wish it would've lived up to the original books, but unfortunately the directors were really trying to make it way too modern and made it entirely about the original couple.

302,Matt-Schaab,Suspension of disbelief the movie,3,24 July 2021,"If you are the kind of person who enjoys paying attention to movies and understanding characters, their intentions or the world they inhabit. You'll for sure have a big disappointment with this one.This review works as a review of the three movies as a whole, but I've also rated them separately.The filmography kinda looks good most of the time, except when you start to wonder ""where's that light coming from?"" and that's where things start to crumble. The director seems to enjoy neon lights a little too much and something a subtle as a sign 2 meters from our characters is enough to light a whole side of the scene in crisp manner without any bleeding. I was hopping this would stop by the second film which happens in a Friday the 13th setting, but no. Here the neon blue light is just 'moonlight' and the neon orange is a subtle fireplace.Another issue might be that a bunch of scenes come out of nowhere to be at 0 lighting, which wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the fact that 80% of the movie tries to look like the virtual girl scene from Bladerunner 2049.Then comes the architecture of the whole world, which starts messing up at the second movie. There's a sort of tunneling which in some scenes seems to be no longer than 100m and in others it seems like you can ran a whole subway on it, because it ends up connecting places that are insanely far away from each other. This wouldn't such an issue if they were used one time but they end up being the most important place in the whole story.World building, Oh god. Don't you ever dare to give it a thought on how the monsters in the movie work because you'll just grow angry. There are a ton of portions in the movie where a character knows something because of a vision, but the world never makes you question whether the vision was telling the truth or not, it just becomes reality.There are also portions where issues are explained as a legacy but they are never explained in the people involved in the legacy, but rather they end up just filled up in one character who's never explored. And the worst thing is that after the movie tells you ""yeah everything was on this 1 character"" they decide to also pay judgement to the rest of the legacy. It's dumb, it's confusing and it doesn't make sense.I laughed so hard when a character killed someone by stabbing their stomach and then it's revealed that the person really had a bulletproof vest made of BOOKS, doesn't the director understand that stabbing a stomach feels way different than stabbing a book?And also the whole police department is absolutely treated from the point of view of a 10 year old, nothing on the crime investigation side makes any sense, and it just gets worse and worse until the ending where it just tops.On character building, during the whole first movie I was unable to relate to any of the characters and I just ended up being kinda fond of the weird kid. But character building is something that only goes as far as plastering a pop song at the moment a character is introduced to say ""yeah this person is like this song"" and that's as far as it goes.This grows a little better by the second and third movie but it just grows up to ok, and even then things just end up in ""this is a good guy and this is a bad guy because I say so"" it's completely uninteresting and something that I'd reserve for a 30 minutes show on television, not a feature length film and way less for a trilogy.On the slasher aspect it was ok, the killings looked nice even though censored at times, I'd guess because budget or because murdering kids could look wrong (people should just watch assault on precinct 13 tbh) but overall they were fun, topping on the second movie where the acting for the killer was way better than all the others.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

305,BadCheesoid,Second half stronger than the first half,5,17 July 2021,"I binge watched all three parts of Fear Street last night and it kept me occupied as I drank beers and played with my phone every now and again. Will I remember this trilogy in a few months? No. It's forgettable, but it's not as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be.One of my biggest gripes with this trilogy has been the writing, which has consistently been quite weak in part 1 & 3 (a little better in part 2). It's just that, in this film, none of the lead characters actually feel remotely real. The plot never really moves forward through their actions. Things just kind of happen and the characters respond to it as if they are completely psychopathic.I don't think I've seen many films with more dis-likeable main characters before. The lead actress was just dreadful across each part. I think that part 2 was the best of this trilogy because she was in it less and there was a stronger actress and character in the lead for that film. The strongest parts of this trilogy are where the lead characters (Deena & Sam) are not in it, which really tells you a lot about the writing here. The supporting characters are far more enjoyable to watch and I think are played quite well considering what the actors had to work with.The effects and gore are pretty solid and there are some entertaining moments in this film and the other parts before it. If you want to watch a slasher for the kills and not really focus too much on the details, then this might be for you. There's a story underneath all of this but, to be honest, it's a bit convoluted in places - the film is at its best with its kills and when it focuses on its supporting characters. Those moments are far more enjoyable. You could tune the rest of it out.It's definitely not awful, but there are certainly better slasher films out there.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

I don't know. Reasons. But the characters make a point of saying the killers are passing right by everyone else and only going for the one who bled on the bones ... Except when they don't and they kill random people at the hospital. Whatever.Point is, you bleed on the witch's bones, she curses you and sends her goons after you.In Part 3 we find out Sarah Fier wasn't actually a witch, she was framed by Solomon, who was the actual person dealing with the devil. But the whole ""reanimated killers are only going after the person who bled on the now non-witch's bones"" rule is still in affect. Again, because ... Reasons. Except when they kill two cops in the mall even though they completely ignore everyone else and just follow the blood trails that were set up.Now the witch wasn't a witch, the Sheriff from the Solomon family tree is the actual bad guy, and nothing that happened previously makes sense anymore. It's not a plot twist if you break the rules you've set for the story. It's just bad writing.Wanted to like this series. Thought the second part was actually pretty good, albeit pointless once the third part came along. But overall, it was a trilogy of poorly done tropes thrown together into a nonsense plot.

But I thought I'd give the second one a chance before I made up my mind completely and to my surprise, I enjoyed 1978 so much more. Then I thought why not watch the third one to finish it off?

So the actors of part 2 did a great job and were only giving cameo roles? Even tommy had a better role as a cameo. Also, what's the point of the actress for sarah if deena's gonna act her role? And deena and her brother are really the worst thing about part 1 and 3. Deena keeps on forgetting the 1666 accent and the way they act and talk i would doubt it happened in 1666. It's a satisfying conclusion after all but goode had a lot of chances to kill deena but i get the good guys win. They should have the actors from part 2 more involved especially ziggy. And the after credits was kinda stupid like why would the police leave the book out there for people to steal it knowing the danger behind this book? And deena should forget acting, i don't what's that thing she does with her mouth when she's angry like??!

The previous two installments were a solid 7/10 for me. However the final chapter did step it up.The 1666 part was good enough, with a well deserved twist. Actors delivered a good performance, the settings was made. Gore is present, and it's good gore, nothing cheesy cheapy.The part that follows 1666 was very good as well. The light and cheery parts were very welcome and just enough to keep this picture from being too dark. The final act was well planned out and I cannot come up with a better way to orchestrate that final encounter. Ruby is my favorite, I just had to say that.So, with somebody grabbing that that book in the end of the movie, will the summer of 22 bring us another fear street trilogy?

Like seriously, half the 1 star reviews are people who obviously have a problem with gay people. The relationship at the center of the films is sweet and works well to provide motivation for the main characters to fight the evil in their midst. If it had been a male/female couple these troll wouldn't have had a thing to say about it being ""too much.""The first half of this film was probably the worst part of the entire trilogy. Terrible accents and I couldn't buy into the time period because I'm pretty sure that it wasn't accurate as to how people acted and spoke.

Part 3, if you exclude the first 30 minutes, where basically almost nothing happens, it's an interesting conclusion to the whole trilogy with a built of agony but not caring deeper because the characters are not well written.

They could have just done a toned down American accent. Otherwise this is still a bad movie/trilogy. Copying elements from loads of horror movies isn't an homage unless the reference is on point, this is like a Gen Z kid that only saw the trailers of all the classic horror movies then tried to write one giving them all a wink.

L Stein ( by the time his books were popular I was already reading King, Herbert and Barker) However I thought the trailers looked good so thought I would give them a chance. Was I glad I did.So Part 3 serves as both a prequel and a sequel to part 1. Here we find out the truth about Sarah Fier and the Shadyside curse.The movie is well acted, apart from a few minor accent issues, like the other two it is shot really wel and has great production design. The story here is really good.Ignore the reviews using the word 'woke' there seem to be a lot of people out there that believe that lesbians couldn't have existed in 1666, I'm pretty sure they did. Also just because the villain is a white man doesn't mean that they are saying all white men are villains, relax. It's been a trend in Hollywood for the villain to always be the one with the English accent, but you don't see us getting upset about it and taking it as a personal attack. It's just a movie.Really enjoyable and well made trilogy, I now hope they dive into some of the other stories in the series.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
337,adamantoun,Heartbeat of the Series Flatlines,3,21 July 2021,"The closing chapter of Fear Street falls short. In its attempts to bring closure to the story, the heartbeat of the series flatlines. Parts One and Two were action packed throughout with blood and destruction and just enough background to keep the story alive. They were fun tributes to horror with enough campiness to gain support from true fans of the genre. In 1666, the pace is fully upturned and the story drudges through the origins of Sarah Fier and Shadyside's intrepid curse. Shock and fear were ever-present from the beginnings of the trilogy, but this unfortunate end is far too subtle.Deena attempts to unite Sarah Fier's bones in their final resting place, and is transported to 1666 and the birthplace of the illustrious curse. Deena's trip is a retelling of history though her mind's alterations. She witnesses Sarah Fier becoming the famous witch...but not exactly. A few twists and turns lead the audience right back to where they started. Trying to confound the storyline was an idea better left in the writer's room. It works well for the pacing of a thriller like The Sixth Sense, but the fires of Fear Street Part Three: 1666 burned way too slow.It's difficult discerning the plight of Deena from that of Sarah Fier. Their differences and similarities circle around each other in an incomplete way. The story forces a political flyer mirroring the injustices of several hundred years ago with the state of the world today that seemed hardly necessary. The acting suffered as a result of the declined writing and the accents were all over the place. I had high hopes for the self-aware slasher blood fest seen in glimmers, but was ultimately disappointed with the trilogy as a whole. There's good kinds of bad and bad kinds of good. I would recommend the first two installments as a fair example of the former. The final movie could be missed, however, as it is mostly a bad kind of bad.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
338,meggzmoore,People are too harsh!!! LOVED the whole trilogy!,8,24 July 2021,"Those out there giving the Fear Street movies, and this one especially, bad reviews have lost their minds. Maybe all they wanted was the guts and gore rather than a great plot. All the movies were great but honestly, I think the 3rd one was my favorite! All my questions were answered, the story of Sara Fier in 1666 was very well written, had a lot of heart, and tied up all loose ends; and the ending back in 1994 was awesome!!!! Not really much gore as compared to the 1st 2 installments though, if you HAVE to have that to like this movie. It was all about explaining the curse's origins and gives you a great twist, and who doesn't like a good twist??!!! Not many great slasher flicks come out anymore, and this series was everything I have been craving! Not your typical dumb slasher flick, because it had a phenomenal story line. The accents didn't bother me at all, though they werent perfect, but I feel that having the initial characters play these roles made me care about them more, rather than them handing us new characters with great Irish accents. It was a great choice by the director in my opinion. And I don't see what everyone's problem is with the lead actress, she played the role very well in my opinion....

339,nfarland,"A pale, soulless imitation",2,29 July 2021,"If you want to see a 90's-style movie with poignant social justice themes go watch Wes Craven's ""People Under the Stairs.""That classic oozes authenticity and character. It is darkly funny, fast-paced, surprising, creepy, and brilliantly acted. There is a scene in which a bad guy kills a hero, and then joyously dances around the house in his leather costume like some deranged, flippant schoolboy. It is both entertaining and terrifying. Anyone who has watched that film remembers that scene. That clip encapsates everything the movie is about.There is absolutely nothing like that in ""Fear Street: 1666.""You can't tell a good story if you can't convince the viewer that your world is real. And boy, does this film fail in that department. The old-world accents are genuinely terrible. The twist is illogical and negates most of the plot from the first two films.The interraction between the main characters has a ""Stranger Things"" or ""It""-style buddy vibe, except that the characters lack charisma or likability. Don't TELL me that they are bosom friends. SHOW me. Give me a reason to care.The final battle is one big boring trope, a mishmash of Lost Boys, Home Alone, Stranger Things, and everything in between. It all feels sloppily tossed together, it resembles its influences but fails to learn from them.

343,tiannagreen-72319,Good for Netflix,7,30 August 2021,"I think everyone is being a bit hyper critical in there reviews, its a Netflix trilogy. So I'll start by saying for a Netflix movie it was pretty good. I think the biggest issue is adults are watching the movie as if it was made for them, it wasn't. This is definitely for the 13-17 crowd. Yes it has murder, drugs , and sex but teens these days play GTF so I don't see the movie as too hard core. Also in the sex scene the girl had a shirt on, thats definitely a teen censor. With that being said teens more than likely never saw Jason, Scream, etc so they have no reference to previous movie plots. The reason why the feel of the movie is genz( though its supposed to be 1994) is another dead give away it was meant for them and not for someone in there 30s-40s. Yes there were some plot holes in the movie and yes they did break some rules but if they kept the rules there wouldn't be as many murder scenes so I guess they had to do a little rule breaking. The 2nd one was the best, it didn't have much to do with the overall movie plot but it did give some background into the villain (Nick) and C. Bermans relationship though I was confused about why he went through so much trouble to save her but she was still haunted by the witch who wasn't a witch it was him. Also why would anyone sacrifice human lives just to be a police chief, i mean if your going to murder a bunch of ppl for centuries you would think they would be on Jeff Bezos status but no these men were murdering ppl for a mayor and a police chief positions. They could have gotten those positions without sacrificing a bunch of teens and children.

348,markkullas,Accents that make your ears bleed. Just don't watch it.,2,19 July 2021,"To start this off, I'll openly state that this is the lowest rating I've ever given a film. Most films I dislike, even hate, I simply just ignore, not wanting to spoil or taint the film for those who may enjoy it.Now, with that out of the way, what follows can only be seen as an example of how truly disappointed I am in not only this film, but the filmmakers themselves.Those accents, those damned darned ""Irish"" accents are the least convincing, and most insulting I've ever heard put to screen. When, oh when, will American's realise that they will never pull off a convincing Irish accent, and yet they never fail to try. While I typically find it frustrating to hear my accent so poorly done, I do enjoy hearing parodies or jokes at our expense. After all, we typically have a good sense of humour. So had this film been made as a comedy, I would have enjoyed it far more, because it is far from the serious film it pretends to be. It's hard to follow a storyline, when I can't understand half the accents, and I'm pretty sure the actors can't understand themselves either.For clarity, I will now list several examples of more convincing ""Irish"" accents on screen;
Gerard Butler in PS I Love You, Warwick Davis in Leprechaun, Mel Gibsons Scottish accent in Braveheart, Donkey from Shrek when he imitates his Scottish accent, a toaster when it pings.All fine examples of better accents that I would be far less insulted had you said they sounded just like me.

350,booktweaker,Great Wrap Up,7,17 July 2021,"Is this trilogy winning awards? No1994 played fun homage to 90s slasher and to me may be the weakest of the three.1978 may have been my favorite giving us Friday the 13th vibes and some solid performances across the board.1666 has a hybrid of the entire cast and it added a fun touch, even if I find Deena to be one of the weaker actors.This final installment takes you on one hell of ride for about an hour straight. It wraps all the movies up rather nicely all things considered.I enjoyed the trilogy. Horror genre is very subjective and these 3 had heart and spirit.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
351,dianawilson1273,Not suppose to be Oscar Worthy,8,17 August 2021,"Damn people just want to complain..I get we are in a Pandemic and people are frustrated, but geez it's a freaking made for Netflix movie based on books by a guy that wrote books geared towards kids to begin with. Not everyone is Merle Streep or Denzel Washington so acting abilities and accents may not be up to par, it's not that bad the actors are ok and the story is tied up. Stop expecting every movie to be an Oscar contender. Just sit back and enjoy.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
352,alexjohncox,"Definitely worth watching the three, they get better as the story goes on",8,17 July 2021,"First installment wasn't the greatest but the second 2 movies were fantastic, worth the watch and linked well together as a trilogy. As horror movies go it's definitely worth your time. The cast and acting was great.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666

354,farabd,Good and intelligent concept wasted,5,17 July 2021,"I was very excited about this trilogy and it started with a bang too but lost its balanced .Note : My review is based on the all the 3 parts.*SPOILER ALERT *Pros :1. Concept : it is one of its kind. May be a trend setter. Story started in 1994 from 1978 from 1666... And many killers in between those years . We still don't know about the killers with bat, Ruby lane, burned face , animal mask etc. Hoping to continue about each killers.2. Intelligent writing : all the three parts were amazingly connected to each other with flashbacks and flashforwards3. BGM4. Some really good plot twistsCons :1. Lighting : I think the makers of this trilogy were so obsessed with the DARK colour. Sometimes you don't even get to see what's happening in the frame. It is so dark.2. Actors : Actors shouldve been changed in the last part. As the actor who played Deena was a big torture . And sad part is she's the lead of this trilogy.3. Deliberately trying to make the run time waste by showing some useless chase sequences throughout the trilogy.4. Long stupid cliché dialogues in some tense situations. I mean imagine a killer/ghost trying to kill you and you're giving speeches to your friends. Wtf5. Loopholes in the plot : at the end ofthe part3 news channel stating that Sheriff Goode has been identified as the Sunnyvale serial killer but the killings were done in the other side of the union that is Shadyside and also how he was identified as the serial killer as there's no proof he killed anyone. All the killings were done by the henchmen dead ghosts and law doesn't believe in ghosts or witchcraft stories , the law needs evidence and proof. And also at the end of part 3, Deena and Sam were spotted and their footprints were all over the house (which is also not clear that who was the owner of that luxurious house) so the prime suspects would be them. And also about the man (whose car was hit by the truck )was also not cleared the intention of that scene.6. Predictable : Though it has some good plot twists as i mentioned in PROS section but major twists were predictable.7. Loopholes in the plot : In the first part Sam was killed and again she regained her life with the help of her gf Deena and in the 2nd part she was possessed again by the alleged witch Sarah Fier ,then deena and friends went to C. Berman for a help as she was the survivor of the same killings back in 1978 and in part 3 she helped them killing this curse. So my question is why C. Berman didn't get possessed as she too was killed and bought back to life by her ex bf Sheriff Goode?? She was normally okay. She shouldve been ended like Sam if that's the procedure of the curse.Over all one time watch and if you love to get your eyes effected then watch it.It could ve been much better as the concept and writing of the trilogy were done by so much of intelligence. The makers knew how to connect the loose ends throughout.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
355,Darklizard1111,"Did not live up to the first two parts, but still enjoyable",6,30 July 2021,"I did not really like the resolution.Nick's actions in part two do not align with his real motives in my opinion, but I liked the twist anyway.In the past the characters should have had their own actors instead of the modern day actors playing two roles. I get that they done this so we can see that this is a flashback, but still did not really like the idea. It took me out of it somehow.But even with all that, the soundtrack is good, the actors play well and the trilogy was an overall enjoyable experience. I like that it deviates just enough from the normal slasher formula, that it becomes its own thing.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
356,halcyondaze-67953,Okay trilogy,6,27 July 2021,"All 3 films had their good points. The story, and back story were OK. My biggest issue was the lighting - even in daylight, it was too dark!",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
357,micheabux,Don't take it so seriously,7,23 July 2021,"Yes, it's cheesy, but also enjoyable and you'll want to inevitably see how y through until the end. While it was not ""scary"", l felt that it was captivating and captured great friendship/relationship moments. If you don't go into this movie too seriously, you will no doubt find it enjoyable.",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
358,parisx217,Great trilogy,10,17 July 2021,"I love all the three movies! The second and the third were a bit better than the first, but they were still all very fun to watch. I hope they make a TV series since it ended on a cliffhanger!",Fear Street - Part Three - 1666
