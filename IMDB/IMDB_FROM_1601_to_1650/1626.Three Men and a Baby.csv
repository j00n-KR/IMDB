0,TheLittleSongbird,Thoroughly enjoyable and funny,8,4 August 2010,"I was actually surprised at how much I liked 3 Men and a Baby. I agree there are some hit-and-miss moments, and it does start off slowly, but a vast majority of it is very funny and enjoyable. The story is simple, three bachelors find a baby on the doorstep and before long they are knee-deep in bottles, nappies and goo. No matter how simple this story is it is effective too.Leonard Nimoy's direction adeptly keeps the entertainment and comedy afloat and it comes thick and fast, while the script has plenty of funny and engaging moments. The film is very nice visually, especially loved that apartment, and the music is good enough. The acting I had little problem with either, Ted Danson, Steve Guttenberg and Tom Selleck show great chemistry together and deliver great performances individually as each of their characters get increasingly harassed while adapting to changing, feeding and burping duties, and the baby was very cute.All in all, very enjoyable and fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Three Men and a Baby
1,Leofwine_draca,Easy watch,6,20 July 2016,"THREE MEN AND A BABY is one of the big beasts of Hollywood cinema of the 1980s. It's a simple story, one that's well executed by Leonard Nimoy in one of his forays behind the camera, and truth be told there's little to dislike about it as a film. It's basically Steve Guttenberg, Ted Danson, and Tom Selleck in an apartment looking after a baby.You can guess the easy, laid back nature of the film in this film and it really is an easy viewing experience. Even a mildly suspenseful crime style sub-plot added to the proceedings never endangers the characters much or adds much in the way of real danger to the story. The three main actors are all charismatic and you can easily see why women would fall in love with them, although it's worth noting that the baby is the real scene stealer here.THREE MEN AND A BABY frequently threatens to veer into cheesy sentimentality, particularly at the climax, but that it never becomes too overwhelming is testament to its success as a film.",Three Men and a Baby
2,SnoopyStyle,three stars with some charms,6,26 January 2016,"Architect Peter Mitchell (Tom Selleck) has an ex in Rebecca (Margaret Colin). Michael Kellam (Steve Guttenberg) is a sensitive cartoonist. Jack Holden (Ted Danson) is a playboy actor. The three bachelors happily share a Manhattan penthouse with a long line of women coming in and out. Then somebody leaves a baby at their doorstep. A note indicates that Mary is the result of an union between Jack and Sylvia (Nancy Travis). Jack is away doing a TV movie. Peter and Michael are forced to deal with the baby. Jack has a package of drugs delivered to the apartment which is to be picked up by two men. Peter and Michael mistakenly assume the baby to be the package. Narcotics officer Sgt. Melkowitz (Philip Bosco) come to question the guys.The combination of the three stars makes this work. Selleck is terrific. This has good comedy and some awkward stuff. I can do without the heroin. It takes the movie down a dark alley. The tone is completely wrong. I would have liked more with Rebecca and Sylvia doesn't need to be British. Overall, it's a mix bag with some laughs.",Three Men and a Baby
3,mark.waltz,Three men find their hearts.,6,2 January 2021,"After the delightful opening credits showing how three bachelors turn their Manhattan bachelor pad into a real work of art, this popular comedy takes off as these determinedly single men find another female in their life: a young baby girl. Little baby Mary is adorable, and even a curmudgeon like myself is entranced by her cooing and laughter.But for father Ted Danson, it's a nightmare when he returns from a movie shoot in Turkey, and finds his very annoyed roommates (Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg) having taken care of not only this but the package of illegal drugs left for him to hold onto. These three men must learn to really grow upon a short period of time and start to care about something a little more substantial than their bachelor life.I could have done without the drug involved subplot, but when they're focusing on the conflicts that occur in trying to raise a child without proper knowledge of how to do it, the film is truly one of the funniest films of the 1980's. Stage and screen icon Celeste Holm has a memorable cameo as Danson's mother. Margaret Colin, Nancy Travis (as the natural mother) and Philip Bosco as the narcotics agent with a secret soft spot for babies are also good. The men's apartment is also one of the most fabulous living spots I've ever seen.",Three Men and a Baby
4,jboothmillard,Three Men and a Baby,7,20 February 2008,"I had heard enough about this film, and I was certainly not going to miss it when the opportunity came along, from director Leonard Nimoy (Spock from Star Trek). Basically bachelors Peter 'Pete' Mitchell (Magnum, P.I.'s Tom Selleck), Michael 'Mike' Kellam (Police Academy's Steve Guttenberg) and Jack Holden (Cheers' Ted Danson) share an apartment in Manhattan. Actor Jack goes away to film in Turkey, and Pete and Mike find a baby, Mary (twins Lisa and Michelle Blair), left on their doorstep, with a note that it's Jack's from a woman named Sylvia. They are convinced it's a package Jack was expecting, and realise they have to look after it, changing diapers, feeding and entertaining it. They eventually realise the package is in fact some drugs, and when Jack gets back Pete and Mike refuse to help him, since it's his kid. After thwarting the gangster bust that Jack is involved in, the three men spend more time with baby Mary (shown in a montage). After a little while, English Sylvia (Nancy Travis) shows up wanting to take the baby back, taking it with her to the airport, which the boys try and stop, but in the end she can't face taking the baby away from them, and needs help, so they all move in together, a happy ending. Also starring Celeste Holm as Mrs. Holden, Philip Bosco as Det. Sgt. Melkowitz, Derek De Lint as Jan Clopatz, Paul Guilfoyle as Vince, Alexandra Amini as Patty, Cynthia Harris as Mrs. Hathaway, Claire Cellucci as Angelyne, Michelle Duquet as Tawnya, Earl Hindman as Satch, Jackie Richardson as Edna, John Gould Rubin as Paul Milner, Camilla Scott as Cherise, Sharolyn Sparrow as Vanessa, Louise Vallance as Sally, Jonathon Whittaker as Adam and A Bug's Life's Dave Foley as Grocery Store Clerk. Selleck, Guttenberg and Danson each get their equal amount of laughs, the baby situations they encounter are all both adorable and funny, the drug dealing plot perhaps slows things, but overall it is a charming and great comedy that may get men thinking twice about having kids. Very good!",Three Men and a Baby
5,moonspinner55,"""These diapers are too big!"" .. ""They're 'super absorbent'!""",1,30 March 2021,"Popular comedy, a remake of the French farce ""Three Men and a Cradle"" from 1985, wrings (repeated) easy laughs from the sight of three clueless guys trying to change a dirty diaper. Bachelor roommates in Manhattan--Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg--become temporary caretakers of an infant girl left on their doorstep, fathered by one of the three men. For those still watching--and no doubt hoping for more--there's also a subplot about heroin dealers and cops on the New York City narcotics squad. Leonard Nimoy was chosen as director, and he shows about as much style and humor as would any Vulcan. Followed by a sequel, ""Three Men and a Little Lady"", in 1990.",Three Men and a Baby
6,studioAT,3 men. 1 baby. Lots of laughs,3,27 July 2017,"This is one of those classic 80's films that are still beloved by millions today.It takes a while to get going, but one the bombshell is dropped the film starts to be quite funny, with all three of the male leads being given the chance to show off their natural comedic skills.It's not my favourite 80's comedy, but its likable enough.",Three Men and a Baby
7,hitchcockthelegend,"Bad bad bad bad boys, make us feel so good.",7,1 January 2010,"Three bachelors have their lives flipped upside down when little baby Mary is left on their doorstep.A remake of successful 1985 French film Three Men And A Cradle, this Hollywood version took the box office by storm to make a domestic profit of over $155,000,000. It's not hard to see why really. Yes it looks a touch twee now, and the irritating drug-smuggling sub-plot (also in the original) grows more tiresome with subsequent revisits. Yet it has a frothy cleanness so lacking in many more similar big budgeted movies that came after it. Starring Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg as the ""no parenting skills"" bachelors, Leonard Nimoy's film , (yes, Spock) sees quality interplay between the guys and some bona fide funny sequences as they in turn attempt to do right by Mary. Yep it's all telegraphed comedy, and the ending holds no surprises for anyone once Nancy Travis as Mary's mother comes back to claim the child. But come on folks, three beefy bachelors trying to change diapers and entertain a wailing baby has to be charming; surely? 7/10",Three Men and a Baby
8,view_and_review,Doordash Daughter,7,10 September 2019,"Two irresponsible adults had a night of sex. A little over a year later irresponsible adult number one (we'll call her Sylvia (Nancy Travis)) dropped off the results of that night at irresponsible adult number two's house (we'll call him Jack Holden (Ted Danson)). The results of that night just so happen to be a beautiful baby girl named Mary.Jack wasn't home at the time of the delivery so Jack's roommates, Peter (Tom Selleck) and Michael (Steve Guttenberg) were left holding the bag. Well, in this case, the baby. There were plenty of follies as these two oblivious bachelors stumbled their way through caring for a child. Fortunately for them, Jack arrived back home after a few days and was able to chip in to help care for his daughter.This was an adorable movie but I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about Sylvia. She dropped the baby off at the front door. There was nine months of pregnancy and another three months or so of child rearing and not once did she call, write, or send a telegram telling Jack that he's a father. Yet, in a moment of weakness, she drops off her baby at Jack's front door.Now, me personally, I'm getting medical proof that I'm the father. Not that Mary wasn't a bundle of joy or anything, but because Sylvia's methods of dropping a baby on Jack were so outrageous. I would be thinking that the real father split and I was the next best option.Jack was too good of a guy (or too gullible) to get a paternity test and his roommates were too head-over-heels to even suggest it. It's not like a woman would lie about such a thing right?As I said, the movie was adorable and it was a comedy after all. There was no need to darken the mood by going to a doctor or by suggesting that precious little Mary could be anybody's daughter. Nevermind my cynical musing, Three Men and a Baby was awesome.",Three Men and a Baby
9,Aaron1375,"Yes, all men are incapable of handling one small child.",3,24 February 2010,"Yes, if we are to believe this movie men who do not have a female present have absolutely no idea how to raise a baby are do anything. Not only is this child left in the care of one guy, but three all of which have no clue how to raise a baby and are completely lost, so all three roommates were only children are had no younger siblings to take care of. If this is the case then you can easily title this movie Three women and a baby as they would be just as lost in that scenario as a guy would be, but for some reason people think women just magically know what to do and men are idiots when it comes to children. The three idiots in question here are Tom Selleck and Ted Danson, known mainly for television work and Steve Guttenberg known mainly for being really lucky to have a Hollywood career. This film is also known for starring a cardboard cutout of a boy who was supposedly a ghost of some kid who blew his brains out by accident in the apartment where this film was shot even though all interior shots of the place were on a set. One has to wonder how much of this movie's success came from the story and how much came from idiots who wanted to see this movie cause they thought there was a ghost in it. In the end, this film is like a long list of crappy films that have babies and idiots raising them and for me it was not very good. I like Ted Danson, but he is basically doing his Sam Malone here, in fact in every movie he was in during this era he was usually in Sam Malone character. However, he is the best thing in the movie and has the funniest moments while Selleck and Guttenberg play lame clueless idiots.",Three Men and a Baby
10,safenoe,3 Men and a Baby and a ghost,7,5 July 2021,"When I saw this in the cinema all those years ago, it never occurred to me that there could be a ghost in this film directed by Leonard ""Mr Spock"" Nimoy. Anyway, it was only a few years later with the advent of VHS that yikes, perhaps there was a ghost of a boy that survived the editing room. But thankfully the rumor was dispelled, but still, if anything rentals for 3 Men and Baby went through the roof for this one scene alone.",Three Men and a Baby
11,Sylviastel,Not bad! Quite funny!,8,31 October 2001,"It turned out to be a good idea after all. I actually liked this movie since I have seen it years ago. I can't remember until now the appeal. It's actually cute and well-done without any real nonsense. It actually makes sense when you watch it. It is actually entertaining without overdoing it. It's a great family movie too. There are hilarious moments between the men and baby Mary. I only wished she had a better name than Mary. The cast is first rate with Tom Selleck, Ted Danson, and Steve Gutenberg as the three fathers and Nancy Travis as British Sylvia. I love seeing Celeste Holm playing grandmother to baby Mary even if it was for only a moment. They have quite a ball with baby Mary in their lives even though she was a surprise beyond belief. Baby Mary usually steals the scene because of her beauty. Babies are beautiful and fun but lots of work for one parent, much less two or three or four parents. I won't give away the ending but I think they should have filmed it in New York City rather in Toronto but that's just my opinion.",Three Men and a Baby
12,Mr-Fusion,This kid's alright,7,20 April 2020,"Not at all surprised that this was the hit of '87. Such star power isn't dismissed easily and neither is the target audience of women that love single dads. I can't imagine this was a hard sell.And I'm a softie, so I fall right in with that audience. I loved seeing that baby wrap three freewheeling bachelors around her tiny finger and I think it was done well from a writing standpoint. This felt entirely relatable to me (kids tend to do that).Put it this way: this is a lighthearted romcom that swayed a violent movie devotee. I figure that speaks volumes.",Three Men and a Baby
13,Robert_duder,Eighties classic still holds it's own,8,11 March 2013,"Until last night if someone had asked me about Three Men and A Baby, I would have said...oh great movie, classic eighties I loved it! Well, it being one of my wife's all time favourites she insisted we watched it and now I'm convinced that it might have been the first time I've seen it all the way through. It is a fun, madcap adventure that's only problem is that with time it has become a little predictable. However, that doesn't make it any less fun and it certainly presents the best possible of ""baby changing bachelor(s) life"" and ""inept new father's taking care of baby."" Its not a new concept, we've seen it time and time again even on Television but this is still an 80's classic thanks to chemistry of the cast, a solid story and simple fun. Only an eighties movie could mix together the new father angle with drug dealers and a thriller type ending in a construction building. A great 80's film in my opinion encompasses and shows off everything we loved about the 80's and this film does that. Success, gluttony (but in a good way), free love, spirit, bright bold and sassy with a touch of gaudiness and you will see all of that in Three Men and a Baby. It also is unique in the fact that it really isn't a family film, it really was geared to adults making it a unique comedy in that way.I could start with any of the main three guys but I will start with my favourite, the unbeatable Mr. Tom Selleck. He's handsome, he's suave, he's an incredibly versatile actor and he was at his prime in this film. His chemistry is palpable and you can see it at every turn. He is a scene stealer just by being Tom Selleck. You can't hardly make an adult 80's comedy without Steve Guttenberg. You can make fun of him, and you can point out he is always the same character but you can't deny he commands attention in 80's comedies. He has a down to earth style that you really like and he's good in this. I happen to think that he gets downplayed because of Selleck and Ted Danson but he is still a welcome member of the cast and has great comedic timing. Ted Danson basically plays Sam Malone in this film. He is absent for almost half the movie and his character has a much faster story than the other two guys but he is still a necessary part to the three men aspect. You can't deny the three of them have great chemistry and they all have at least one great scene between them that will make you laugh, smile or feel all warm and fuzzy. I can't say a lot for the supporting cast, they are all good but they do nothing more than support the three guys. Even our ""villains"" are mostly just run of the mill bad guys that don't really shine in their roles but they are completely adequate.I was nearly bowled over when I saw Leonard Nimoy directed this film. I just had no idea that he did anything like this as a director. He does a very good job. He keeps the script simple and he lets his three stars do what they do best. All three of them were 80's TV and movie heavyweights so you just let them do what they do and it works. The movie is fun and light, cute and weepy at times but it just hits the right chords. No one will ever say its a brilliant feat of film making but the fun and entertainment factor is without a doubt high! If you love 80's then you have to see this of course, and moreso if you want a light fun comedy then look no further because this will fill the void!! 8/10",Three Men and a Baby
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The kid's alright.,6,30 August 2021,"'Three Men And A Baby (1987)' tells the story of... well, three men and a baby. One day, a crib rocks up on the doorstep of thee bachelor roommates (though one of them is out of town for quite some time) and the unsuspecting soon-to-be-dads have to figure out how to take care of the baby it carries until someone comes to take her off their hands. They also have to contend with a mysterious package that some unsavoury types - as well as the cops - are looking for. It's a typical sort of 'fish out of water' comedy that focuses on the evolving relationship the three men have with the child, initially finding it a nuisance but eventually coming to love it as their own. Sure, it follows a tried-and-tested formula, but it follows it fairly well. It's enjoyable enough and has a few chuckle-worthy moments. Having said that, the thing isn't all that engaging or, even, memorable. Plus, it rockets past its natural conclusion with a bizarrely extended final movement that really feels as though it should have had more screen-time (it certainly feels more relevant than the almost obligatory drug plotline). When it comes down to it, the movie is perfectly passable entertainment. It's good enough for what it is, I suppose, even if I find myself less aware of its existence with each passing moment. 6/10.",Three Men and a Baby
15,Bored_Dragon,Damn nostalgia,6,23 October 2017,"To be completely honest, if we put nostalgia for 80's and childhood aside, together with everything being so sweet and cute, this movie is really a crap. Too shallow for a drama and fails as a comedy too cause I did not laugh once. But nostalgia and cuteness... <36/10",Three Men and a Baby
16,insomniac_rod,Classic family movie with a dark urban myth.,6,25 July 2009,"In the late 80's this was the family comedy by excellence. I mean, it aired regularly on many channels and to be honest, it's a funny but naive movie that had a premise that was very popular at the time; making a baby or infant being the center of the plot.Tom Selleck is great as always and delivers a fine comedic performance. The situations are funny mainly because it demonstrates how a bunch of macho men are able to take care of a baby. Well, that's all you have to know about the plot.The dark urban myth is well known by everybody and I won't get into details about it, or I won't even discuss if it's real or a hoax. The truth is that the ""moment"" is creepy as hell and makes this family movie a creepy experience for a moment.",Three Men and a Baby
17,gwnightscream,Good 80's Comedy!,6,12 November 2017,"Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, Ted Danson, Nancy Travis and Margaret Colin star in this 1987 comedy. This tells about New York architect, Peter (Selleck) and his 2 roommates, Michael (Guttenberg), an artist and Jack (Danson), an actor who are all bachelors. Soon, a baby girl, Mary arrives on their doorstep while Jack is away shooting a film. Peter and Michael tend to her and when Jack gets back, he learns that's he's her father. Their lives instantly change and they grow close to her. Travis (Greedy) plays Mary's mother, Sylvia and Colin (Independence Day) plays Peter's girlfriend, Rebecca. This is a good 80's comedy with humorous and a bit of heartfelt moments featuring a great cast. I recommend this.",Three Men and a Baby
18,ianlouisiana,There is nothing so old - fashioned as being completely up to date.,4,3 March 2018,"""Three men and a baby"" is very much a product of its time.
The power dressing,the ""cool"" wall painting in the boys' apartment,the outdated attitudes towards women,the presumption that men will have no idea of how to look after children - a proposition completely demolished within a few years with the growth of the Househusband and the fragmentation of family life in much of the Western world.
And,frankly,if I never see another baby peeing I will still get through my life ok,thanks.
We have three ridiculously attractive bachelors living what might have been called in more innocent days ""the gay life"".
All this fun and games is brought to a standstill when the eponymous baby turns up on their doorstep.
Of course they are all ""Creatives"" which makes it even more unlikely that they should have been left on the shelf - as it were - for so long.
One of theses carefree chaps is the unknowing father of the baby,but being good types they all chip in when they can and actually begin to enjoy the experience.
Bless!
Every new baby cliché is dusted off and given new life.
There is a sublimely unlikely twist when they become involved with a gang of drug dealers(very much a hazard of American life in the eighties,apparently)
but otherwise the film rides smoothly on it's pre - ordained path.
It's all so last century - and not in a good way.
Tom Selleck has gone on to become a significant actor,his moustache unchanging through 30 years.
If you want to catch up on his earlier career watch ""High Road to China"",far better than this in every respect.",Three Men and a Baby
19,gcd70,Funny though overly sentimental,6,3 November 2007,"Accurately funny comedy about two swinging bachelors who are left stranded with a little baby girl which they are forced to look after.Leonard Nimoy's film (based on the French hit ""Three Men and a Cradle"") is spot on with its humour as it details the misadventures of the two men as they struggle to feed, wash and contain the noisy child. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson are a good team and the subplot fills in time quite nicely.When it starts to get sentimental, the film does weaken a little, however for the most part this is a comedy worth your while.

Pretty short and sweet but this movie is pretty much what you see is what you get. For me, it had it's cute moments but it got a little tiresome after the beginning.There's nothing hidden here, it's about-well-three men and a baby-As mentioned it's cute-the people who want to see movies about 3 men raising a baby will enjoy this, those who don't won't.  Ok-I'll add that some parts are very touching. This is NOT a movie that you can easily dislike or hate, it's to-well-cute!

21,blott2319-1,Great comedy that never fails to make me smile,9,24 March 2020,"One of my first movie theater memories is packing into a sold-out theater and watching Three Men and a Baby from the front row. I loved it then, watched it countless times on home video often looking specifically for the ghost (because that was a thing.) I'm happy to say that I think the film still holds up decades later. I know people that act like these guys, who would struggle to even understand how a diaper works, let alone figure out how to feed a baby. That makes the comedy relatable, timeless, and effective. I laugh constantly through the first act, and there are plenty of humorous moments later in the film as well. I think why I enjoy it so much goes beyond the comedy, though. There's a believable affection that grows between the men and the baby, and it brings a great deal of heart to the film. I can't say that I was quite brought to tears this time, but I have seen the movie MANY times before so it would take a lot to get me to tears now.The trio of actors are perfect for the swinging bachelor types, and I like that each one has a slightly different personality that seems to fit them well. Tom Selleck does a lot to steal the show, and I think that's because he's the best actor of the three, but even the much-maligned Guttenberg brings his A-game here. I do wish Ted Danson didn't disappear for a large part of the film, but when he returns, he brings some good laughs. It's also important that he leaves so that the plot can keep moving forward. I do think that there is an element to the plot which is probably the weakest aspect of the movie. Any time it is focused on the titular Three Men and a Baby, it is golden, but there is a subplot about drugs that can feel a bit ancillary. I actually enjoy it for the added layers of conflict and the confusion that it creates, but I could see others disliking that aspect. I'm sure there's some level of nostalgia boosting my rating of Three Men and a Baby, but I do think it's a good film and deserving of all the box office love it received back in the 80s.",Three Men and a Baby
22,SanteeFats,Decent enough,7,27 June 2013,"I watched this movie with high hopes based on the three stars. I mean Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg are all funny in their own right and I figured the three together would be really funny. I was a bit disappointed. I do figure it was the writing and the directing since I have seen all three guys perform a lot better. The whole premise that three roommates would date the same woman is not too far fetched for the 70's-80', what is a little hard to believe though is that all three ""slept"" with her with in enough of a time period so that any one of them could be the baby's father. I guess DNA matching was still not reliable when this movie was shot. All in all though it was fairly funny.",Three Men and a Baby

Their combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It is very light-hearted. It's fun to see the three guys in all the stereotypical circumstances of diapering and baby tending.

26,Darkside-Reviewer,The joys of fatherhood,7,29 December 2019,"This is an absolute classic family comedy about three bachelor's Peter (Tom Selleck) Michael (Steve Gutenburg) and Jack (Ted Danson) who live together in a new york apartment there lives are filled with party's, women and work all the fun with none of the responsibilities until one day Peter comes home from his morning run to find a baby on the doorstep with a note explaining who the father is and why the baby girl named Mary has been left in his care in an instant there lives change from being carefree to becoming full time dads with no experience of how to take care of a baby they band together to take care of Mary as dad and Co dads but overtime all the things they hated the late nights the crying and diaper changes no dates or free time aren't work anymore and they can't imagine there lives without Mary there are many ups and downs along the way and a subplot involving gangsters and the police but altogether this movie is very heartwarming and really tugs at the heartstrings showing the joys of being a dedicated and loving father or father's rather.Tom Selleck, Steve Gutenburg and Ted Danson are a great comedy trio together and use there charm and charisma to sing lullabys, charm the ladies and be great dads it's nice to see a movie where the dad's save the day and are the role models for being good parent's there's not a lot of movies that focus on fatherhood in a genuinely light hearted and fun way while also being serious and grounded.The soundtrack is one of the best parts of the movie in my opinion it follows the journey of the characters carefree bachelor lifestyle to them becoming parents and co-parents with a perfect mix of light hearted songs that stick in your head even days later.I recommend this movie to any parent or soon to be parent it perfectly captures the highs and lows of new parenthood and the changes that happen in your life but overall how being a parent is a wonderful and unique experience that can change your whole life and put all the little stresses in life into perspective when there's a whole person new to the world who's counting on you for everything and guide them along the way.",Three Men and a Baby
27,Min111,I think it's cute,7,15 January 2021,"I seen the movie multiple times now because I liked it so much. If I had the time, I'd see it again. I thought the movie was very sweet. The name of the movie couldn't be any clearer. Basically, there are three men (Jack, Michael and Peter) who live in an apartment together, and they each have luxurious careers. Jack is a actor; Michael is a cartoonist; Peter is a architect. The three men find themselves in a tricky situation when a baby randomly appears at their doorstep. The baby is a girl: her name is Mary. They are forced to take care of the baby. A note tells them that Jack is the girl's father. The father, Jack, is away for a while, so Michael and Peter have to look after the baby for now. I like how the both of them grow attached to her. They'll make good fathers if they ever had a baby. Jack soon returns back at the apartment. Jack is given the task to take care of his daughter, and he too quickly loves her. I'm amazed how caring and loving the three men are. I think it's cute. They each took care of the baby. In fact, they each can take care of a baby better than what a mother could based on what you'll see. I'm sure this movie will teach parents a wonderful lesson on how to take care of a baby. I found it shocking though how a mother would just leave her baby at the doorstep like that. What was the mother thinking? The baby could've easily gone missing. The mother's name is Sylvia who is an actress. The only thing I'd wish for in this movie is to see Jack and Sylvia in a loving relationship along with their baby. The family will love this movie for sure. It's heartwarming! 'Three Men and a Baby' deserves a good rating. I can't believe how old the movie is now. I wasn't even born when this movie came out. It's an eighties movie. I wished I seen it sooner, but better late than never I guess.",Three Men and a Baby
28,jhaggardjr,Cute comedy,8,24 February 2001,"""3 Men and a Baby"" is a comedy that's cute and funny. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, and Ted Danson star as three bachelors who live together, and who's lives are changed forever when on one particular day a baby infant is left on their doorstep. The three bachelors are now forced unexpectedly to become fathers to the baby. Plenty of wonderful comedy scenes throughout as the three stars go through the frustrations of having to deal with this infant girl in the early stages, then the baby eventually starts to win them over. If only the filmmakers threw out the subplot involving drugs, then this film would've been a great comedy. *** (out of four)",Three Men and a Baby
29,DavidSim240183,A film that stinks as bad as Mary's nappies,4,31 March 2008,"3 Men and a Baby was the No 1 box-office smash hit of 1987. Although why that is is anyone's guess. It may have been because of an urban legend that surrounds the film. A ghost boy appears in the background of one particular shot. You need only browse this site's trivia section to find the details behind that. Its only a cardboard cutout of Ted Danson. There does seem something rather ludicrous about a myth fabricated by the public proving to be the selling-point of a film. And yet it worked. In ways beyond the filmmakers wildest dreams.Lucky for them. Because there's nothing particularly brilliant about the rest of the film. In fact you can almost sense the filmmakers cold feet with the whole baby angle, since they include a clumsy and completely ham-fisted drugs subplot. Almost as if they sensed the baby wasn't a strong enough story to sustain the film on its own. Which says all there is to say about 3 Men and a Baby.If it weren't for that whole marketing ploy about the so-called ghost boy, something tells me 3 Men and a Baby would not have been the box-office winner that it was. The film is made up of two disjointed plots that never gel together, no matter how hard it tries. And the film follows the dictates of formula right to the letter. You can almost imagine the screen writing sessions, pitching they're ideas:""One of three guys fathers a baby he never knew about. The mother dumps her on they're doorstep. Wouldn't it be great if daddy's out of town at the time, leaving the other two hapless schmucks minding the baby. Cue lots of diaper changes. Crying. Goo-gooing. And what about this, a drugs angle to make things even more exciting than they already are? Once that's dealt with, the three guys realise they do love this little bundle of joy after all! And then Mommy comes back to really shake things up. I think we've got a genuine classic on our hands here. Let's get this baby into production.""Its times like this I fear for the future of film-making if this is the best they can churn out. 3 Men and a Baby is one of the most overrated comedies ever to hit cinemas. The fact it filled out so many theatre seats is beyond belief. A much better baby film of 1987 was the superb Coen comedy Raising Arizona. Now that was a comedy classic!I'm hard-pressed to think of a single thing about the film that does work. The Blair twins who play Baby Mary are certainly adorable enough, but the film surrounding her is so routine and eminently predictable. There are all the usual hallmarks. Director Leonard Nimoy (Mr Spock!) ticks them all off like he were filling out a check-list. The sleepless nights. The nappy changes. And poop jokes. Lots and lots of poop jokes. Or doodling as its called here for some strange, bizarre reason.After Nimoy demonstrated such a deft hand for comedy in the previous year's Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, its surprising he fumbles it so badly here. Even the title is a bit misleading. For half the film, Ted Danson is completely absent. Leaving it to Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg to carry the load in his absence.Tom Selleck can certainly be a charismatic and likable leading man. Any episode of Magnum will tell you that. But he often looks a bit uncomfortable in the role of a care-free bachelor forced to develop a softer side through a baby. I think everyone (including Selleck) was expecting 3 Men and a Baby to be the film that would launch his movie career. Except it didn't happen. Despite numerous TV appearances and the occasional film role, Tom Selleck has almost completely vanished from the Hollywood circuit.The same goes for Steve Guttenberg, even more so. I was never really much of a fan of Guttenberg. Although he carved out a modest career for himself in the 80s, he is hardly what you would call a truly gifted comic actor. He coasted for far too long on the Police Academy series. Had a couple of outside hits with the likable Short Circuit and the endearing Cocoon, but his career didn't survive the transition to the 90s. The decline of his career has been steeper than Selleck's. He's now reduced to appearing in TV movies. Usually of the Christmas kind.Ted Danson is the only one to have had any kind of career beyond 3 Men and a Baby. Showing his natural talent for comedy in Cheers and Becker, Danson is one of Hollywood's greatly underrated comedians. But the film doesn't give him much of a chance to show off his considerable talent for comedy since it sidelines him for most of it.3 Men and a Baby is miscalculated on all counts. A lot of the comedy falls flat. The dramatic scenes come out mawkish, e.g. violin music plays when Mary's mum Sylvia (Nancy Travis with a very convincing British accent) comes to take her away. And the film is an odd blend of a light plot and a dark one. You can tell Leonard Nimoy backed himself into a corner with that drugs subplot, as he goes out of his way to wrap it up in the quickest way possible in a hurried and utterly unconvincing showdown at a construction site. All the actors look itchy and restless. As if they're as eager as Nimoy to wrap this thing up.Things end predictably with Mary being accepted, Sylvia joining the family, and all live happily ever after. 3 Men and a Baby is not quite as dire as its sequel, but it still falls far short of classic status. Funny that an unfounded rumour would have such a positive effect on a movie!",Three Men and a Baby

31,roghache,Fun comedy about three confirmed bachelor dads,7,20 April 2006,"This is a really cute, light hearted comedy. The plot may be pretty unrealistic, the ending kooky & unbelievable, and don't get your morals from it, but all in all...it's great fun to watch.The story revolves around three carefree bachelors (Peter, Michael, and Jack) who share a New York City apartment. All are busy with their jobs, girlfriends, and social lives and have no intention of settling down anytime soon. While actor Jack is away shooting a movie, a baby is left outside their apartment door with a note indicating that this is Jack's child from an affair with his co star (though he's previously been unaware of this offspring's existence). His two room mates mistakenly believe that they are to deliver the baby to a couple of men who appear at the door asking for 'a package'. Right before they are about to hand the baby over, they realize these men are drug dealers. Then the bachelors have to contend with the baby's care as well as the drug dealers' demands for payment.The three bachelors are played by famous name stars...Tom Sellick (Peter, the architect), Steve Guttenberg (Michael, the artist), and Ted Danson (Jack, the actor). Their considerable talents and playboyish charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. The unlikely trio must learn to juggle the demands of baby care with their careers and social lives. It's really fun to watch them in all the stereotypical hilarious circumstances of diapering and baby tending. The men's paternal instincts come into play and the bachelors grow quite attached to the little tyke.Directed by Leonard Nimoy (Spock, my favourite), this is a generally light, mindless, and entertaining movie that shows how these three 'hunks' & confirmed bachelors are won over by little baby Mary.

35,japamo,Everyone Loves Babies,8,9 August 2002,"I own this charming film on VHS tape.  It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember it with tender and life-affirming pleasure.  Indeed, it is a lightweight, somewhat implausible Hollywood comedy with three impossibly well-off, comely, and well-adjusted bachelors in a cavernous apartment (imagine the rent).  But Selleck, Guttenburg, and Danson earn their laughs (although I fould the latter just a tad stiff) and after cherubic baby Mary enters their lives, they earn our hearts.  During the middle of the film after the drug dealers have tied up the babysitter, trashed the apartment looking for the heroin, and left the baby in a closet with threats to return, when Selleck finds the baby and says, ""Nobody is going to hurt you, nobody is going to hurt you"", despite the unsavory drug plot, the movie grabs you in its caring but firm embrace.  When Mary's mother returns for the baby after abandoning her on the doorstep, at first you want to condemn her.  But when she tearfully explains to the trio why she did it, I think you forgive her. ""Three Men and a Baby"" demonstrates that the simple love of an adult for an infant is enough for a compelling story and will more than compensate for an awkwardly shoe-horned subplot and even Danson's (Mary's biological father's) negligence.There's a vital place on this planet for ""feel-good"" movies like ""Three Men and a Baby"".",Three Men and a Baby

41,Cherubin,Candy,6,18 April 2001,"""Three Men and a Baby"" is one of those movies like ""Ghostbusters"" that you enjoy in spite of the fact that you realize that they are only made for money and are otherwise empty. I saw this about three times when it was new and laughed like a loon each time. A couple of days ago, I saw a dubbed version on Czech TV. This time, only a few of the jokes made me laugh such as the drug hiding jokes, the scenes of the three roomies being obviously outside of their element with the baby and that masterpiece of a scene where Tom Selleck tells off the pompous Hungarian celloist (I always loved that one). Otherwise, the only other entertainment value is provided by the ""goofball with a heart of gold"" appeal of the three lead actors and a cute little baby for the more sentimental viewers. One thing which struck me though was just how garishly the 80s the music and the fashions were ! When people think ""good 1980s music"", they usually think of new wave and some of the better hard rock stuff. The music here, though, is exactly the kind of sugary drivel that is best left forgotten. And the fashions, of course, make everyone look like either a ""Miami Vice"" fan or an ultra clean cut Young Republican.

Maybe it's what I was brought up on: Rainbow, Jamie & The Magic Torch, Knight Rider ... but I could watch ""3 Men and a Baby"" a million times and STILL laugh at the funny bits, and cry at the sad or ""mushy"" bits. All I know is that you have to be a real cynic not to just kick back and let it carry you away for an hour and a half. By the way, I've been a technical support analyst, web/graphic designer and am now a software developer, so I'm NOT easily impressed.Now I know that the US has had the unfortunate habit of taking some foreign classics and rendering them unrecognisable, but not so here. The characters HAD to be played by Selleck, Guttenberg and Danson, simply because they're recognisable from their Magnum, Cadet Mahoney and Sam Malone roles (respectively), all of whom (incidentally) are synonymous with the ""macho, womanising bachelor"" lifestyle - THAT'S what make 'em believable here, and thus makes the film work so well. Like my erstwhile colleague observed, you could well believe that Selleck was about to pull out a grand any minute to avoid changing nappies.I'm a fan of a GOOD Euro-to-UK/US-remake; since I have no real-world knowledge of world languages nor their dialects, I often have to resort to reading the subtitles on foreign films, which detracts and distracts from the action on screen, such as facial expressions, body language, etc. But I'd put up with it if it's a good film. However, my wife detests subtitles, so the only way to get her to watch some of these classics is to watch the English/American remake: I for one can't wait for someone with a passion for world cinema to make a comparable version of Amelie, so my Babylove can grow to love it the way I did the original!

A few tear ran down my face and from that point on till today, this movie is one of my favorites of all time. Maybe its because I am a father that takes raising my kids seriously. Or its seeing three bumbling guys trying to take care of one baby and I have always taken care of my all 4 of my children, a lot of times on my own.

If you examine closely you will see that when to the right of Jack and his mother the gun and the boy are both at their frontal views. The gun and the boy never coexist within the scene.
