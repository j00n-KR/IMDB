0,TheLittleSongbird,Rob Zombie strikes back,1,17 January 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Its numerous sequels were wildly variable, with 'Halloween H20' being the only above decent one for me (the fourth one was also watchable but not much more) and 'Halloween: Resurrection' being proof that the series shouldn't have been resurrected and that it should have ended at 'H20', a perfect place to stop. Something that was further felt in Rob Zombie's awful first 'Halloween' outing from 2007. His second 'Halloween' film, this one, is even worse and even more pointless than its predecessor. The only real good thing here is the make-up which is pretty good. Brad Dourif comes off best in the acting department and does his best but he deserves better and has been better too.Everything else fails...and not just by a little. Catastrophically. The rest of the acting is scarier than Michael Myers himself (at his least creepy here) in how bad it is. Scout Taylor-Compton, in an embarrassingly appalling career-killing performance, and Sheri Moon Zombie, who should be nowhere near in front of a film camera, are especially bad. The film also brings the worst out of Malcolm McDowell, actually a good actor wasted in a very poorly written and used role.All the characters are bland, annoying or both, nobody is remotely likeable here or worth rooting for (even those intended to be) and the dialogue down there with the worst of SyFy and The Asylum, and worse. The production values are too gimmicky, Zombie continually seems to think taking a self-indulgent smug approach to his directing is being cool and the music is constantly at odds with the mood and the action, nothing atmospheric or appealing here and more outdated attempts at being cool. Overused and a vast majority of the time gratuitous expletives, artificial gore and sickeningly brutal violence completely get in the way of a coherent or engaging story, that's instead paper-thin, unintentionally silly, nonsensical, dull and contrived. As well as tension, suspense, chills or terror (none in sight). The whole Deborah and white horse stuff was not needed, felt completely misplaced and just added absurdity to the story, while the ending is as slap in the face a joke as it comes.In summary, awful and had no point to it whatsoever. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween II
1,SnoopyStyle,great for 24 minutes,4,26 October 2013,"Rob Zombie is remaking the sequel with Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode. The first third is very effective. He took the best part of the original Halloween II and just redid it with more blood and guts. That's actually a great plan. The hospital is a great isolated creepy place at night. It's perfect for horror.Then Rob Zombie goes off completely off the straight level paved road. He does the cinematic F.U. It's all a dream and everybody wasted their time. The rest is a crazy psycho artsy weirdo mess. If he stuck with redoing the original with more blood and gore, I think it could have been a worthy remake. I like the sleazy Loomis, and it's great to see Danielle Harris again. That would have been enough and it would have made a worthy remake.",Halloween II
2,claudio_carvalho,Annoying and Stupid Remake,3,15 July 2010,"Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is living with Sheriff Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif) and his daughter Annie (Danielle Harris) and she has dreadful nightmares with Michael Myers. On the night of Halloween, the greedy Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) releases a book disclosing that Laurie is actually Michael's sister Angel Meyers and she becomes unbalanced and disturbed with the discovery. Michael Meyers appears in town slaughtering everybody around Laurie. ""Halloween II"" is an annoying and stupid remake of the classic horror movie. Scout Taylor-Compton is irritating with her whimpering voice and she disrespects the role of the Queen of the Scream Jamie Lee Curtis. Most of the lines have the ""f-word"" or other swear word in the unintelligent screenplay of Rob Zombie. Maybe the best moment of this flick is listening to the Moody Blues singing ""Nights of White Satin"" in loop since they are singing the song inside the hospital and then they are in the beginning of the song in the lookout where Laurie hides. It is better off watching the classic again instead of this bloody crap. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Halloween II""",Halloween II
3,nogodnomasters,Hit the bricks Dorothy,4,31 October 2019,"The film picks up where the other one leaves off. The dead Michael Myers is carted off on the meat wagon. Oh, Wait! ""I'm not dead yet. I don't want to get on the cart!"" He wonders around the countryside for two years and then on Halloween he is back doing van conversions. The characters fell off a cliff. The writing for the second part was very substandard. I was disappointed with the sequel which included the addition or Weird Al, Margot Kidder, and Octavia Spencer who went to better things.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Sylvia Jefferies +uncredited)",Halloween II
4,kosmasp,Myers world,4,2 March 2010,"With the material on hand, I think the actors did a pretty neat job. Especially the lead actress Scout T. Compton, who had to go to extreme emotions pulled it off (in my opinion). And I'm talking about the theatrical release of course (although I'm looking forward to watch the Director's Cut, which I feel, will fill in some things, that I did miss in the theater).Having said that, it's a shame, that the movie couldn't have been more filled. And I don't mean more ""kills"" or more ""light"" (although I have to admit that it would have been a nice contrast), but the story as it is. The characters go certain ways, they have evolved after the first movie (or devolved, if that is even a word). Which also is one of the things most people criticize about the sequel.Rob couldn't please everybody and another Halloween will be made by another director. If he will pick up where Rob left off? We'll see, although I doubt that!",Halloween II
5,BA_Harrison,Kill the lot of em; see if I care.,3,5 July 2010,"I had hoped that, having spent so much of his god-awful Halloween remake exploring Michael Myer's white-trash upbringing and showing us how fragile his poor little mind had become, director Rob Zombie might be content to make the killer's next outing a simple but effective scary flick; I had hoped that he would at least try to give us one sympathetic character, rather than the collection of obnoxious, foul-mouthed teens that proliferated the first film; and I had hoped that he would try and keep his directorial and editing trickery to a minimum, employing the wobbly cam, rapid cuts, and different film stocks only when absolutely necessary.Fat chance.Halloween II features as much, if not more, superfluous investigation of the killer's fractured psyche as Halloween; the victims are just as deserving of a butcher's knife through the skull as before; and Zombie's addiction to ugly film-making gimmicks seems to be getting worse with each movie. Even the film's enjoyably brutal and bloody murders cannot compensate for the endless visual and narrative garbage that the director spews onto the screen.On top of all these major issues that I have with Zombie's film, there are also one or two little niggles that just compound my hatred for this crap-fest: Margot Kidder's Rorschach painting isn't open to interpretation—it's clearly a friggin' picture of horses!; why is Loomis's book advertised on a huge hoarding in a field in the middle of nowhere?; would even a total slut grab a random guy in a mask for a shag without even taking the mask off first to see who she is doing?; and why couldn't 'Weird Al' Yankovic have been a victim?Oh well, at least this sequel has given me a renewed respect for the original Halloween II, which didn't get me frothing at the mouth with rage and screaming 'Please Stop!' even louder than Scout Taylor-Completelyuseless's Laurie as she tries to flag down a passing car driven by yet another gormless soon-to-be victim.",Halloween II
6,Coventry,The Night He Should Have Stayed Buried,1,4 March 2010,"I realize this may sound somewhat silly and stupid, but I honestly feel downright betrayed by Rob Zombie! I always liked him as a musician, but also considered him to be a terrific new horror director who obviously knows the genre and worships the older and bona fide creepy horror classics. His remake of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" in 2007 was regarded at by many fans of the genre as pure and shameless blasphemy, but even that film I personally liked because it was an exciting and non-stop spitfire of brutal violence, dark & unsettling scenery, eerie sound effects and graphic make-up art that don't leave too much to the imagination. This sequel, however, is painfully horrendous! Rob Zombie had absolutely nothing to add to the Michael Myers saga, and he knew it. ""Halloween II"" is substantially void and exaggeratedly pretentious, which is a really frustrating combination. Until now I assumed that Rob Zombie disposed of the ""right"" horror attitude, meaning he brought straightforward and genuinely grim stuff, but now all of a sudden he shows pseudo-psychological ambitions and actually makes a pretty big fool of himself. The basic principles of cinema are actually a bit similar to the rules of marketing and economy. There's a little rule called supply and demand, for example. You don't supply something for which there is no demand. In case of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II"" this translates as: nobody demanded a deeply psycho-social and metaphor infested portrait of Michael Myers. Ever since John Carpenter created him in 1978, Michael Myers has been a one-dimensional psychopath with a white mask and sharp knife. We were all fine with that, but now Rob Zombie insists on depicting him as a mentally tormented child that never grew up. To illustrate this, there are approximately five thousand dream/hallucination sequences of Zombie's ugly wife (Sheri Moon Zombie) walking next to a white horse and the child version of Michael Myers. What's the added value? What's even the point? Other than with the wannabe intellectual psychological themes, ""Halloween II"" also embarrassingly fails at being a regular horror film. The main plot of Michael Myers going after Laurie Strode again isn't at all compelling, suspenseful or even remotely interesting. Michael Myers literally walks out of a hearse alive and kicking – after the driver stupidly ran into a cow on the road (!) – and promptly goes after his little sister again. I can't really explain why, but even the returning characters that I appreciated in the first film came across as really irritating and insupportable in the sequel. Laurie Strode, for example, was a really cool youthful heroine in the first film, but she's a whiny and spoiled drama-queen in the sequel. In fact, the only reasonably worthwhile sub plot in this film centers on Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) who turned into a sleazy and media-addicted scumbag who made a fortune by exploiting his sessions with Michael Myers. Last but not least, ""Halloween II"" is a very unpleasant movie to look at. Usually this is a positive thing for horror movies, but not in this case. This is a very UGLY and mean-spirited film and the numerous death-sequences will leave you with a bad feeling in your stomach. The few sympathetic characters (like Laurie's friend Annie) die in horrible ways or suffer tremendously while the real scum gets away with everything. And that's just not right, not even if you exclusively watch horror films to see gore. And did I mention it's boring, repetitive and clueless? Many people mock the numerous sequels in the original franchise (Halloween 1 – 7 with Donald Pleasance) but they were all masterpieces compared to this piece of unendurable trash. After this, you owe us another awesome film in the style of ""The Devil's Rejects"", Rob!",Halloween II
7,michaelRokeefe,Michael Myers is back.,4,12 January 2010,"Rob Zombie at the helm, writing, directing and co-producing this follow-up to his 2007 HALLOWEEN. The story isn't much compared to the original franchise; but it is brutally violent and grisly. Special effects are first rate for being gruesome. This film just seems to be a lumbering mess. Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie reprises her role as Deborah Myers. Its that time again to ""trick-or-treat"" in Haddonfield, Illinois, where psycho Michael Myers(Tyler Maine) left unexplained carnage. Mean Mike breaks out of the institution, not before he leaves a bloody mess. He has urgent needs to return home to finish up on some family business. His sister(Ms. Zombie) is still there as well as his surviving victim Laurie Strode(Scout Taylor-Compton). To capitalize on the infamous holiday, Michael's doctor Samuel Loomis(Malcolm McDowell)is in town to plug his new book. As expected Halloween will once again be bloody.I'm not real fond of the White Horse aspect nor the visions of little Michael and his mother; they could have been left out entirely. Plus the F word was way over-used. And the actress playing Laurie is so bad and irritating, you could care less how long she survived. Also starring are: Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris, with smaller roles for Margot Kidder, Howard Hesseman and Bill Fagerbakke.",Halloween II
8,Scarecrow-88,Rob Zombie's Halloween II,5,15 January 2010,"I had the misfortune of watching the director's cut of Rob Zombie's Halloween II. My worst nightmare was realized..we get even MORE of Sheri Moon and that awful, awful replacement for Daeg, Chase Vanek.I tell you there's this scene where Scout Taylor-Compton is standing on a table drunk talking about how she wants to party, her Laurie Strode in this one is so insufferable, I wanted her to lean her head up just a little higher so the ceiling fan could take it off.I'm just not inspired enough to write a synopsis. I'm not about to critique this too much. Plenty of people hate or loathe it enough, and there's dissection of this movie in lots of places across the Internet. Take your pick.Look, I realize that Zombie's films have ""ingredients"" that will appeal to some, and alienate others. The non-stop profanity, which normally doesn't bother me, just grew tiresome. It didn't seem to aggravate me as much when I watched Zombie's theatrical version, but you pile on all that white horse, Ghoul Sheri Moon and Young Michael absolutely everywhere and in so many more scenes than before, and I was bound to become beleaguered with this movie. One thing is for certain, this sequel is brutal and violent. I counted 11 times that Michael Myers stabs nurse Octavia in the really cool opening hospital sequence. I believe the body count was 18 people, give or take one or two. The butcher knife is put to good use. An ax, a strangulation, a bone snaps(..protruding from the arm), the face/head crush under MM's boot heel, and the infamous mirror bashing which was off-the-charts sadistic. My favorite grisly scene is the surgery..that delivers the goods, and I imagine Herschel Gordon Lewis would be proud. I mean, Zombie's camera just lingers on wounds being sewn up, really great stuff. The effects, for the most part, I definitely was more than impressed/satisfied.I guess, the hospital sequence(..until it concludes in the guard shack)is my favorite complete set piece. Once Laurie is shown ""Zombie-fied"", I lost interest fast. Laurie so grated on my nerves, watching this all the way through was extremely difficult.I had fun with Malcolm McDowell, truth be told, and thought he had some nasty, acidic, acerbic, but funny dialogue along the way. I agree with some others that he belongs in another Zombie movie absent the Halloween franchise. Loomis is so positively sleazy, that his ""absolution"" is too little too late. Loomis, for the most part, remains outside the universe of Myers, interesting enough. I must be honest, I am part of that large volume of folks who didn't like the idea at all of showing Michael's face. I felt Zombie wanted to bring out a more human monster..I'll say this, man, he is impervious to bodily harm because those hick hunters sure land some blows before he dispatches them.Poor Annie, I mean, boy, does Myers finish what he started, or what?!?! Good grief. I could go on about how trashy the Sheriff Bracket house is on the inside, and how much different the exteriors of it look, but the army of critics have done so already..no use beating a dead horse, although that damn white horse could've used a clubbing.The DC extends the psychiatrist sessions between Laurie and Margot Kidder's quite tolerant doc(..if Laurie had talked to me like she does her, I'd have knocked her block off), and we see how psychosis runs in the family..yep, more of the white horse stuff, and she is starting to envision Mama Myers, too, oh joy, oh bliss. We also see how Annie and Laurie's friendship has deteriorated since the night Myers came home..understandably so if you had to live with Laurie, who could fault Annie for being so sick and tired of her?! 3/10 for director's cut, 5/10 for theatrical version. The newly added climax for the DC was the proverbial nail in the coffin of my night..boy, what a stinker.",Halloween II
9,preppy-3,Not as bad as the 2007 redo...but that's VERY faint praise!,2,2 September 2009,"This starts right after the 2007 ""Halloween"". Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton--not making anyone forget Jamie Lee Curtis) has survived her battle with her brother Michael Myers but is (understandably) a basket case. It cuts to a year later. Laurie is living with Sheriff Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif) and his wife Annie (Danielle Harris). Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is making a living off of the murders that occurred. Micahel Myers (inexplicably) returns and hunts down Laurie to kill her.OK--I HATED the 2007 redo. This is only marginally better because Zombie isn't totally destroying a classic like he did last time. However this is NOT a good movie. The swearing is nonstop--I haven't heard the ""f"" word used so much since ""The Departed"". The main character (Laurie) is annoying and pathetic and I couldn't stand her. The story stops making sense at an alarming rate, characters act inconsistently and what the HELL is this with Michael's mom AND his younger self appearing nonstop? Also it's in faded color, grainy film stock and the violence is STRONG and graphic. And there are plenty of sequences where people are being attacked by Michael--but it's only a dream!!!! I mean COME ON! That was old back in the 1980s! The only saving graces are the uniformly strong performances and a really great ending involving Michael, Laurie and Loomis in a shack. Still this is a dull and pointless sequel. Zombie was forced into making this--and it shows (remember how he made it clear he WOULDN'T make ""Halloween 2""?). Well--they're ready to make ""Halloween 3-D"" for next year!!! Thankfully Zombie won't be doing that--but it will be yet another needless sequel. This actually makes the 1981 ""Halloween 2"" look like a great horror film! I give this a 2.",Halloween II
10,poolandrews,Not quite as bad as I expected but not too far off.,4,10 March 2010,"Halloween II starts as a bloody & terrified Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton)is found wondering down a street by Sheriff Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif) after the events of the original Halloween (2007), the supposedly dead body of mass murderer Michael Myers (Tyler mane) is found but on the way to the morgue the ambulance crashes & his body mysteriously disappears. Two years later & it's October 31st & Laurie is now living with her friend Annie (Danielle Harris) & Sheriff Brackett, it's Halloween & Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowall) is publicising his book about Michael myers & his bloody killing spree, Laurie picks the book up & while reading it discovers that she is in fact Michael Myers sister Angel. Meanwhile Michael himself is very much alive & returns to Haddonfield to kill Laurie prompted by the ghost of their long dead mother killing anyone else he meets in the process...Shot under various working titles such as Halloween 10, H2 & Halloween II: The Devil Walks Among Us this was written, co-produced & directed by Rob Zombie & is a sequel to his remake of the classic horror slasher Halloween (1978), while the original Halloween did have a sequel called Halloween II (1981) this is not a remake of that but a sequel to Zombie's remake if that makes sense. Annoyingly available in both standard theatrical versions & the obligatory Director's Cut which runs nearly twenty minutes longer & significantly changes the film including the ending I simply cannot believe the Blu-ray I borough only contained the shorter theatrical cut, what a waste of disc space & a real rip-off (I only found out there was a Director's Cut after I had brought the Blu-ray), as such I will be basing my comments on the shorter theatrical version. I admit to not liking the original Halloween that much (either the 1978 or 2007 ones) but I did like the original Halloween II from 1981 & the first twenty odd minutes of this plays like a revamped modernized remake that I dug but once the homage is over & this Halloween II goes in it's own direction it fell apart for me & gradually got worse & worse. Halloween II picks up where the remake left off & fans of that film will probably like this but with unsympathetic character's (the hissy fit that Laurie throwed when she found out she was Michaels sister was enough for me to want to kill her), a shallow story that doesn't even seem to do the basics right (not enough stalking or slashing for my liking) & a few odd little moments (Michaels hallucinations of a white horse) that seem out of place & were probably intended to be deep or meaningful but come across as awkward & bizarre. At over 100 minutes it felt long & the pace of the opening twenty odd minutes is never recaptured in a rather dull slasher, the ending of the theatrical cut is also bad as it hints at Laurie being the next psycho killer of the family & it kills off Dr. Loomis who was the only fun character in the entire thing. Give me the original early 80's Halloween II over this any day of the week.I don't usually pass comment on such things but the Blu-ray also sucked big time, it has the worst picture of any film I have. I am positive that the lack of colour, the lifeless picture & the horrible fuzzy grain were deliberate 'artistic' choices made by Zombie & the makers & that the Blu-ray accurately represents what Zombie made & how he made it but I just thought I looked awful. I was disappointed in the gore levels too after a good opening involving a decapitation, lots of blood, a gory operation, a mutilated cow, some gut eating & some gory stabbings but that's as good as it got as the rest of the films gore is incomprehensible fast edits that ultimately show nothing & have little impact. The usual modern film techniques are here, bleached out colours, fast editing, shaky hand held camera & a disregard for the audience. Halloween II is just an ugly film & it's even worse on Blu-ray because the annoying techniques used stand out even more. Michael is quite good here as a villain & his mask is quite creepy, there are one or two half decent scenes with a bit of tension & the opening homage to Halloween II in the hospital is fun which the rest of the film can't live up to.With a budget of about $15,000,000 this had a decent budget & it show's with good production design, effects & music. Filmed mostly in Atlanta in Georgia. The acting is alright, genre favourite Brad Dourif is great as is veteran Malcolm McDowall while Rob's wife Sheri Moon Zombie appears as a ghost. Danielle Harris has now appeared in four separate Halloween films while Margot Kidder & Caroline Williams (the DJ in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)) both have small roles.Halloween II wasn't as bad as I was expecting but it's not far off, the first twenty odd minutes are alright while the rest is pretty crap to be honest & has all the annoying modern film-making techniques that many just don't like. I'd rather watch the 80's Halloween II again to be honest & even the Blu-ray sucks. Enough of a success for the IMDb to already list Halloween III (2011) as in production.",Halloween II
11,dbborroughs,After a disturbing opening 20 minutes the film begins to shift gears and lose its way. Its a good looking but uneven film,5,3 September 2009,"Rob Zombie proves himself one of the most frustrating filmmakers working today, something he began with the first Halloween film he directed. The first film was an odd mix of note perfect horror mixed with some odd flourishes and story changes that made little sense either to the legend of Michael Myers, or to the internal consistency of the film itself. Here he continues ""the night he came home"" from the moment the first film ended and takes it off in other directions. Zombie c starts the film with a scene between the young Michael Myers and his Mom in a hospital. It's a well done scene about a dream Michael had had. The film then shifts gears to Laurie Strode walking down the street after Michael has been stopped in the first film. What follows is about 20 minutes of pure visceral horror and terror as Laurie is taken to the hospital and the seemingly dead Michael Myers gets up and follows her leaving a trail of bodies along the way. It doesn't really make a great deal of sense but it doesn't matter Zombie has filmed the sequences in such away that they are dreamlike and work on a deeper level than reason. Then Myers leaves and Laurie is left alone. The film shifts to a year later and we see Laurie worrying about the upcoming holiday and with her friends. She visits her shrink, a very good Margo Kidder, before the film begins to spin out of control as we get scenes of Laurie's friends (which begin to crack the mood), and most damaging scenes of Malcolm McDowell's Loomis on a book tour. The leaking in and injection of the humor destroys any and all sense of horror.What was Zombie thinking? I'm sure he thought it would work, but it really doesn't and the result is once again a scatter-shot film that mirrors in many ways the first film. When Zombie gets it right it's great, even when the film begins to fall apart the film has moments, shots, little bits that show what this film could have been. This could have and should have been a real visceral punch in the gut. But the film moves off to somewhere else. I can see what Zombie was doing, I understand the mix he was going for but he never managed to get it to keep it all together. The various parts (the serious horror and the humor clash as does the real and dream) of the film rub against each other making everyone unhappy. I loved the first chunk of the film (and most of the dream sequences), I'm really mixed with the rest.In Zombies defense I think the problem is that Myers is an almost impossible character to work with. His creation came at the right time and place to grab the psyche of the public. Ultimately He is a blank ""shape"" and nothing more.Unfortunately he really is a bland character because of his unstop-ability, silence and lack of anything except killing, the films really rely on everything around him to generate tension. If the surrounding characters and settings aren't there the films fail.Worse over the last 30 years the original has spawned too many copies. Because he's bland he's easily copied, and because all one need do is add a few details to have it seem more clever you got Jason. Those that followed the strict Meyers mode created a series of one off films that went nowhere. I think even the original producers knew they were limited hence the change of plot for the third film. I think Meyers survived in film goers minds because the first film was so good and had become a classic, not because of any other reason. If you think about it once you keep Meyers from the chase the films fall apart, that's what happens here as well. The first films work because they build up this monster and then turn him loose. But once you stop him, unless you can have him on an endless hunt the films are doomed to fail because there is nothing outside of that hunt to interest the audience. That's what happened here. Zombie starts mid hunt and its great then he stops and refocuses our interest and it all falls down.I don't think the current sequel is the total disaster that most people think, but it is a disappointment, but it's a disappointment that was bound to happen because the material won't allow for anything else other than failure. Short of a 90 minute chase this was never going to work. (Perhaps if it had been chase inter cut with flash backs it might have worked). Fans should probably wait for cable or DVD.I know I need to see this film again to really write on it more clearly.",Halloween II
12,lastliberal,I know he's not gonna come back just because of some stupid holiday.,7,30 August 2009,"Surely the Halloween purists will keep the flame burning by trashing this film. I am so sorry that they cannot get beyond themselves and see that Rob Zombie has taken the crown from Mario Bava, Jesus Franco, and, dare I say it, Dario Argento, as the king of bloody horror.You may not like the loud music, the lack of any real plot other than Michael's (Tyler Mane) desire to fulfill his mother's (Sheri Moon Zombie) command that he reunite the family.Most of the film deals with the pain and trauma that plagues Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton). What is real and what is fantasy? You are constantly jumping back and forth. The film demands much of the viewer, but one thing it gives you is 101 minutes of pure slasher pleasure. It is never boring.The cinematography was fantastic. The mood was set perfectly by the shots and the lighting. The music was loud, as were the screams, but the film went soundless at just the right times. Zombie shows himself to be getting better and better with this film. I cannot wait to see more of his work.There were a lot of great actors/characters in the film, but one has to particularly note Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis. You just could not wait for him to get his just desserts. You knew it was coming. You wanted it to come. When it finally does, there is a satisfaction that self-righteous assholes usually get what's coming to them.Don't miss this film if you are an Italian horror/slasher fan. You will not be disappointed.",Halloween II
13,zardoz-13,Nightmare in Haddonfield,10,2 September 2009,"No, you don't have to be a degenerate to enjoy director Rob Zombie's violent remake/sequel of ""Halloween 2."" Director Rick Rosenthal's original ""Halloween 2"" (1981) qualified as a one-dimensional, no-brainer sequel bloodbath with stabalicious Michael Myers prowling a hospital and killing everybody in sight, not always with a knife. Michael assumed a supernatural omnipotence in ""Halloween 2"" and he survived virtually everything, even being blinded by Laurie. Nevertheless, ""Halloween 2"" told us nothing new about Michael other than he derived satisfaction from killing more people in different ways. Writer & director Zombie doesn't make this mistake with ""Halloween 2"" and it is virtually as brilliant and psychologically insightful as its predecessor. The cinematography and the songs, especially ""Nights in White Satin"" by the Moody Blues, enhance the atmosphere of this chiller. Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" is a surreal saga and a commentary about family values. This remake of ""Halloween 2"" is far more ambitious, gruesome, and psychological than the original.Briefly, in the prologue, Zombie flashbacks to 10-year old Michael at the mental asylum conversing with his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie of ""House of 1000 Corpses"") about a white horse that she has given him. The first thing we see is a definition of a white horse and that it symbolizes the rage of the protagonist. Meanwhile, the Michael that talks with his mom is the Michael before he retreated behind the mask. Sure, it is unfortunate Zombie couldn't bring back Daeg Faerch to reprise his role as young Michael. According to Zombie, young Faerch had grown too old to play a 10-year old. Nevertheless, Chase Wright Vanek brings his chilly presence to the role, resembling a murderous munchkin.Thereafter, Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" replicates the original as ambulances deliver both Laurie and Annie (Danielle Harris) to Haddonfield Hospital where the emergency room physicians perform miracles, especially the hacked up Annie. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif of ""Dune"") orders the coroner to lock up Michael's body until he can examine it. No sooner have the two sleazy attendants loaded Michael and driven off than they slam into a cow on the highway, killing the driver instantly, smashing up his partner, and allowing Michael to escape. At the hospital, Laurie isn't doing so well. Laurie is frantic about Annie and she still suffers from the trauma of having emptied a revolver into Michael. Just as she is regaining her grip on reality, Michael comes a-slashing and nobody can keep him out. He chases a hysterical Laurie during a storm around the hospital and corners her in the security guard shack with a fire axe. He chops his way into the shack, but Laurie manages to escape.Indeed, Laurie escapes by waking up. Dreams, hallucinations, and nightmares pervade ""Halloween 2"" and you can never be sure when reality is real. Michael is driven by the image of a giant white horse held on a rope by his dutiful mom Deborah, with himself standing alongside her as an angelic 10-year adolescent. Family solidarity means a lot to Michael, and Michael has sworn to reunite the family, even if it means butchering Laurie like a steer. However, Zombie shows us a deeper, psychic linkage between Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Michael. When Michael (Tyler Mane of "" Troy "") slaughters a dog and dines on it, Zombie cross-cuts images of Michael devouring the dog with Laurie eating a pizza. Psychically, Michael and Laurie groove on the same wavelength and Laurie winds up vomiting. because she can taste the dog meat. Without spelling it out in dialogue, Zombie tells us it is this deep, psychic connection between Michael and Laurie as blood kin that enables him to track her down.Life after Halloween has not been a picnic for Laurie. She visits her therapist (Margo Kidder of ""Superman""), works at an old hippie-style coffee house run by none other than Howard Hesseman of ""WKRP in Cincinnati ,"" and hangs out with two trippy girlfriends. Repeatedly, Laurie has lurid nightmares about Michael's attacks, but Michael is nowhere nearby. Indeed, he has gone into hiding in the woods, until two pugnacious rednecks catch up with him and too late realize their error. Like the original ""Halloween 2,"" Laurie doesn't know she is related to Michael Myers, and this revelation scrambles her brain.Laurie Strode is the chief protagonist in ""Halloween 2"" and the film justly belongs to Scout Taylor-Compton as she struggles to survive. She lives now with Annie and her father at their rural house. Not only does ""Halloween 2"" look different from its predecessor, but also Zombie emphasizes the rural quality of the area. In his remake of ""Halloween,"" we were trapped along with the principals in what appeared to be a rural suburb. ""Halloween 2"" takes us back to the woods. Michael spends his time communing with nature and the visions of his mother, the white horse, and himself as an innocent adolescent before he resumes his murderous ways.Not surprisingly, the violence in ""Halloween 2"" is gruesome but not sickening. In other words, we rarely see close-ups of the knife penetrating flesh. Zombie's favorite tactic is to let Michael strike just as things are calming down and part of this involves sudden movements and things like glass or wood shattered by his fists. There are moments when the violence takes on a traumatic weight that will scare the daylights out of the squeamish while gorehounds may yawn at some of Zombie's discretions.""Halloween 2"" is both a triumph in style and substance with an ending that suggests Zombie may pull the biggest surprise in the franchise should the saga continue.",Halloween II
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I bet you didn't think a knife could dig that far down that fast,3,9 December 2010,"Based on the Director's Cut(it appears to be the superior one). After the first one showed us how a chubby little girl grew up to be a man with the figure of a friggin' wrestler, in this, he returns(and no one notices, of course) and we see Laurie trying to deal with the trauma. The latter is actually pretty good. There is genuine, credible psychology and if one was to cut just those portions together, this would be a nice little short about what tragedy can do to a survivor. Unfortunately, it's not the only plot in this. We also follow Michael. And yes, he kills more, the deaths are better(this has well-done gore and brutal, bloody violence, and plenty of it... oh, and nudity and sex, too; also, constant swearing) and actually creative and effective this time. However... it's his mother who tells him to slaughter. Yes, she's a ghost. And she's on a white horse. You know, I was worried this would be as stupid and as much of a waste of time as the one preceding it, and then I found out it was worse. Loomis returns, as well... he's a jerk who's gotten rich off what happened to him and the others. Why we keep seeing him here is a mystery... he's inherently unlikable now, and it's not like we loved him before. The characters aren't all obnoxious(with that said, half are, and some are perverted and disgusting), and the acting isn't horrible. Harris does well, and Taylor-Compton is OK. The FX are great, and that goes for a bit of the editing and hand-held cinematography, too. Dialog is dumb. You know, this could have been a fine if forgettable slasher, or a smart drama. It tried to be both, and the appropriately named Zombie penned the script, and here we are. You can do better. I recommend this solely to those who love Rob's style. 3/10",Halloween II

16,view_and_review,Soulless Sequel,2,5 October 2021,"Whatever happened to Haddonfield, Illinois? And more importantly, what happened to the people of Haddonfield? Wow they became the trashiest of trash and that includes Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Dr. Loomis (Malcom McDowell). Rob Zombie did like every sequel-maker does--he went for more: more blood, more killing, more vile, more everything. But guess what it's not? More better.The 2007 Halloween reboot was actually pretty dang good. It was more of a Michael Myers origin story than anything. The follow up was a soulless work with profanity and gutter behavior as a substitute for real script-writing. Most of the women were goth nudists all part of the same cult of vamps looking to have a good time. Even Laurie joined that clique. Dr. Loomis was now a greedy opportunist who sought to capitalize on Michael Myers' brutality with a book. The new Laurie and Dr. Loomis were a horrible version of the originals.How did Michael do?Even he was worse. We know Michael was never killed in part one, that's why we have a part two, so that's nothing new. But this Michael Myers broke character as much as Laurie Strode and Dr. Loomis did. The Michael of old never went out of his way to kill and he never seemed to be doing it for any emotional reasons. He wanted Laurie and he would kill whoever came between him and her. He never roamed the countryside racking up bodies, his body count was always going to be a direct line to Laurie. In ""Halloween II"" 2009 he is zig-zagging all over the place to catch bodies. Furthermore, he seems to be killing with anger which he never had before. He's even letting out audible grunts of rage as he superfluously stabs his victims. It's not a Michael I'm familiar with or like.At the end of it all we end up with a bunk movie made just to be shocking with the gruesomeness, the foul-language, and the nudity. As I said, soulless.",Halloween II
17,anaconda-40658,Even Worse.,4,11 September 2015,"Halloween 2 (2009): Dir: Rob Zombie / Cast: Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, Brad Dourif, Danielle Harris, Sheri Moon Zombie: Starts off where the first film left off just as the original Halloween 2 began where the original Halloween left off. Director Rob Zombie takes a different path by going ahead a few years and using only the first act to reference the substantial hospital scenes in the original Halloween 2. This is effective because in the original sequel, Myers is reduced to a zombie like stalker in hospital corridors. Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis survives the attacks from the previous film but unlike Donald Pleasence, he turns the character into a fame seeker selling his book about his encounters. This adds some humour as well as critical reception when he is accused of exploiting the murders. How Loomis is ultimately dealt with is another lame and graphic encounter with Myers. Scout Taylor-Compton as victim Laurie Stroud is given more to do. The Sheriff finds her that night and after extreme therapy she is living with him and his daughter Annie. She discovers her birth right before she ultimately visits a Smiths Grove. Brad Dourif plays the Sheriff while Danielle Harris plays his rebellious ill fated daughter. Sheri Moon Zombie appears briefly as mother Myers leading a white horse about. Visually well made alteration of the original sequel. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Halloween II
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Dredging the bottom of the series' barrel,5,9 May 2015,"Returning from the dead, Michael Myers follows the instructions of his ghostly mother while continuing a bloody path of terror back to his hometown looking for his sister, unaware of her true legacy and the maniac coming for her.On the whole this was quite the disappointing effort with a ton of problems. The biggest issue here is the rather lame continuations of the events from the first film, only they're even worse here by feeling even more pretentious. The feeling of exploring the relationship even more is just unbelievably ham fisted by continuing to show off the irritating them of the ghost mother and white horse throughout the whole film is some completely ludicrous series of scenes that rarely get to anything remotely interesting when they occur. The concept is laughable to begin with, and the scenes are just endless with her doing the same encouraging speeches each time which makes the whole process so hard to get into. Other boring parts here include the series of utterly useless and overlong parts of her living with the adopted family at the beginning which just take forever to get through as well as having Loomis in the film as he does nothing for the film and just makes for a wholly troubling time with him taking all that time needlessly. Likewise, even further problems such as the incomprehensibly lame decision to party upon the discovery of his true identity or the ridiculous multitude of dreams on display that just quite painful to sit through or the need to curse simply for the sake of doing so all really hurts this one with so many damaging efforts that the few small positives here barely even register. The film is easily at its best when dealing with the stalking and different encounters within this, as not only does this one factor provide some nice blood and gore in the different kills but also has some rather fun times as the woodland stalking after the house ambush as well as the party scenes and strip- club sequence all feature lengthy, complex scenarios that get plenty of action and suspenseful antics throughout here. Most notably here is the early escape from the hospital providing this with its best overall scene as the rather lengthy scenes stumbling along the hallways and into the basement trying to escape all makes for a pretty unsettling scene. The only other positive for this one is the fact that it really manages to effectively capture the aftermath of the first film as the chaos of the situation is handled appropriately and certainly seems logical in actions based on what happened previously as well as the setup the preceding action nicely. Still, all the flaws hold this one down.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and Nudity.",Halloween II
19,FlashCallahan,"PG tips, and make it sizzling.....",8,8 October 2011,"Michael Myers is still at large and no less dangerous than ever.After a failed reunion to reach his baby sister at their old home, Laurie Strode is immediately taken to a hospital to be treated by the wounds that had been afflicted by her brother a few hours ago.However, Michael isn't too far off and will continue his murdering 'Halloween' rampage until he gets his sister all to himself..If you've seen a Zombie movie before, you will know that they are disturbing and sometimes, very insane. This is no different, but the fact that it's so much better than Zombies first take on Myers says a lot.This film has a very strange 'homely' feel to it. it's as if Zombie wants you to feel Empathy for Myers, as the people he kills only get in his way or cause him grief during his quest.we even see his human side when a little boy asks if he is a giant. But it's full of such sporadic and mental characters and imagery, it can be very hard to like, or even tolerate.And the film is very violent and quite full on. The scene in the hospital is unflinching and focuses on the number of times myers stabs the nurse making you feel helpless and a little grubby.The performances are good if a little bizarre, and the inclusion of a white horse, almost makes this somewhat mystical. The scenes with MacDowall relieve a little of the tension, and are a little comedic, lifting the sense of dread that the film exudes.It's a great movie and compared to the spate of recent remakes, good fun.",Halloween II
20,Aaron1375,"Brutal and gruesome sequel, plus boobies...what is there not to like?",9,31 August 2009,"I enjoyed this sequel quite a bit. It started quite briskly and never let up during its runtime. Very good tension manufactured throughout, and a rather interesting subplot featuring what actually is motivating Michael Myers to basically fight off death by the gunshot he sustained at the end of the previous movie. Add to that a supernatural edge to the movie and many scenes that look almost Gothic as Myer's walks through the countryside. The movie is not much of a remake of the original Halloween II sequel, but it does give it a nod in the form of a very well done hospital scene right at the beginning of the film. This quickly yields to the present where once again Halloween is fast approaching, Laurie is still feeling the effects of her first encounter with Michael, and Dr. Loomis is basically trying to pitch his new book where he is going to reveal even more facts about Myers. Brad Douriff is back as the sheriff and plays a much bigger role in the sequel which I really enjoyed as he is one of those actors I find to do really good jobs, but they never seem to get good roles in more mainstream fare. The kills are nice and brutal once again especially the one involving Myer's and his foot. There is also a strange dream sequence, which to me seemed like it came from another sort of horror movie ""Erasure Head"". It was in black and white and these strange people were having dinner and one of those characters reminded me of the lady in the radiator. Of course, Rob Zombie may not have been thinking of that movie when doing that scene, but it sure reminded me of it. The movie is not perfect though, I thought there were some really bad attempts at humor especially the scene featuring Weird Al Yankovic that seemed to not belong in the movie at all. The end was also a bit anti-climatic as I thought the end for Michael in the original Halloween II was a bit more fitting. All in all though I enjoyed the movie and just have to ask Rob Zombie ""When are you going to make a zombie film?""",Halloween II
21,trashgang,further away from Halloween,5,19 November 2010,"I really enjoyed the first attempt of Rob with his view on Michael Myers, but here things go terribly wrong. As with so many sequels the killer is more in the headlight with stupid things. Remember Freddy Kreuger suddenly peeling an apple with his glove. Here we have some weird things going on, he's seeing his mom dressed in white with a white horse. Michael going to the supernatural. Even his sister has the same problems, she's seeing the same demons. All of that takes the movie away from being a slasher to another dimension. Even the fact that we see Michael without his mask is for me not done. It takes away the mystery of the killer. It's like Pinhead (hellraiser) standing in full light. Even the part of Loomis is sometimes too long and takes you further away from Michael. Not as good as his first attempt.",Halloween II
22,mm-39,Rob can not direct or produce a great story.,3,4 September 2009,"I found Halloween 2 to be an awful movie, but I have seen worse. The directing was awful. There was no continuity for the script, and the concurrent movie stories did not intertwine well. The movie had no build up for the story just action. Even the action scenes were predictable. Does Rob know how to create characters who are other than trailer trash. Everyone uses the f word and yells. Rob needs more balance persona for his movies characters. There were a few good parts to the Halloween movie. One see's how angry and deranged Micheal is. Just nothing but anger with this guy. The other theme that big people are hard to hurt message got across well with the film. I notice silence with the Michael character creates a stronger emotion than dialogue.

24,namashi_1,Rob Zombie's not-so-scary fare...,4,13 January 2010,"Rob Zombie is an Icon, loved his musical work & also as a filmmaker. His first interpretation of 'Halloween' which released in 2007 is one of my all-time favorite films. 'Halloween' is a brand, a name which creates a terror in you... so obviously you expect the moon from this latest 'Halloween' flick, unfortunately, this only gives us a mirage.The problem with 'Halloween 2' is its writing. Zombie, the director is in form, but the writer isn't. 'Halloween 2' starts superbly, the entire Michael-chasing-Laurie sequence at the hospital is memorable, but right after that it loses its grip. 2007 had a success in Michael Myers, but 2009 didn't. Which is a visible fact! Coming to acting, Scout Taylor-Compton is truly fantastic. Malcolm McDowell is wasted. Sheri Moon Zombie looks gorgeous, as always. Tyler Mane is fine. Others are passable.One truly expected much more from Zombie!",Halloween II
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Rob Zombie threw a party and Michael Myers just happened to drop by,1,28 August 2009,"A couple years ago we had the release of the re-make Halloween, directed by Rob Zombie, he claimed that it wasn't a re-make as more of his own vision. I was very much looking forward to it and was greatly let down. So when I heard that Rob was working on the sequel, I just laughed and knew I wasn't going to see this movie. But then I saw the trailer for the film and darnit, curse Rob Zombie for feeding my hunger towards scare and gore. The trailer looked so great, I just had to see the sequel, I don't know maybe it had hidden messages saying ""see this movie"" or something. But I saw Halloween 2 today and once again, I fell for it! Now I think Rob Zombie is a very talented director, his visionary style is incredible, coming from a graphic design background, I admit this movie still has some great and creepy images. He has this knack for these gritty horror films and I believe that down the line his film The Devil's Rejects will be a cult classic. The reason why; despite the fact that The Devil's Rejects is somewhat of an homage to the old gritty dark horror films of the 1970's, it was exactly meant for Zombie as it was his vision that made it into the classic that it will be. Halloween is not meant for Zombie and the reason why is in one word: Simplicity.Simplicity being the reason why this isn't Zombie's picture to mess around with, Michael Myers is evil, no specific reason why, he just is. As we saw in the first movie, Zombie tried giving Myers a soul and it took away the scare more than give it to the audience. He's made Michael Myers into a bum, or at least he looks like one, take for example: The Mask. Myers does not wear the mask for most of the film or at least it's ripped off and we can see a good amount of Myer's face and it's not Michael Myers without the iconic mask. His look for me is just all off as well, I don't see his height as much of something to be bothered by, while his kills are extremely creative and fun to watch on screen, he still didn't do much for me as he looked like a hippie bum with that long black cloak. Zombie also has all his trademarks in this movie, as his love for the 1970's, strippers/boobies, gore, sex, drugs and dirty ugly bums who look like they still haven't figured out that the tooth brush has been invented. But here's Zombie's version of what he thinks the sequel should be.Taking right where we left off from the first film, Laurie has a vicious nightmare that Michael is still after her, but she wakes up. It's one year after all the murders and Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael's body has been missing since last Halloween, presumed dead, and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy, Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Meanwhile, Michael has been seeing visions of his mother's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home.Scout Taylor-Compton, this girl, I have no idea why she was picked as the strong female Laurie Strode, because she spent 98.9% of this movie crying, sobbing and blubbering ""he'sgonnagetmeeeee! I'mnotwhoyathinkiam!"", and how in the heck was I supposed to root for that kind of a female lead? Scout is a lousy actress and the writing was all wrong for the character as well. Another trademark that I forgot to mention earlier that Rob loves putting in his movies, his wife Sherri Moon, pretty woman and over all a talented enough actress. But how in the heck was her role needed in this movie? Zombie is ripping off Psycho by making Myers see his dead mother all over the place saying for him to kill everyone. Again, I like the simplicity of Myers just being born evil with no explanation. Rob Zombie delivers in images and gore, but not in the scares. While the movie has some awesome kills, it's not worthy to add to the collection of Halloween sequels which the first 7 are actually good and worth watching. This was a project that wasn't meant for him nor should have it been for anyone, Halloween should be left alone. With Zombie making this into his vision, he's turned Mike Myers into a bum who dumb people for some odd reason pick a fight with and then get killed in the end and I'm supposed to feel sorry for them? Not likely, just skip it.1/10",Halloween II
26,disdressed12,boring and pointless,3,12 June 2010,"to say i was disappointed in Rob Zombie's followup to his 2007 Remake of Halloween would be an understatement.this thing is no nowhere near as good as that film was.for one thing,its about as exciting as watching paint drying or grass growing.it also goes straight into bizzaro land on more than one occasion,which doesn't really belong in the movie.it doesn't really fit,in my opinion.Zombie really had something going with his first attempt at breathing some much needed life into the franchise and putting his own spin on things.maybe he should have have just left it at that.all i know is he took several steps back with this misfire.for me,Halloween II (2009)is a 3/10",Halloween II
27,KineticSeoul,More annoying than the 2007 version and crappy build up,4,26 February 2011,"The visual style this time around for this sequel seems a bit different, I personally liked the visual style of the first one better. The story revolves around Laurie Strode once again except she is traumatized this time and doesn't put good amount of emphasis on Micheal Myers. Myers this time is basically a homeless guy and looks like on as well that kills people. The mystery behind a character like Myers is what kept him interesting and scary, but he is less scary this time around. The surviving character changed in this sequel for the worse, they just got more annoying to watch especially Laurie. Anyways so Micheal Myers is on a journey to kill a bunch of people that was involved with his family and to find his sister. And Dr. Samuel Loomis is making the situation worse for everyone by trying to get famous from a book he wrote about Micheal Myers and his family and victims. There is also a lot of nightmare scenes that got annoying after a while since this ain't ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". Also the build up is just plain terrible this time and boring to watch and depends way too much on that Rob Zombie style of vibe. The new kid that plays the young Micheal Myers fails and isn't good as the other kid from the last Halloween movie that portrayed him. But seriously what is the point of making him seem human for the majority of the movie if your going to add fantasy element in it as well for a slasher. If it kept thing a bit more fast paced and cut out some pointless scenes it would have made the movie less dull cause it really started to drag after a while and nothing about it was thrilling. Fans of Rob Zombie may try to find as much positive thing they can think of for this movie, but it really isn't a good slasher flick and a waste of time. Watch it if your a hardcore fan of the Halloween franchise and Micheal Myers.4/10",Halloween II
28,sddavis63,An Absolutely Atrocious Sequel,2,22 October 2013,"This has neither point nor purpose. It's directionless from the start and, frankly, just plain boring through almost all of its runtime. It begins with an extended (OK - let's be honest - stupefyingly excessive) dream sequence taking place in the mind of Laurie Strode (again played by Scout Taylor-Compton.) Maybe you can excuse starting this with a dream sequence. After all, she had lived through a nightmare the previous Halloween, and as the next Halloween approaches, sure it's going to be in her head. But it just went on and on and on. I knew from the moment it started that it was a dream sequence. I don't know how I knew; I just knew. So after the first couple of minutes I was sitting there thinking, ""Come on. Can't we just get on with this."" But it goes on and on and on. Then - when it finally ends - you kind of wish it hadn't, because what follows was atrocious. Simply atrocious.Blood and gore galore. Slashing after slashing; knifing after knifing; killing after killing. None with any particular purpose. Just over and over and over. It wasn't frightening. Not at all. It was just plain boring. In Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" - although it wasn't as good as John Carpenter's original - he at least made things somewhat interesting by giving us more depth on the character of Michael Myers. There was an attempt to do that here. There was an attempt to explain Michael's obsession with his baby sister Laurie, which was never explained in the original series of movies. He was delusional (or was it supposed to be real), thinking that his dead mother (who is in this as some sort of spirit-thing dressed in white) wants him to re-unite the family by killing Laurie so that she can be with them. Maybe. But there was way too much focus on the spirit of Michael's mother. Leave it as a delusion in his head, let us know it's there and that it explains his rampage, and then let it go. But Rob Zombie wouldn't let it go. I guess the totally meaningless and frankly irritating part of the deceased Deborah Myers represented too good a paycheque for his wife, Sheri Moon Zombie, who played her. (And, I noticed on the movie's IMDb page that she got top billing in the credits? Sheri Moon Zombie? Top billing? Please.)It's an absolutely atrocious movie that should be of no interest to anyone. Even the cast was far weaker than before. Taylor-Compton wasn't bad, Malcolm McDowell was weak as Dr. Loomis, whose primary interest is now making money by writing Michael Myers books. The end seemed to set up a possible next sequel, with Laurie now taking Michael's place as the deranged killer. Thankfully, it was never done. Indeed, the world should be eternally grateful that Rob Zombie never made ""Halloween III."" (2/10)",Halloween II
29,thesar-2,"Family may be forever, but let evil finally rest in peace",2,28 August 2009,"I heard that once Rob Zombie knew they were going to make a follow-up to his 2007 remake/prequel/reboot, 'Halloween,' he agreed to make a sequel to avoid anyone else messing up his vision. Unfortunately, he went blind, himself, during 2009's 'Halloween II.' Blind in direction, writing, any sort of plot and original scare/twists. He did, however, have blind rage. Over and over and over, Michael exhibits massive amounts of this rage, even to the point of having Michael finally speaking, though grunting. I'll give Zombie that: Michael now makes Jason, Freddy, Pinhead and Leatherface into a bunch of little wimps with his massively brutal rage channeled through his signature butcher knife. Sadly, he does this so much and combined with the enormous amounts of the printed swear words splashed everywhere, the movie comes more across a repressed Catholic child who finally gets a taste of freedom in sin and rebels for the simple art of rebellion. The movie is so random in its killings and Michael's ventures from one locale to the next, it's painfully aimless despite a straight-forward paper-thin plot line. Surprise alert! Despite getting shot in the head, Michael lived to wander around, dream up his mother and grow into, no coincidence, a Rob Zombie-lookalike. Everyone knows Laurie is Michael's sister, but it takes nearly the whole movie for her to find out, and she does by Loomis who acts like a complete buffoon throughout. His storyline, if you could be so kind, runs out of gas 2 minutes in and makes me, a McDowell fan, shudder. I could only forgive him if he previously signed a contract. I laughed out loud (probably disturbing others) at the hysterical closing. I think it was supposed to be serious/scary. Just avoid this utter ""violence just for the sake of violence"" mess.Side note on the other actors: Sheri Moon Zombie was laughable. Sad, despite her flawed stripper role in Zombie's #1, at least you remotely liked her there. Here, she was regrettably plain and seemed like an unintentionally funny spoof off of the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi and friends. Dourif overacted, Compton made you miss Curtis all the more and Harris made you wonder who the heck she was and why agree to return (again, other than contractually obligated.) The one saving grace was Vanek, who replaced Faerch from Zombie's #1, who had absolutely more range and was more believable as young Michael Myers in his few scenes than all of Zombie's #1 combined. If only they would remake Zombie's remake with Vanek instead of Faerch. Sadly, he could not save this rubbish.Another side note: I really wanted to see this movie. I had high hopes. Though it stood apart from the previous nine installments, it simply was an over-the-top gruesome picture with ABSOLUTELY no redeemable or original qualities. There weren't even any scares: every scene was seen a mile ahead, every kill predictable as the last and never a time did I get scared or jump. In fact, I simply waited for Michael to do his thing. It was like rewatching any of the 'Friday the 13th's from the 80's. Such as, ""Oh, here's a nameless & obvious victim who stops having sex in order to peelet's count down, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1—kill!"" Seriously, did Zombie even try to put his ""vision"" into this? I think not. He followed his remake with another remake of the 80's slasher fare.I recently bashed the other chapters, having re-watched all 9 'Halloween's (up to this segment) and perhaps I was too harsh on them. At least they (aside from #s 2, 6 and 8) knew what they were and ran with it. This doesn't know what it wants to be: a stylistic, telekinetic ghost story or just an excuse to have Michael use the knife. Or it was Zombie who was venting his own anger on screen vs. using the obligatory punching bag.I incredibly hope this is the final 'Halloween.' Please, please stop. (Especially the direction the hilarious ending wants to follow in potentially future installments.) Again, after viewing now all 10 'Halloween' films back-to-back, just watch the 1978 'Halloween,' followed by 'Halloween: H20' and finally, Rob Zombie's 2007 'Halloween.' Watch those three. Watch no more. Zombie, make no more.",Halloween II
30,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Generic, predictably blood splattered gore porn",4,19 October 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Not a Rob Zombie re-invention of the original sequel, but a sequel he has written and directed in his own right, following the apparent success of the first film. If that verged on above average, this falls on the more below average side of things.Zombie is a bleak, seedy director, perfect for someone in an angry mood, because if his skills as a story teller and director are questionable, his love of blood splattered violence and gore is all too clear in his devotion to it, with Myers's killing spree exercising his bread knife wasting enough tomato ketchup to feed a small country. And so if you can't complain about much else, weirdly one of the strongest complaints here is that there doesn't feel like enough of the stuff you've come to see (blood and gore) compared to the original, not to say that when it does strike it doesn't put you on edge at all. But also, as Myers hunts his surviving sister, we have to contend with an iffy subplot involving the ghost of his dead mother popping up to guide him on his journey, including some weird mind fu*k visual imagery that take it outside the realms of mere slasher horror. Malcolm McDowell pops up again also as Dr. Loomis but despite his experiences in the last film, he still seems like too much an arrogant, egotistical jerk compared to his calm, assuring demeaneur in the last film.This first sequel won't really let down fans of the original. But sequels have always been the downfall of series in the past. **",Halloween II
31,MLDinTN,not as good as Zombie's first Halloween remake,5,7 October 2010,"Zombie's first remake was a little different by having a background story of a young Michael Myers and how he turned into a killer. This movie was just your typical slasher film; plus it was annoying as to how many dream sequences there were. The film picks up were the last one left off. Somehow a dead Michael Myers escapes a crashed coroner van and brutally kills the van's passenger. A year later and it's almost Halloween again. Michael has visions of his mother, a white horse, and his younger self telling him to bring them all home, including his sister. So, we are too believe Michael has been living for a year in hiding and not killing and all of a sudden knows it's Halloween so returns to his hometown. We have some kills at a strip club and some rednecks. And before long he's chasing Laurie.FINAL VERDICT: There are a few good scenes for the gore fans and that's the best thing I can say about the movie. I wouldn't pay to see it, but if you catch it on cable, it's good for a bad horror movie.",Halloween II
32,ericstevenson,Just end the stupidity already,3,27 May 2018,"I've been tortured with these awful horror movie sequels lately. I was at least hoping that with Halloween/Slasher Month over a long time ago, I could avoid these stupid movies. The version I saw happened to be the longest slasher movie ever made and boy, did it feel like it! There's twenty minutes that are a dream meaning they're completely pointless in this already long movie. This movie is mostly just Michael Myers with a beard killing random people before confronting Laurie. Sometimes he wears his mask and sometimes he doesn't and I have no clue why.This is the only time where he says something as an adult (""Die!""). Laurie is so obnoxious in this movie and just yells over and over. There's tons of gratuitous swearing and nudity (at least in the unrated edition I saw). It's just an excuse to show more gore galore. Weird Al Yankovic appears briefly in the film giving it the only good moments. I guess it's not as bad as ""Leprechaun In The Hood"" or ""The Final Destination"" but it's still terrible. *1/2",Halloween II
33,cricketbat,There's no one to root for in this dark & grimy flick.,3,29 October 2021,"Rob Zombie's Halloween II is a grotesque and demoralizing film, which is no surprise considering the grisly remake that came before this sequel. With the choppy editing and bizarre visuals, this feels like one of his music videos more than a Halloween movie. The violence is brutal (Zombie seems a little obsessed with killing undressed or partially dressed women onscreen) and the story is ill-conceived and repetitive. There's no one to root for in this dark & grimy flick.",Halloween II
34,CuriosityKilledShawn,Nothing hallowed about this eve,8,1 November 2010,"I've always rooted for the underdog movies, movies that very few people like or are victims of popular misconceptions (RoboCop 2, Hudson Hawk, Waterworld). But never in my life have I known a film to be on the receiving end of so much anger and undeserved hate than Rob Zombie's Halloween II.Zombie didn't want to do the movie. He'd killed off Michael and that was that. But the studio went ahead with a sequel regardless, and he figured that if a sequel was going to be made then he should be the one calling the shots instead of someone else who might deviate from his vision.Many were furious over his desecration of John Carpenter's original. I wasn't. I thought it was entertaining...but pointless. Zombie (and the makers of all the original sequels) just didn't grasp the fact that the minimalism and purity of the 1978 movie is what made it stand out. Copious amounts of back-story did nothing but bore me to death.But the 1981 Halloween II was hardly sacred ground. Though it took place on the same night as the first the series had already degenerated into pure drudgery and sank even further from there. Zombie's Halloween II pays homage with the first 10 minutes but goes off into a brand new tangent following his own imagination.His huge liberties with the Michael Myers mythology and rules may have offended fans, but after 31 years of keeping him in the dark it was time to bring the brutal ugliness into the light. This is hardcore slasher material. Compared to this the 80s and 90s sequels are PG family films. Violence and death in real life are not pretty, cool to look at, or bloodless. I'm sick of slasher films that are so clean and sterilized that they make murder look hygienic and harmless. What kind of message is THAT sending out? Zombie has delivered, without a doubt, the most visually striking Halloween film yet. I wasn't too impressed with his editing or cinematography style in the 2007 movie. Carpenter shot his film in anamorphic Panavision and stuck with the format ever since. But Zombie opted for ugly Super 35, which gave his film-making style a garish, MTV feel. This time around he shoots in grainy 16mm and keeps the camera right in front of the carnage, keeping it in our faces. He also grinds raw, emotional performances out of his cast, especially Scout Taylor-Compton and Brad Dourif.The hate, the anger, the condemnation...it's all completely unjustified. None of the original sequels were this bold, daring or imaginative. When it comes to drawn out franchises (especially horror films) there are frequent complaints of ""same old, same old"". But as soon as a sequel that DOES break the mold comes across it's torn apart for being too different.It's our inability to make up our minds over what we really want in movies that pushes studios into making so much inoffensive garbage. Honestly, if you're the kind of person who likes Twilight then you really have no business watching this film.",Halloween II
35,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,You better watch the original movie,5,28 August 2021,"Rob Zombie is good as a musician, but not so good as a director.The movie was so bad. The decisions made were not good. There are a lot of stupid decisions in the movie. You better watch the original movie.",Halloween II
36,Bored_Dragon,"After ""Halloween"" (2007), Rob Zombie stated he would never do a sequel. He should have kept the promise.",4,16 July 2019,"The movie is audio-visually very well done. There are some really nice camerawork and interesting solutions. The acting is realistic and believable, without silly over-acting typical of slashers. But as much as it is technically good, it is so inexpressibly boring. After only fifteen minutes I was already bored, and for the next hour I struggled not to give up. Although he did a good job as the director, Zombie wrote a disastrously bad scenario. Without a good plot that will keep you in anticipation of the outcome and without characters for whose fate you care, there's simply no tension, which makes scenes that should be terrifying just plain stupid and banal. Half an hour before the end, I completely lost interest and went to bed. Unfortunately, I hate to leave things halfway done, and I had to finish it the very next day. The ending buried even what little positive impressions I had from the previous evening. It's so incredibly stupid that it hurts. The only positive impression after watching this movie remains the following dialogue:Did you just mention ""journalists"", ""cool"" and ""positive"" all in the same sentence without throwing up?Yes, why? Is that a problem?It's just quite an oxymoron, my dear.4/10",Halloween II
37,jacobjohntaylor1,I think the reason people don't like this movie is because it is a sequel.,10,7 November 2015,The is a fellow up to the Halloween remake from 2007. The Halloween remake is pretty good movie. But this movie is better. The original Halloween from 1978 is a pretty good movie. This movie is better. The 1981 version is of Halloween II is better. That is one of the scariest movie ever made. And it is impossible to top. The seventh Halloween movie Halloween H2O is also scarier then this movie. The 1000 times better then Halloween III session of the witch. This a great movie and Halloween III session of the witch is just crap. Halloween 4 the return of Michael Myers is a pretty good movie. This one is better. Halloween 5 the revenge of Michael Myers is a pretty good movie. This movie is better. The sixth Halloween movie Halloween the cures of Michael Myers is a pretty good movie. This movie is better. This is 200 time better then Halloween resurrection. This is a great movie. And Halloween resurrection is just crap. This movie is very scary. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. It also has great special effects. I do not why people who liked the Halloween remake would have a problem with the violence in this movie. I know people like this movie in ratting It got 5 out of 10. People who like this movie need to speak up. The truth be told this is better then Halloween (2007).,Halloween II
38,UniqueParticle,I am one of the only ones on earth that loves this sequel?,9,31 October 2019,"Wildly disturbing and absurdly bizarre! I appreciate enjoying something that not many others do, it makes me proud to be different. Awesome how Rob Zombie didn't want his vision ruined so he took the honor of directing rather than anyone else. I love how gross and nightmare fueled this Halloween II is! Scout Taylor Thompson really did incredible even if not many others did she deserves credit and so does Tyler Mane! I also understand the hate this gets, sure it has many flaws, but come on does every horror have to be perfect, no way and this is great for down times like at night. Lastly I love the soundtrack!!",Halloween II
39,paulclaassen,The WORST Halloween film with the best ending.,1,17 October 2018,"From the onset I wasn't really keen on watching this, as it couldn't possibly add anything meaningful to the storyline. Keep in mind this is a sequel of a remake of the original 'Halloween', which had a sequel. This film therefore has no place in the timeline - anywhere!How can I put it mildly: I HATED this film! It was unnecessarily graphic, vicious and brutal, and disgusting for the sake of being disgusting. Written and directed by Rob Zombie, the man surely has a very sick mind. It was over-gory and over-bloody and the killings were done torture-style, which is very unlike Michael Myers.I further did not like any of the characters. Laurie Strode is an unrecognizable character, unlikable, foul-mouthed and a complete asshole, if I may use this word. I didn't root for her at all. In fact, I didn't care about any of the characters. (Characters were literally added by the minute purely for the kill anyway). Dr Loomis' character is also completely different to previous films. He has become a stupid, comic-relief character, and wasn't funny at all. Michael Myers is still a complete idiot, but more so in this film. And now he roams without his mask, looking like a hobo!! And he even grunts and uttered a single word: ""Die!"" Pathetic!The film had no suspense whatsoever. It was crude and rude and a very sick film. And why are hospitals always so empty in horror films? Where's the Security? This was not only the worst Halloween film I've seen, but one of the worst films in general.On a positive note, despite me hating the film as much as I do: some of the dream sequences were very well done, albeit very weird. The ending was visionary, together with an awesome version of Nazareth's 'Love Hurts' (performed by Nan Vernon). I must admit to loving this final ending, making it one of the best Halloween endings.",Halloween II
40,sol-,More Myers,4,7 October 2017,"In era of countless horror movie remakes, Rob Zombie's 2007 version of 'Halloween' was a breath of fresh air; if not as spooky as its predecessor, it added a ton of background and character development that made its antagonist all the more intriguing to follow around. This sequel to the 2007 version on the other hand does little to up the ante and ultimately feels redundant - if effective every now and again. Indeed, the film is not a total waste with a gripping first 25 minutes of struggles and chases, plus there are some intriguing decisions, like having Michael drop the mask with his face gradually revealed in bits and pieces before full-on towards the end. The majority of changes are not for the better though. Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis is suddenly an arrogant jerk more interested in publicity than helping Michael out, Laurie Strode is so whiny and emotionally unstable that she drains the energy of every scene that she is in, and many of Michael's attacks happen so quickly that it is hard to tell what is going on. Narrative-wise, the film is a logical progression of sorts; whereas the first film was more about Michael, this entry is more about Laurie, however, as she is nowhere near as fascinating a character, the movie is ultimately only ever as interesting as it sounds without anywhere near as many fun references to the 1978 original as in the 2007 version.",Halloween II
41,zkonedog,Suffers A Similar Fate As Its 1981 Namesake,3,2 March 2017,"In 1981, John Carpenter penned a sequel to his iconic original. It was a decent movie, but failed to fully capture the magic of what had come before it. Rob Zombie runs into a similar issue with his own ""Halloween II"". It just can't live up to its predecessor.For a basic plot summary, ""Halloween II"" sees Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) a mental wreck trying to cope with the violence inflicted upon her and her friends. She is living with friend Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris) and Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif). Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) is presumed dead...but that doesn't prove to be the case for long. This time, however, Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is no help, having turned into a fear-mongering, money-hungry weasel.This is nothing inherently bad about this movie. It has a plot, hits the same horror notes of any similar genre film, and tries to accomplish a theme. The problem? Like all the other sequels to the 1978 original before it, it finds that within the Halloween franchise, lightning only strikes once.The only story that really, really works on a visceral level is the tale told by Carpenter in 1978 and Zombie in 2007. Other than that, it has been pretty much complete and utter failure to build on the Myers legacy without turning into gore-fests or simply snooze-fests. ""Halloween II"" is a combination of the two: The parts that aren't excruciatingly gory are the parts that are boring.Not helping matters is that Zombie's heavy-hand is seen much more in this film than his first effort in the series. Here he is given more free reign to do what he pleases, and as such it turns into (at times) kind of a Gothic mess.So, the pattern continues: Unless you are telling the story of ""the night he came home"", you are probably making a failure of a movie in this series. ""Halloween II"" isn't (by far) the worst movie in the franchise, but it doesn't have any magic to it either. It's just ""a movie"" instead of a visceral, chilling experience.",Halloween II
42,poe426,Trailer park chainsaw massacre...,2,30 August 2009,"Knob Zombie, it seems to me, has been attempting to ""re-imagine"" Tobe Hooper's trailer park drive-in favorite THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE for the past several years, now. He's inching closer, but he's nowhere near there, yet. Give him a couple more decades and another half a hundred tries, and he'll have it licked. Or at least he'll get dang close, I'm sure. I give HOLLERWEEN TWO a Two because 1) it boasts some gorgeous cinematography and 2) because it boasts some more gorgeous cinematography. The grainy look is classic, and a favorite of mine. (And cinematography alone can sometimes make a movie worth seeing: check out Walter Hill's STREETS OF FIRE, for instance.) Storywise, there's literally nothing to speak of; thespians cringe in horror when mention is made of the alleged performances herein. Knob (or the cinematographer) has a good eye for shot composition, but the other eye appears to be clouded over with some kind of milky membrane... If you and Brother/Daddy're lookin' to take the two-headed tykes out to the drive-in, HOLLERWEEN TWO's the ticket. (""Hey, Knob! What do you tell a woman with two black eyes?

43,damianphelps,Good But Not as Good,6,7 January 2021,A big fan of Halloween 2007 I was really looking forward to this follow up.And...whilst it is a pretty good film it fails to deliver in the same creative impactful way of its predecessor.Zombie tends to have a style that you love or hate (I usually love it) so if you are not a fan of his then this may be a movie to pass on.The other criticism that can be put forward to this film is the use of Moon. I think moon is ok and works well sometimes and not so well on other occasions. However she tends to play basically the same character in the same way in every movie she is in. In Halloween II I feel is detracts more than she adds.Still a nice addition to the Halloween saga and another movie that allows us to forget Halloween 3 Season of the Witch!,Halloween II
44,BaronBl00d,"""Bad Taste Is the Petrol that Drives the American Dream""",2,15 May 2010,"I concur with so many reviewers out there that say this is a putrid, nasty, vile film void of any real merit. The lighting is hideously dark throughout - does any actor ever get much of a close-up? The F word is used ad infinitum and with little need or effect. The violence. Let's talk about the unnecessary violence like cutting a throat with a jagged piece of glass, multiple stabbings to the point where it is almost ridiculous and funny, kicking a guy's face into pieces(not that you see much in the dark), and a whole slew of other pointless killings that drive this film rather than plot. Which once you see the plot in place, you know why Zombie has so much killing in here. What in the heck is all that garbage with Michael Myer's mom and a white horse? Pure nonsense. This movie couldn't do what Carpenter did in Halloween II because that story was weak to begin with. Here we have lots of dream sequences - even some you may think are in real-time are only dreams. Malcolm McDowell is back as Loomis, but here he is totally unlikable where he was somewhat likable in the first Zombie Halloween - which by the way is miles above in superiority to this wretched dreck! I cannot say I liked much: McDowell(always good), Brad Dourif as the sheriff, Daniel Roebuck chewing up scenery in a ridiculous scene, and it was nice to see Margot Kidder in film again. Other than that I have very little to say in favor of this film. Bad. Bad. Bad.",Halloween II
45,digitalbeachbum,Cash Grab,1,30 October 2021,"I remember when this was released. Everyone in school was talking about it and how frightened they were to watch it. However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts.

46,matthewssilverhammer,Just Another Bad Michael Myers Sequel...,2,11 September 2019,"I really can't figure out what Zombie's point is with these. By showing us Myers' past, he seems to be trying to make him more empathetic and understandable...except his Michael is by far the most brutally violent and mean-spirited of the entire franchise. The first Zombie outing is bad, but this one is oppressive, utterly joyless, and seems to completely misunderstand what we want from this franchise.",Halloween II
47,insomniac_rod,"Zombie re-directs the series through acid trips, Grindhouse, white trash, and extreme violence. Not bad...",8,6 December 2009,"I felt frustrated after leaving the movie theater. I thought ""Rob Zombie ended with a series of traditions we the die hard Halloween fans love. What do I mean? Read above please.With a cold head, I accepted that Zombie is bringing to us his own re-inventing of Carpenter's classic. We can like it or not, but it's only his point of view, it's not like he's trying to chance history.He throws controversy all the time: Myers killing and eating a dog, vulgarity, political points of view, references to other films (got ""The Funhouse"" moment?), etc.Also, call me crazy but I found many references to ""Halloween 4"". For example, the shots of the ambulance driving Michael's corpse, the custody outside Brackett's house, Myers' demise, Laurie having nightmares involving her wearing the clown outfit, etc. It also captured it's dark vibe and somber atmosphere.Nowadays you love or hate him. I'm a big fan of ""HO1C"" and ""Devil's Rejects"". By watching those movies, you can understand what are Zombie's influences and his style. So he decided to bring the Halloween characters and story into a world of violence, white trash, vulgarity, and blood, plenty of blood.I praise Zombie's guts for creating a movie that takes a complete twisted direction in the Myers paradise. He takes Myers and makes him roam in a very different setting from old pacific Haddonfield. In other works, he ADDS THE GRINDHOUSE TOUCH to the series.Laurie has changed a lot since the previous film and she avoids now the image of sweet tender girl to become some sort of Avril Lavigne who likes to party, listens to Alice Cooper, but is very disturbed. Scout Taylor Compton is very sexy with that steamy maid mini skirt, and I bought her dramatic and desperate performance.Loomis' ego is bigger than Myers height. He seems to have lost the sense of his investigation with Michael but at least he has the chance to reach redemption by the time of his death. (Did he die?).I didn't like at all that Loomis, who was always been Myers' #1 nemesis, the man who gave his life to study a serial killer. Now he's an old lunatic who delivers bits of humor to the movie. YES, YOU READ IT CORRECTLY, LOOMIS IS THE COMICAL CHARACTER. This will infuriate fans like me. It's a lack of respect but again, I understand that it's Zombie's vision. Nice deliver by Michael McDowell.Sheriff Brackett takes a leading role as Myers' hunter and it goes under his responsibility the information held about Laure's past. I really enjoyed his relationship with Annie. It was a tender and moving moment when he founds her dead; probably raped and slashed. Brad Dourif is a freaking living legend in Horror.Loved the nightmarish bizarre sequences involving Laurie getting caught inside a crystal coffin, nightmare creatures having dinner (that pumpkin guy gave me the creeps!), Deborah having an inverted cross painted on her forehead telling Laure ""bitch!"" and threatening to kill her. These situations give us an idea that Zombie's Michael Myers is a very demented serial killer with help from the grave.The negative aspect in my opinion has to do with installing the series into a grind-house atmosphere that decides to get rid off suspense, mystery, and even situations that could generate fear. Michael isn't anymore the representation of fear that haunted Haddonfield. Zombie's gift to us could be translated as violence, gore, extreme grind-house characteristics, but it brings a sacrifice to us: No more mystery or interesting plot devices.Zombie delivers poor writing and some situations are really difficult to believe such as Michael's ""super powers"", Loomis surrender (why the hell didn't he enter the shack with a gun?!), the way Michael receives instructions from the grave, the fact that he prowled as a hobo for one year without getting caught, or why would he crash into a Halloween party and only kill one specific person? How did he know it was Laurie's friend? The score is excellent. Tyler Bates creates a spectacular, memorable soundtrack. Love the bits when Brackett commands the mission to rescue Laurie. Also the thrilling moments of the killings and the ""Terror Train"" moment. The cinematography is outstanding. Brilliant. Visually, this is an unsettling movie with extraordinary night shots and brilliant use of Halloween colors.Clearly Rob Zombie used the winning elements that converted his both previous movies into a huge success and tried to give a special punch for this sequel basing it on brutal atmosphere, gore, and surrealistic nightmares. Nice twist I must admit.Though this is not fresh air in the Horror genre, it's a merit that deserves recognition.Give it a chance for ""Halloween II"" because it's amongst the most brutal films you'll see in 2009. I can't understand all the hate, even us the die hard fans of the series accept this new dimension in the series. Watch it as a re-telling of the Myers story through the twisted mind of Zombie and his surreal nightmares caused by, probably acid. We can't do anything else to change history, just relax and watch it.",Halloween II

50,FiendishDramaturgy,"It is graphic, Graphic, GRAPHIC.",7,16 March 2010,"I'm not a purist, so I have no axe to grind here.I enjoy the psychological aspects of Rob Zombie's contribution to this franchise. The dialog is witty while really delivering the essence of what a slasher flick is all about. Zombie generates thick and tense atmosphere without forgetting to tell the story; an accomplishment in both the genre of horror and the sub-genre of slasher movies.That having been said, Zombie also favors the T&A aspects of horror camp, which takes the class of the film down a notch or two, in my opinion. Gratuitous violence and sex are expected in films of this type, and Zombie doesn't disappoint in this aspect. If anything, he over-delivers in the area of gratuitous violence.I realize the idiocy of complaining about violence in a slasher flick, but there is a point where the violence and blood effects go over the top and destroy any suspension of disbelief which could have otherwise been possible. While this film doesn't exactly cross that line, it does dance all OVER it, lending a few spots where the viewer must remember s/he is the viewer of a film, and not a witness to events. There are a few scenes featuring violence so horrific, so repugnant, the viewer is compelled to withdraw from it, causing the spell to be broken again, and again.All in all, it's a splatter flick with deep psychological ruminations. If this is your thing, you'll love it. Just remember it is graphic, Graphic, GRAPHIC.It rates a conflicted 7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Halloween II
51,Captain_Couth,Rob Zombie's H2 out does the first film on all levels.,8,28 August 2009,"H2 (2009) is the second film of Rob Zombie's reboot of the Halloween franchise. He gives the film a much needed edge that was found in his previous films like The Devil's Rejects and House of a 1,000 Corpses. Zombie's surrealistic dreamscapes and brutal gory set pieces are on display. Instead of doing a straight forward redux of the sequel he brings forth his own nightmarish vision. The sequel picks up right where the first film left off. Laurie is having a very hard time dealing with the Halloween attack by Michael Myers that left her friends and family dead. Almost a year later she lives with her best friend and fellow survivor Annie. Her view on life is much different and her attitude towards it has changed as well. A therapist counsels her on trying to move forward with her life. But the calendar shows that Halloween is only a few days away...I saw this at a midnight screening and the crowd was really into the film. Rob Zombie doesn't play around and try to stay somewhat to the original film. This is old school hardcore horror. I don;t know how it managed to get an R-rating but it did. I haven't seen a horror film this violent, brutal and squeamish in a long time. No sanitized violence in this one like a lot of the bland horror films that have been coming out of Hollywood recently. No kiddy stuff here, just a straight forward horror film that will entertain those who just love to get scared. Most of the cast returns in this film. Michael Myers has a new look to fit in with his character (but don't fret because he still has his mask). If you enjoyed the first Zombie Halloween then you'll want to watch it. But if didn't like the first one watch it any way because it's a lot better on all levels because I expected to see a hardcore horror film and I saw one.Highly recommended.",Halloween II
52,generationofswine,An Honest Review,2,1 July 2017,"Malcolm McDowell so 2 stars just like I did the first one: ** The nudity isn't as much, so maybe I was wrong, maybe he was going for satire in the first one and not snuff porn...or maybe he was told to tone it down with the rape and dead naked women......but there are still naked women that get murdered by the big scary male monster after committing a fundamentalist sin of one kind or another......so was it intended to be a satire of the genre or does it just get Zombie off? Still not sure.And again, the atmosphere isn't there. The film has a feel to it that is almost grindhouse sleaze without being good enough to really achieve grindhouse sleaze.It makes for an off putting after taste in your mouth.And with all the nudity it still feels like its trying to be Friday the 13th more than it is a Halloween installment.Yet again I ask ""Why remake it?""

Malcolm McDowell is chewing up the scenery as Dr Loomis, Michael Myers' dodgy psychologist who is now dubiously cashing in on the fame he got from surviving the first movie. Laurie Strode is suffering the psychiatric effects of her own closeness to the masked boogeyman, and is really going off the rails - and with Margot Kidder (RIP) as her therapist, who can blame her?And Michael? He's doing what he does best, and takes probably a bit too long to meet the other two characters for the reunion you know is going to go down.""Halloween 2"" isn't a bad movie. It's not as bad as the laughable prequel, for which Rob Zombie should hang his head in shame for having ever committed to celluloid, and it's also not as bad as the inexplicable ""31"". It's more just average and forgettable, hamstrung by a silly two hour run-time, and a bit of narrative confusion. I also can't remember a single kill, so whereas the movie may deliver on the violence, it's not particularly creative or interesting.",Halloween II
54,dfranzen70,Solid follow-up,7,6 September 2009,"A lot of people didn't like Rob Zombie's Halloween, but I'm not one of them. I found his vision of John Carpenter's classic to be stylish without drifting from the core issues of the original. Sure, it's gorier, but you knew that going in. Zombie's followup isn't a direct sequel to the first Halloween II but rather to his own film, and personally I thought it (and the blood) flowed rather nicely. It's clear the man is passionate about his horror.You know how I know a horror movie works for me? When the killer leaps out unexpectedly. Time was, that was basically every time, but we're a little more jaded now and really expect him continuously. You know what else works? When the characters are more than just victims, cardboard standups there for the killin'. When something happens to these people, you feel it. Example, Sheriff Brackett rushes back to his house, realizing that Michael Myers - not dead! - is probably in the middle of hacking his daughter to pieces. At that moment, we feel what Brackett feels - not just that an innocent, but the man's daughter is being killed. Done right, this kind of scene can pack an emotional wallop, something you don't often see in slasher movies.Here's the story. It's a year later, and Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is trying to get on with her life after Michael Myers escaped from a mental institution, returned to Haddonfield, Illinois, and tried to kill her. Laurie bears the considerable mental and physical scars of her encounter with Michael, as does her friend Annie Brackett, and she now lives with Annie and her father, Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif). Michael's supposedly dead, but we wouldn't have a sequel if that were truly the case, so he finds his way back to Haddonfield as well, cutting a swath of bloody corpses (or leaving a path of bloody corpses).Zombie's great talent is style. You see it in his old White Zombie videos, you see it in his animated sequence in Beavis and Butt-head Do America, and you see it in his earlier films. The man has verve and panache. People don't just get smacked around, they get pummeled, and not just men, either. People don't just get stabbed in the leg, they get sliced up. Dogs, too. It's not a movie for the weak of heart.What also works here is that Zombie never loses sight of the story. (Yes, there is one.) Sometimes, with crappier horror movies, the director will simply go all-in and make everything as goopily gory as possible. There's a plot here, and there are victims and good guys, too. There are other things in the movie, is what I'm saying, and Zombie makes sure we remember they're there, too. Keep the story moving - Michael must have some reason to butcher someone, even if that reason is ""they were in the way."" One problem I had with the movie, though, was the character of Dr. Loomis. In the first-series films Loomis (played by Donald Pleasance) is a kindly doctor, terribly upset that he's inadvertently unleashed Michael onto the world by letting him escape. In this movie, Loomis (played by Malcolm McDowell) is a greedy, self-indulgent jerk who's pushing a tell-all memoir about the events of a year ago. Loomis seemed a lot more concerned with everyone's well being in Zombie's first film, but here he simply doesn't care about anyone - even going so far as to reveal a potentially deadly secret to sell books. I'm not sure if it was just McDowell hamming it up or an oversight on the writer (also Zombie), but the character seemed way over the top, sort of like Gale Whatshername from the Scream movies, which were parodying the way newsie types profit from misery and woe.But overall, I liked this sequel quite a bit. I was literally the only person in the entire theater this morning, which is always quite nice. I particularly liked Brad Dourif as the strong but vulnerable police chief; a great performance from an underlooked character actor.Note: Zombie (and the studio) has said he won't be back for Halloween III, should it come to fruition.",Halloween II
55,atinder,One or two good scene but its a total waste of time,3,31 May 2010,"I never saw Halloween remake in full , it turned it off after 45 Min's and really wish i did the same with this movie.This can be really confusing at times, The Girl as got have one of the most annoying voices i have ever heard, she was giving me a bloody head ace , My God, how many dose the F words need to be said.The start of the movie was really interesting, only to fool us with one of the longest dream ever.what i don't understand if Michael Myers died in remake and how could they bring him back from the dead, he was shot in head? was that a dream part? i was total confused by that!, i don't understand why they Dr looms a pain in the Ass, i wish he died in this movie! When i watch Halloween movies they normal know as slasher movies but this Halloween movie not a slasher movie at all, )yes this movie did have one or two good gory deaths scenes, which i really liked) some reason this more of a supernatural movie.That is main reason I did not like this movie, slasher and Ghost do not not mix.I going to give this movie 3 out of 10 If you are looking for Halloween movies, DO NOT WATCH THIS movie i would recommend Trick 'r Treat (2008) that a really good Halloween movie",Halloween II
56,JoeB131,A Zombie that needs to be put out,1,27 January 2010,"its misery.I think it's fair to say that Rob Zombie is not that talented as a director. He's like a little kid who has found something that is cute the first time, but gets annoying after a while. In Rob's case, it's gore. Maybe funny in ""House of 1000 Corpses"", but tiresome by Halloween and completely useless by Halloween 2.Getting his otherwise good cast (including Malcolm McDowell and Brad Dourif) to further debase themselves in a sequel, it picks up where the last one left off. Like all good deranged killers, Michael is not quite dead. Yes, doctors and paramedics in horror movies can't tell when someone is dead. He proceeds to kill a critically wounded paramedic and stalks Laurie to a hospital. Or does he? We don't know.The problem with this movie is that it's about how Laurie becomes insane, which was a problem because she was such a non-entity in the first film, you don't care about her in the second. (Keep in mind, the original two movies made Jamie Lee Curtis a star. Danielle Harris has done her fourth Halloween film, and no one is going to remember her in five years.",Halloween II
57,meeza,Michael Myers is rolling in his grave!! If he is in a grave.,3,26 November 2010,"When horror movie director Rob Zombie decided to reintroduce the ""Halloween"" movie franchise with some new blood, I thought it was not a bad idea. He actually did a commendable job in the original ""Halloween"" remake that was released in 2007. But why did he have to unmask his unoriginality in the ""brutal to watch"" remake of ""Halloween 2""! This has to be one of the worst movies of 2009. All of it deserved a timely death: the acting, screenplay, direction, makeup, grips, you name it! In this ""Halloween 2"" remake installment, Michael Myers looks more like the Brawny Towels' pitchman than a masked killer. The mountain-man, in dire need of a Gillette razor, is not Michael's strong suit. Anyways, the presumed dead Myers is on the loose once again on his way to Haddonfield to finish the killer job of slaughtering his younger sister Laurie Strode. He is driven by hallucinating images of his dead mother and a white horse. Yikes! I know that Zombie was probably horsing around too much in developing ""Halloween 2"", but this is ridiculous! Anyways, Laurie Strode is two years ""almost removed"" from the time that Myers attacked her and her neighboring friends on Halloween night. She has recurring nightmares about that night and is a mental mess. Scout Taylor- Compton stars as Strode, in a performance that was so awful & pathetic that one would want to be a part of Team Myers than Team Strode. Taylor-Compton plays Strode as an egoistic, obnoxious brat which completely opposites how Jamie Lee Curtis portrayed Strode as a brave, cerebral survivor in the ""Halloween"" films of the past. Taylor-Compton's Strode lives with her best friend Annie Brackett and Annie's police chief dad Sheriff Lee Brackett. Let's just say that I will put Danielle Harris and Brad Dourif's performances as Annie and Sheriff Lee in the ""atrocious acting"" bracket category. Laurie also has some slutty, party girlfriends in the music store she works at. They convince Laurie to go to a Halloween party and. You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a Nostradamus to figure what happens there. Oh, I almost forgot, because it was quite forgettable. There is a side story of Dr. Loomis, Myers shrink, craving media attention in order for his newly-published book on his experiences with Myers to be a best-seller. Malcolm McDowell returns as Loomis, he was not half-bad in the ""Halloween"" remake, but in ""Halloween 2"" he was an acting clockwork damage. And don't let me get started in the dismal casting of Margot Kidder playing Strode's cliché-filled psychiatrist, ""are you kidding me?"" Rob Zombie must have taken some zombie-induced substances in directing and scribing ""Halloween 2""; all for that one scene where Michael causes havoc in a rural strip club, ""Halloween 2"" was a total dismal display. The strip club scene was more comical than frightening, so therefore there was not one scary scene throughout the entire ""Halloween 2"" movie; maybe the ""Halloween"" movie franchise does not belong in Zombieland after all. Consider yourself warned: ""Halloween 2"" is much more a trick than a treat. * Failure",Halloween II
58,MBunge,"After a flicker of hope with Halloween, Zombie goes right back to sucking as a filmmaker.",3,3 September 2010,"I've seen all 4 of Rob Zombie's big budget movies. House of 1000 Corpses was an incoherent mash that looked like Zombie threw the film into a blender and taped together the scraps. The Devil's Rejects was pretentiously awful, but it made some vague sense. His remake of Halloween was a quantum leap better than either of those two, though it still sucked, and made me wonder if Zombie was growing and learning as a filmmaker. Halloween II demonstrates that he hasn't grown a motherbleeping inch and hasn't learned a bleepsucking thing.This ugly, grinding, unintentionally hilarious abortion of a movie demonstrates that Zombie doesn't have the storytelling skills to handle anything more complex than ""See Spot Run"", though in this case ""See Spot Stab"" would be more appropriate. Halloween II has all the sophistication of a children's picture book, except one where Bob the Builder hacks someone to death with an ax or The Cat in the Hat stomps someone's face into lunch meat. Even the multitude of violent acts throughout the story are horribly botched. They're filmed with enough camera movement and flashes of motion to put any epileptic into a permanent vegetative state and they have all the emotional reality of watching an anvil bop Wile E. Coyote on the head.The plot, if you can call it that, is essentially this: Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) kills a bunch of people while his sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) switches from happy to sad like a manic-depressive off her meds. I'm not joking. Laurie just sort of wanders hither and yon while Michael, looking like Rob Zombie after a steroid overdose, murders his way through the usual assortment of white trash, trailer park losers. There is a subplot with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) that has literally nothing to do with the rest of the story. In it, Loomis appears to function as a self-loathing stand-in for Zombie as he bitches about what it's like to be a celebrity whoring yourself out to sell your latest work and whines about the complaints he got from some fans over his remake of the first Halloween.Honestly, parts of this thing seem like a parody of a horror movie that you'd see on Mad TV or Robot Chicken. Halloween II actually tells the audience that the reason for Michael Myers' killing rampages is that, like every other 12 year old girl in the world, he just really, really, really wants a pony. I'm not being sarcastic. That's the reason. Noseriously, that's the reason.In addition to urinating all over the work of John Carpenter and the audience, Zombie invalidates his own work in the first remake. In that one he tried to give a psychological explanation for who Michael was and why he does what he does. It was an attempt to reground a classic horror myth in reality. Halloween II flushes reality down the crapper. Not only does Michael's mom return as a ghost that is apparently zonked out on Prozac, but Michael is no longer just a 7 foot tall powerhouse. He now must possess the abilities to turn invisible and teleport, because that's the only way he could do most of the things he does in this visual diarrhea of a film.I'm begging you, Hollywood. Stop giving this guy money to make his own movies. Anyone who thinks it's a great idea to have Michael Myers grunt while he's stabbing someone, doesn't deserve to be a director. He deserves to be the guy who has to lick clean the lint traps in a prison laundry. He deserves to be the guy who tests what happens when you use hydrogen peroxide as lubricant for anal beads. He deserves to be the guy who's forced at gun point into having a threesome with Philip Seymour Hoffman and the rotting corpse of Chris Farley.What Rob Zombie does NOT deserve is to ever make another film.",Halloween II

60,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Extremely misunderstood, one of the best the franchise",8,21 November 2015,"After the financial success of Rob Zombie's Halloween reimagining, they handed the reigns to him to craft a sequel as well. While in the first one he somewhat followed the format of the original 1978 film while adding his own flourishes, here he completely tosses the H2 blueprint out the window and totally fashions his own unique and very different vision. This shocked a lot of fans, resulting in what is probably the most hated and worst reviewed film in the entire franchise. For me that makes it the most underrated, as I love it. It's a bitter, nasty, crass, horrifying sequel, the emotional dregs of every character pushed to the forefront, still raw with trauma even when Michael makes a triumphant return a year later. Zombie's excellent writing is once again on display, some of the characterizations even more intense than the first time around. After a nerve shattering prologue involving Michael's escape from a van driven by two obscene coroners (Dayton Callie and Richard Brake) we follow Laurie as she's pursued by Michael to the hospital they take her too. Flash to one year later, Laurie is back in Haddonfield, living with Annie (Danielle Harris, top notch once again) and Sheriff Leigh Brackett. Dourif has a scene that if films like this bothered to get award attention, he'd be front runner for. He's such a talent and is given his best role in years with a character arc that will bring you to tears. Malcolm McDowell returns as Dr. Loomis, whose path in life has taken a turn for the reprehensible, the events of the past and his ultimate failure to reach Michael feeling a deep, petulant narcissism and ugly sellout nature. The scene with him on a talk show with Weird Al is priceless. Laurie (Scout Taylor Compton) has become a damaged she'll of the girl she used to be, suffering from extreme PTSD and raging against her psychiatrist (Margot Kidder, of all people). The cast is stacked as usual, the landscape dotted with familiar faces such as Mark Boone Jr, Daniel Roebuck, Sheri Moon Zombie from beyond the grave, Jeffrey Daniel Philips, Tyler Mane, Octavia Spencer, Richard Rhiele, Duane Whitaker and Brea Grant. There's a notable change in cinematography from the first film, brightly lit colours giving way to hazy, twilight soaked rural vistas as Michael makes his way back home, and traffic light piercing shadows for some really gorgeous frames. Zombie also adds some truly jarring psychological stuff, as Michael hallucinates all kinds of strange things, from his mother and a white horse, to a dreamlike banquet of pumpkin headed weirdos. This has been dismissed by many as unnecessary hogwash, but I loved that Rob severely branded the film with his own ideas and creativity, instead of just vomiting the same plot, set pieces and atmosphere from other films of the franchise. The harshness and brutality of the killing is also upped here, as Michael is like a ferocious beast in his fury, so fair warning: it's a slog to get through, and there's no light at the end of the tunnel for any of the characters involved. Depressing, overbearing stuff. Zombie's Halloween films are notable for being the first ones to introduce actual feeling characters and emotional beats that we are sold on, not cheap melodrama and topical sexual banter. Despite the horrific nature of the film, and the meanness of the people, they are compellingly written, acted and realized to make me want to spend two hours of my time with them. I think that in time this one could be seen as a cult horror classic, a terrific entry in the Myers legacy and a standalone horror film to be reckoned with.",Halloween II
61,hu675,"It's mean, tough, violent but it's more Rob Zombie movie than his ""Halloween"" remake.",8,1 February 2010,"Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) thought she killed her attacker Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) by shooting him in the face. Michael is presumed dead and he brought to a separate ambulance to transport his body. Michael finds himself awake, when the ambulance crashed into a cow. Two years later... Laurie is now living with Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif) and his daughter/her friend Annie (Danielle Harris) in the country side of Haddonfield. But Laurie isn't getting better, since she been having vivid nightmares, she's on medication and she's almost falling apart. Michael is been living outside of Haddonfield for two years. He sees his dead mother (Sheri-Moon Zombie) is his head, he sees himself as a young child (Chase Wright Vanek) and she's speaking to him. She's telling him it's time to go back to Haddonfield and he picked... where's he left off, two years ago. But Laurie still doesn't know of her true identity. Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) wrote an new book about Michael Myers. Since he survived the attack but he's relieving the secret about Laurie in his book. Nothing will be ever be the same for anyone at Haddonfield.Written and Directed by Rob Zombie (House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects) made an mean, tough, violent sequel to his remake of ""Halloween"". But in this movie, it's more his vision than his slick looking 2007 version. This is the review for the Unrated Director's Cut. Although i never seen the R-Rated theatrical cut and i know the ending is different from the Director's Cut. The performances are good here, especially Dourif and Harris are the stand-outs here. Compton is strong here and since her character is nearly slipping towards insanity. I felt she was doing an believable performance in her part. ""Halloween 2"" feels closer to the style at times from ""The Devil's Rejects"", which it was close to a Masterpiece that the director made. Horror fans will certainly be entertained to the brutal sayings of Michael Myers, which for some viewers will have a tough time to watch. Also Dr. Loomis character isn't sympathetic as he was in the remake although McDowell seems to be having a great time playing a real jerk in this one.The Blu-ray edition has an fine 1080p High Definition anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific DTS 5.1 HD Master Audio. This movie is actually well shot in 16mm to have that grainy, dark, depressing feeling of the style for the sequel. Best feature on the Blu-ray is the running commentary track from the director, which he points out the scenes were added back for his Director's Cut and talking about how it was making this sequel. Blu-ray extras includes Deleted/Alternate Scenes, Audition Footage, Outtakes and more. But it would have been nice, if they added an behind the scenes footage and the original theatrical ending as a special feature. I have an feeling, they will add other edition of ""Halloween 2"" on Blu-ray, someday. I felt ""Halloween 2"" is better than the ""Halloween"" remake. I liked his 2007 version (Both versions:Theatrical's Cut and Director's Cut are fine). I just feel that he was more into making this sequel than the remake. So... Judge it for yourself. Also remember that ""Family is Forever"". (****/*****).",Halloween II
62,JoeKarlosi,Halloween II (2009) *,2,5 September 2009,"What a load of garbage. We didn't need a remake of the 1978 HALLOWEEN, and we required another sequel remake entitled HALLOWEEN II even less. But here it is, with dark and hard-to-follow photography and characters you'd just love to shove a hot pitchfork through yourself, who you couldn't care less about. I will never speak out loud during a film at the theater, but when the foul-mouthed Laurie of this movie (Scout Taylor-Compton ???) kept babbling the ""F"" word over and over in between being a strung-out obnoxious junkie, at one point I couldn't resist the urge to yell out: ""OH, WILL SOMEBODY KILL HER PLEASE???"", while my wife hushed me with a sternly embarrassed ""Shhhhhhhhh"". I couldn't help it; this film and its characters were horrible. Oh, and the little girl who was in HALLOWEEN's 4 and 5 has a sizable part here too, like anyone cares.What's there to say about the plot? Some over-sized homeless person - who we'll call Michael Myers because that's what Zombie wants us to do - returns to seek out young Laurie Strode (I hate to even disgrace the original innocent and wholesome Jamie Lee Curtis character by calling this bimbo by the same name), presumably egged on by the ghost of his mother. Once you're made aware that this mom is played by director Zombie's own wife again, you realize that her frequent re-appearance is only to somehow justify her getting another part. Then we have clueless Malcolm McDowell, once again defaming the good name of ""Dr. Loomis"" from the original films by reducing the character to nothing more than a self-centered money grubbing opportunistic A-Hole (he even calls himself that at one point). His presence was so out of place in this picture that he could very well have been written out and nobody would have noticed. Poor, poor Donald Pleasence, R.I.P.The one reason I've given this dreck a star is because many of the killings by this Myers are brutal, and uncomfortably enhanced by him grunting savagely when destroying his prey -- very effective and unsettling. This is not your dad's Mike Myers -- though then again, this isn't really Michael Myers, period. I actually liked Rob Zombie's THE DEVIL'S REJECTS a lot ... but who knew back then that this type of trailer trash stuff was the only thing he knew how to do? Everyone and everything here is so dirty, depraved, and infested with grime that you'd applaud if Myers would just nuke the entire town. Even Brad Dourif as the town sheriff is portrayed as a slimy redneck. Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN made me appreciate John Carpenter's original more than I had previously. And now his HALLOWEEN II actually makes the 1981 sequel of the same name look like a classic. I guess behind every dark cloud there is a silver lining. * out of ****",Halloween II
63,TdSmth5,"Loud, brutal, violent, but lacks personality",7,1 September 2009,"You wouldn't be able to tell from the weak previews, but this movie is rather brutal and violent, most of it accomplished with wall-shaking loud sound effects.Michael is being transported in the coroner's vehicle when it hits a cow. Michael kills the guys and escapes. In the meantime his sister and another survivor have moved in with the town's Sheriff and have taken on a new life. However, she is haunted by night terrors involving Michael. Michael is guided by the ghost of his mother and of his younger self to embark an what looks like a cross-country walk back home to find his sister. He feeds of dogs and kills anyone in his path. During this he is usually without a mask wearing a hood instead and he's quite the handsome devil.Dr. Loomis has written a book about Michael Myers and is touring the country and the media circuit to promote it. He's a complete self-absorbed jerk who only cares about money and his image. But as coincidence would have it- the kind of coincidence that only happens in the movies- he's in the same town when Michael arrives to grab his sister. And in the end has a change of heart and offers to help.This movie is better than the previews lead you to believe. However, it's still weak. To make up for the weakness, the volume of the sound effects have been raised to keep the audience awake. What this movie is missing is the Rob Zombie touch. This is more like an effective Michael Bay remake. There's no character that stands out, although Loomis makes for a good villain.Michael has developed some hatred of faces, so he stabs all his victims in their faces until they die. You don't see too much gore, the brutality is achieved by sounds. But one guy gets his face smashed in as Michael stomps on it. Michael also seems to find endless number of windows to smash.The movie is about 20 minutes too long. Laurie's night terror's are long, there are a lot of Loomis episodes, and Michael's visions. Laurie has some cute and fun friends, I wish those characters had been developed more. Instead there's the's some lame Halloween party. When will filmmakers learn- parties are never fun in the movies. There's some nudity here and there, but unlike past Zombie movies, no full-frontal nudity, and very little humor. There's no sense of dread though as you would expect. No one has to hide from Michael or run from him. He's either there or not there. I give it a 7 for the sheer viciousness of it all, which has been missing in many horror movies. It is watchable but not thrilling.",Halloween II

It's by far the worst mainstream horror flick i've ever seen, but what baffles me most is the fact that this film was made at all. There isn't a single good quality I can think of with this film. Not any that hasn't been stolen from the other films or eventually used in them that are simply executed so incredibly poorly here. Seriously, i've seen fan films better than this- i've even seen fan films that look better than this film! Besides the dreadful acting, messy screenplay, and over the top...well everything- the cinematography is an absolute chore to follow- feeling like it was filmed in 2004 and projected through a gameboy. It's so incredibly tedious and all over the place, that I honestly didn't know what to feel besides disgusted throughout. Some thrillers that go for more realistic or graphic terroty can be good- but it's also good to have a plan while doing so- and not oversaturate your movie with pain so they just become numb to it by the end.

65,Jonny_Numb,Killer Instincts,7,29 August 2009,"In my review of Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds,"" I wrote that those put off by ""Death Proof"" would also likely be put off by his latest. Go figure that one week later, I am applying the same notion to Rob Zombie's sequel to his 2007 remake of ""Halloween."" One of the most heatedly derided remakes to date, I found Zombie's take impassioned and sincere while transcending John Carpenter's minimal, workmanlike low-budget-horror-flick terrain. While not a perfect film, ""Halloween"" epitomized (to me, anyway) the creative potential of the remake when placed in the right hands.""Halloween II"" finds Zombie returning to the Michael Myers maelstrom while tightening already-established character arcs, employing a harshly gritty style (courtesy of DP Brandon Trost), and topping it all off with a heapin' helpin' of carnage. Whereas ""Halloween"" focused on the inception and evolution of Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) from a murderous youth to the hulking masked madman we all know and love, Zombie's thematic focus this time out is ""family"" (and its many incarnations), using the traumatized character of Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) as its axis.Picking up one year after the fateful night her brother decided to come home, Laurie has become a punked-out version of her former virginal suburbanite self, and now resides with Sheriff Lee (Brad Dourif, sporting a Ted Nugent hairdo) and Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). Meanwhile, the Eve of All Hallows is looming over Haddonfield like a shadowy blanket, with a rejuvenated, hooded-angel-of-death Michael Myers making a pilgrimage back home, guided by the specters of his younger self (Chase Wright Vanek) and his mother, Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie). In the meantime, Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) has become a pop-psychology celebrity, authoring yet another book on his last run-in with the notorious Myers.With ""Halloween II,"" Zombie drops the slick, polished look of the initial film, replacing instead with dark, grainy stock punctuated by flashes of neon and the soft focus of black & white. In many ways, the director has created a film that, like his characters, is schizophrenic in its style, cleverly threading complex dream sequences into reality, and cutting away from scenes with little warning. While the employment of dream sequences in most films is a cheap tactic for a ""GOTCHA!"" moment, Zombie keeps his motives ambiguous: do the dreams represent a psychic link between Laurie and Michael? the erosion of Laurie's sanity? Michael's distorted concept of pilgrimage? Either (and every) way, they give the proceedings a richly layered psychological weight that, in addition to their shock value, make us feel that the characters each have something at stake. The events leading up to the brilliantly-staged climax are both unpredictable and surprisingly affecting.Unlike the ""Saw"" sequels (which have become the bane of the discriminating horror fan's existence), bathed in a hypocritical morality amid all the twisted flesh, spilled blood, and dungeon locations, Zombie is cognizant of death as something horrifying and destructive--the murders in ""Halloween II"" are played straight, executed with a fury that is disquieting; Myers has become a driven beast whose path of destruction possesses a joyless, workmanlike quality, removing any potential glamorization from the act. Every flesh-tearing slash, every helpless scream, cuts to the bone.Quite admirably, Zombie uses his second go-'round with Myers as a chance to tie up character arcs and plot threads that felt truncated in the over-ambitious ""Halloween"": Loomis, who seems detached from most of the main plot, is given a chance to redeem his greedy, bottom-feeder ways; Sheriff Brackett gets to exhibit a paternal side, but also an authoritarian mentality once the code of law is broken (he has several great, emotionally wrenching scenes near the end of the film); as Deborah, Sheri Moon Zombie's detached, trancelike performance is apt for the physical manifestation of the voice guiding a psychotic mind. Amid the carnage of his corpse-strewn landscape, Zombie's interest in character interaction and moral ambiguity gives ""Halloween II"" a depth that, for those with the stomach to take it, is downright refreshing.",Halloween II
66,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Halloween II (2009),5,13 September 2012,"To it's credit, it's better than the majority of sequels in the original Halloween series. Unfortunately, the flaws are just too big to ignore. Zombie is obsessed with creating his own vision and this leads to some bizarre choices and plot details. As before, Zombie wants us to sympathise with the villain, so he is now followed around by a white horse, a younger version of himself and his mother. A choice that cynics will imply was just to get Zombie's wife some more screen time. Mane's ferocious strength translates well, but when walking around as part of the odd-bunch, it becomes distracting. Zombie tries his hand at some artistic flourishes, which would be welcome, and would feel right at home in an original piece. As part of the Halloween mythology, it just sucks out all of the fun. An acceptable slasher, but one that mixes the laughable with the horrific in a tasteless mix.",Halloween II
67,Sandcooler,Well...it's different,2,30 October 2011,"I have to be honest here: I was actually sorta excited when I heard Rob Zombie would be doing some ""Halloween""-remakes. Not that I was ever particularly fond of his other work, but at least he did seem like the type of guy who had a fair amount of respect for the original. In the ideal case, John Carpenter's subtle suspense would somehow blend together with Zombie's energetic and (albeit sporadically) daring style. Sadly, the end result is just embarrassing. Apart from some character names it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual ""Halloween""-movies, it prefers to be a collage of everything you can hate about Rob Zombie films. Overuse of pop culture references: check. Failed artsy experiments: check. Jumpy editing: check. Excruciating dialogues: check. Virtually no plot: check. Rob Zombie's wife: check. Irritating characters: oh, that's definitely a check. What the hell happened to Laurie Strode? It's been a while since I've seen the John Carpenter version, but I'm pretty sure she wasn't meant to be an inbred rage-aholic that dropped f-bombs every four words or so. Jamie Lee Curtis' career must be spinning in its grave. I guess it's interesting that Zombie refused to make his final girl a goodie two-shoes, but interesting is the friendliest word I can come up with. Worse than any other offense I've listed though, this movie's just really, really boring. It's a pain in the ass to sit through, and it doesn't even reward you with a halfway decent climax. What a disappointment.",Halloween II
68,Matt_Layden,The Film Is Completely Forgettable.,3,4 September 2009,"The film picks up right where the last one left us. Laurie is walking down the street covered in blood with a gun still in her hand. She is hospitalized, along with her friend Annie. Michael survive the gunshot to the head and comes back to reunite with his sister. Killing everyone in his way.Not much of a plot, not much of a film. This sequel punishes those who had any interest in the first and almost immediately kills this re-invented series. The remake of the original is not bad and Zombie did a decent job of bringing Michael Myers to the new century of horror, but with the sequel he seems to have steered too far into House of 1,00 corpses territory.Why is Michael so terrifying? Well, he use to be that is, because he never had a reason to kill. He just did it. In the words of Dr. Loomis, he was pure evil. Freddy had the revenge thing, Jason has the mommy issues, Michael was just evil. Zombie, on the other hand, seems to have missed this point and deemed it necessary to have Michel do things because of visions he has of his mother and a white horse. Enough with the mommy issues, leave that crap for Jason. Michael got his background story given to us in the remake. He is a sick and disturbing boy, now we see that he has a method behind his madness? The film's script consists of dream sequence, wake up and scream obscenities. Then we cut to Michael making a trip to Mount Doom, killing people along the way. Repeat this for about an hour. Then have a lame, not thrilling, not scary pathetic excuse for a climax at the end, that takes place in a shed. A shed in which Myers stands still while our main character battles herself and imaginary people. This is the same main character whom people seem to have liked in the first film, here she becomes an annoying crying little emo baby. The film brings back a few character whom we thought were dead from the first film, only to see them die here. Waste? I think so. Purpose? Nothing what so ever. Dr. Loomis has a separate story alongside Myers and Strode. One that makes him look like a total douche bag and seems to have been thrown in to make the film run longer and seem more fleshed out. The problem is that it's paper thin and out of character.Myers is no longer scary, and neither is this series. The film is laughable and the predictable by the numbers set up and execution will make you fall asleep. After years and years of slasher films, you would think they would want the deaths to be unique and the very least creative. Seeing this horror legends slice and dice is what the fans of the original series want. Halloween II has none of this. All Myers does is stab people multiple times. Grunting while doing so, which also ruins the myth of this character. He is suppose to be this silent killer. With the exception of a face stomp, none of these kills are memorable.Zombie here seems to have gone backwards in his film-making skills. The whole thing feels like a first time music video director takes a shot at a horror film. The sloppy editing and hand held camera make it almost impossible to see. The darkness of the film doesn't help either. I respect Zombie, more than Eli Roth, for trying to put a new stamp on the horror genre, but this is a horrible mess. Being a member of the Splat Pack, you can expect this film to be excessive in its violence. It is, but it's never really too much, specifically with how filsm are done these days. This is probably one of the weakest slasher films to have come out in a while. Prom Night is the only thing I can think of that is lower on the scale. Things are left unexplained for god knows what reason. Apparently Myers and Strode share a psychic link to each other? Halloween was an interesting take from a fan of the horror genre on a classic. Halloween II is the same fan's dream, only in his own little weird world. A giant misstep, and this series is already done. Skip it.",Halloween II
69,begob,Long and messy,4,27 August 2014,"The Halloween concept needed a supernatural injection - a crazed slasher is pretty boring.The reviews here keep talking about the psychology of this movie, but it's completely anti-psychology, with both therapists shown up as useless and only the police-state capable of stopping the monster.So we get visions and dream-sequences. The first sequence is done well, with idling car to misdirect the audience as we figure out the escape. Instead the heroine gets chopped - then wakes up! So we get visions to bring in the supernatural, but they're a bit Munster Family, a bit specific, not really creepy. They messed up the film. What's the harm in being suggestive instead? The Frankenstein's Monster idea was nice but undeveloped, and they missed a trick by not having a mask-to-mask confrontation. And the idea of trickery with masks was completely ignored, just like in the first movie. For gawd's sake, there was even a reference to plastic surgery at the beginning, and nothing developed from it.There were a few mild jumps. Zombie's excellent dialogue from previous movies was on vacation, plus his '70s soundtrack didn't create much atmosphere this time round. And most of the 20m chase scene at the climax is worth skipping.",Halloween II
70,moviewizguy,Family Is Forever,3,21 February 2010,"Michael Myers is still at large and no less dangerous than ever. After a failed reunion to reach his baby sister at their old home, Laurie Strode is immediately taken to a hospital to be treated by the wounds that had been afflicted by her brother a few hours ago. However, Michael isn't too far off and will continue his murdering 'Halloween' rampage until he gets his sister all to himself.When you read or listen to the interviews of director Rob Zombie after the completion of his HALLOWEEN remake, you'd notice he didn't want to make a sequel nor was he planning to. However, a couple of months later, he regained interest in a sequel and had a limited amount of time to shoot the film for the close release date. After watching this film, it's apparent everything was rushed to get this film out of to the deadline. I liked Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN. I honestly did. I loved the way he made it his own vision and that he showed the origins of Michael Myers. I also respected the characters in the first film. Now, what the hell happened here? It was as if the script was made up while they were shooting the film. It was as if they did the opposite of everything that was good in the first film. What a mess!The film starts off interesting, to be quite honest. We're given the definition of one of the film's themes: The white horse. I liked it because it gives this franchise a new direction to branch out of than be the usual slasher film. However, it all goes down here from there. The interesting and unique ideas presented in here ends up being quite bland and ridiculous. It's apparent Zombie was trying to make a surrealistic slasher film. In fact, this film would have been the product if director David Lynch made a slasher film. However, everything was executed so badly and confusingly. By the end, there is no words to describe what the white horse is even though we are given the definition of it in the first frame.The film also meanders all over the place between a half-baked surrealistic film and your usual slasher with every cliché that you can ever see in this type of genre. One thing I complained about in the first movie was the violence, which was quite disgusting. Zombie didn't quite go over-the-top with it as one may have feared. However, this film gives ""backstabbing"" a whole new meaning. Imagine the violence in the first film multiply by 100. The death scenes are so brutal, mean-spirited, and distasteful just for the sake of violence and gore. It was as if Myers took a bottle of steroids since the first film. Where he take an average of three stabs to kill the victims in the first film will take him thirty stabs to overkill the victims in this here.The characters are a mess as well, which is quite a surprise considering all of the surviving cast members from the first film reprise their roles. Scout Taylor-Compton as the heroine is so different from her character in the first film that you almost don't recognize her. She's more bitchy and whiny as ever before. She's bipolar in a way that she screams and cries in one scene and is trashy and happy in the next. Malcolm McDowell isn't much better either. If any, he's worse than Compton. As a stable and understanding psychiatrist in the first film, he's PMSing and a jerk in here. Danielle Harris continues the trend as the evermore annoyed and cranky friend of Compton. Don't get me started on the new cast members. With no hope, it's surprising to say the one saving grace in this entire film with more dimensionality than every character combined is Brad Dourif. His character actually gets more development and I'm saying that in a good way. He gives a terrific performance.Overall, everything seemed to be completely different since the first film. That's also including Haddonfield itself, now looking more like a hillbilly and trashy town more than ever. I would seriously hope the main cause of the film's badness is due to the time constraints it was in because I think Rob Zombie to be a terrific director with his own unique visual style. Sure, some will probably end up liking this film. There always are. However, there's more likely of a chance that one will not like the film. Watch this film only if you can bring yourself to watch it.",Halloween II
71,elliotjeory,It's bad,2,4 October 2021,"Compared to the first Rob Zombie film this is atrocious, lacks any of the features of the first one. Why the ghosts? Come on it didn't even have a story, the acting is bad and it's filmed terribly. Overall a bad film.",Halloween II
72,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Though not without some clever sequences and brutal imagery that will please gore-hounds, ""Halloween II"" unfortunately suffers a bizarrely WEIRD script that doesn't quite work",4,17 January 2014,"I'm just going to come out and admit it. I loved Rob Zombie's 2007 ""Halloween"" reboot. I thought it was a crazy, hellish ride that gave a fairly interesting new take on the Michael Myers mythos. Sure, it wasn't without its flaws, but I feel that it was a good film. Different from the original series for sure. And not for everyone. But a good film.Then there's this sequel. A film that I am not really sure how to review, because it's one weird, wild, crazy watch. It's a film that still has me scratching my head years later, trying to process what worked and what didn't work about it.We again follow Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who one year after the first film is living with the Bracketts. (Danielle Harris as Annie and the criminally underrated Brad Dourif as her father, Sheriff Lee Brackett) Michael (Tyler Mane), somehow still alive following the finale of the original film, escapes from an ambulance transporting his body in a very bizarre sequence, and spends the year living as a hermit in the woods, under the guidance of a spectral hallucination of his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie). As it once again approaches Halloween, Laurie begins to lose her cool, especially after an exploitative tell-all book by Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) reveals her relation to Michael. All the while, Michael slowly returns to Haddonfield to finish the job and presumably murder the survivors of his last rampage.To give credit where it is due, the acting is solid. Some have complained that Taylor-Compton didn't give a good performance as Laurie, but I disagree. I thought her performance was very decent, and her character, while not necessarily totally likable, is compelling and convincing as a young woman who has been left mentally ravaged by everything that has happened to her. She's a scarred person, inside and out, and as a result, she has developed a nasty, selfish, compulsive and even borderline paranoid personality. And I thought she did the role justice. McDowell is just plain fun as Loomis. Much like Laurie, Loomis has been criticized in this film for being selfish and unlikable, but again... that was sort of the point, and I thought McDowell was just a blast to watch, having turned into almost a diva. He was probably my second favorite performance in the film. My absolute favorite was Brad Dourif as the Sheriff. While in the first film, Brackett was a brash, intense person, here you see what a fun, teddy- bear of a person he can be towards his family, and he's given a lot of compelling sequences to explore. In all honesty, Brackett is arguably the ""hero"" of the movie, and although he doesn't have as much screen- time as Laurie, he has almost as much focus in the story, becoming a pseudo second main character. Harris and Mane are also very good in their roles as Annie and Michael.However, the film falls apart when it comes to the behind-the-scenes material. For starters, I will say that the film is fairly well directed by Zombie, at least visually. Though he relies on the gritty, shaky-cam style of camera-work (which I'm tired of at this point), it's very comprehensible and watchable. It doesn't go too far as some films do, and the shaky-cam does compliment his style and the story he is trying to tell. However, his aesthetic and creative choices do get questionable. Even though I enjoyed the first film, it is becoming clear that Zombie has a fairly obvious style to his storytelling- everything is filthy, everyone is a redneck, etc. And it gets old. In addition, some of the more abstract sequences (particularly hallucinatory and dream sequences), while creative, feel forced, and some of Zombie's visual motifs (such as a white horse that appears at times) are contrived and feel pretentious.The script by Zombie is the biggest problem here. Because it's so darned weird, and it feels like Zombie didn't know what to do. So he tried to actively make it different from the first film while maintaining the some tone. And it betrays itself. There are already a lot of weird things going on that I've brought up (hallucinations, trippy dreams, etc.), and I haven't even touched on some of Zombie's other odd touches. (I didn't even bring up the weird psychic-connection between Laurie and Michael, a twisted dream-sequence taking place in a hospital, nor an amusingly bizarre sequence featuring ""Weird Al"" Yankovik) I think Zombie (who originally wasn't even going to make this sequel before changing his mind) wanted to try new things, so he used this script as an experimental ground to see what he could and could not get away with on screen. And it doesn't work together as a cohesive film. The straight-horror elements alternate between feeling forced, over-brutal and tacked-on, before suddenly feeling forgotten once the stranger sequences start up. And the strange, weird stuff feels really contrived because it's so different from not only the rest of the film, but the first film as well. It's a finished film that feels like two separate movies edited together.All that being said, this film isn't without some things to admire. As said earlier, the acting is very good. And I genuinely enjoyed the character arcs of both Dr. Loomis and Sheriff Brackett. In addition, the horror sequences are very strong and very brutal. While this may turn some people off, I found them effective and visceral, and it did please the gore-hound inside me quite a bit. And finally, even though it is a weird, weird, WEIRD film, I admired some of the things Zombie was trying to do.I am giving this film a 4 out of 10. It's not a good film, nor is it a complete and utter failure. I'd say horror fans should give it a shot, since it is a fascinating watch and some may enjoy it.",Halloween II
73,DJAkin,Michael Meyers is Paul Bunyan now,2,25 February 2010,"I don't like how Michael Meyers didn't really wear his mask in this movie. He looked like Zakk Wylde with a brown head of hair and beard. I was not impressed with how Michael Meyers killed in this movie. Michael Meyers was basically doing easy kills suck as stomping on a person's head, throwing a lady against a mirror 45 times, poking a person's eye out, cutting a man's throat and then beheading him like a terrorist, punching a person as hard as he could and then tossing them onto some antlers, head butting a person to death from the back of their head and finally taking a person and putting their head into a meat grinder that is over-sized and then manually turning the handle and letting the dog eat the meathead. All in all a terrible movie.",Halloween II
74,rivertam26,Intriguing but overly mediocre,5,3 March 2020,"Revisiting this during my Myers marathon so many years after being disappointed during its initial release. I actually have just a touch more appreciation for it. I still don't think it's a good movie by any means. But it does seem to have more of an identity that the remake. Original at the time in the Halloween franchise of its exploration of the trauma that the surviving characters have endured and the after effects is interesting. Some of it works and some of it doesn't. The good stuff is Zombie's story direction and some solid ideas. The beginning is exciting and appropriately nonsensical. Danielle Harris is the MVP of the movie giving Annie some layers and a likable, genuine feel unlike the last film. The bad is the unnecessary mean sportiness, the goofy and crass dialogue, Scout Taylor Compton's horrific turn once again as Laurie and the decision to have Sheri Moon in it again with a white horse. I get it symbolically but having it materialized physically throughout the entire film is a big mistake. I also loved once again the ferociousness of Michael. All in all it's better than I remember but it's still not a good movie on any level. Mist of it feels unnecessary and soulless and mostly it's just not very entertaining.",Halloween II
75,Analog_Devotee,An absolute embarrassment.,1,14 April 2020,"I hated the first film, but I could at least respect Zombie for taking it in a different direction. I didn't understand the overly huge Myers, the unnecessary backstory, or this fantasy land where everyone swears after they've said two other words. But again: I could at least respect him for taking it in a different direction. Who am I to shame someone for having a vision?This film, however, is nothing more than an illogical, convoluted ball of nonsense. Why make an unnecessary, convoluted film? Because of money. Now, every film is created with the rooted intentions being to make money, sure, but this? This is one of the most blatant cash grabs I've ever seen. It's painfully obvious that not only did they have no clue where to go with this sequel, but they didn't care, either.Got a Halloween itch that needs to be scratched? Go back to the originals.

76,btreakle,Rob Zombie,6,20 March 2020,I thought 2009 directed by Rob Zombie was kind of a letdown. I still watched it and I respected that it's a reference to the original Halloween 2. But if your Halloween band you must watch this one,Halloween II
77,capkronos,There's a little to love... but a lot more to hate.,3,31 August 2009,"A year after the events of Zombieween, Michael Myers - who somehow survived a bullet to the head, killed a couple of coroners and escaped into the woods - comes back to the small town of Haddonfield to reunite with his troubled sister Laurie (Scout Taylor-Comptom)... and kill off anyone else he happens to come into contact with. Somehow all this time, Laurie is still oblivious to the fact she's actually even related to Myers. But that will all change when a novel written by Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is released to the public. In a silly attempt to give this ordinary slasher some artsy cred, Michael is now guided by visions of his dead stripper mother (Sheri Moon), himself as a child and her magical white stallion (!?!) Oh brother.Taylor-Compton's shrill, nearly non-stop shrieking and crying never lets up for a second. She's not believable during her big dramatic moments and hilariously unconvincing trying to play a hard-edged tattooed punkette. Then we have Rob's wife Sheri Moon. Thankfully she's playing a delusion so her vacant facial expressions and monotone line delivery are at least somewhat acceptable for the part she's playing. It's still hard not to be annoyed that an utterly pointless role was grafted on just so she could participate in the film.Nearly every single horror scene is botched by split second cuts that get increasingly more tiresome as the film progresses. The kills themselves are forgettable. What some refer to as ""brutal"" reminded me of professional wrestling where people basically get thrown around 20 times before falling over. It was over-the-top and comical. Everything looks extremely ugly, grimy and dreary thanks to 16mm film stock and dim lighting. As a result, a lot of the footage was difficult to make out. If I'm going to watch a slasher film, I at least want to clearly make out the gore / murder scenes. Clarity of picture was often blurred (a style choice, but it sucked), and mixed with the rapid fire editing and graininess, the attack scenes were completely annoying to watch. Even worse, nothing even remotely scary happens the entire time. No suspense is ever generated. The film couldn't even deliver jump scares. I wasn't really expecting this to be scary. It's a Rob Zombie movie, after all. Still, it would have been nice for a horror film to provide something, you know, horrific.And what gives with Sheriff Bracket's (Brad Dourif) house? This is just one example of how Zombie's obsession with grime and disgusting living conditions gets downright silly. The interiors looked like a waste dump and I seriously doubt the three people who lived there would be wallowing around in that filth. And the Sheriff is just going to let Laurie spray paint a giant Satanic star on her door and start hanging Charles Manson pictures in her room? Riiiiight.Any claims that this film is in any way ""realistic"" are hilarious at best. Michael teleports to various locations within seconds a la Jason, which are due to bad pacing, scripting and editing. And I'm sorry but it's hard to swallow the concept of a giant hulk hiding out in the woods near Haddonfield for an entire year without being detected. Oh wait, apparently he HAS been detected. There's a scene where three rednecks are mad that this 7-foot weirdo who's always hiding his face is on their property yet ""again."" I guess in a year's time these yahoos haven't heard a thing about the near-by butcher job or the well-publicized fact that the killer's body turned up missing and he's rumored to still be alive. I know rednecks aren't known for their intellect, but are we really supposed to believe these people are THAT stupid? Let's see... A strange, abnormally large man who hides his face suddenly starts hanging out in the woods near your home. A strange, abnormally large man who killed 20 or so people may still be at large. Hmmm... How about we put two and two together and get into contact with the police about this, shall we? Nah, let's just hit him with a stick a few times and then turn our backs to him instead. There are many other moments that tax credibility to the limit that I could mention (such as Myers picking up a car and flipping it over!), though I realize that this is ""just a slasher film"" and I should just smile and accept such stupidity as part of the game.Zombie's poor writing hasn't improved; the intensity of a character's rage is illustrated by how many times they shoot off the ""f"" bomb in one minute. Scout's potty-mouthed flip-out sessions where she screams profanities over and over again are hysterically funny and the other humor is centered around things Rob (and every 3rd grader across the country, no doubt) automatically assume are funny. You know, stuff like necrophilia, herpes, date rape drugs and golden showers.On the plus side, this has some well-composed shots; namely the scenes dealing with ghost mom. They're sometimes very striking. In addition, some of the night shots where light floods in through the trees look great. This movie has the most uneven cinematography I've seen in quite some time. It ranges from awful to outstanding.And is Rob getting softer on us? I saw a glimpse of (*gasp*) humanity actually directed toward a victim for a change instead of it all being heaped onto the psycho. It's just too bad the characters he created are so thinly drawn it's impossible to really care for any of these people. Try not to roll your eyes at the sudden burst of Enya music when little Annie is found dead. Oh well, at least he tried.Final Verdict: A complete and utter mess... with a couple of cool shots... that unfortunately fall into the ""shining a turd"" category in the context of an otherwise very bad film.",Halloween II

It is worse than Night of the Demon, The Ring 2, Leprechaun 27 and Nightmare on Elm Street Freddy on Pluto. Zombie is stuck in a trailer park and he has no clue how to write believable characters or invoke any real fear. This movie is a disgrace to Halloween lore and I hope John Carpenter got paid a lot of money to let him do this. He's going to need it to pay the bills to the shrink he'll be seeing after seeing what Zombie did to this.0/10EDIT....looks like I don't need to write a more detailed review. This one sums it up.

81,jaredmobarak,Hit the bricks Dorothy  Halloween II,4,3 September 2009,"This film is not good, by any means, yet it does have some really great style and aesthetic. Unfortunately, it is a bit schizophrenic in its execution. For every awesome visual sequence, whether in a dream/nightmare/white trash living room, there is that brutal murder that goes beyond masochism and straight into sadism. I understand a story must be told and the masses must be appeased into having an idea of what is going on, but when you have brilliance like a crazy, slimy, pumpkin-head people dinner party, screw comprehension and give me surrealistic bliss. Scenes like this make me believe Zombie has something up his sleeve and hopefully the future will finally bring it out. For all I know it's happened already with House of 1,000 Corpses and this train wreck just makes me want to see that debut even more.Rumor/speculation/fact/whatever has it being said that Halloween III will be happening, but sans Zombie and in 3D, (because every third part needs to be since it works so smoothly with the name). This is not a bad idea at all. The ex-rocker needs to get back to cultivating original work and opening the world to some horrific imagery without any history attached. We know the Michael Myers stories and how he works and his relation to the victims. This ingrained knowledge begs to bring up comparisons and, let's face it, nostalgia for the original will always win out. So take your twisted mind Rob and really mess up our slumber with imagery incapable of being forgotten, as we know you can. This film is better than his first, (that's not saying much), just for the reason that he has taken the plot in fantastical places, adding layers of the supernatural and psychological world.This one ratchets up the look to the point where it assaults your sensibilities. It's not only the matriarch stripper with too much make-up, coarse language, and take no crap attitude watching her son put on his cheaply made mask for Halloween's ritual begging; no, now its about a lifestyle of darkness and evil. Sheriff Brackett, have you ever been upstairs in your house? How can you allow your daughter and friend to do what they did to that bathroom? A pentagram and ""666"" written on the door, curse words in graffiti or printed everywhere, and a picture of Jesus by the toilet? Even Laurie's bedroom is complete with a giant image of Charles Manson hanging above the bed. And these are the good girls may I remind you. Before a party full of debauchery, (this is the Zombie I'd like to see more of in low-budget indie slashers), Scout Taylor-Compton mentions how being a good girl has gotten her nowhere. Man did I grow up in a good place if that house, those clothes, and her job is being ""good"". That party, though, wow  it's like the Labyrinth costume ball on acid, vampire blood, and lust; a lethal combination indeed.I do applaud Zombie for saying screw you to the original series run's scripts and doing what he wanted, even if it's unsuccessful. Loomis as a money-grubbing, attention whore cashing in on the carnage a former patient of his inflicted? Definitely great on paper and, with Malcolm McDowell hamming it up, decent on screen, but overall just plain forced. I couldn't help thinking that this new incarnation of a man trying his best to save his tortured soul is merely a stand-in for Rob himself. After two cult successes, Zombie went and did the mainstream thing, toning down his vision, (if that's possible), and going for the money rather than the originality. So he puts in Loomis to do the same, a hubristic journey to redemption and the chance to maybe do something right. This is Zombie killing the hack he refuses to become, and if this film has any merit, let's hope that is it. Out with the old and in with the new in many ways according to the end here. But without a third installment under his reins, the set-up is most likely all for nought.Acting-wise, though, I didn't really have a problem. Kudos to the multiple cameos and bit parts from recognizable folk just to die in horrific ways. There's the ""Deadwood"" connection with Brad Dourif's reprisal of the Sheriff and Dayton Callie's inclusion as an ambulance driver and the ""Heroes"" connection with McDowell's return and Speedy herself, Brea Grant's, small part friend. And how about Margot Kidder? At least some people are having some fun. It's not all adequate, however, as Zombie really needs to be comfortable not casting his wife. Sheri Moon Zombie has the look and the intensity for this film, but every time she opens her mouth just proves how amateurish she is. Being an apparition here meant Zombie could have had her face, mouth always closed, and another actress to speak with some inflection and tonal differentiation, but alas he did not.It is those supernatural moments of Sheri Moon appearing in the thoughts of both Michael and Laurie, bringing them together to bond the three in some demonic spiritual ritual, that stuck with me through the unintentional laughing and headshaking running rampant elsewhere. Seeing her with the white horse under a shining moon, atmospheric and striking, is beautiful. And, along with that amazing dinner party scene with the pumpkin people ready to eat Laurie, the dark nightmarish moments are great. Quick cuts in Laurie's mind while at the Halloween rave of her trapped in a glass coffin or screaming with markings carved into her face left an impression. It's just too bad the fact of the film's failings and stupidity, (Myers walking through a field with a giant Grizzly Adams beard is supposed to be suspenseful?), leaves a much stronger memory.",Halloween II
82,Fernando-Rodrigues,H2!,8,17 August 2021,"Zombie ""Zombified"" this film for good. Grindhouse-styled, rock n' roll, dialogues with the human psyche, violence, gore, metal, everything related to his style. But at some points, the movie gets mediocre because of its messy script full of conveniences (Loomis and Annie alive), dirty talking, and contours discording with the Michael Myers' mythology essence (Laurie's PTSD approach is so intricate that its subjectivity becomes an issue). Still, it's a good movie. I personally prefer this one more than the 2007 remake.",Halloween II
83,ODDBear,Disappointed!,4,6 September 2009,"I think this is the first Halloween featuring Michael Myers that I'm rating less than 5/10. Although 2002's ""Resurrection"" was pretty bad it still retained some of the old ""Halloween"" charm...though 5 may have been a little too generous there. Here I feel Mr. Zombie went too far astray and what people didn't care for the first time around...he decided to go even further this time.Nearly everyone comments on the white horse thing, I'll just say here that I didn't care for that. As for the constant use of profanity and displaying of white trash folks, well it bothered me more here. It seems that Zombie was a little restricted with the remake (thank God) but here he had free rein and did whatever he chose.To say H2 is a total failure is going a bit too far but it certainly isn't a welcome addition to the Myers saga. I didn't care for the way Loomis (McDowell) was handled here, I still hate Laurie (Compton) and the whole red neck/white trash population here still doesn't feel very ""Halloween"" to me. Stylistically this film looks sort of like ""House of 1.000 Corpses"", weird dream sequences and hallucinations simply don't belong in a Halloween flick.Some good things are floating around here, though. Brad Dourif is excellent as Sheriff Brackett, Danielle Harris is much better as Annie than in the remake and the brutal violence here is executed well...here's a Michael that's really mad (in the first scene at least...but wait...that was a dream, right?).I have a feeling that Mr. Zombie raised his hand and pulled out his middle finger to fans of the series that weren't all that pleased with some of his directions with the remake. Going into Michael's psyche and explaining him just doesn't seem to work all that well and here it's just plain boring in it's attempt.But I have a distinct fear that the worst is yet to come; I read somewhere that the next installment is going to be in 3-D. Well, maybe Myers can jump out of the screen and scare the hell out of the dude that thinks that's a good idea.",Halloween II
84,cultfilmfan,Halloween 2,9,7 September 2009,"Halloween 2 is a follow up to writer/director Rob Zombie's 2007 version of the film which was based on the original John Carpenter film from the late 70's. Now first off I would like to address the fact that much like Rob Zombie's last version of Halloween, this version was not screened for critics. Usually when a studio does not screen a movie for critics to review, it means that the studio knows they have a bad film on their hands and if it was to get reviewed, it would get terrible reviews and probably hurt the film's box office gross. I haven't really seen any point in studios doing this, because lately there have been several films that have been released for the critics to review and the critics just hated said films and they got terrible reviews. However the movie going audiences still went to see them and they made a good buck at the box office. I think if a moviegoer is really interested in a particular film they will go see it despite the reviews, whether they are good, or bad. Some critics did get a chance a couple days later to review Halloween 2 and a lot of them really did not like it. I was also looking around on some of the internet movie message boards and seeing how the average viewers like the film and most of them were either lukewarm over it, or on the other hand they absolutely hated it. I still liked the previous film, so I wanted to give this one a shot. I would also like to state that the horror genre is not a genre for everyone, especially slasher films, of which Halloween 2 is one. A lot of people find them repetitive and just non stop gore and brutality with no artistic, or redeeming value and is more or less a waste of time and money. Then you have some horror films (mostly older ones) like The Exorcist, The Shining and Rosemary's Baby that are almost universally praised and they are so well done that they don't just shine for the horror genre, but movies in general. Most people I know who will see a horror film will stick to one of the classics such as the ones I just mentioned. They are a lot smarter, have more atmosphere, better acting and don't repeat the usual formulas, or clichés that some horror films (or most for that matter) do. I can see and agree with the argument on both sides. I do enjoy mindless slasher films for a bit of an escape and for what I would call light entertainment. I don't necessarily need to have my horror films really gory, or violent at all. I just like a good story and some good atmosphere and some thrills. Then again a lot of my favourite horror films are the ones I mentioned above and I do have a lot more respect for them, but a film like Halloween 2 is just good for a bit of an entertaining thrill ride of an escape that is entertaining, but probably will not stay with you after you leave the theatre. Halloween 2 did have a lot of atmosphere and stylish shots which I did like and I also liked how this time around it did get a little bit more into the characters and their true personalities. The psychological part of the film while at times it did seem a bit far fetched was still interesting to me and made for some compelling viewing. Most of the acting was decent here for the type of film it was and it did deliver excitement and thrills and was pretty entertaining. It also had a surrealistic touch to it which I thought was great also. This is certainly not the worst film of the year and I think fans of slasher horror films, or recent films of the genre will enjoy it. It doesn't have the same effect on you as say The Exorcist, but it is still entertaining and a fun night out.",Halloween II
85,fernandoschiavi,"Halloween 2 tries to delve into Michael Myers' psyche and offers some interesting aspects, but it still suffers from its unfortunate choices",5,5 September 2021,"Following a long flashback that takes place directly after the end of the previous one, with Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) surviving his injuries and chasing Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) as the young woman recovers in a hospital, the plot sets in to start 2 years after the assassin's return to Haddonfield. Laurie and Annie (Danielle Harris) try to overcome the trauma of the attacks and find themselves in a very different situation, while Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) succeeds in selling his new book based on the Myers attacks. However, from a distance, an obsessed Myers plans his return to Haddonfield to kill his sister, being guided by angelic visions of his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) and a mysterious white horse.Now, with Halloween 2, Rob Zombie could finally break free from the shackles of reshooting a great horror movie classic. After all, this new movie of yours is a sequel to the remake, not a remake of the sequel to the original - Halloween 2 directed by Rick Rosenthal in 1981. This time, the script-director would have the freedom to start over from scratch, create his own material, finally adding their own ideas without the pressure of remaking a classic film. Anyway, he could take it easy, correcting the (countless) nonsense of his 2007 remake and, who knows, even transforming Michael Myers into a character closer to the original franchise. And that's the good news about Halloween 2: Rob Zombie is now really trying to tell an original story, a Halloween all of his own, with his own ideas and a new script, totally decoupled from what Carpenter and his troupe did back in the 70s-80s.And now the bad news, which is exactly the same: yes, Halloween 2 is an original Rob Zombie story, a film all of him, with his own ideas and a new script, but that only demonstrates the lack of creativity of the subject. That's because the entire movie is identical to everything Zombie has done to date, with the same metalhead characters and/or foul-mouthed hillbillies (what, in the US, they call ""white trash""), the same dirty and dark scenarios, the same dirty, ugly people who don't seem to have a bath in months, the same five-fold violence and the same hard rock on the soundtrack. Oh, and with even less respect for the characters from the original series.As he performed in 2007, Zombie is torn between literally reshooting a portion of the original film (in this case, the 1981 sequel directed by Rick Rosenthal) and introducing a completely new portion, but here he risks being ""inventive"" during most of the drawn-out 2-hour narrative. There are interesting elements, like the whole Michael portion and the white horse visions, which practically elevate mother Myers to the levels of Pamela Voorhees and Norma Bates, who guide her son to complete a series of murders, and Zombie is happy to bring the characters discussing the meaning of the white horse and even bringing an academic text on the study of dreams to justify it, and I confess that the decision is pleasing; it's something different from what we've already seen in the franchise, and it even serves to bring some identification with the killing machine - albeit a questionable decision.In directing, Zombie keeps his pseudo-documentary camera and marked by a highly contrasted photograph of Brandon Trost, which also exaggerates the grain. But it is an improvement over the previous one, as here the director is able to create genuine tension in rare moments, such as the great scene in which Laurie hides in the office of a hospital security guard, in a desolate setting punished by an intense rain and almost dangerous, being the best scene in the entire film and also one of the best uses of the figure of Michael in the entire franchise, whose mask becomes even more frightening in this deluge scenario. And speaking of masks, the assassin's ""beggar"" look works surprisingly well, with Captain Kirk's shattered mask offering crisp details of Tyler Dane's bearded face, and by extension, a slightly more conscious presence of the assassin, who wins. More prominence in your look. It's interesting to watch the scene where Myers spends a lot of time stabbing a girl. In addition to showing the sick mind of the killer, the scene also brings a very classic type of horror that is difficult to see in current films of the genre, since most fall into caricature. And this is the most attractive side of the work. The problem is that, after so many consecutive deaths, there comes a time that gets tired and the work becomes boring and predictable. And it ends up being difficult to hold the audience in its almost two hours of duration.But Zombie also delivers a lot of hype, especially a sequence set in a Halloween rave, with the flashing lights highlighting the bizarre monster and creature costumes there. Finally, all of Michael's visions of his mother also yield a more apparent visual care, with the use of white (both in photography and in production and costume design) and rays of light that evoke an almost angelic presence. And were it not for the grimaces of his wife Sheri Moon, Zombie would even be able to provoke a certain fear with such sequences, which also include the appearance of young Michael, who is played here by Chase Vanek, replacing the great Daeg Faerch from the previous one. The ghost of Mommy Myers, with her unbelievable white horse, spends the entire movie appearing to the psychopathic puppy, trying to convince him to go back to killing people, especially Sister Laurie, so that everyone can be ""one big family"" again in the beyond. In other words, Zombie tried to do something more serious and realistic in the remake of the original, only to then move on to the absurd resurrection of its villain and supernatural apparitions of lost souls.But the big mistake is in Laurie Strode's arc. Scout Taylor-Compton no longer demonstrated the charisma or lightness of Jamie Lee Curtis in the previous one, which justifies her radical change to a young rebel and rocker (typical Zombie), but she is a simply unbearable character. Thanks to Zombie's debilitated writing, Laurie's trauma is never able to generate any empathy, as the young woman is always angry and swearing and her mood swings are laughable: at one point she's crying and cursing the world to finally discover her Originated as Myers' sister, and in the next scene she is inexplicably begging her friends to go to a party and ""enjoy"".The traumatic Halloween experience turned former nerd Laurie into a troubled teenager, a revolting vegetarian metal head who is always with dirty hair, smudged makeup and punk-chic little clothes. The girl also has a poster of Charles Manson (!!!) in her bedroom and works in a record store, along with other syrupy girls who are rockers. Certainly, at no time does Rob Zombie's Laurie manage to win the spectator's sympathy. It also doesn't help that Compton is forced into over acting with screaming and crying all the time, and in this way even ""understands"" how easier it is to identify with Myers, just following his mother's spirit, while the police officers, friends and even Samuel Loomis reveal themselves as obnoxious figures.But that's not all: Zombie's script destroys the most iconic character in the Halloween series. While in the old movies Loomis played by the late Donald Pleasence was portrayed as Michael Myers' relentless hunter, like Van Helsing was to Dracula, McDowell's Loomis in Halloween 2 went from being a monster hunter psychiatrist to a mercenary celebrity who only think about money. It turns out that he wrote a second book about Michael Myers - ""The Devil Walk Among Us"", a sensational work in which he describes the murders in Haddonfield and his own attack by his ex-patient -, became famous and now spends the entire film riding around in a limousine between autograph sessions, conferences and TV shows.But back to Michael: what has he been doing since the end of the remake? Good question! Zombie's script doesn't even bother to explain how the villain survived a point-blank shot to the head. Considering that he was introduced as a normal, supernatural human being in the 2007 movie, logic would force Michael to remain dead - and goodbye to Halloween 2! But it seems that a clean shot to the forehead is nothing more than a superficial wound in the Zombie script, which also doesn't explain how the killer simply walked away with a hole in his head. Incidentally, not only is Michael still alive, he is hiding in an abandoned shack in the middle of the forest miles away from Haddonfield, without once again being given any explanation for how he got there.Halloween 2 tries to delve into Michael Myers' psyche and offers some interesting stuff, being a notable evolution of Rob Zombie as a filmmaker, but it still suffers from its unfortunate choices and obnoxious portrayal of virtually every character, providing a setting where the viewer is simply unable to root for anyone. The original tone of the previous film no longer shows effect and, thus, the work becomes more of a disposable sequence. And not to say that nothing has value, the soundtrack is a spectacle. By far the most pleasing thing about the film. The final scene, to the sound of the classic ""Love Hurts"", is sensational; in addition to the series-themed closing credits that have also become the hallmark of the franchise.",Halloween II
86,EijnarAmadeus,Rob Zombie's world.,4,21 November 2010,"Rob Zombie's revamping of Halloween and its Michael Myers was sort of good in a way, but being a John Carpenter fan I couldn't avoid repelling amounts of it. Still, Zombie's idea of making a sequel to his own is totally accepted by me, solely because of the tame original sequel from 1981. HALLOWEEN 2 is certainly more of everything than the original sequel, and it involves disturbingly weird and annoying bits of Myers' inner self and dreams that draws dark in a movie so indulgently bleak that it dives into comedy.

89,Geeky Randy,The epitome of a sequel's stereotype.,3,13 February 2010,"Like many sequels, it's inferior to the previous film. Like many directors who return to make a sequel, they've developed a major ego since between the first and second installment was made (you'll notice the same with Tim Burton in the Batman series). Like many sequels, the story miraculously isn't over despite the feeling of closure at the end of the last film. The film picks up where the first one left off (or ENDED, actually), and spirals down to every stereotype a sequel has — even silly dream sequences that really aren't necessary but Zombie will do anything to a story, even ruin one like he did with this, as long as his untalented wife gets a role in the film. All the survivors from the first have changed in character so greatly for the worse, you begin to wish they won't be as lucky this time around as they were in the first film. Taylor-Compton made a great up-and-coming Scream Queen in the first, but in this one she is just dreadful; screaming for the sake of screaming. McDowell is more theatrical in his performance as Dr. Loomis, which is completely out of character of any version of Loomis from the previous films, even McDowell's previous performance. The only thing worth seeing is the creepy beard that hangs out from under Michael's mask, and eventually his face (obscured by shadows though). In the director's cut, you hear his first line; which is a milestone, but almost not even worth it.*½ (out of four)",Halloween II
90,DarthVoorhees,This Jack O'Lantern just got smashed,2,29 August 2009,"Halloween II is a painful film to watch. It's excessively brutal and I'm not talking about violence. It's like spending a night with a screaming annoying child which for all intensive purposes is Scott Taylor Compton.Michael Myers isn't dead. It seems that bullets only tick him off. Fair enough, chopping him into confetti probably wouldn't kill him. The Achilles heal of this character is not in his death but what made up his life. Every new director and writer coming into this series has tried to get inside Michael's head and give him new reasons as to why he is what he is. One only needs to look back at the original John Carpenter Halloween to know that isn't what made Michael frightening or interesting. All we knew about Michael then was that he was ""purely and simply evil"". Carpenter left it vague and the audience had to believe Loomis in his eccentricities because the fact is a schmuck in a mask is only as interesting as the presence around him. You kill Michael if you make him too complicated a character. Unfortuneatly for this franchise Rob Zombie has given Michael his most elaborate back story ever which I still don't think is given a satisfactory explanation.The White Horse as Zombie calls it appears to Michael in dreams (Wet Dreams? It certainly looks as if that is what Zombie was going for). It seems that his dear old departed mother Deborah Myers doesn't want to leave Michael. If I had to name the star of the film or who the picture was built around it would be Sheri Moon Zombie's bizarre ghost version of Deborah Myers. It isn't interesting, it isn't scary, and it doesn't work. Well once you build a picture around a faulty premise and a character around a stupid back story, the picture doesn't have much chance of working. Zombie may think his wife looks sexy in a ghost get up, but that simply isn't good enough starting point for a film. Deborah overshadows Michael who really isn't given anything to do other than be a brute. Michael is put on the back burner to the women in his life.Zombie's Laurie Strode isn't interesting either, in fact she is annoying. Scott chews the scenery in the worst performances I have ever seen in a horror film...ever! Scott seemed serviceable enough in the first Halloween film which I did enjoy. The problem here is that she can't go where Zombie wants to take this character. I don't think Zombie himself knows what to do with this character other than bring her to the visual in the film's final shot. Laurie goes from whining incessantly about Michael to opting to go out drinking at a party. Now that's what I call character development! Frankly I just didn't care about Scott's Laurie. It wouldn't cause me any grief as an audience member to simply have her shut up and get knifed. In fact I was rooting for Michael to do so for some of the film.There are some interesting characters in the film. Sheriff Leigh Brackett is the most compelling and best performed character in the picture. It makes me sad to think that Brad Dourif would touch this film but he does give a very good performance. Michael's arch nemesis Samuel Loomis played again by one of my personal favorites Malcolm McDowell is reduced to the comic relief. I yearned for a Loomis similar to Donald Pleaseance, the Van Helsing to the Dracula. That is a character McDowell could sink his teeth into. I see what both Zombie and McDowell were trying to do but I think that the character doesn't have a lot of dramatic weight with this interpretation.The picture isn't completely to be damned. Zombie is a credible director and has a very good eye. The problem is he isn't a very good screenwriter and his scripts seem like they only appeal to him. Halloween II feels like Zombie wanted to entertain himself on the studio's money. I'm all for personal expression by the director but only to the point where it makes sense. I highly doubt a near murder victim would be a devil worshiper and have photos of Charlie Manson on their wall. I'd like to see Zombie direct a film he didn't write because I think it would be his best one yet.November 1st couldn't have come any sooner this year.",Halloween II
91,ersinkdotcom,"A worthy entry into the ""Halloween"" franchise",7,7 October 2014,"Rob Zombie's 2007 remake / reboot / origin story of John Carpenter's classic tale took the first half of the film to give us exhaustive information on Michael Myers' past and his reasons for becoming the cold-blooded killer he turned into. The second part was a rather faithful re-tooling of the original 1978 classic.His ""Halloween II"" does the exact same thing as the remake. It loosely takes the storyline from Rick Rosenthal's 1981 follow-up to Carpenter's masterpiece and runs with it for the first 30 or so minutes before heading in a completely different direction. In a nut shell, Michael Myers is viciously making his way back to Haddonfield to finish the business he started in the first chapter. This time he's being led by the specter of his dead mother riding a white horse while leading around a vision of his childhood self. It seems Judith Myers wants Michael to bring his sister Laurie ""home.""Tyler Mane portrays Michael Myers as a coherent demonic force with an unquenchable fury. When he wants someone dead, he sees the job through grunting and viciously thrusting his weapon to the bitter end. Carpenter's Myers was more calm and passive in his approach. Although cut from the same cloth, these are two very different versions of the same character.Where the original 1978 film and even its sequel were studies in gore minimalism, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II"" revels in its on screen gruesomeness. From the graphic opening scenes of Laurie Strode being put back together on the operating table to each and every kill performed by Michael Myers, it's an exercise in excess blood and guts. Just what audiences crave in their horror films now.Taking in ""Halloween II"" for a second time has revealed it's not quite as cerebral as I originally thought on first viewing. Don't misunderstand me. There's way more thought put into the script here than a slasher film really demands, but at its core it's still just a modern update of a good old- fashioned stalking killer flick. I still think there are points in the film where it's insinuated someone else besides Michael is doing the butchering.The unrated Director's Cut of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II"" is 14 minutes longer than the version seen by audiences in the theater. The extended edition is made up of 94 altered scenes including 42 examples of alternative footage and 14 re-cuts. What's strange is there's no extra violence or sexual situations among any of the unused and amended material. While still a worthy entry into the ""Halloween"" franchise, Rob Zombie's sequel isn't quite as fulfilling on a second watch. I remembered it being a whole lot smarter than it really is. It does deserve props for trying to take the slasher genre in a heavier psychological and abstract route. However, at the end of the day, it's still just another entertaining episode in the legend of Michael Myers.",Halloween II
92,acidburn-10,Remake sequel takes a weird turn (for the worse),3,14 February 2010,"Wow this sequel takes a weird turn to the last one, with all the constant dream sequences ghosts and what's with that white horse. The movie even starts out as a dream sequence as we later finds out, where Laurie is taken to the hospital (a nod to the original Halloween II), and then she wakes up and it's one year later and Laurie (Scout Taylor Compton) is still reeling from the events of the previous year, popping pills and seeing a psychiatrist and has taken on a grungy rock chick look. Laurie is now living with her friend Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris) also from the previous Halloween movie and her father Sheriff Brackett (Brad Douriff). But things take an even more downward spiral when Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) comes back into town and starts on a killing spree again.This Halloween sequel is definitely not the conventional Myers tale, it tries taking an artistic turn which doesn't work at all, and I honestly didn't like the turn that this sequel took, okay I commend Rob Zombie for doing something different with this sequel, it was just a shame that it didn't work and the violence is definitely upped yet again, a tradition in sequels, even I felt uncomfortable at how brutal this flick is and just so over the top.Character and acting wise, it's terrible even more so than the usual ""Halloween"" world. Scout Taylor Compton (Laurie Strode) was even worse here than she was in the first one, what the hell happened here, all she did was shout and scream and became very vile and over the top. Danielle Harris back again in her fourth Halloween movie and she was again great and I really felt for her when it came to her big moment. Brad Douriff (Sheriff Brackett) played a more fleshed out role and loved the relationship he has with his daughter. And lets not forget Dr Loomis (Malcom McDowell) has again taken a new spin on the original character and made him a very unlikeable character but I enjoyed it at times, even though he looked like he wanted to fire his agent but was great at chewing the scenery. Tyler Mane as Michael Myers again takes a different turn from the usual Halloween movies as a more fleshed out and sympathetic character, which totally misses the point and doesn't at all feel like Michael Myers.On the downside, some clarity would have been nice in terms of Michael's motive. I mean really, why does he want to find his sister so damn much again? What do the ghosts that drive him want with her anyways? none of this explained and it all becomes a total mess, trying for artistic but failing totally.All in all a terrible sequel and the worst out of the bunch, avoid even Halloween fans won't like this trash.",Halloween II

Malcom McDowell is weak as Loomis, Scout Taylor-Compton this time is not good as Laurie Strode, Danielle Harris is not into her character and Brad Dourif acting is simple. The script is bored mixing horror with surrealistic scenes, maybe Zombie was looking for something new but his idea was a flop.

94,destroyerwod,Disappointing after a solid reboot of the franchise...,6,29 August 2009,"Alright, usually i am pretty easily satisfy with a slasher. Give me a bunch of stereotype character(the black dude, the nerd, the slut, the ass hole, the gently but super cute main girls and her male counter part) and i will be satisfy as long as the kill are brutal and gore.But here it seem like Rob try so much to put plots in what was just a nice slasher that it become weird. Also i really like the first Halloween and was very satisfy how the series was restarted after the not necessary Halloween 8 : Resurrection. Micheal's part as a child and build up was just great. Halloween 1 finished on a very ""BAM"" ending with the head, Dr Loomis also appears to be dead, i was a little bit surprise to see him come back but its possible, the thing is just that his character was so out of context, i mean he turned into a money making ass hole? Then come back out of nowhere at the end and get kill for no good reason.Then we got the white horse and Micheal's mom thing and i tough that was super dumb, especially since his mother was not a bad character in the first one. Seems to me like Rob brought her back only to give her a role in this, because his wife appear in every movie he make. Out of that she was not necessary at all. Also i was disappointed the way Laurie was made, and the whole ending with her... Is she gonna me the killer in the next movie? I mean its weird...But to get back to the essence of the movie, the killing, i think they where brutal and gore, which i like, but the camera sometimes was way too shaky, even bad filming i would say, it didn't needed that.So overall i think after a pretty good first movie, Rob made a really trash story trying to do something similar to the first movie but failed badly, when a simple slashing fest would have work just fine. The movie seem to be a mixed of completely dumb story moments mixed with nice killing action.I would say a 6 out of 10 is definitely proper for that, and i feel really disappointed after a great reboot of the franchise.",Halloween II
95,t_atzmueller,Rob Zombie trolling Halloween-fans,1,8 September 2011,"It has become a sad sport for unhappy horror fans to watch the numerous franchises drop to ever-lower depth – and none of the franchises have fallen as low as ""Halloween"". Most series had a good numbers of duds and stinkers but ""Halloween 2"" takes Michael Myers to new lows that the fan couldn't have imagined.Rob Zombie has two things in common with German director Marcus Nispel: both managed to breathe fresh air into the slasher-genre; Nispel with his Grade-A remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and Zombie with the TCM-cum-Easy Rider blood-letting epos ""The Devil's Rejects"". And both managed to take two slasher-classic and almost run them into the ground.The new Jason Vorheers is now an inbred survivalist – Michael Myers 2.0 is a hobo with lots of facial hair who does a lot of walking through the countryside, looking a lot like the fairy tale giant Rübezahl. Indeed, for an instant we're almost glad that movie giant Matthew McGrory (""Big Fish"", ""The Devil's Rejects"") passed away before Zombie could cast him as Mike Myers.As in all his films, Rob Zombie invites us into his private parallel-universe, where humanity consists entirely of white trash and degenerates and where Emo-, Goth- and Heavy Metal kids rule every household. Brad Dourif looks like a bum put into a sheriff uniform, while his (adopted) offspring deface their home with ""F**k You""-scrawling, satanic graffiti and posters of Charles Manson and Kiss.Unlike Zombies prior works ""House of a 1000 Corpses"" and ""TDR"", there is not a likable or even remotely charismatic character in sight. The ""heroine"" of the film has the charm of a pubescent loaf of bread, trying to hide the inability to act by throwing many-a tantrum, adding to the film 'length'. The male cast invariably looks like they all slept in their suits and didn't bother to shave for a long time.If there is any good word to be dropped on the flick, we might name two or three well choreographed splatter scenes. True, Michael Myers never has been an imaginative killer like Freddy Krueger; mostly he stabs his victims while grunting a lot. Stab, grunt, stab, grunt - simply grunt; it's like watching a woodchuck chuck wood for an hour an a half.I could also speak of unwarranted dream-sequences, of fairy tale settings and white horses, of the world's worst actress (I give you a tip: she's married to the director) but the memories seem painful and the electronic ink too precious.The honourable Razzie of the year must invariably go to Malcolm McDowell. Granted, he's not given much to work with. Most of the time he doesn't even appear with the rest of the ""main-cast"", content to rattle down his lines in some parody of a Dr Phil media-hack. Only in the very last minute does he appear in the real film, only to be killed by Michael who of course is then killed by the police. Yes, it is the scene where Michael Myers has dialogue: ""DIE!"" Let it be a man more bitter than myself, who wishes that a disgruntled fan repeat that line when expressing his 'gratitude' to director Zombie. The worst I'd wish upon Zombie is that the most mediocre MTV-pop-hip-hop-trend band will cover Rob Zombies hit-album ""La Sexorcist"" just so that we can ask him: ""How does it feel, Rob? Sucks, doesn't it?"" Speaking about music: the Coup de grâce is delivered by the soundtrack: perhaps the fan must be thankful that the iconic ""Halloween""-theme is not featured. Instead, Zombie decides to let some god-awful Psychobilly band play a couple of songs give – hey, did I mention that Zombie will be producing that bands next album? Coincidence over coincidence.The Halloween franchise has pretty much covered the entire spectrum of badness. However, this train wreck of a movie has added a new one: embarrassment. If you thought Zombies first ""Halloween"" film was bad, boy, you haven't seen anything yet – this is worst, infinitely worst. Where are those minus-ratings when you need them?",Halloween II
96,Shattered_Wake,Violent sequel is ruined by a muddled script and lack of likable characters,5,13 December 2009,"For the past few years, Rob Zombie has been one of the major players in the horror genre. Regardless of our opinion of his movies, he's been someone who really goes with his vision and that's something respectable in Hollywood, a land that has forgotten originality and courage for the most part. Personally, I think that not only has his individual films have been hit & miss, but within each film, he's shown moments of both genius and mind-blowing badness.After House of 1000 Corpses & The Devil's Rejects, Rob Zombie brought his own ""white trash"" variation to the classic & classy Halloween series. This sent many horror fans (including myself) into an uproar. Not only was a truly perfect piece of horror cinema being touched by Hollywood, but they were giving it to the guy who created Captain Spaulding and the Firefly family? Regardless of what we wanted, however, Rob Zombie delivered a reasonably watchable & brutal Halloween that was later tarnished by a hideously awful director's cut of the same film.Two years later, he came back with the sequel: Halloween II. While I knew it wasn't going to be any kind of horror masterpiece, I did at least hope for something relatively watchable. I did get that. However, I also got one of the most confusingly inconsistent horror movies of recent memory. It's not so much that the plot was confusing (although there was some serious weirdness in this one that really could have been left out (like the half-dozen dream sequences and visions of white horses)), but there were moments that were just extremely good. . . and just as many that were really pretty bad.The best element of this is that the pacing is pretty good. At the beginning, I thought it was just going to be a continuation of the last one and we'd spend two hours in one big chase scene. Luckily, it went and tried to construct an actual story for Laurie. Too bad it failed there. Why? Because this film had some of the worst characters in Zombie's history. Michael is nothing but a dirty old bum in some grimy sweatshirt. Laurie is an unbathed hipster working at a hippie coffee shop and talking about some concert she's super psyched for. Annie is a whiny vegetarian and that's basically her only real input. Loomis is now some money-grubbing, soulless pervert with no real care for anyone or anything. Basically, the only character I even liked a little bit was Sheriff Brackett. Not only did he care about Laurie & Annie, but he actually had a good personality beyond that.Other than this, there is a ton of gore. Sometimes, it gets laughably over-the-top (like with the nurse at the hospital). Other times, it's grimace-inducing (like with the poor puppy). The script is nothing special and really goes second to the almost non-stop violence and weirdness. The one thing I will commend Rob Zombie on, however, is that he definitely is proving to becoming a better director. However, I truly do think he needs to turn over writing duties to someone who, you know, can actually write.Overall, if you were a fan of the first, you'll probably like this one. . . but, the poorly constructed and muddled script along with the lack of likable characters will turn off most casual viewers.Final Verdict: Without comparison to the past sequels. . . a 5/10.-AP3-",Halloween II
97,baileycrawly,Mediocre (Director's Cut),4,13 May 2020,"Laurie Strode is struggling to come to terms with what happened on Halloween night. However, Michael's back to get his revenge...Rob Zombie allegedly didn't want to make this movie.The remake was a hit - rightfully so - and Miramax wanted another one. The Weinsteins had shamelessly milked the original franchise for all it was worth, and they were at the ready to dilute the remake to get every penny they could out of it. Left with the choice of either stepping down and allowing another artist to continue the vision he began or to bite the bullet, fall back on his word and make another sequel, Zombie chose the latter and what we got was this, perhaps the biggest let-down of the Halloween franchise. The remake was incredible, this reeks of obligation. It's not a labour of love; it's a begrudgingly accepted project to retain control of his creation.Laurie Strode is an absolute mess, spewing profanity nearly constantly and acting manic (a la Shelley Duvall in The Shining, minus the profanities). The actress is talented, but the script is such a diluted shell of what the original was that she's not given a chance to display any amount of actual talent in this film.We get more Brad Dourif, which is always a plus, but even he couldn't revive this dead corpse of a film.Malcolm McDowell really blows everybody off the screen, portraying the biggest a-hole in the Halloween franchise who has no problem profiting off the tragedy of others while not having a single likeable character trait, unlike the first one. Malcolm is such a terrific actor, though, that despite the soulless direction of his character, he's still at the top of his game and gave a fantastic performance.This movie is a mess. It tries to do something new and exciting with the plot (former succeeded; latter did not) but ultimately suffers from both lack of vision on Zombie's part and micromanagement from Bob and Harvey Weinstein that really holds this movie in a cage instead of letting it free.This could've been an absolutely phenomenal sequel that really did justice to both the remake and the original franchise - and perhaps even have spawned its own side franchise - but what we got instead was an embodiment of the few things about the remake that were irredeemable. The movie wants to be an ambitious continuation but it ultimately ends up being nothing more than a boring and confusing mess of a film. It's not quite as bad as Halloween 5, but it's pretty close.",Halloween II
98,PedroPires90,Really bad - and I liked the first,2,14 October 2021,"There is a trend to pick some really hated films (2 on this saga alone) and make them cult films. Fine, each one with their opinions and tastes and I'm sure we can find something positive in every single film or book ever produced. However this is...almost offensively bad. And this come from someone who really likes the first Halloween from Rob Zombie.I won't say a lot because I prefer to talk more about things I like than about films I don't like. Basically I like 2/3 minor scenes on this film, nothing more. There are 3 plot lines: I hate all of them, hate all characters on them, didn't connect at all with this PTSD Laurie, don't understand the change of character in Loomis, I can't care less about this white horse mother dreamer Michael Myers.Yes, I hate it. Hate all the dreams (awaken or sleeping), all the images of the other world, the cinematography, every dialogue, the bad editing and confusing direction, the almost absence of the classic score... Hate it even more after rewatching it - which usually doesn't happen - and it's for me the worst Halloween (followed closely by Halloween 3 and Halloween 6).",Halloween II

Not very good at all..and he speaks at the end as well, like come on. Now your not even trying to be Halloween, should be disowned from the collection because of that.",Halloween II
100,kirk-246,A great end to a great franchise.,10,29 August 2009,"Rob Zombies original 'Halloween' was a brutal and thrilling movie that almost kept me on the edge of my seat.Many months before 'Halloween II' came out, when I've never knew about it, my friend actually told me that there was going to be a sequel.At first, I didn't believe him, but then he showed me and I did not want to wait for this movie to hit the theaters.Seeing the trailer once was enough to make me anxious about seeing it.Last night, I managed to catch the 7:30 showing with my older sister and my heart was pounding when the Dimension Home Entertainment logo came up.I have 3 simple words to describe this film: What a movie! I sat in my seat and I watched Michael Myers murder at least a dozen or two of innocent people.In case you were wondering, this movie is much more brutal than the already violent 2007 original.I don't think I've ever had as much fun at the movies as I did last night.Some people are going to disagree with my opinion, but I really don't care what other people think.The plotIt has been a year since the brutal events that took place on Halloween.Laurie Strode is now living with Sheriff Bracket and his daughter Annie.Laurie and the whole town of Haddonfield thinks that the nightmare is over.They think that Michael Myers is dead.They're wrong, of course.Michael survived the head shot he took a year ago and now he's on the hunt for his sister, and he isn't afraid to kill anyone who gets in his way.'Halloween II' is a very brutal and bloody movie, as I have said before.He breaks a man's arm, causing the bone to actually appear on screen.He takes a stripper and bashes her head in to a mirror over and over again.He takes a sharp rock and cuts a person's head off with it, and we hear the rock scraping against his neck as he's doing it.Do not see this movie under any circumstances if you couldn't handle the brutality of the first movie.If you think you can handle such graphic violence as I just explained, then watch this movie at your own risk.Overall, I highly recommend this awesome Rob Zombie film for anyone who is a big fan of the series or people who just love blood and boobs.10/10",Halloween II
101,skybrick736,Halloween II 1/10,1,22 February 2015,"Rob Zombie's follow up to his re-imaged Halloween is a catastrophe on every level. Some of the dialog and writing is unexplainable bad and has nothing new to add to the story of Myers. He turned Myers into some mindless brute that has no personality or shape shifting characteristics that made him scary in past films. He turned Dr. Loomis into some rotten low-life with the likability of a fast acting cancer. Above all else, the imaginations of Michael's mother and of a white horse to kill people are downright stupid. I couldn't believe how bad the dialog, script, characters, directing and ending scenes were in this sequel. It's a shameful attempt to get shock brutality and above all us laziness on originality. As a loyal fan to the Halloween franchise I may be disgusted way more than I should, but the only way I see people liking or defending this movie is if they love Zombie's music and past films. Utter crap...",Halloween II
102,p-jonsson,A huge disappointment,1,4 November 2013,"What happened? When I watched the 2007 remake I was quite happy that it was a decent enough work and gave it 7 stars out of 10. This one though? Well the reboot is effectively killed as far as I am concerned. If there are to be made another movie in this franchise there has to be another reboot. This one is just ruined.The first 20 minutes or so was not too bad. Then it just went to hell. Rob Zombie must have been high on drugs when he wrote this crud. A god chunk of it is just some drug-induced psychedelic mess.Debora Meyers is just a foul-mouthed brat who is so dislikable that you almost hope that Michael will get her. Dr. Loomis have been turned into a despicable asshole. Michael himself is mostly just a big dirty man who slashes people up. Occasionally he shows some of the supernatural qualities he is supposed to have but most often not. And he grunts a lot, what the f? The dialogue is non-existent if you remove the foul language. I am normally quite resistant towards foul language but not when the movie is filled with it just to cover up the lack of talent in the writer.I think that I have not been so disappointed in a movie in a long time. This movie is utter trash and a disgrace to a franchise that is really one of my favorite horror ones.I am going to think more than twice before I ever watch a move by Rob Zombie again.",Halloween II
103,jonathan-577,a real piece of crap,1,7 September 2009,"Normally I don't review a movie if I miss the first ten minutes; and normally I don't review a movie if I can't see it; this may sound like the kind of thing that would work in a drive-in, but those lost lumens almost erase the image entirely, so that if it weren't for all that clanking and keening you wouldn't even know anyone was being slaughtered. But I did experience the daughter whose single character trait is didactic health-foodism as scripted by a game hunter; I did hear Malcolm McDowell's press agent use the word 'kosher' and then clarify, 'as my people say'; I did see McDowell play an aggressively one-dimensional a-hole for an hour and a half, before abruptly endeavoring to appear sympathetic if not heroic; and I did see a female protagonist who realizes she's in line for slaughter and so decides to go HOME, take her friend with her, and then pull a 'wait here I'll be right back'. This is badness so extreme, so unexamined, so basically contemptuous of its audience, that it condemns not only the film as a whole but the people who made it; unless you can prove to me that Rob Zombie was drugged, bribed or kicked off set, then my first taste of his wares will be my last, thank you very much.",Halloween II
104,bh_tafe3,The key to a good slasher flick is caring about the victims,3,27 June 2014,"Which is where this movie falls off a cliff very early in the run time and stays there. I am not one of the people who hated the original reboot. felt it was an interesting, reasonably well done, if unnecessary little movie and I was looking forward to seeing what Zombie would do with the sequel.What Zombie did was take the only two characters you cared about in the first film and turn them into two of the most unlikeable people in the history of the universe. It's OK in a slasher movie to ask questions like ""why did you run up the stairs"" and ""why do you go outside?"" What is not acceptable questions to have for the audience is ""Why is Michael taking so long to kill this bitch Laurie?"" and ""Why the hell is Annie acting like such a bitch?"" Hence prompting the audience to say ""Fine, kill them both."" And in the end that's the issue here. While some of the kills may be OK, in the end I could not care less about a single person in this film. We are just watching three unlikeable, horrible sociopaths acting horribly for 90 minutes. I remember actually caring about Laurie Strode and feeling sorry for Annie in the first film, in the second I couldn't wait for them to die, and even that was too grisly to be much fun.Frankly there are many better ways to spend your time. Don't bother with this movie. It's just not worth it.",Halloween II

I was looking forward to having a lot of fun watching this sequel; only to be set up for disappointment. The movie lacked suspense.The movie started good. First 20 minutes were good and pace was also good but after that film diviated from it's path. Every character was just a cookie cut-out waiting to be killed. There were many of the actors in which you didn't even get a good look at their faces before they were killed. The movie was disjointed and extremely loud and gory. Also, Sam Loomis's character which was better in first part was worst in this part.I also didn't like the fact that the movie veered so much into her nightmares that most times you didn't know if it was real or just a nightmare; or was Michael Myers and he could be anywhere.Overall, this movie was so violent and gory & so dreadful and boring at the same time.",Halloween II

111,geminiredblue,Stop Hollywood From Remaking Everything! Part 2,1,26 April 2011,"Has Hollywood really sunk so low as to remake a classic like HALLOWEEN? Please don't answer, it's a rhetorical question. Hollywood has been doing it forever. Before HALLOWEEN, it was KING KONG. Before KING KONG, it was PSYCHO. And on, and on, and on. Recently, I reviewed Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN, which I called H1 for short. Now, I'll review his sequel/remake of HALLOWEEN 2 (which I'll call H2 for short.) Like H1, this movie loosely follows the plot of the original HALLOWEEN 2, but quickly degenerates into a bloody mess. Once again, we're given the Rob Zombie treatment: bad acting, a butchered plot, gruesome drawn-out deaths, and profanity up the wazoo! At one little three-minute scene, I literally got so bored that I counted the F-words and lost count at around 30! Jeez! Here, I'll summarize the plot: F-word, F-word, F-word, sex joke, F-word, F-word, kill, sex joke, kill, kill, Rocky Horror reference, kill, sex joke, F-word, sex joke, kill, kill, kill, The End! This time, Malcolm McDowell is wasted in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis. Half the time, his role is treated like a sick joke. There is one moment where he's on a talk show, along with Weird Al Yankovic, and he's roundly mocked by the host and Weird Al alike. I almost screamed ""How dare you mock Dr. Loomis!"" A ton of other star cameos can't make up for a lack of plot or reason. Right around the halfway point, I didn't even try to follow the (haha!) plot and didn't even care about what happened or who got killed. While I'll admit HALLOWEEN 2 wasn't as scary or original as HALLOWEEN, it had its moments. H2 doesn't improve upon the original sequel. In fact, it takes the title and that's about it. Sure, you get the hospital set and Laurie. Once again, we're treated to the thoroughly unlikable Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie. Please Hollywood, I implore you, avoid allowing Rob Zombie back in the director's chair, he butchers everything he touches. Also, Hollywood, stop remaking movies, even if they're sequels to classics! For you, the viewer, watch the original HALLOWEEN & it's sequel for a night of chills and thrills.",Halloween II
112,tburke85,Halloween 2 A Flawed Horror Sequel,4,16 January 2010,"Halloween 2 is a flawed horror sequel from writer/director Rob Zombie. I didn't think the remake was the greatest and the second one is just as bad. From beginning to end it was just predictable. There was no character development besides Scout Taylor Compton or suspense, too many weird moments but not in a good way and very little story. Most of the characters only serve as victims for Michael's bloody rampage. They show up for extended appearances before being killed off in some gruesome way. Scout Taylor Compton is okay as Laurie Strode who finds herself once again relentlessly stalked by her twisted mass murdering brother Michael Myers. She isn't given much to do besides act crazy but Comption does what's required I guess. Maclom McDowell has what amounts to a supporting role as Dr. Loomis whose ego has gone to his head and he pays for the price for it. Brad Dourif and the rest of the cast turn in decent performances but none of them stand out. Tyler Mane is very effective as Michael though even with no dialogue. He's an intimidating lethal killer who seems to be unstoppable and can take a beating like a champ. None of the deaths were memorable and there wasn't a whole lot of suspense because you could see it coming from a mile away. Almost every word out of a characters word was F this and F that. I was thinking about shutting it off halfway through but I watched the rest to see how the train wreck would end. I hope they stop with this film and not make a third. I preferred Paranormal Activity or The Haunting In Connecticut over this one. If you're in the mood for non stop brutal deaths and gore than you'll probably enjoy this one more than I did. I wasn't expecting much when I was watching it but overall the movie could've been a lot better.",Halloween II
113,revival05,Marilyn Hanson Returns,2,13 April 2010,"With his Halloween II, Rob Zombie has effectively transformed himself into the Michael Bay of horror. I know people think that the mainstream 90s slashers were shallow and plastic, but at least they had some wit, and once in a while some creative thinking had gone into them. I don't think that there was one scene in this movie that didn't include at least one bafflingly old and predictable cliché. This movie is flipping mirrors, chasing red herrings, muting the soundtrack at sad moments, leaves the girls alone in the house, uses characters who repeatedly say ""I'll be right back"" and has got the most tedious and boring chase sequence ever, going on for something like 20 minutes - only for it to turn out to be, yep, a dream sequence! It's like a perfected cliché feast. The tiniest little coincidence in a suspense situation, or unlucky turn in the plot, is strangely convenient, when the screenplay simply isn't ignoring the lack of coherence (this is a movie where a car driving down a highway will crash into a cow as if it's a brick wall). When people are not getting killed they are talking ""cliche filler chow"". It could be an anecdote. Could be a joke. Doesn't really matter.Apparently, this sequel to his superior - and still very bad - 2007 remake takes place two years after that one. That would make it 1980, but in here that's just four numbers that the movie forgets about instantly. Everything, from the clothes, to the post-ironic dialog, to the excessive costume parties to the mobile indoor phones (right!) feels more 2009 than 2009. But our kids can't use cell phones when Michael Myers shows up, now can they? Once again, convenient.Ah yes, Michael Myers has returned. From where I don't know. With the exception of walking around talking to the ghost of his dead mother and a white horse (.....utter, baffled silence......) he's basically the same, save for some aggression problems. I always thought that it was a stupid idea to try to tell the back story of this character, in an attempt (at least seemingly) to make him more human. First of all it's sacrilegious to the point of the character, and second it doesn't do anything for how we look at Michael Myers. This time around it's even more confusing. He's taking orders from a ghost! So what's so real about him? He still awakens from the dead and can't be stopped! The only real difference from this and any other Halloween entry is the ugliness of his killing spree. By now, any horror devotee knows about the gore galore, it's as if the violence has been directed by an autistic person. Michael starts the movie out by cutting off a head. Then we get him stabbing a poor nurse for something like a minute. He's very angry! Now, you may wonder, what has this got to do with John Carpenter's original creation? How many stabs did it take for him originally, just to nail a guy to the wall? Right. One. I don't even feel comfortable calling him Michael Myers here. As a kid, he looks like one of the members of the 90's kiddie pop trio Hanson. And fifteen years later he looks like a member of Slipknot. All this makes demographic sense, of course, but this is not Michael Myers. It's Marilyn Hanson.Marilyn Hanson is in this movie chasing Laurie Strode. No, that's not it either. He's chasing Avril Lavigne. And, well, Laurie/Avril deserves to die. No, sorry, I didn't mean to say that, she's just a troubled emo teen. It's not her fault nothing she says makes any sense, and I guess a kinder soul would feel sympathy towards her egomaniac lack of perspective to herself or the world. I wished that her psychiatrist (played, oddly enough, by Margot Kidder) would just smack her up. This is a kid who points at a Rorscharq test and wonders whatever that could be. I guess they are the target audience for this movie. That's just disturbing. Malcolm McDowell seems to be thinking the same thing in his inexplicable portrait of a Dr. Loomis gone sellout deluxe a-hole, cashing in with crap books on the famous events. He is enjoyable enough, he's doing this ""Sean Connery in Highlander II"" thing as I like to call it, but it is only because you realise that he also knows what a pointless piece of crap movie he's in.As I hinted at earlier, the original Halloween was far away from Rob Zombie's idea of horror. It was built on tension, suspense and psychology. Not blood, guts and random shiny, white horses. I love horror films but I don't believe in gore as an ideal. There was a time when gore filled horror films were both needed and understandable. Some of the greatest exploitation horror movies from the 70's and 80's had both chock and schlock value, and at times they even made sense out of the violence. Rob Zombie himself even did similar tricks in The Devils Rejects and House of 1000 Corpses. But, in general, this trick is old by now, and Zombie's strange obsession with lackluster gore and excessive sadistic violence will not help a franchise that already boiled a girl alive, almost thirty years ago in another movie that is already called Halloween II.",Halloween II

It gives us dreams and visions, and it's hard to determine what's part of a dream and what's supposed to be real.The problem with trying to show us the point of view of (1) a homicidal maniac and (2) a traumatized young woman is that you wind up with a story told by two unreliable narrators.Worse yet, this violates lots of what was good in the first film. Michael's mother appears in visions, accompanied by younger Michael and a white horse, to lead her son through his horrible acts. Deborah Meyers was established as a sympathetic, even tragic figure in the first film. Sheri Moon's performance made the character's crisis poignant. Now she's reduced to an evil force directing a slaughter of the innocent.Dr. Loomis takes center stage here, and we see a lot about how he cheapens himself to promote sales of his book. This culminates in his appearance on a talk show where he's goaded by no less than Weird Al Yankovic. Later, in his lavish hotel suite, he develops a conscience. With this comes, as best I can figure, super powers. He's been driven everywhere in a limousine, he's in a big city (Chicago?), but somehow he gets from the hotel to the isolated rural shack where Michael is holding Laurie hostage in what seems like under five minutes. Did he fly? Teleport? Was he shot out of a cannon?Margot Kidder plays Laurie's sympathetic psychiatrist. Howard Hesseman is Laurie's boss, a ""Woodstock burnout"" from the 60's. These and many other interesting characters are introduced, only to vanish.I have a feeling that the ""director's cut"" DVD will be about four hours long. Then all those unresolved narrative threads can be cleaned up.I did figure out two strong themes here. Mr. Zombie likes to cast men who have facial hair. And he must be a health nut: in three out of four scenes where we see men smoking or about to smoke, the character is dead within minutes. I guess this sends out a positive message.In the meanwhile, Mr. Zombie should either leave the writing of screenplays to professionals or take classes in how to write for the screen.",Halloween II
115,darkreignn,"Rob Zombie returns with another frightening exploration of rage, trauma, and violence",7,18 October 2021,"As a fan of Rob Zombie's first ""Halloween"" film, I may be biased when I say that I unabashedly enjoy this movie; there is enough rage and violence to satisfy any slasher fan, and Zombie's animalistic depiction of Michael Myers is sure to scare and disturb. Mr. Zombie understands that violence is frightening in and of itself, and there is certainly enough of it here to make Genghis Kahn blush. The acting is just as good as it is in the previous film, especially with Scout Taylor-Compton reprising her role as Laurie Strode - playing a more broken, emotionally damaged Laurie, Scout depicts the very real negative consequences that PTSD can have on personal relationships and self-preservation. In line with the first Zombie ""Halloween,"" this sequel balances its horror with legitimate drama. That said, there are more than enough questionable choices made here to slightly detract from the overall experience.Rob Zombie enjoys his depictions of white trash - there can be no denying that. Where his first ""Halloween"" had those elements sparingly and only in the beginning of the movie, here Zombie sprinkles them throughout, basically turning the town of Haddonfield into some sort of hillbilly fantasy. Practically every character that we come across is a punk rock archetype - and while that may be effective, and in some places is effective, it is glaringly obvious that Zombie wanted to see this and personally made this decision for his pleasure and not as a way to organically fit the narrative and characters that inhabit this world. While, in some cases, it may make sense for someone suffering from PTSD to turn into a grungy version of their old self, it makes little sense for a survivor of a sadistic serial killer to hang a photo of Charles Manson above their bed and spray paint ""In Charlie we trust"" on their wall. It's the little things Zombie chooses to show that can really manage to take you out of the film for their utter lack of believability.That said, there is a lot Zombie does right here. For one, Malcolm McDowell is still brilliant as Loomis - his transition to a money-hungry showman makes sense considering his belief that Michael Myers is dead, and never coming back. Though, when Michael does come back, we are treated to the same horrific violence we got in Zombie's initial ""Halloween,"" and it is just as effective here as it was then. What Zombie really gets right, however, is the story this movie chooses to tell. Depending on how you personally decide to interpret the events you're seeing on screen, you may or may not agree with my interpretation: that Michael is indeed dead, and Laurie has been the one committing these atrocious murders.My theory is never explicitly confirmed in the film - and at times, it may be downright refuted, depending on how you choose to view things. Even with that in mind, there are little hints that Zombie sprinkles throughout this film that add credibility to the theory that Laurie snaps and goes on a rampage of her own. Even if this isn't true, however, and the movie is meant to be taken literally, it still works in a horror/slasher type of way. Michael is as ruthless as ever, and is genuinely scary to behold.Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II"" may not be the best ""Halloween"" film out there, but it is a good one. It works on multiple levels, adding a rewatchability that isn't present in other slashers. And whether or not you choose to believe that Michael is alive or that he is dead and Laurie is continuing his legacy, I'm sure that you'll still find enough to enjoy, and enough to scare you, in this movie.",Halloween II
116,happyendingrocks,White horse enthusiasts will enjoy this a lot more than Halloween fans,4,20 June 2012,"If we agree right off the bat that ""re-imagining"" the greatest and most enduring horror film of all time was a dire mistake, then it follows that a second film delving into Rob Zombie's alternate universe mythos of Michael Myers is simply pointless. Despite Zombie employing every film-making trick he's learned from a lifetime of engrossing himself in the work of the genre's masters, this Halloween II redux is never nearly as engrossing as the derivative director seems to think it is. Rest assured, this entry in the lamentably weak extended Halloween franchise isn't the worst one in the series (it's got too much competition to claim that crown), but it very well might be the least entertaining.Though we would assume the focal point of any Halloween film should be Michael Myers, Halloween II spends most of its run-time dwelling on the post-traumatic meltdown of Laurie Strode 2.0, who has been reduced to a basket case after the events of Zombie's first Halloween cycle. It's impossible to watch Scout Taylor-Compton bring this iconic character to life without comparing her to originator Jamie Lee Curtis, and while Curtis provided audiences with a strong and resourceful heroine to root for in even the lamest of the original run of sequels, Zombie's vision renders Taylor-Compton's Laurie Strode a foul-mouthed, intolerable shrew who pops pills like Skittles, screams at everyone she encounters, and sleeps beneath a window-sized poster of Charles Manson.Even more unpleasant than enduring two hours with a leading lady who we can't wait to see get killed off so she'll finally shut up is spending nearly half of that time navigating Laurie's meandering and ultimately incomprehensible dream sequences, which give Zombie ample opportunities to indulge his quasi-Lynch-ian fancies, but make zero narrative sense within the film. In Zombie's world, Laurie doesn't merely suffer from nightmares about her ordeal, she also has vivid visions of her would-be murderer as a young boy, in which he has mystical conversations with his dead mother in surrealist locales, such as a Mad Hatter-esque outdoor table-side gathering where all of the guests are attired in Shakespearean garb and have pumpkins for heads.All of Zombie's greatest directorial strengths and weaknesses are on full display here, but unfortunately there are far more of the latter. There's no denying his aesthetic acumen, and his use of lighting, atmosphere, and Argento-inspired camera angles often make Halloween II compelling to look at. However, Zombie's inability to tell a coherent story dulls the cumulative effect of these artistic images, and as in most of the entries in this vastly over-rated film-maker's oeuvre, his screenplay is an utter mess. I'm not sure why Zombie populates his films with characters who can't complete a sentence without dropping three f-bombs, but the effect of this stilted vocabulary is that any scenes of extended conversation are rife with histrionics that make the acting seem worse than it is and load the film with implausible dialogue that completely negates our immersion into the real-world horror that formed the backbone of the Halloween franchise. Additionally, while the original Halloween remains one of the most classy and classic genre offerings of all time, Zombie can't resist inserting decidedly unclassy bits like a coroner who animatedly mulls over whether or not he should dabble in necrophilia with one of the attractive victims from the first film.The director's keenest touches are the products of his Pop culture fixation, and the most enjoyable aspects of the film fall under this umbrella. Zombie's song choices are uniformly excellent, and the thematic costumes donned by Laurie and her friends during their Halloween festivities are very cool. The subplot revolving around Dr. Loomis's book is particularly savvy and prescient in today's culture, and we even get a truly humorous ""Weird Al"" Yankovic cameo out of the deal, which is always a plus.What's most glaringly absent from this affair is Michael Myers himself. Michael is without his mask for the bulk of the movie, and most of his screen time consists of him lumbering across the countryside looking like a vocalist from a stoner rock band or chatting with his deceased mommy in his whiny childhood incarnation. Michael the character is all over the place, but Michael ""The Shape"" is nowhere to be found, and without the stalking and lurking so crucial to his essence, the genre's most frightening figurehead isn't really all that imposing.On the plus side, the violence in Halloween II is brutal, vicious, and wholly realistic. Zombie's tone is stark and serious, and there's nothing mirthful about the frequent and savage bloodshed here, so the visceral and disturbing impact of the homicides ends up providing the pure horror elements sorely missing from the silly, disjointed plot.Unfortunately, the ridiculous finale and coda are way off the mark, and while I can appreciate that the director was trying to upend our impression of Laurie's character based on the original run of Halloween films, the fate he envisions for our long-suffering protagonist feels tacked on and manipulative, and completely muddles our understanding of exactly why Michael has been trying to kill her throughout Zombie's two installments. Zombie apparently added 14 minutes to this already bloated opus for its DVD release, but this is a severe step in the wrong direction. If the baffling and unnecessary hallucinogenic hocus pocus was trimmed away, the effective bits here could be finessed into a lean and tidy 90-minute outing, and we'd most assuredly have a much more serviceable entry in the Halloween series on our hands. Instead, Zombie's Halloween II is overlong and underwhelming, and the abundance of nonsense in this near-epic makes getting through it an almost interminable exercise.As in any Rob Zombie film, there are moments of true genius to be found here. Unfortunately, in this instance, sifting through the crap surrounding them is more trouble than it's worth.",Halloween II
117,lorcan-61881,Strange..but true,9,3 February 2018,"Halloween might have pissed off a few Halloween fans but considering the great success at the box office, a sequel was then put into development for 2009 and then we got Halloween II..wow. Halloween II I never actually really watched until last week along with the remake..two pretty different films. I honestly really enjoyed the first Halloween film and then we got this. Halloween 2 when I think about it was really different to the first film, the film had things I liked..and things I did'nt like, lets just get the bads out of the way now. The dream sequences in this film were fucking awful and I hated them so much, I know in ways Halloween 2 actually tried to remake the original 1981 film which also featured one or two dream sequences but this film had way too many and I felt like I was watching some sort of fucked up Marilyn Manson music video, I also felt like after Laurie shot Myers in the face, literally, I don't really think this was necessary, it just felt like a money milking scheme to punish you. Goods; the acting, the acting in this film is really good from Scout Taylor Compton as Laurie and of course Danielle Harris as Annie from the Halloween remake and the original two Halloween's, 4 and 5. Overall, Halloween 2 is ok, but suffers from a bit too much stuff we did not need, at all.",Halloween II
118,Gresh854,"Less Straightforward, More Up To Interpretation",6,7 July 2018,"I think I prefer Rob Zombie's Halloween II more than his first attempt poking at Michael Myers's story. There's definitely a more artsy approach to the way Zombie presents the story which I somewhat appreciated. The most compelling and thought-provoking theme presented in the film that carried it graciously was the trauma in which the main characters were situated in due to the events of the previous film. This is something that hasn't been deeply explored and certainly not as tramautically exposed as other Halloween entries have tackled. What really set me off from really liking the film however, was the pacing and the carnage. This film feels way too long, and injects so many unnecessary portions, my intrigue was slowly declining as the film went along. Also, the ""gore-porn"" aspect of the movie was so over-reliant, that it took away from the more serious aspects the film was trying to flourish. I'm glad that Zombie's interpretation of Laurie Strode has increasingly improved in terms of the actress's portrayal and the character's ""storyline purpose,"" despite us having to be constantly bugged by her abnoxious whining which is shown about 90% of the time she's on screen. Even though the movie's attempts to be deep feel a little too pushy and far-fetched, I much rather prefered the craziness of this wacko entry than a typical remake/replication that many of the Halloween sequels tend to eradicate. (Verdict: C+)",Halloween II
119,Mr_Censored,Rob Zombie returns to the Myers fold with mixed results.,6,30 August 2009,"Hot on the heels of his 2007 remake of the John Carpenter classic, Rob Zombie has returned to resurrect his version of ""Halloween"" to the big-screen yet again in ""Halloween II."" Picking up where the original left off and re-uniting all surviving characters, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find a leaner and more meaner effort than the first, which is unfortunately still plagued by poor characters and weak story-telling. At the very least, though, you'll find ""Halloween II"" to be more of a ""Halloween"" film than its predecessor, and for some, that will be enough to satisfy their thirst.To gives this film a few compliments: First off, the mood is unmistakably Halloween in this film. Make no mistakes about it: Rob's second entry in the franchise means business and has the cinematography to back it up. Not since maybe ""Halloween 4"" has the look and feel been nailed so brilliantly. Michael Myers is less of a character and more of a presence in this film when compared to Zombie's first take, and that's one of the other things Rob gets right this time around. While the portrayal of The Shape was pulled off menacingly enough by Tyler Bates in the previous film, a lot of the bite was taken out of the character by over-exposing him and shedding far too much light on a far too troubled past. Here, he is relegated to the shadows, living in the outskirts of Haddonfield and acting as an urban legend to the characters. When he does appear and strikes -- as he so often does -- it is with maximum impact and brutality. Not only is this Michael Myers more mysterious, but he is also much, much more cruel and punishing than any version we've seen before.In fact, part of what sets this film apart from any of the original eight films or even Rob's remake is the sheer magnitude of violence that is at hand. Completely opposite from John Carpenter's original version – and even the original ""Halloween II"" – this film is unrelenting and unflinching in its portrayal of Michael's wrath. Granted, it's not the goriest movie you'll find nowadays, and as far as effects go, it's tame compared to the previous film, but the way the violence is handled is in a blunt and all too realistic way. Almost like the exploitation films that Zombie admires so much, this is a film that presents its violence in a stark and ugly light. Michael grunts as he jabs his knife in and out of his victims just as anyone exerting any such force would do, and the results make a more human and, in turn, more frightening incarnation of the character than we have seen in a long while. Unfortunately, though, Michael Myers is the only character in this film that is handled with any care, and in turn, the sheep lined up for his slaughter are a faceless bunch.Enter Laurie's new group of pals, whom are dispatched before we even get to know them. Then there are the countless people Michael picks off during little intermissions within the narrative. These moments are, for all intents and purposes, filler, and reveal just what a rushed product Rob's sequel really is. Then, of course, we have the return of the surviving characters from the previous film. Danielle Harris ties Jamie Lee Curtis with most appearances in the franchise with her reprisal of Annie, who still lives with her Dad, Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif), who has taken the now orphaned Laurie Strode under his wing. While Dourif isn't given much to do in his role, he is given a lot of screen-time and makes the most of it. Unfortunately, however, Scout Taylor-Compton's take on the iconic Laurie Strode is just as flat as it was in the previous film and is not made any more likable by her angsty performance. Here, instead of being the charming and likable girl-next-door, she comes across as a self-loathing mallrat who needs a slap in the face and needs to spend less time shopping at Hot Topic. Then, of course, we have Malcolm McDowell as the iconic Dr. Loomis, who serves no purpose in this film other than to pop up in the final act and try to save the day.Four paragraphs and I feel I've yet to sum up Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II"" in a nutshell. As many things as Rob gets right in his sequel – the atmosphere, the handling of Michael's character – he also gets wrong. To be frank, there's hardly a person here you'll give a coroner's corpse about and the film is still as riddled with bad dialogue and bad acting as the first. These minor grievances wouldn't drag the film down so bad, however, if they weren't punctuated by some unnecessary and ineffective dream sequences/hallucinations, shared by Michael and Laurie. What was meant to be creepy and unsettling on paper turns out to be goofy in the context of the film, and each time one of these scenes pops up, the film comes to a screeching halt. Nothing sticks out like a sore thumb more than the satisfying and chilling final frames that are tainted by yet another wacky hallucination. Truth be told, this film has one of the most unsettling endings of the entire franchise, and for a moment, Rob nails the tone. Almost. But then, we see his wife and we see the white horse and we are instantly taken out of the mood again. Such is the curse of Rob Zombie's limited story-telling ability, and therefore goes a long way to sum up what is both good and great about ""Halloween II."" For a moment, he almost had us.",Halloween II
120,dormesher-21565,Not a fan of Rob Zombie's movies,5,7 October 2018,"The Rob Zombie Halloween movies I'm not a fan on these films and I really dont like them at all I do however have alot respect for Rob Zombie because he does bring his own style to his movies and always has a vision that he brings to the screen.However I just find these movies boring and I don't like how he tries to humanise Michael in the first one we don't need to see he is childhood and have a reason why he does the things he does it makes more scary when he is just pure evil like in the original franchise and at least part 6 made his reason for doing it a little Interesting with the Cult story this is just a little boring.I do like Michael in both these films when he is the killer he looks amazing and some of the kills in Halloween 2 are brutal and brilliantly done.
I also really like the way Laurie finds out that Michael his her brother in the second one something that was missing from the original and it works but it doesn't save the movie at all.Not a fan of Sam Loomis in these movies he is boring and if that character isn't being played Donald Pleasance it just doesn't work in my opinion.Verdict 5/10 for both movies not a fan of them has some fun moments but just don't like Rob Zombie's style as a director",Halloween II
121,Sober-Friend,How to Reboot this film Series,1,24 May 2017,"The Rob Zombie films are the worse films in the series. They are worse than ""Halloween 8"". Where the original films had distinct voices for the three girls Rob Zombie makes everyone sound like tattooed White Trash! I guess He wrote t he knows""Now if it was up to me I would re-start the series. I would called it ""Halloween: The True Michael Myers Story"". I would have take place in the 1970's. I would have 3 houses where Michael is Stalking and people disappearing. I would show him breaking into a store and steeling ""Mask, Rope, & a couple of knives"". I would change the name of the girls so that way you don't know who will be the final girl. Now if you liked this film that's fine but ""Its garbage to me""",Halloween II
122,krzysiektom,quite good actually,9,31 October 2009,"I find it funny that some viewers - especially those into the genre - call it too gory or too full of violent deaths without a story. It is like criticizing a porn film for having too much sex in it, really. I found it much better than previous the Halloween film, the twist about the sister becoming mad like a new Mike and being the one to really kill him in the end was fresh, she acted very well and convincingly. I found various deaths well done. The bits with his dead mother were also OK and even made sense to explain his madness. And to criticize that there is not enough depth to the story is also funny - it is Mike Myers for pete's sake: a giant dude who cannot be killed, he moves slowly but somehow always surprises his victims etc. Again, u get what u see in this series, so do not complain. One thing that did not convince me was little reaction from the police chief after his daughter's gruesome death, I think a real person would be in a total shock.",Halloween II
123,randyfromscream,Made HalloweeN Resurrection look like a masterpiece,1,16 September 2017,This is has to be the worst Halloween movie of all time. The theatrical edition sucks and I bet the rest might be bad. Please don't buy this; this is a money grab. The slow motion scene sucks like their not scary in this film at all. The original Halloween II with Jamie Lee Curtis was better like they try hard in that film but in this Rob Zombie made the Halloween franchise a joke. I hope that new reboot is better than this garbage. 1.9/10,Halloween II
124,thekyles99,Rob Zombie rocks!!!!!!,7,3 August 2010,"I often say to people if you don't like sick and twisted as they come kinda movies then stay away from any film that has to do with awesome director Rob Zombie. i simply love his films to death, the soundtracks, the shooting locales, the characters, the 70's feel of his films, and yes his no holds barred approach to gore. I would love to see a Zombie/Tarantino collaboration some day, that would be killer! This wasn't as good as the first one agreed, however i didn't like it any less. I liked the fact of zombie's take on the Myers family saga! Will Michael succeed in reuniting his family again, will Laurie Strode/Myers be able to live a normal life again? these are all questions that get answered in this second and final instalment ( Zombie insists that he is sooo done with this series and apparently the next couple of remakes will be directed by someone different entirely) I loved the fact he casted Brad Dourif( Billy Bibbit from One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest and the voice of the evil lil doll chucky) as sheriff Bracken, an underrated phenomenal actor who's scene at the end of this film actually brought tears to my eyes and this this is Halloween for crying out loud! Consider that a firstz for me! Im glad this sits right beside part one on my movie shelves along with every other movie Rob Zombie has put out there! I own them all and will continue to do so!!!",Halloween II
125,tvcarsd,Could have been a lot more,7,25 September 2020,"Briefly, there were a lot of things good in this movie and would have been great had it not been called Halloween. A lot of good acting and music went to waste making this, ultimately a tame Rob Zombie movie, that's my conclusion.",Halloween II
126,Rathko,Another Missed Opportunity,5,2 September 2009,"Though disappointed by Zombie's first ""Halloween"" I grew to like it more on subsequent viewings and followed Zombie's comments regarding the sequel with high hopes. Unfortunately, everything that I liked about the first movie has been abandoned in the sequel. The biggest let down is the replacement of the genuinely disturbing Daeg Faerch as Young Michael with the cutesy Chase Vanek who, for all his superficial resemblance to Faerch, fails to deliver an ounce of crazy. I would have loved to have seen more of Michael's time in hospital, slowly withdrawing into his psychosis; more of his life as an isolated drifter roaming the countryside; a more coherent rationale for his madness; a greater development of Laurie's own psychological state. I realize that such things are nor normally to be expected in a slasher movie, but Zombie raised so many interesting ideas in the first film, it's inexplicable that his sequel should fail to develop any of them and instead fall back on the same formulaic clichés that have plagued the genre for the last 25 years. I still maintain that Zombie is a very talented and creative director, but maybe it's time he put down his pen and let somebody else take over screen writing duties - 'cause if ""Halloween II"" is anything to go by, he's run out of fresh ideas.",Halloween II
127,bayardhiler,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible, and , Oh Yeah, Terrible",1,9 October 2012,"Oh God, this movie really, really sucks. Apparently, Rob Zombie decided that he wasn't done messing up the Halloween franchise and thus he made this dreck. Halloween II starts out decent enough, Michael comes back to life and escapes, goes to the hospital where Laurie is being kept, kills everyone else, chases her, and at the last minute, she wakes up. Turns out it was all a dream, and we are never sure how Michael's body disappeared. But it gets worse. It turns out that Laurie is really messed up because of what happened to her two years ago. She's now a punk rock girl who visits a shrink, takes medication, and drops the f-bomb every chance she gets, and is very ungrateful to Annie Brackett for taking her in. Her character is so bad, you just want her to die right away. And then there is Dr. Loomis. In the first movie, Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of the good doctor was pretty decent in the sense that he was able to make doctor a bit of a scoundrel while at the same time make him out to be a hero. In this movie, Dr. Loomis becomes nothing more than a money grabbing, fame seeking narcissist who, at the end, all of a suddenly decides to sacrifice himself to save Laurie. Huh? And don't get me started on the dream sequences with Sheri Moon Zombie and a young Michael Myers, (who's not even played by the original actor, the creepy Daeg Faerch). They add nothing to the plot but confusion and were most likely only included so that Rob could show off his wife. Bottom line, this movie was so bad that I'm not sure if I will ever see another Rob Zombie again. I certainly will never see any new ""Halloween"" movies that are made, God forbid. Although, something tells me that this movie was such a failure, both critically and commercially, that no one in his right mind will try to make another one for quit a while. Or at least one can hope not. 1 out of 10.",Halloween II
128,LanceBrave,Too ugly to be entertaining,4,3 November 2013,"After a highly condensed remake of the original ""Halloween II"" turns out to be just a nightmare, we join Laurie again a year later. She has been left deeply traumatized by the events of the first film, suffering emotional outburst and screaming profanity. This puts a strain on Sheriff Bracket and Annie, whom she lives with. Michael, despite taking a .357 to the face. For the last year, he has lived in a barn, his mask rotting away, eating stray dogs, and killing anyone stupid enough to mess with him. Dr. Loomis has written another book and become a total jerk, a facile shallow celebrity cliché. As another Halloween approaches, Michael and Laurie are both haunted by bizarre visions of Michael's dead mom, his younger self, and... A galloping white horse?The first Zombie ""Halloween"" film worked best when Rob followed his own muse. His attempts to recreate Carpenter's classic were less successful. You'd think Rob completely owning a sequel would work out for the best, right? Wrong. ""Halloween II' is grotesque, vulgar, senseless, completely divorced from the source material, and a Rob Zombie movie through and through. This is evident early on when paramedics crack jokes about raping Lynda's corpse. After an inexplicable collision with a cow, we are treated to a solid two minutes of the driver bleeding from the mouth and repeating the word ""f**k"" over and over again. In extended close-up, we see Laurie's bones get set, her wounds clean out, all in sickening detail. Zombie indulges his love of extreme violence, over-the-top profanity, and crude sexual references, far pass the point of acceptability.The grotesque quality extends to the characters. Laurie Strode is not only unrecognizable compared to the original, she's completely unlike the character from the last film. She too gets a minute of repeating ""f**k."" She screams, swears, pops pills, swigs beers, dances on tables, and raves about party. She spends the whole movie in a state of emotional distress, her breakdown only growing worse. By the time she finds out that she's Michael Myers' sister, she's gone totally bonkers. Her screaming, nerve-wrought confession to her shrink pushes far pass the audience's patience. Scout Taylor-Compton's limited range can't convey Laurie's over-exaggerated distress. You audience can't relate. Worse yet, we can't like her either. It's screaming, ranting protagonist is perhaps ""Halloween II's"" biggest issue.The other returning characters undergo serious changes as well. Michael spends large portions of the film unmasked, Tyler Mane with a full beard looking a lot like his director. He wears a ratty hoodie and hides out in the woods. He is motivated by visions of his dead mother, determined to reunite his family in death. He grunts with every stab and, in the video release, even speaks. This is Michael Myers in name only. Dr. Loomis is completely unrecognizable. He is the biggest asshole imaginable, chewing out his beleaguered assistant, demanding obscure tea, and pulling tasteless publicity stunts. Loomis wantonly exploits the victim's tragedy, something the film hammers into the ground. The doctor's sudden, last minute change of heart is sloppy writing at its worse. For his part, McDowell hams it up, nearly saving the whole thing. Only Brad Doriff and Danielle Harris, both more comfortable in grounded roles, give good performances.Zombie's extreme visual style overwhelms the film. Laurie and Michael share surreal visions. These dreams are overdone and obnoxiously directed. What does a table full of pumpkin-headed ghouls have to do with ""Halloween?"" Why is Laurie buried by her mother in a glass coffin? The siblings sharing dreams have no justification. The white horse symbolism is so out-of-place and meaningless, the movie needs to justify with a pre-credits info card. Miss Myers' extended appearance exists mostly so Sheri Moon can be in the movie, I think. The surreal elements are deeply out of place, incredibly distracting, and very annoying.The violence is unnecessarily brutal. Michael decapitates someone with a shard of glass. The most nauseating sequence is when Myers stomps a man's head to pulp. He repeatedly smashes a stripper's face into a mirror, the carnage unnecessarily focused on. He brutally stabs countless people. The violence is sickening and lingered on. Everyone cries out in agony as they die, suffering. This extends far pass fun slasher gore and into the realm of gratuitous torture porn.The new characters aren't very good. Laurie has a new batch of friends that exist to be slaughtered. Harley loves to party and sleep around. Angela Trimbur overdoes it. Brea Grant is slightly better (and very cute) as Mya, who at least feels sympathy for her friend in-between rounds of cursing and partying. Worse yet are the additional victims added to up the body count. Numerous redneck assholes hassle Myers, prompting their deaths. Why would anyone threaten someone who looks like Michael Myers does in this movie? A pair of hicks assaults him on the road, each one a human cartoon. The residents of a strip club are even worse. The owner is possibly mentally disabled. His partner is a hateful jerk. The stripper is exploited and abuse. You wonder if Zombie even wants you to like these people. Special guest stars include Howard Hessleman, Margot Kidder, Richard Biehle, Chris Hardwicke, and, most bizarrely, ""Weird Al."" Yes, it's as distracting as it sounds.""Halloween II"" is nihilistic and depressing. It ends with most of its character's dead, without solace, satisfaction, or catharsis. You come to hate its character's quickly, the visual style is oppressive, and the violence is far too ugly to be entertaining. John Carpenter's traditional theme doesn't appear until the end credits, signaling the film's disconnection with the rest of the series. No wonder a third/eleventh installment has stalled. Rob Zombie has made a film so punishingly weird and uncompromisingly ugly that no one would want to follow it up.",Halloween II

This film is dark, intense, and was scary to watch in the theater... 11 years later it's still as intense...Halloween 2018 borrows quite a bit from this Film. So if you like 2018 Halloween, I don't really see how you don't like Rob Zombies Halloween 2...just doesn't make sense! Halloween 2018 is a shell of this film...2018 even took camera angles/shots of Michael from Rob! I've never seen a side profile shot from the shoulder up of Michael walking after a victim until Halloween 2 2009...then Halloween 2018 comes along and has the same side shot of Michael from the shoulder up walking after a victim???

130,jdollak,Still a struggle to get through,3,1 March 2017,"Back when Zombie's first Halloween was released, I started trying to watch it, and I couldn't get past the first scene. Rob Zombie has some real problems with writing characters. He tends to write every character as a jerk. When the entire family establishes that they are all wastes of space, why should we care when they die?Eventually, I returned to that movie, and found a few redeeming qualities to it. It was still an exhausting movie.Then I started this movie. Right off the bat, I like following up with Laurie being patched up in the hospital. Then things start rolling downhill. Things very quickly turn into Michael escaping from people transporting his body, arriving at the hospital, and killing everyone he sees. Laurie spends a bunch of time running. This whole sequence takes up somewhere in the area of half an hour. The whole time I'm thinking that there's no way they can sustain this for that long. So they reveal that it's a dream sequence. Dream sequences can be a useful tool, but when the purpose is to be able to start your movie out with a bang without earning it...The movie continues with the same problems as Zombie usually has. He confuses annoying people for interesting ones. It's a bleak world that he uses, bereft of any nuance, where everyone is sleazy, everyone is mean-spirited. Now that I think of it, the cop father is a decent person, which might be why he generates most of the interesting movement in the story.There's effectively no tension. There are a few jumps, but we all know exactly how things are going to play out. Michael kills whoever he sees, which a single exception. But there are people he kills for absolutely no reason.Most of these complaints are things I could overlook, except that the movie gets boring. Zombie has an eye for doing some interesting visual work, but it gets bogged down in relentless, mindless violence. Michael stabs his victims multiple times. Does it get scarier as we see each stab? Nope. Does it communicate anything in particular? Not really. It mostly wastes time.The writing is also a real annoyance. I couldn't care less about cursing in movies, but this movie is an exercise in two screen writing no-nos. First, the characters curse constantly, and needlessly. I've known people like this, and they are especially boring. Second, everyone is ready with a ridiculously written insult. This is a trend that I saw heavily in things like Juno, and, good god, it's terrible. It eliminates any sense of reality a movie could have. And for a horror movie, that's the kiss of death.Normally, I wouldn't bother to write a review of something that has 400+ reviews already. But I wanted to get my thoughts out. This is probably one of the worst horror movies I've seen. Mostly because they had the budget to make it work, but they skimped on all of the places that could have made it work.",Halloween II
131,kevin_crighton,"A nasty, horrible movie.",1,10 October 2009,"Michael Myers, missing presumed dead since the events of a year earlier returns to resume the hunt for his sister, lead by visions of his mother with a white horse....I didn't think much of Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. I thought there was far too much wrong with it to work properly. But after seeing this awful movie, I think his first one was brilliant!There is so much wrong here, it's hard to know where to start. The visions that Michael has, are simply bizarre. The violence is bloody, and quite nasty at times. I don't have a problem with violence in movies, but here it is frankly excessive. The best Halloween movies have never been about the violence, but Zombie seems to relish it. The death scenes here belong more to Jason in the Friday The 13th movies.But where it really goes wrong is in the way Zombie treats the characters. There is a hint of an idea about survivor guilt, but it is never properly dealt with. Both Laurie and Annie having survived the previous movie, seem to have dealt with it differently, but this is never dealt with. And as for what Zombie has done to Dr. Loomis is truly unforgivable. In the original movie, and even in the subsequent movies Loomis was seen as a man determined to stop Myers at any cost, as he knows what he truly is. Zombie has turned him into wannabe celebrity writer living of the Myers case. I don't blame Malcolm McDowell. He is a good actor, but the part is badly written.In fact despite the poorly written script most of the actors do their best. Scout Taylor-Compton, who I thought was disappointing in the remake of Halloween is better here, and is a pretty good lead. But despite her and the rest of the cast doing their best, there are few likable characters here, and you frankly don't care who lives or dies. The only likable character is Annie, but is so poorly written you wonder why they didn't just kill the character off in the previous movie!It's not scary, something Carpenter's original managed easily, it makes no sense at all, and then there is the ending. Zombie completely got the ending his remake wrong. But here it is even worse. He actually comes up with an ending that is part Psycho and part the ending of Halloween 4!! Yes, he actually uses part of an ending from one of the poor sequels! Says it all really.Rob Zombie, please leave this series of movies alone. It took until Halloween: H20 to undo the damage done to Carpenter's original. I'm not sure if the damage done here to the entire legacy of the the Halloween movies will be undone any time soon.",Halloween II

Some of the imagery in this movie is just way too weird to watch, which is why I see so many people on YouTube or IMDb.com hate this movie.The music by Tyler Bates is good, but the one thing that was missing was the original Halloween theme (which appears at the end of the film).

Sure, there are some major flaws in this film, but that does not stop me from watching it.If you like the 2007 remake, this is worth the watch to see a completed vision of a scary movie, written, produced and directed by Rob Zombie and his vision is just a scary, violent, intense and disturbing conclusion to his vision that he introduced in the 2007 remake.This is the true meaning of a horrifying and intense vision of a sequel to a remake / re-imagining and it is really good. 7/10.

138,CihanVercan,Boogeygirl: The Sensational Comedown of a Phenomenon,3,6 October 2009,"The Zombie family, Rob and Sheri Moon, produce an idea of altering the identity of the Halloween killer. The aforesaid Halloween killer, Michael Myers, has become an idol for Laurie. Opening scene of the film shows Laurie at the mental hospital, how she turns out to be a Satanist. Rob Zombie has used a strong grade of Symbolism here at the beginning. There are equivalently systematized delusions in between Laurie's mind and the film itself. Through Laurie's submission of her soul to the Devil, Michael Myers's soul captures her mind to give her enough courage to not to fear. The Satanist symbol of the black star inside a circle is shown several times during Laurie's submission of her soul. Using fear to heal her wounds, she appeals to take revenge.Watching this movie may require some guide of clues, so you can have some explanation. The second scene that starts with the traffic accident causing Laurie to be delivered to another hospital is the last scene you should watch. Go to the end, up until the closing credits. There are good photography works there like rage with ensuing chaos and destruction; you will realize who killed Laurie. If you have watched the entire movie thinking that Laurie is alive, you would be discouraged so badly at the end. The reason for that is the production of the movie is half-the-way and stands very raw. There are supposed to be more scenes to be cut or relocated. Not only the production phases effect the completion of the movie, it kills the script to become such a nonsense with the imbalance between the plot and storyboard. Basically, this is the main reason why the film doesn't tell you anything.Even if you just want to watch the murdering scenes, sadly you'll still be disappointed. 'Cause the camera work is terrible and the lighting can't focus you to the action. Plus for some reason every murder scene is interrupted with a funny outlook of a daemon in the delusion of Deborah Myers walking towards the camera with a white horse beside it.Rob Zombie's film never accomplished anything more than offering ridiculous materials for the next Scary Movie sequel. In my opinion here is the most ridiculous one: That guy is drinking outside of the bar near his light duty truck. Then our delusion hero comes closer to him after committing multiple assassinations with all the screams and clutter happening 10 feet away of him. Our truck driver doesn't panic, he doesn't even pretend to look calm to covertly call the police or something. He thinks he is the Terminator(in this film I wouldn't be surprised if he turned out to be) and says to our immortal delusion hero: ""Look man, don't give me no reason, OK?"". Less than a second passed we witnessed his corpse divided into two halves cut right from his belly.My advise to whomever want to watch this film: Go start work as an undertaker. You'll see less disgusting corpses.",Halloween II
139,CowherPowerForever,Rob Zombie Goes Full Retard,2,1 November 2014,"The following review will contain spoilers.Two years after the release of the Rob Zombie Halloween re-imaging, another film was set to be released. Zombie didn't want to make another Halloween film, but when the studio was going to move forward anyway, he decided he wanted his vision to play out. That is a laugh riot now, because he had no vision at all. He was high off the success of the re-imaging, and he thought he could get away with anything. He threw garbage at the wall in hopes of it sticking, but no one was buying it. In the end, we are left with the worst Halloween movie of the ten that are currently released. The following is my review of Rob Zombie's Halloween 2.Rob Zombie wrote this sad excuse for a film, and directed it as well. The film has a very loose story(that is in no way connected to the original Halloween 2, minus the hospital setting early in this film), and often incoherent. The film starts out with a young Michael Myers at the mental hospital being visited by his mother. She brings him this White Horse he really likes. Of course we hear nothing of this in the first film, so Zombie adds a useless piece of trash to try and stay fresh. We then go the night he came home, after we think Michael is dead. Of course he is not, and one the way to the morgue, there is an accident with a cow, and Michael escapes. Laurie is in the hospital because of what Michael did to her. Of course Michael is going to hunt her down, and gets very close. That is until as he is about to kill her, she wakes up from a bad nightmare. The story from there picks up nearly two years after the events of the first film. Laurie is struggling with her life, and later on in the story starts to get mentally connected with Michael. This is directly from Halloween 5, but with more garbage thrown on it. The story is simply hogwash to say the least. The story is easily the worst out of them all, and that includes the awful Halloween 6 story from the Theatrical Cut. Zombie let the movie fame go right to his head, and it shows in this disaster called a film.Rob Zombie is back directing, and once again we are left with a bloodbath of a movie. Too much blood, and not enough being subtle. Add that with the awful story, and things do not gel well at all. Zombie is really all over the map in this film. Not only is Michael grunting while killing people in this film, Michael actually speaks one word. This is shear lunacy. One has to wonder what sane person would allow this film to even be released. The acting is worse this time around as well. Zombie thought it would be a fantastic idea to make Dr. Sam Loomis a naive stuck up jack wagon who is only trying to help his image with the upcoming release of his book. While Malcolm McDowell pulls this off perfectly, this is not who Dr. Loomis is. Rob Zombie's wife is also back as Michael's Mother. She is the definition of a worthless character in this film. I wouldn't even be surprised if he wrote this awful idea just to stick his annoying and talentless wife into the film. Scout Taylor-Compton is back as Laurie Strode and her effort as the crazy girl just doesn't cut it. I'm not buying what she is selling in this film. It wasn't poor acting, just not good acting on her part. Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is really the only enjoyable character in the entire film. Dourif is a fantastic actor and he shows that even if the rest of the film is poor. Overall, Zombie delivers a cash grab effort. Nothing to see here, and so far only one enjoyable aspect.Tyler Bates, who composed the score for the first Rob Zombie Halloween film is back once again. This effort however, is pretty poor. The iconic Halloween music is gone in favor of some generic horror music. I am pretty sure Zombie had the final say on using the iconic score, but at the end of the day, Bates still went to work, and he deserves flack over this awful score.In closing, this film is a mess, and is easily the worst of the franchise. Hardcore fans of the series will either likely watch this movie or have already watched it. Even if you are a hardcore fan, there is no need to watch this garbage fest. The odds of a direct sequel are very slim, and since it has already been five years since this film was released, I doubt anyone at the involved studios want a direct sequel either.2/10",Halloween II
140,gattonero975,"""Hell-NO-ween""",5,12 November 2012,"After seeing Rob Zombie's re-imaging of 'Halloween', I was somewhat wanting to watch this one. I thought it was gonna be his take on the original Halloween 2 of the 80's. Yes he did include a hospital scene environment but it was not the focal point as it was in the original. I was very disappointed with this one. It was just too weird and confusing for me. What was more 'scary' for me was all the cameos of famous actors of the past and how they look today! Zombie must have really been smoking 'The Bong"" big time while filming this 'Zombiasco'! :DWhat was Sheri Moon Zombie doing in this film? I understand flashbacks and all that but here Zombie brought her back as a ghost!? Come on. None of the previous Michael Myers had so-called ""visions"" of ghosts and the like.Chase Wright Vanek as young Michael: This actor was cast because Daeg Faerch from the original had grown way too much and would not look believable as a 10yr old anymore.Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie: Once again Scout returns and the version I saw which was the uncut-director's version, she played the ""going insane"" pretty well.Brad Dourif as Sheriff Lee Brackett: Also returns and is just as good as he was in the original.Caroline Williams as Dr. Maple: I did not recognized her for nothing. Until the credits rolled did I realized it was her! Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Samuel Loomis: Once again Malcolm basically just redoes the doctor from the 1st film. No variation.Tyler Mane as Michael Myers: Also returns but somehow he is not menacing at all in this one!? He actually grunts in this one quite a lot! Previous Michael's never done that! Dayton Callie as Coroner Hooks: Nice cameo bit by this great character actor from the 1980's.Octavia Spencer as Nurse Daniels: Nice little bit for this talented actress. Brutal death scene though.Danielle Harris as Annie Brackett: Returns again for I don't why. She should have been killed in the 1st. Pointless return.Richard Riehle as Buddy the Night Watchman: Nice little bit for this funny actor.Margot Kidder as Barbara Collier: I truly did not recognized Kidder! I mean I thought it was her but then I said no way. Boy was I wrong! She did not age well at all! Nice cameo though.Howard Hesseman as Uncle Meat: Another old timer from the past I did not recognized because time has changed them so much. Nice cameo also.Duane Whitaker as Sherman Benny: Nice bit by this good character actor. Funny and just death scene as he and his buddy Floyd mess with Michael, not knowing who and how dangerous he truly really is.Mark Boone Junior as Floyd (as Mark Boone Jr.): Same as above.",Halloween II

144,moviemaniac008,"A weird film, don't bother seeing it unless you have seen the 2007 prequel",7,29 August 2009,"Halloween II is basically a gore-fest, pretty much like it's predecessor. I have seen Halloween (2007), and I had enjoyed the first movie without going bananas and saying that it was extremely, way-over-the-top cool, but I had enjoyed it nonetheless. When you hear the word sequel, the first thing that pops in your mind is ''worse than the original'', right? Well, that's exactly the case with Halloween II. I'll start off with the cons, and the biggest con of them all, the story. The story was really bad, and you can tell that the makers of this movie really made this movie to make money. This one is way more artistic than the first movie, Myers gets his visions from his mom, and the visions are stunning, but that's on the visual side, because on the other side they were quite weird.Other cons include the actors: Malcolm MacDowell seems pretty good in the movie as Dr. Samuel Loomis, but the other actors seem to make fools of themselves. Scout Taylor Compton is a beautiful lady, but I don't think she can act. Also this movie takes for granted that you have seen the 2007 movie Halloween (also directed by Rob Zombie), so if you haven't seen it but plan on seeing the movie, then I recommend you rent it before watching this one because my friend hadn't seen the previous one and was pretty confused. On the bright side, the film features lots of breasts and gory murders, which is exactly the reason it was made, so at least it stays true to the original recipe. The visual effects are quite good, which is basically my only reason to recommend this film, but some of the murders could barely be seen due to shaky camera movements.This film is not scary, in fact, you may jump a few times during the first 30-40 minutes, but after it gets repetitive and you just don't have that surprise feeling anymore. I recommend this film in theatres if you have seen the original, and you truly liked it because if you didn't, you won't really like the second one either. Or I can recommend you to go see it in theatres if you are an adept of slasher flicks such as Friday the 13th. But if you found the first one average, or think of developing a new passion for slasher flicks, then wait for the DVD release.",Halloween II

Made the sheriff's role a little stronger, But the role of Loomis whatever, it's over. The kill scenes were great. But Mr. Zombie I remember an interview of yours and you said that I would never want to remake a classic movie and totally said that Wes Craven was bought out. Well your first two movies borrowed from a lot of great films like Texas chainsaw and you made it your own movie Part 1 and 2. But now you got Hollywood stars in your eyes who is the buy out now Rob. This movie would be good if it stood on it's own and was original but it's not. Mr. Zombie has so much talent and needs to make an original film come on Rob, give us something we haven't seen before we know you are brilliant let's see it please. You made your money let's see what you can do with it. I heard through the grape vine that Marilyn Manson is working on an original film called Phantasmagoria. Based on the man Lewis Carrol the guy who invented Alice in Wonderland sounds pretty promising. A whole library of books and why can't we see something original for god's sake so tired of directors cashing in on remakes. Oh sorry re-imaging's.

146,scott-sw,Much better effort - but that is not saying much.,4,4 September 2009,"Despite fan backlash against Rob Zombie's re-boot of the Halloween franchise, he continues with his maligned vision of Halloween. Laurie Strode (Scout Compton) has been recuperating from her ordeal from the previous Halloween when Michael Myers goes after her. She is living with Sheriff Brackett (Brad Douriff)and her good friend, Annie (Danielle Harris). At the same time, Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcom McDowell), is out on the book tour, trying to sell his book on Michael Myers. Little does anyone know that Michael Myers (Tyler Dane) escaped from the coroners after they crashed. He is trying to find his lost sister. There are flaws in Zombie's version. First of all: what is the deal in release dates? Not since Halloween VI, the Revenge of Michael Myers, has a Halloween sequel been released in the month of October. No guts, no glory. More practical complaints, though, rest in the film making. In the first place, it is very brutal, vicious, and angry. It goes for the shock and scare instead of the suspense Carpenter gave us in his vision. Michael also lacks the simple pathological patience he displayed in the originals. Not only is the violence overly-brutal, but also the language. Frankly, profanity does not offend me, but it was so much it eventually grates on your nerves. This is linked to Zombie's over-use of the lowest common denominator of characters. Except for Laurie and the Bracketts, most of Michael's victims are, for the most part, white trash with little or no scruples, a profanity laden mouth, and the basest desires. Sure, Halloween is a pagan holiday, but can we get a broader spectrum of characters in a Zombie movie? One aspect that can either be viewed as a problem, or praise, is the use of the psychological milieu within Michael and Laurie. It is this ""dream"" state of both characters that see a dead mother's ghost and a young boy cajoling Michael into his brutal killing spree. In other words, we know what is behind his madness, as well as Laurie's. One thing enjoyable from Halloweens I, II, IV and V is to know that Michael's madness is a mystery (despite some lame attempts to explain it in the sequels). At least this gives us an idea that someone is inside Michael, trying to get out-just like the originals did. This is all for naught, though. I contended Zombie's first Halloween spent too long on the pathology created and then rushed the rest of it. Halloween II, though, paces slowly, trying in a vain attempt to look into the characters and stories. Other than Laurie, and Loomis, the only other interesting character was Brackett, who has a much broader role. The rest are just poor white trash waiting their turn to be murdered. Malcom McDowell does wonders as a controlling ego-maniac. While Tyler Dane is a giant, brutal killer, that strays from a quiet and calculating Shape of the Carpenter/Hill era. We did not fear the Shape because of his brutality, but his patient stalking and cleverness.
This one is worse than The Curse of Michael Myers (part six). Like I said with the review of Zombie's first reboot: never let a Zombie direct a slasher film.
You have been warned.",Halloween II
147,dudedazzreviews,The tagline should be changed to: Boredom Walks Among Us,2,7 October 2010,"After the success of the latest Halloween by Rob Zombie, he decided to make a sequel. This is one of the worst sequels I have seen for a movie in a very long time. Starting where the first one finished, Michael Myers escapes and is still at large and more dangerous than ever before. After failing to kill Laurie in the first, you can pretty much guess what this one is about. Michael becomes a kind-of tramp figure trying to find Laurie with the guide of his mother's spiritand killing anyone who gets in his way.So after watching Halloween II, the first thing I noticed about the story was that there was none whatsoever. It just felt like things were just happening for the fun of it and that circumstances were just happening out of nowhere. The pure fact that Michael Myers is being followed by his mother's spirit is clearly ripping off Jason Voorhees from popular horror movie 'Friday the 13th' and doesn't try too hard to cover it up, it's clear as day! It doesn't show the tough bad-ass Michael Myers but the one who is trampy and has mommy issues. The acting was abysmal, lacking of emotion almost all the way through and in the scenes where there were emotions, I just didn't buy or believe it in any way. Some parts of the movie was boring and could probably have been easily cut out. Also, the movie wouldn't be a Rob Zombie movie without needless and pointless violence as Michael just kills pretty much anyone which was kind of disappointing. All the movie really did was switch between Laurie either having bad dreams or shouting and crying about them and Michael running (or walkingslowly) round killing people. It got boring after the first ten minutes and remained that way all the way through to the end. You didn't care for any of the characters at all.It relies way too heavily on blood and gore and Halloween isn't really supposed to rely on it. There were quite a few plot holes that I'm sure people would notice but other than that, this is more or less a 'take your brain out before watching' type of movie and the ending is possibly one of the most anticlimax endings ever to have graced the movie world and what's possibly worse? It's rumoured there will be a third one! Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Halloween II

149,Field78,"Ignore the rules of the genre, and this is what you get",4,9 November 2018,"Halloween (1978) is a classic that may have lost a bit of its shine over the years because of its copious use of genre clichés, but it is the movie that actually *started* most of these clichés, and therefore worthy of its status. It was a film that didn't necessarily need a remake, but one was made nonetheless in 2007. And apparently it made money, which explains why there had to be a sequel. However, Rob Zombie's vision for the remake, though authentic to his usual style, wasn't particularly groundbreaking, and this sequel is of the kind that makes the original Halloween II (1981) pretty good in comparison.Where did it go wrong? A better question would be: where didn't it? The biggest problem may be director Rob Zombie himself. Granted, I am not a big fan of his work. I liked his House of 1000 Corpses as a tongue-in-cheek slasher, but The Devil's Rejects and 31 got bogged down in a lot of nasty and humorless physical and psychological torture, lacking any redeeming suspense. What I will say for him is that he is a good actor's director, though. No matter how uncomfortable his movies get, the casting is always good, his characters feel authentic, and I have not spotted the bad acting that plagues many horror movies. He also has a keen eye for uncomfortable situations, gory details and, unlike many American directors, he doesn't shy away from the amounts of nudity that were common in the 70s.But a quality that I have consistently missed in his movies is a talent to build a tense atmosphere and suspense. His first Halloween had plenty of explicit killings, but you saw them coming from miles away, and they weren't very scary. Sure, there was gore and violence, but we have seen enough of that during the horror renaissance of the 90s and 00s to no longer look away (or faint) from that. The even bigger lack of suspense and good scares in Halloween II is what makes this an overlong, boring and predictable horror movie. You can actually set your clock to the jump scares this time, and Zombie still doesn't understand how to create a suspenseful scene. The trick is to suggest that there is danger around the corner without showing, or to let the audience know more than the characters. Sadly, he seems too preoccupied with his leading ladies correctly delivering the lines from his script, or having knives thrust into bodies repeatedly to bother with that.Another problem is that despite all the previous criticism, Zombie keeps trying to (literally) give Michael Myers a human face. He clearly hasn't learned his lesson from the previous movie where he controversially gave him a complete backstory. What makes Myers scary is his complete inhumanity: like the Terminator, Michael Myers is a silent, single-minded and unstoppable force that can't be reasoned or bargained with, and whose inner mechanics and motivations remain undisclosed. Zombie now found it necessary to have Myers without the mask and talking, and give him visions of his mother guiding his younger self. It is killing for the horror, but potentially interesting if this were a character piece on Myers; however, Zombie has no further interest in that dramatic side of him as soon as the mayhem starts.The final blow comes from the other main characters. Dr. Loomis has now been reimagined as a sensational writer who is making a living off his famous case. The complete antithesis to his previous incarnation who was determined to stop this force of evil in any way he could. This could have been an interesting spin if they had stuck with it until the end. However, not only does this plotline have little to do with the central story most of the time, it suddenly changes direction at the end, as if the makers chickened out. At least Malcolm McDowell is a joy to watch with his characteristic British politeness with thinly-veiled disdain. Something that can't be said of Scout Taylor-Compton, whose continuous hysterics get so annoying that you actually hope that she runs into a knife somewhere. Giving her character PTSD could have worked, but not in the direction that the movie takes her.So this film managed to make all the wrong choices because it failed to follow the basic rules of the horror genre: you should feel sympathy for the victim and hero, and fear for the killer. I apparently watched the Director's Cut, which adds 12 minutes of tedium to an already long-winded snorefest, something that isn't exactly compensated for by the gore or shocks. It would actually take another 9 years for someone else to make a Halloween film that was received favorably. I am anxious to see it, and hope it can erase the memory of this dull slasher.",Halloween II
150,Kashmirgrey,Rob Zombie Makes Uwe Boll Shine,2,25 April 2010,"At first I was flat-out infuriated by this film. I've never been infuriated by a film. Disappointed, sure, but never angry. Then I realized something. Rob Zombie doesn't give a hoot about how he has aborted a legendary horror franchise. He cares about only two things: further projecting his ugly, misogynistic view of the world on screen and making as much money as possible doing it. He has no imagination nor even the slightest sense of originality. The characters in his films are all the same. Men are portrayed as misogynistic, white trash and women are trivialized as foul-mouthed sluts. He even whores out his own wife. So the thing is, we shouldn't be angry with Zombie. He has established what we can always expect from him garbage. Nope, we should be angry with Dimension Films for what they allowed him to do to the Halloween name, but even more, we should be angry with the folks out there who actually enjoy this type of abomination and lap it up at the trough.",Halloween II
151,LinkGoku,well.. i enjoyed it,10,18 February 2010,"Well.. let me start with what i didn't like about it, i wish they would've gotten Daeg Faerch back to play 10 yr. old Michael, (Chase Vanek did no justice) i also didn't care for the random killing.. but other than that, Malcolm Mcdowell was good, as was Sheri Moon Zombie, Scout Taylor Compton was really great, and Tyler Mane was just amazing again, i also thought both Danielle Harris and Brad Dourif did good.. the music was good as always, and honestly i thought the story was very interesting, i thought Rob Zombie took this movie in a good direction, i loved the idea of this movie and i thought that it was very well made, thus concludes my review of Rob Zombies Halloween II",Halloween II
152,Tender-Flesh,So Laurie Strode is a replicant?,3,9 September 2010,"With all the white horse nonsense, I was expecting Deckard to show up and retire Laurie Strode and maybe leave a paper crane for Michael to play with.While I didn't care for Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween, his sequel is a downright abomination. I know it's difficult to make characters that people care about in horror films when most of them are just going to end up on the chopping block. But, seriously, did Rob have to make Haddonfield a herpes nest of the nastiest looking girls he could find? This isn't the usual vat of sexpots we expect to be bumped off. These girls look genuinely filthy, as in unwashed for weeks. And the mannish Scout took acting lessons from Lindsay Lohan's real-life temper tantrums, obviously.Dr. Loomis didn't even seem to fit hardly at all into the plot. The ""big reveal"" for Laurie's character could have easily come about some other way, so why revive Loomis with no discussion of how Michael darn near crushed his head in the last movie? To have them all three meet in the end was just silly and foolish.And I hope Rob gets divorced soon. I'm tired of seeing his wife in all of his movies. She's a stripper, not an actress. We really don't need so much of Michael's back story that it keeps popping up in a white dress every 10 minutes with moronic dialogue. Part of his character that makes him interesting is the mystery. The same with other popular slasher ""heroes."" We don't want garbage added to the canon to make it difficult for following directors to have to work around that nonsense.And, what of Michael? He's gone from a boogeyman to a giant to, now, the Gorton's Fisherman! And he even gets a bit of dialogue. Isn't that nice? And several scenes in the film have Michael blatantly without his mask and he looks like a really tall Rob Zombie. Gee, I wonder why. Instead of being ""The Shape,"" he's grunting every time he kills someone, then at the finale, he utters a single word. It doesn't matter what the word is: Mikey ain't supposed to talk!Now I guess we can mull over the plot, such as it is. Laurie is living with the Sheriff and his daughter. She is highly medicated, having nightmares, hallucinations, and is in therapy with an actress who is no stranger to that, I'm sure. Meanwhile, since the story takes place I believe 3 years after the last, Michael has been wandering cross country from God knows where and he's wearing a hoodie and looking like a hobo. He isn't menacing in the least. He kills a few people who don't matter a darn to the plot and finally finds Laurie. Then there is a ""big"" showdown at the end, with more ghostly encounters with Mrs. Zombie and her bratty little son and mostly unmasked big son.And where was the famous theme? I expected it to be peppered throughout the picture, but apparently Rob knows best. This film is the final nail in Rob's movie career. Oh, he may make more movies, but he's quickly become the Steven Seagal of horror directors. In fact, that's even being to kind since Seagal had a handful of early enjoyable movies. Rob had one, and that's Devil's Rejects. I'm sure he's got plenty of excuses about why the movies keep turning out like dog poop, such as blaming studio executives and such. The fact is, he's over and overrated. Now quit screwing around and reform White Zombie, the only good thing you ever did. Stay far away from Halloween 3.",Halloween II
153,andell,Dreadfully Pathetic...the worst Halloween of all!,1,21 June 2010,"Before this film came out, Rob Zombie toured the horror junket, talking about how this would be HIS Halloween, and how he would not be constrained to the rules of a remake (a la his alleged ""extreme vision"" of the original), etc... To that end, he talked about his choice of film medium, and how he opted for a medium that was grittier, dirtier and rougher.To that end, Zombie's ""H2"" is a study of contradiction. After all, here he has created a film that features some inventive, darkly fantastical scenes that in a nicer medium would have been far more effective...but which is more painful to behold because of the outdated film medium used! Even gornophiles will be horribly disappointed with this endeavour: there are plenty of savage, gory deaths, however the film is so gritty, it's like watching them on a black and white TV! And to think, we haven't even talked about the story yet. It's pretty generic: Michael Myers makes his escape at the beginning...and following a homage to Rick Rosenthal's ""Halloween II"" at the beginning that is revealed through a dream sequence, we are updated to the following year.Laurie is now living with Annie and her Sheriff father, and in the lead up to Halloween, Michael Myers cuts his way through Haddonfield's ""underbelly"" while Dr. Loomis reveals himself to be an upper class sleaze ball, capitalizing on the tragedy from the previous year to sell his book.Michael is not alone on his rampage this time: his dead mother returns, accompanied by a white horse, and some nonsense explanation about the meaning of it all. She eggs Michael on to ""take us home,"" which of course means picking off Angel/Laurie on the way.There is so much in the film that is deserving of ridicule and contempt, but the reality for me was that most of it centres around Zombie's take on people, and on the horribly inept development of Scout Taylor-Compton's portrayal of Laurie Strode.The former is not new: Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" was chock full of white trash stereotypes that got tedious pretty quickly! For those unsure of what I mean: no one brushes their hair, they wear gaudy clothing as a rule, and most of the men have long hair.However as for the latter, it got annoying really, really quickly! This is not the innocent Laurie Strode made famous by Jamie Lee Curtis: Taylor-Compton's Laurie harasses her new guardian for his choice of pizza toppings, spray paints her en-suite bathroom with satanic graffiti, and acts in general like a petulant brat! I won't even go into her dreams of killing Annie, or of the incomprehensibility of the ending when she finishes off Michael with a knife AFTER telling him she loves him, then walks out of the broken down shed wearing his mask. Or that silly ending, where she's meant to look menacing...but instead looks less menacing that the child Michael! I sure hope Malek Akkad milked this for all it was worth...because in one movie, he has destroyed the film franchise that Moustapha Akkad had created with John Carpenter and Deborah Hill!",Halloween II
154,Dandy_Desmond,"Brutal, strange and quite original",7,19 August 2010,"I liked this. its a strange movie, very violent, a little weird and one thing you can't say is that it is just another slasher film.It seems to have divided people and although yes it has it faults I must admit it kept my interest. That is until the end when the chase goes on far too long again! The main criticism of this film coming from a lot of people is that Michael becomes a tramp (or a bum in US) and kills dogs and eats them. Well he is not exactly going to blend in with society is he? And did he not eat an animal in the original Halloween when Loomis and Brackett entered the Myers house and found a partially eaten dog?So Michael has been wandering around the American countryside for a year until his mother shows up with the child version of himself and a white horse (crazy!) to tell him the time is right to go back after Laurie. Halloween. Laurie is struggling to recover from her previous encounter with Michael. She is yet to discover she is Michaels sister, something that is to be revealed in Sam Loomis new book which he is doing a signing tour for. Michael, Loomis and Laurie are separate for a lot of the film and sometimes you wonder where this film is going. However they all reunite for the showdown at the end. Halloween 2 is definitely Rob Zombies vision. Its brutal (heads getting stomped beyond recognition, a poor nurse gets stabbed and stabbed and stabbed then stabbed some more!) has the usual quirky trashy characters and strong visuals. I feel this was better than Zombies first Halloween. Scout Taylor-Compton was also better in this one and when *spoiler* Annie is killed you feel for Laurie and for Annie after surviving the first film. Overall I liked it. Its not a classic but much better than a lot of the slasher horror coming out at the moment. Although Zombie is not for everyone I think his films have something to offer the horror world.",Halloween II
155,J_Trex,Bloody Waste of Time,3,2 September 2009,"This movie has badly damaged the Zombie brand of horror movie. I liked Rob Zombie's earlier slasher\horror flicks. Movies like ""Devils Rejects"" and ""House of 1000 Corpses"" combined genuine real life psycho characters with tongue-in-cheek humor that made the movie viewer feel in on the joke. These movies didn't take themselves very seriously, and while gory, were also at least a little bit fun to watch.Zombie obviously tried to bring some of that camp levity to ""Halloween II"", notably by including ""Weird Al"" Yankovic in a cameo role, which helped a little. I think the movie could have used a lot more of ""Weird Al"" and a bit less of Mrs. Zombie (Zombie's wife played a leading role in this turkey, some type of angel of death as Jason's Mommy...don't ask, too stupid for words).Unfortunately, this move really stunk. It was just bloody disembowelment after decapitation after evisceration. It was a stupid and bloody mess and a complete waste of time.Stay away from this stinker.",Halloween II
156,culmo80,Just a Mess,4,9 March 2013,"The problem with Zombie's take on Halloween is that he fell victim to the gore/blood over content problem that modern horror has succumbed to. There are long, drawn-out murder sequences for completely random people and that doesn't make for a plot.Once you get past the grisly murders, the plot is somewhat thin. Basically, the movie picks up where Halloween 1 left off. Laurie is taken to a hospital to be treated for her injuries. Michael, meanwhile is transported in a coroner's van which soon hits a cow and crashes. Michael returns to life (after having been declared dead, and shot in the head - this despite Zombie's claim that there is no supernatural in his Halloween films). Michael then goes to the hospital where Laurie is and kills everyone but just as he gets to Laurie, she wakes up 2 years later - it was all a dream!2 years later, Laurie is an even bigger brat, but who now has a sort of fatalistic outlook on life, which makes her even more annoying than in the first film. Dr. Loomis is a self-serving jerk. Michael, we learn, is still alive and is having random dreams about his dead mother (a la Friday the 13th series), so after 2 years of doing nothing, he decides to head back to Haddonfield.After murdering a three random people in a field, some people in a strip club, and some random young adults at a party, Michael then kills a police officer, Annie Bracket, and Laurie's other friend...then a random guy who tries to help Laurie before taking Laurie to an old shack. There we learn that Laurie has also been having the same visions as Michael...therefore they are both insane!I want to like Zombie's take on the Halloween films, but the effort just falls flat. The problem started with the long ""intro"" to Michael as a boy in the first film. By trying to humanize Michael Myers, Zombie successfully deflated a certain amount of mystery from the films.In Halloween II (2009) none of the main characters are all that likable except for Sheriff Brackett. As I said Laurie is a brat; in the original films, she was a sweet, innocent girl but she was also strong. Dr. Loomis in this film is a pretentious jerk hocking a book; in the original film, he was the noble defender who knew what Michael Myers was. And Michael Myers is just too ""human."" He grunts and shows emotion...in the alternate ending, he takes off his mask and tells Dr. Loomis to ""Die!"" I won't get into the all the visions and the white horse motif in this film...they only were distractions and thinly provided a motive for Michael's killings. In trying to provide a more gritty, realistic vision of Halloween, Zombie only partially succeeded. By trying to make Michael Myers more human, he took something away. By making the central hero (Loomis) into a despicable human being, Zombie made the film boring.The only good thing about this film is that the physical appearance of Michael Myers IS terrifying.",Halloween II
157,aqos-1,Rob...Go back to making music.,1,10 December 2009,"I have never been more disappointed in a movie than I was this one. It turns Loomois into a douche bag and Lori into hippie with a very loose grasp on things. Zombie made Michael look like he himself does. If that's what Zombie wanted to do, he should have taken over the role and save Tyler Mane the embarrassment of being associated with this piece of garbage. The character of Michael goes from someone who mindlessly kills people to someone that expresses rage and kills people because of it. Zombie's attempt to keep his wife in this picture was ill conceived and completely negated her being a loving mother in the first movie. Her whole involvement in this movie makes Michael into a being capable of reflection instead of a mindless killing machine on a mission. I kept looking for something to like about this movie and all I can say is that the horse was pretty.",Halloween II
158,jaguiar313,Sequel is a vicious and visually effective mixed bag.,6,4 October 2012,"Once again Rob Zombie shows great potential but, also once again, his film is a mixed bag. First off, the slow methodical pace doesn't really help and the film never really gets scary. In fact, it never really feels like a ""Halloween"" film. There are some savagely violent scenes that are very effective and intense but, by the end of the film, you've been bludgeoned into numbness with all the brutality. I also didn't like Dr. Loomis being portrayed as an egotistical asshole. Just didn't work. So what did I like? There are some really twisted and bizarre dream sequences that have beautiful and surreal visuals that really impressed me. Much like the final act of Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses, it is when Zombie takes his camera into these surreal sequences that his films really come to life and sadly he doesn't do it often enough. I liked the sequences of Myers hallucinating that he sees his dead mother and his younger self, egging him on to kill. And the same for Laurie Strode's nightmares. Great stuff. And I really liked the WTF ending. Also, genre favorite Brad Dourif gives what might be the performance of his long career. Yes, he is that good and, to be honest, the whole cast give strong performances around him. And to give credit where it's due, Tyler Bates' moody score replaces Carpenter's classic theme this time round and adds it's own texture to the films atmosphere. I hope someday Rob Zombie makes a film that finally lives up to the potential he constantly shows.",Halloween II
159,cheighlee,The one where Michael Myers is talking to his dead mother and also there's a white horse in it,3,18 June 2018,"Like in the movie before this one, Rob Zombie continues to miss the point of Michael Myers completely, however, this time he's not copying older Halloween movies that much.Two years later and new Laurie Strode is an asshole and has mental problems. Annie Brackett has also survived first movie, unlike the original and deals with Laurie's breakdown.Michael Myers eats a dog and is a hobo with a knife. Kills people, tripps like he's on drugs. Laurie tripps as well, but she's maybe actually on drugs.Loomis gets money, personal assistant and fame... more infamy though.
 
Everyone finds out Laurie is Michael's sister, she goes even more nuts. Oh, yes, we have that back for this reboot as well, sorry.Brad Dourif gets angry, guns everyone down with the power of police. The end, also there is white horse here and there. Stupid.I rank this second worst Halloween movie in my book.",Halloween II
160,Rattrap007,Another lousy remake,1,24 March 2010,"Wish i could go lower on this film. A one is not low enough. It is that bad.The first one screwed up by doing the back story and making him ""human"". He is supposed to be the Boogeyman. Not a white trash little psychopath.This one tries to be a little artsy at times. The sound drops out completely and music is turned way up. This may work in other movies.. but not here.One big problem is the writing. I have never heard the F bomb uttered so much in a single film. It comes off as either the writer thinks it makes him sound edgy and cool, or a little kid who learns the word, knows it is naughty and keeps saying it because he knows it is wrong. Either way it is annoying. One sequence is 2-3 minutes of a guy just saying the f word. Ugh.Other parts give the viewer a major WTF reaction. Like when Annie, her father, and Laurie are having pizza. Meanwhile Michael cuts open a dead dog and eats the heart. Then almost like it is a physical connection Laurie gets sick. So she tasted the dog heart? What?? I can see it written as a twin sensing what the other is doing, but two people separated by 10 years in age? No! In the original you may hear a little heavy breathing from Michael, here he grunts.. a lot.The ONLY things I liked in this movie were Dr. Lumis and Weird Al. Lumis was great that he is so different. The old Lumis was excellent as well. Old Lumis was a savior and died a real hero. He knew Meyers was pure evil. He tried to keep it contained. New Lumis wanted to help and felt he failed Meyers. Then after surviving the encounter in the first one, he becomes a total a****** and profits from the tragedy. Adds a new Dynamic to the character. Al is hilarious as always.Laurie is nuts, but somewhat understandable. Her friend also survived the attack yet seems fine. Also the cop dad must be very lenient to allow Laurie to spray paint pentagrams and crap all over the walls of her room and bathroom.The dream sequence stuff with mommy and little Mikey. What the hell is that? Seriously? And how is it Laurie sees this? How can the little Mikey hold her down? It makes no sense! The opening in the hospital was somewhat OK... but it is all a dream and never happened.",Halloween II
161,fritzlang,ugh!,3,25 July 2010,"Before I start my review, let me share some things.1) I missed this in the theaters. Saw the unrated DVD version 2) I love horror films, though don't think much of the Halloween franchise. Besides the 1 one (maybe the 2nd and 4th entries), just haven't been particularly impressed. 3) based on all the negative reviews, I went into seeing this with EXTREMELY low expectations.With all of this said, i found this a real chore to sit through, and many times was tempted to stop watching it.On the plus side, there were some nice things about this. It was a bold and daring approach. Michael was a non-speaking monster in the original series. Here is a non-stop talking kid (at least in many scenes)There were some very impressive visuals. Some scenes still stand out. The dream sequences were especially impressive.The kills were brutal and nasty - if you go for that sort of thing.There were a few genuine scares. When Zombie focused on horror (not gore) then it worked for me.The bad? everything else.First, I hated every character. I don't think I hated Laura's character as much as loathed it. She was one of the few characters in movie history that I really wanted to be killed just to get her off the screen. And she was supposed to be the heroine of the movie!!Dr. Lumis was an arrogant SOB whom I also wanted to die and get off the screen as soon as possible.Only Brad Douriff's character had any kind of likability, and his part didn't really have that much meat to it. Most of the cinematography was abysmal to me - dark, muddy, blurred, close up. Editing was the typical modern Michael-Bay-Let's-Cut-every-two-seconds type of editing which only added to the confusion of most scenes. Some of the fight/kill scenes, in particular, I really couldn't tell what was going on!There were WAY too many scenes that just didn't make any sense and didn't add to the plot. Just what was the extended party scene about anyhow? It is telling on the DVD Special features, there was a segment DEVOTED to the comedian AND the band at the party! The entire 20 minutes could have been cut from the film and I really don't think I would have noticed.Too many teenage characters, and none of them really were distinct. Everyone of them were a bunch of partying kids with no personality or goal in life. At some point I thought Zombie was trying us to care about them (like the kid in the wolf mask in the van), but nothing really happened.There was a grimy feel to the film that was just 'icky' to me. Not scary, not meaningful = just dirty. That didn't help.*** SPOILER AHEAD**** We do get to see the Shape without any mask and it just looked like a redneck. Not even any scars on the face? And was it just me or did he look like a fatter version of Rob Zombie? Really wish I never saw that.*** end of Spoilers *****It was also WAAY too long.. I think 40 minutes could have been trimmed out (the unrated cut might be longer, though I didn't read glowing reviews of the rated version either).In the end, I really felt like I wasted my $4 and the 2 hours of my life.Zombie has skills, no doubt about it.. I just didn't like this movie..And I can totally understand that anybody who is really 'into' the original Halloween franchise would be even more unhappy than I was.3/10 - generously.",Halloween II
162,eytand94,"""Halloween II"" is definitely not a bad movie!",9,11 September 2009,"When I first saw this 10th Michael Myers outing, I thought it was just OK and nothing more. I believed it to be a small disappointment. But now that I think about it, ""Halloween II"" is better than I thought it was, at first. Now, I realize that this movie has a lot going for it, despite a few flaws.The plot revolves around the damaged lives of some of the residents of Haddonfield. Laurie Strode is now living with her friend, Annie, and her father, sheriff Lee Brackett. Physically, Laurie is fine, but mentally, part of Laurie's mind is destroyed because of what happened on Halloween night in 1978. She has terrible nightmares, and can't bear to think about her psychopathic brother, Michael. Laurie keeps reminding herself that The Shape is dead and gone, never to come back again. But she's very, very wrong. Michael Myers is very much alive, and he's coming back to Haddonfield to claim his sister. And anybody who gets in his way...will suffer his painful wrath.2007's ""Halloween"" tapped into the twisted icon's psychosis, and then it went on to be a remake of the original, only with new, original touches. ""Halloween II"" is actually not a remake. It is Rob Zombie's own movie, a truly different film for a slasher hero like Michael Myers. Zombie has crafted an original story and several characters you believe in.You know what really surprised me? ""Halloween II"" is not as bloody as the first. Well, at least after the second act. Zombie shoots most of his kill scenes in very shadowy environments, keeping the tension amped up and the claustrophobia settled in perfectly. Michael could have gone farther, but he went far enough.The one thing that I probably admired the most about ""Halloween II"" is how much the character of Laurie Strode changed. She is almost bipolar, but then again, wouldn't you be if someone like Michael Myers attacked you? Zombie creates a very accurate vision of a traumatized, sympathetic teenager who finds out terrible things about who she really is. And Scout Taylor Compton has always been the perfect girl to play Laurie. She did an awesome job in the first movie, and she does it again here. This is a wonderful and believable actress who can really scream her guts out! Now, here's where the movie had its flaw: I was like all the other ""Halloween"" fans, asking myself ""What the hell happened to Dr. Loomis?"" He pretty much became a jerk, obsessed with publicity and success. Whatever happened to Loomis making sure that his patient was dead? But, I think I understand the new Loomis, now. Since Halloween 1978, he has given up on himself, and he has now let himself drown in egocentricity. Like him, we don't want to remember that night. But everyone knows that it's going to come back to him sooner or later.I enjoy the new Michael Myers look: the dirty, hooded coat, a brand-new knife, and the classic William Shatner mask is nearly torn in half, revealing part of The Shape's face. But if they're going to bring Michael back for another ""Halloween"" movie, they should probably just stick with black overalls and the regular mask. There's always a costume store that Michael can sneak into. He did it in ""Halloween 4.""The cast is well-rounded. Like I said before, Scout Taylor Compton is great as Laurie. Malcolm MacDowell is back as Dr. Loomis, Brad Dourif is very good as Sheriff Brackett, and it's always a joy to see Danielle Harris as Annie. Along with those guys are more cameos from stars such as Margot Kidder, Weird Al Yankovic, Howard Hesseman, and Caroline Williams. Also back from the first movie is Sheri Moon Zombie as the illusive Deborah Myers, complete with a creepy look and a white horse. And Tyler Mane is awesome, as always, as Michael.The music is composed, once again, by Tyler Bates. This time, he doesn't use much of the original score by John Carpenter. Instead, he creates his own music, setting an even bleaker tone for the movie.I know that ""Halloween II"" wasn't so well-received when it came out. And I understand how people feel about it. It does have its flaws, including a script that is a little bit thin. But, I went into this movie with the right expectations, knowing that this wasn't going to be like Rob Zombie's first outing with Michael Myers. So, ""Halloween II"" is more than OK. I realize now that it's a very unique, original, and bizarre entry in the franchise that is soon to develop a cult status. Consider ""Halloween II"" booked on my DVD shelf.",Halloween II
163,anchoreddown,The man in the white mask is back!,9,28 August 2009,"Let's return to Haddonfield on Halloween 1978, again.This is take two of an updated franchise done in very similar to how Christopher Nolan did Batman. The torch was passed to Rob Zombie back in 2007, and now is time for take two.There is nothing less than what any Halloween film needs - brutal killings, unexplained vanishings, blood spots on the ground, etc. Zombie picks up right where we left off, but goes in a totally different direction. A year later, Michael Myers is pronounced dead, however very much alive. He's living a secluded life while channeling nightmares into Laurie's brain, much like he does with Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 5: Revenge of Michael Myers. Dr. Loomis is soaking up vast revenue from his new book and taking heat from it. Then on October 28th, Michael emerges from his cave and travels to Haddonfield to continue his reign of blood and terror with his mother's spirit by his side. Zombie does a very good job in rebuilding an already existing structure of the famous Halloween tale. There is less blood in this film and could easily replace the original film if the tie-ins weren't there. There's always something new to explain about Michael Myers. This time we can see the prophetic white horse being used as Michael's morbid inspiration to keep killing with mother by it's side, guiding his every step. The druid-like symbol seen on Michael's right wrist from Halloween 5 and 6 is not visible, so this idea will obviously be weeded out even if Zombie chooses to make that many sequels. Clearly the best remake to date next to Friday The 13th.",Halloween II

Well let's start with the positive elements. Well first of all the acting is pretty good and there are some good Horror visuals.Now on to the negative elements. The the story is mess, filled with plot contrivances, random weird scenes that contribute nothing to the plot, and drama that doesn't work. This is also a very mean spirited movie, taking a lot of unpleasant turns. The characters themselves are forgettable. Michael Myers does the same thing he's been doing the past few decades, Sam Loomis is suddenly a greedy jerk for no reason, and Laurie Strode is an idiot at times.All in all this is a film you should probably skip and see the original Halloween instead, or even the original Halloween II. Just don't see this one.",Halloween II
166,pmcguireumc,kind of disappointed,7,28 August 2009,"OK, this is not John Carpenter, and I did not expect it to be. I love the mythology of Halloween, and have liked all the films for what they were. I even liked Season of the Witch.I liked Rob Zombie's first film. I thought it was a nice tribute, and it added some dimension to the Myer's character. It was gory, in comparison to the first 8 or 9, but it was different enough to enjoy.Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about this one. I have been looking forward to it for some time, and I have to say that for the most part, i was disappointed.Actually, the acting was pretty good. I really can't complain about any of the actors. My complaint is with Zombie. I really wanted to like this film, but the choppy, rapid cut cinematography was so over the top that it was painful to watch at times. Furthermore, the gore was excessively ridiculous.Regarding the acting, I was not impressed with the new kid they got to play Michael Jr. I know the other one is grown up, but they could have just had him in masks since they had him masks for most of the first movie. it would have saved the viewer from going ""that's a different kid from the first film"" all the way through.I did like the white horse bit. Thought it was clever, and Sheri Moon is gorgeous throughout. Some have trashed the ending, but I have to say that I thought it was a nice tribute to Psycho.The camera work and the excessive gore though, prevent me from being overwhelmed by the film, and that being said, I am kind of disappointed. I really wanted to like it more than I did. Here's hoping Zombie veers clear from this franchise in the future. Bring back the old series!",Halloween II
167,furiousneon,Halloween II: Rob Zombie's second bizarre take on Michael Myers.,10,29 August 2009,"Halloween II starts off giving you a definition that will define plenty of moments through out the film and after its first initial display, you should kind of get the hint of what you are going to be in for. If you thought Rob Zombie put his touch on the first film, just wait until you get a load of this one. It is BRUTAL, sadistically violent in every single way possible. If you don't cringe during the hospital scene then you have some thick skin, let me tell you. Aside from the horrific violence (which comes with the territory when it comes to Zombie) this movie is nothing like your average Halloween film. It isn't even like the remake. The first 10 or so minutes are the closest to his remake that you are going to see, because after that he takes our buddy Michael Myers and throws him into a completely DIFFERENT element, multiple of them actually. With the first film you felt that Zombie had to stay faithful to the original and stay in bounds, well with this one the studio definitely let him go buck wild and do anything..and i mean anything, that the master of redneck guts wants. I don't want to give away anything about the film, but I will justify my 10/10 score and I am giving it that based on this: Rob Zombie is fearless. He made HIS Halloween film and is leaving it up to you to either love it or hate it. If your like me and are intrigued by some of the new grounds and territory that this film takes this series into, then you will without a doubt love it.",Halloween II
168,HK_Key-Si_HK,"If you are just looking for an impressive slasher let loose, then this movie is for you.",7,14 March 2018,"Rob Zombie's world is different. We all know that. After the 2007 remake of Halloween this is now the sequel to it. And once again Zombie follows his path relentlessly, despite all the criticism for the first attempt. The director took this classic and gave it a complete overhaul. Not only in story but also in the way the characters are presented. Remember the original? We all liked Dr. Loomis, right? Not so in this one. Loomis is one of the least likable characters in this movie and totally self centered. Michael Myers still stands tall and is so much more impressive than in the original. By this I mean just the appearance. If I would see the Michael from the original at night on a dark street, I'd just think ""what a weirdo"". If I came across this one, I better run as fast as I can! Also all other characters have been dragged through the dirt of what I would describe as a reality check. You easily can imagine meeting any of these characters in real life and they would just behave the way they do in this movie. It almost doesn't feel like acted and I really like this approach. Yet I still miss the intense atmosphere of the original movies. If you are just looking for an impressive slasher let loose, then this movie is for you. I am totally capable of enjoying both versions for different reasons.",Halloween II
169,scrapmetal7,one weird mixed bag,7,2 September 2009,"(psst...It's still better than the new Friday the 13th.)The main problems with Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN II are its unnecessity and its redundancy. It is unnecessary because Zombie's 2007 HALLOWEEN, whether you liked it or not, made a complete statement as a film and there isn't anything to add to it. This new sequel is redundant not only in its basic premise, but actual scenes in this film are repeats from the 2007 film. There are ways in which HALLOWEEN II departs from his first film and from the franchise in general, but they aren't ways that I expect to go over well with anyone, Halloween die-hards or otherwise. Halloween fans who railed against the minor changes in the 2007 film will be blogging endlessly into the night over Michael's traumatically different visual appearance, with his bushy beard that comes out from underneath his mask, and I doubt anyone will be enamoured with the idea of Michael and Laurie seeing the ghost of their mother. These aren't bad touches, but they don't add anything of value to what was already done, and weren't worth building a whole new story around.As with any Zombie film, the visuals are amazing. RZ uses the best cinematographers in the business, and if you watch the film solely for the cinematography, you'll enjoy it a lot. Some nice visual moments include Michael walking across the fields, or a small boy's perspective of an unmasked Michael. Michael's dreams of his mother are nice and spooky, if a little Hot-Topicy.A lot of fun character actors show up, such as Dayton Callie as an ambulance driver, but aren't given much to do. Unfortunately, Scout Taylor-Compton also shows up, and continues her A.D.D., shrill, giddy, silly-ass portrayal of Laurie Strode. At the end of the day, a ton of fan recrimination is going to be laid at RZ's feet, which is understandable because H2's better qualities are overshadowed by its vulnerabilities.(scenes that repeat from the first one: Michael beats Laurie's best friend almost to death and then Laurie comes home and finds her. Loomis shows up and the cops don't like him because of his book. Loomis tries to intervene and Michael kills him. Laurie has a long moment sitting next to Michael who is incapacitated, and she kills him.)",Halloween II

171,willwoodmill,"A valiant, but failed, effort at developing a surrealist atmospheric horror movie",4,31 May 2016,"The Halloween horror franchise is one of the most famous horror franchises ever. It started way back in 1978 with the release of John Carpenter's horror masterpiece Halloween, a film that forever changed the horror genre. Halloween did so well with audiences that it led to countless sequels, most of which are of ""questionable"" quality. But just when everyone though the franchise was finally dead, Rob Zombie came along with plans to remake the original classic. And that remake was not well received, it wasn't considered terrible, but it was nowhere near as good as the boundary pushing original. But even with the mixed reaction to the original Rob Zombie decided to continue with the series and make a sequel to the first remake. And while this remake was completely panned upon its original release, it has now found a small cult following.The majority of Halloween 2 takes place two years after the incidents of the first film. Laurie, who is Michael Myers little sister, whom he had been trying to kill in the previous film, is still living in Haddonfield and her foster family are trying to conceal her identity as Michael's sister. And meanwhile Samuel Harris has gone on to make a fortune of the the tragedy of the first film by selling books about Michael Myers. As Halloween approaches Laurie, who goes struggles to cope, as she is viciously reminded of the horrible events that happened to years earlier. And to make matters worse Myers has come back to Haddonfield to try and finish what he started two years ago.Halloween 2 is a film that had some really good ideas, the best of which being to start trying to experiment with surrealist horror in the film. Also the film occasionally boasts some pretty impressive visuals, which is nice. But undeniably the best part about Halloween 2 is the opening part in the hospital. While most of the film takes place two years after the events of Rob Zombie's first film the first 20 or so minutes take place immediately after the first film. And these 20 or so minutes are amazing, first of all they are unrelentingly brutal and disturbing. Even little things like the dialogue between police officers in this opening scene is down right disgusting and volatile. The opening also has a great oppressive atmosphere, that feels liked being covered in a heavy blanket of dread and terror. This Great atmosphere will unfortunately not come back for the rest of the film.After the opening scene the film slowly decreases in quality, and quickly devolves into a complete mess. One of the biggest problems with Halloween 2, is that it didn't go all the way with the surrealism and the brutality of the first scene. It just will occasionally experiment with it a little bit and then leave it alone for a while, which was really disappointing. Another huge problem with Halloween 2, is that it kept cutting away from the protagonist. This breaks the movies flow, and prevents it from creating any atmosphere or building any tension. The film would have been so much better if it just focused on Laurie and created a little private surrealist hell for her where she was tormented by figments from her past. Another thing that would have made Halloween 2 better, is if it wasn't a ""Halloween"" film. The connection to the franchise is just holding it back. If the film was not connected to the tired old story it could have experimented much more. At the end of the day Halloween 2 isn't terrible, but most of the film is horribly un- scary, dull, and forgettable, and I don't think I can recommend it to most people. But that opening scene is pretty good.4.8",Halloween II
172,chrishayes737,Better than expected,10,30 January 2010,"I'm a huge Halloween fan but alas I live in New Zealand & Rob Zombies Halloween 2 was not released here in theaters so I had to wait until I could buy it off amazon on DVD . For months I have read & heard about the negativity towards H2 but all of this was unwarranted as H2 is probably the best Halloween movie yet . It had strong performances by all the cast especially Scout Taylor-Compton also Micheal Myers is portrayed as human not the super natural can't die freak of the originals....I think the dream sequences worked well & showed how Micheal was driven to reunite his family in the after life .The opening sequence in the hospital was awesome & the end sequence with the stand off between Micheal & all the police was awesome too so overall a fantastic entry into the Halloween family & just can't understand why more people didn't like the film , I thinks it's mainly to do with Rob Zombies style but in this case it works well within the Hallowen saga .PS....18 months after my first review I have something to tell , the above review came from watching the unrated directors cut in other words I never saw the theatrical version until now that is . There is one massive difference from the unrated directors cut to the theatrical version that is the endings are very different !!! In the Unrated Directors cut Micheal throws Lumis out of the shed & takes his mask off & says die to Lumis before stabbing him once & then Micheal is gunned down by about 100 guns & then Laurie comes out & is also shot by a gun happy cop & looks as though she's dying when it fades out to the asylum sceen . Now the theatrical version has Micheal killing Lumis in the shed in a far more violent manner & then Micheal is shot in the shed through the window by the cops & falls on some sharp machinery & Laurie proceeds to stab Micheal about 10 times & then walks out of the shed with Mickeals mask on & then fads out to the asylum sceen so in summery the theatrical version is much better because Micheals face should never have been shown & him talking was a big no IMHO so anyone out there please don't bother with the unrated directors cut as the ending is not what it should be .",Halloween II
173,jwtrox08706,Watch the Unrated Director's Cut to see what story Rob *really wanted to tell,9,24 January 2010,"Closure...a term that can never seem to apply to the Halloween series. But now, despite plans for a sequel to Rob Zombie's Halloween II having been put in the works (but later halted), I think we can say that Rob has truly brought real closure to Halloween. And he did it in a span of around 4 years with just 2 films. In that 4 years and 2 films, Rob brought us a re- envisioning of Halloween and closure to that story he retold. While I did find the theatrical version somewhat effective, the Unrated Director's Cut released on DVD is what should have made it to the big screen, because it is what Rob Zombie had originally intended to be Halloween II. We have all the gritty, raw and emotional action from the theatrical version in this film (with a few extra touches to help drive home the emotional parts) and a different outcome to the film as well. Rob's use of imagery and lighting is phenomenal and really brings an eerie surrealism to the film, and that is what this film is. It is surreal. We are seeing the gradual demise of Laurie Strode. The night her brother came home completely pushed her beyond her limits. She lost the people she knew to be her parents her entire life, her friends and her security. Now she is struggling to cope with the hell that she had endured. Instead of setting the film one year after its predecessor, Rob decides to set it two years later, and that makes more sense. If it's not bad enough to have lost so much, she is constantly reminded of that night by the scars on her friend, Annie's, face, and she's living with Annie and her father, Sheriff Brackett. The constant reminder of that night creates much turbulence between Laurie and Annie, and their once solid friendship has now taken a turn for the worse. There is also somewhat of a role reversal. Annie becomes the more responsible person; while Laurie has become the more wild and outlandish character that Annie once was. Laurie's therapy is going nowhere, and she is becoming more and more addicted to her psychiatric medications. She is more run down and almost completely gone than she was depicted in Halloween: Resurrection. Rob's depiction of what is going on inside Michael's head is very surreal and spooky. Michael still thinks and acts as he did when he first started to kill people. He hasn't grasped the fact that his mother killed herself, and he still believes that he can bring his family back together. So seeing young Michael and Deborah is seeing the world through Michael's eyes. Michael goes on a horrific killing spree. He butchers anyone in his path from Lou Martini (who is still running the Rabbit in Red Lounge where Mrs. Myers used to work and he is using that fact as a way of attracting customers) to Annie (in a horrific beating that the audience's imagination). Annie's death is treated differently. It is more drawn out. We see Laurie's grief over losing Annie, and then we see Sheriff Brackett's grieving, which is very well played by Brad Douriff. He brought home the pain of a father losing his daughter in such a horrible manner. It brought tears to my eyes. Dr. Loomis, another survivor of that night, has become a slick, money hungry fame monger. He is now in the process of pushing his new book that reveals a huge detail that he learned the night he nearly was killed. That detail: Laurie's true origin. That detail is Laurie Strode is actually Angel Myers...Michael's sister. Amidst great controversy and buzz, he has the book released on Halloween. Sheriff Brackett finds out what Loomis did, and frantically tries to find Laurie before she can find out about it, but he fails. Laurie buys the book, reads it, and this helps push her even more over the edge. As the film goes on, Laurie's psyche becomes more and more a mirror image of Michael's, until finally she steps into the realm of Michael at the very end in a standoff at an old shack in the middle of a field where Michael had been staying. After Loomis tries to redeem himself for what he did and gets killed by Michael and Michael is gunned down by an entire police force, Laurie steps out amongst the carnage while Sheriff Brackett looks on. He already lost Annie, he has one more chance. Laurie, in a state of shock and in somewhat of a trance, picks up the knife and goes over to Loomis to seemingly stab him. A shot rings out, and then more. Laurie is gunned down in the same manner that her brother was, and just as she is about to slip off the mortal coil, she has one final thought. The vision of her sitting at the end of a long, bright, white hallway. She looks up to crack an eerie grin as she sees Deborah walking down the hallway with a white horse. All the while, this is being serenaded in the background with a very depressing rendition of Love Hurts as sung by Nan Vernon, which is a track on the Halloween II soundtrack. For sheer human emotion, vivid imagery and a very convincing attempt that may very well succeed (I hope) to bring closure to Halloween once and for all so that we may stop seeing this great film that was raped into a franchise continue to be milked and milked for more money, I give this film 9 stars out of 10. If anyone has a problem with it, then they just don't get it.",Halloween II
174,johnjanis,Not good,4,7 December 2020,"How ironic that the most goriest Halloween movie is also my least favourite. In fact now that I think about it some of the killings are way over the top. Michael never needed overkill. The movie just drags and drags.
Unlikable characters, unnecessary music, unnecessarily long, stupid dream sequences and Michael has suddenly turned into some 7 foot giant who now grunts and looks completely different.
If it wasn't for some of the deaths which are admittedly well done, then I would have rated this a 3.",Halloween II
175,adam_uk09,"Good, but not great!",6,16 October 2009,"Michael Myers has returned, again! But this time it's personal. Halloween II is the brainchild of Rob Zombie who directed the remake of the 1978 John Carpenter original.However, in this, the first sequel of the rebooted slasher series, Zombie has been able to splash his creative wisdom all over the celluloid with somewhat successful results.By now, we all know that having Sheri Moon in a Rob Zombie film is a given, but her role here is perhaps slightly too implausible for even the most hardened critics to understand, playing schizophrenic Michael's dead mother. Unfortunately, the idea, which whilst being excellent at the production stages as an idea, is badly executed on screen and what we're left with, is a mess of a storyline that doesn't ever know which way it is going; supernatural one-minute and slasher flick the next.Regrettably, Zombie has made some horrific choices concerning Michael's character. In this film he grunts as he kills, he doesn't use a knife to kill very often and the biggest sins of all, the iconic mask is removed in what could be a historical cinematic moment and John Carpenters musical score masterpiece has been completely removed. For these reasons alone, it doesn't feel like a Halloween film.Negativity aside, the story is pretty much the same as last time around, though Zombie has focused in on Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor Compton) and the way her character changes from the events of Halloween night. As with giving the characters a back-story in the 2007 Halloween, this storyline change really does work.The acting is superb; Compton is much better this time around and really brings a whole new side to her character. On the other hand, Malcolm McDowell's iconic Sam Loomis has been shoddily turned into a greedy, fame-obsessed man whose objectives are simply to make as much money as possible. This doesn't suit the role and leaves McDowell wanting.Overall, Halloween II is a decent stab at recreating the old franchise; Zombie has made it work on so many levels and it certainly moves the game on. Unfortunately, he has tried to pack too many elements into the film and the pay off for that is a messy looking cinema experience. Enjoyable as a film, but the jury is still out on whether this deserves a spot on the Halloween collector's shelf.",Halloween II
176,rynlarson,Rob Zombie fails to grasp the subplots of the original films!,6,13 September 2009,"One of the things I always found attractive about the Halloween series that in my mind set it apart from its competitors (Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street) was its foundation in reality (up until Michael survived anything!!!). The first two films in the original series (obviously what Rob Zombie is ""re-inventing) had a special characteristic of realism and characters the viewer could identify with. What I found most disappointing about this entry was the portrayal of Dr. Loomis. I was content with the first films use of this vital character, but here he has been diminished to nothing but a greedy individual that is trying to cash in on his encounters with the character. Gone is the Donald Pleasance portrayal of the obsessed Doctor that is near mad chasing the monster whom he felt obligated to. I always thought Carpenter's use of the Loomis character was terrific, similar to ""Moby Dick"" where the Whale and its adversary are opposed but similar in their stance. The cat and mouse game between Myers and Loomis was always done well. It was precisely what the Friday the 13th series always lacked. Here, Zombie inserts at the very end a moment of redemption, but as the viewer you are still unsure of Loomis' intentions. The gore is aplenty here, with constant close ups of the victims meeting their untimely fate. What works here is Myers, Zombie's vision of the monster itself is well done, and perhaps a scarier figure than the original. What doesn't work is the tension, which is completely amiss here, the viewer knows exactly what is coming next. The action is not well done...it is hard to tell what is going on at times. With ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" the characters were interesting and less was more. Here, Zombie is getting to kinetic for his own good. Also what fails here is the inability of the town of Haddonfield (doesn't exist by the way) where the survivors of the last film are nonchalant about Myers and seem content to ""just believe"" Myers is dead even though no body has been found. The lack of worry by the Annie Brackett character is unrealistic. A character, in the last film, who was knifed by the monster repeatedly and survived, doesn't seem to be bothered by the same things Laurie is even though they went through the same experience. I gave it a 6 out of 10 simply because as a horror genre fan, this film is better than Halloween 5 and Halloween 8. Its production is top notch and the addition of Weird ""Al"" Yankovich is worth a couple of points up. Overall disappointing to what it could have been.",Halloween II
177,Fenris Fil,Rob Zombies Friday the 13th,1,17 February 2010,"Seems Zombie can take a classic and make a good film (Halloween and House of 1000 Corpses (being essentially a remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre)) but give him an average sequel to a classic to remake and he seems quite lost. He tries to take it in a new direction, much like his sequel to Corpses, but this time (when firmly in a recognised franchise), it backfires. His new angles are lame and annoying and don't really fit with his own first part let alone any of the original series.The trouble here started with the change to the earlier remake which opened the door to a sequel. In an earlier cut the film was clearly a one off and made a good go of showing us a more realistic version of Michael. To allow for the sequel however Michael had to escape and the changes seemed to invoke the supernatural elements of the original series (which I felt really detracted from an otherwise solid film). Now following on from this Zombie has tried to continue to show us more of Michaels psychology, but at this stage it no longer fits with the direction the film needs to go. The Shape is no longer a child with a darkness building inside him. What they end up doing makes the film feel much more like the early Friday the 13th films rather then a Halloween.Sadly it does nothing for the Genre and makes us all cringe as once again we wonder why they bothered to reboot a series just to mess it up all over again. I can't help but feel that Rob Zombie never really did understand the original Halloween.",Halloween II
178,IMDBer100575,Zombie's worst movie,3,24 January 2010,"I finally decided to watch this movie. I've always enjoyed the Halloween series but have put this one off mainly because I heard that the signature white mask was not a part of the movie. Now that I've watched the movie, the absence of the mask is not the reason why the movie sucks.I have enjoyed all the movies I've watched from Rob Zombie. This one really disappointed me.It amazes me that Zombie committed such a horrible foul in movie-making; the opening sequence was a long, drawn out dream. That was the first sign to me that this movie would suck. But I gave it a chance and proceeded to watch the remainder of the movie because I'm a Halloween and Zombie fan.Another foul in this movie is making the star annoyingly stupid. All throughout the movie, she's weak and pathetic. We hope that at the end, she becomes empowered and overcomes her situation. That is not at all the case. In the end, we learn that she is weaker than we originally thought. I think Zombie is trying to imply that Laurie Strode is now Michael Myers; however, the transition is not believable and just too abrupt.The overall acting in this movie was quite decent. Everybody pulled off their rolls believably. Scout Taylor Compton gave a great performance and I was truly annoyed at her character's weakness and patheticism. The atmosphere was great and allowed for some excellent death scenes. I have to say that the death / kill scenes in this movie were excellent!! Tyler Mane's size makes him a great Michael Myers.I would give this movie a 5 if there was better plot development. Actually, I'd give a 5 if there was a plot at all. I just did not see the point of the movie. Yes, it's a slasher flick but I think Zombie tried to get too artistic with it and should have just left it at good ol' hunt and kill.I put this movie off from it's theatrical release date till now, which is about six to seven months and now, I know why. I'm glad I watched it but I have to say that this movie sucks. I can't believe I stopped playing WoW for this.",Halloween II

180,m-rugen,"It's not a remake, so stop calling it that.",10,28 August 2009,"Halloween II is not a remake of John Carpenter's Halloween 2 and it is a direct sequel to Rob Zombie's Halloween. This movie is a complete re-imagining just as Halloween (2007) was.If you are a TRUE fan of the original Halloween, you will not like this nor Zombie's first attempt because let's face it, who TRULY enjoys remakes of movies that you love? I'm reading that people don't like the repeated stabbing Michael does and the ""grunts"" he makes. Who cares? Michael is a brutal psychopath, he doesn't just stab someone once and call it quits. And the grunting, is it that big of a deal? People make noises, get over it.Zombie seeing his mother, his younger self, and the white horse is what is driving him to kill. In the first movie, he was simply trying to get to Laurie and show her who she is. In this movie, however, the images of his mom and younger self are trying to get Michael to ""reunite"" his family.I'm also reading that people do not like the characters nor their use of profanity. OK so we can't curse in our every day lives? I use the F bomb pretty much every two or three words, it's just the way we are. And Zombie purposely intended on making the characters as annoying as they were because who wants to see someone not scared of death and just take it.I personally feel that the characters, the deaths, etc. are made exactly how they would happen in real life. I understand where people are coming from when they're calling this a suspense movie rather than a horror, but what is horror nowadays if it's not supernatural killers. This movie also does not try to scare you with sudden jumps. Yes they do occur a lot but it's a movie, it's supposed to go down that way.I highly recommend this movie to people who enjoyed Zombie's first Halloween and if you don't care about what he's ""doing"" to Carpenter's Halloween. As I mentioned earlier and as Rob Zombie has mentioned, this movie is a complete re-imagining, not a remake or a sequel. If anyone had a brain you'd realize this in the original when he introduced the younger Michael Myers backstory.",Halloween II
181,mrnunleygo,Deadly dull,1,31 March 2020,"This is a really bad movie. It starts off with a couple of good scenes, then becomes entirely predictable. There are no interesting characters and nobody does anything interesting. It has no suspense, no wit, no irony, no plot twists, no near escapes, nothing. Even the jump scares are too obvious to surprise us. The fantasy element is idiotic. The only good thing about it is that it reminds us how good the original ""Halloween"" movies were.",Halloween II

Gore, trash and lunacy are not making a good horror movie by itself. It still needs some spirit to cook a great and suspenseful film of this ingredients. And trying so, Rob Zombie failed on all levels, cause he could not put his ego back and wanted to tell this sick story! He even found a way to put his wife into this piece of trash, although her acting skills seem to be very limited. Where his first ""re-imagination"" was well done, the sequel is a complete failure.

In this movie, precisely that happens. Expectations fulfilled.But in this movie, Rob Zombie creates a world of carnivalesque violence. He also creates (in my opinion) a believable character in Laurie Strode, if not a likable one. Following the events of the first film, Laurie now suffers nightmares and crippling anxiety attacks.YES there are some clichés but on the whole, I found this film to be a great slasher flick with the unique atmosphere of insanity that Rob Zombie creates. I think it is very telling that the girls are dressed up as Rocky Horror characters for the second half of the film.In conclusion: this is one of the best horror sequels I've ever seen.",Halloween II

185,RebelXStar,"Hey, world! Guess what. I'm Michael Myers' sister! I'm so f*****",2,17 February 2017,"So, Rob Zombie's Halloween II starts out much the same as the sequel to the original in that it picks up on the same night as the previous movie, with Laurie Strode wandering the streets in a state of shock after having attacked and been attacked by her long lost sibling, serial killer Michael Myers.She is promptly whisked to hospital, along with best friend Annie, who also survived her attack, and stitched backed together again.In the meantime, as Michael's seemingly dead body is taken away to the morgue the vehicle crashes and he awakens. He tracks Laurie to the hospital and proceeds to slash his way through the hospital staff in a bid to get to her. Just as Michael zeros in on Laurie and it seems as though he will succeed in killing her, the movie then abruptly cuts to two years later, where Michael's body is missing and Laurie, struggling to cope with what has happened to her, awakens from a nightmare.And that's where the similarity with the 1981 movie begins and ends. Which is fine - it's not like the sequel to the original Halloween is some untouchable classic - and we see that Laurie has basically turned into what she would have become had she grown up in her original family; foul-mouthed, greasy, grungy, unpleasant, whiny, bitter and angry.Her anguish is understandable of course, but when she is even angry and mean towards Annie and father, who take her in and let her live with them after Laurie's adoptive parents were slaughtered in the first movie, and raging at her therapist she is a very exhausting character to root for and sympathise with; and one of the strengths of the original movie (and even the sequels) was the likability of it's heroine(s) - even poor, tragic Jamie Lloyd who was stalked by Michael Myers from the age of eight, abducted into a cult at age nine and gave birth to her uncle's baby showed more resilience and less self-pity than Zombie's Laurie Strode.During the course of the movie, thanks to Dr. Loomis (now a selfish, fame chasing, money hungry pseudo-celebrity) who wrote a book on Michael Myers, she learns of her true identity as Angel Myers - Michael's estranged baby sister. She breaks down at the revelation and in an effort to escape her pain, she goes out and parties the night away on Halloween night, with disastrous consequences for her and her friends, as unbeknown to them, Michael is very much alive and eager to finish what he started. To give credit where it's due, this does present a very interesting premise; is it possible to change your fate? Can you escape who you were always destined to be? Is tragedy rooted in your DNA?Unfortunately, all of this is COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED by Zombie's reliance on extreme gore, violence, mean-spiritedness, insistence on making every other word an 'F' bomb and completely bizarre and odd plot choices.For instance, were the first twenty four minutes of the movie real? A dream? And if it was real, how did Laurie escape? Who knows? The movie never explains.What was the point of Michael's 'white horse' visions of his mother? Was there a point? Or was it just an extremely forced way of giving Zombie's wife, Sherie Moon, a role in the movie?What was the point of showing Michael traipsing across the countryside as an unmasked, hairy, dishevelled hobo? Most of the murders he commits during these scenes are completely unnecessary and gratuitous, it lessens the impact when he finally shows up on Halloween night knowing he's just been trawling through fields eating dogs and killing rednecks (imagine how terrifying and impactful it would have been if he had just appeared without any warning or explanation!) and his physical appearance just looks like a lame attempt from Zombie to insert his own image into Michael.And don't even get me started on Loomis, who in the original movies and sequels was always a worthy adversary to Michael - the 'woodcutter' to Michael's 'big, bad wolf' if you will - is now just a narcissistic, selfish jerk.",Halloween II
186,TomConnors,What Happened?,5,27 December 2009,"I have to say first off of all the remakes of the classic 70's-80's horror icon's, Rob Zombie's ""vision"" of ""Halloween"" was the best of the bunch. I was very disappointed by ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and even more sickened by ""Friday the 13th""-at the very least Zombie's ""Halloween"" was handled with care, and in it's own way-stood on it's own apart from John Carpenter's classic.Zombie's ""Halloween II"" is a mess, being Zombie's 4th film, I was very upset with the direction he took with this film. I will go into the few things i liked before i go into all the things that were just wrong with this movie. First, I felt the actress playing Laurie did a much better job here, she was one of the few actors from the first film I wasn't too thrilled with, but she does much better here. The story went it's own unique direction, giving the characters a lot more punch than the first film- which had crammed so much into a running time not much different than the original. All the new arcs were interesting and well played out. Except for 1.2 of the people in the movie, I felt that it was the right way to portray the returning characters.I won't go into much detail on the 1.2 characters-just know that 1 is Michael and one of the .2 is his mom, you will see what i mean if you actually torture yourself with this mess. The problems came in with the center piece of the film, Michael, and this whole thing with his mom. the other .2 is young Michael and first off-I don't care if the kid who played young Michael is 3 feet taller than Sherry Moon Zombie-the new kid is HORRIBLE. Beyond that, the whole reason for young Michael, and Michael's mother returning is the pit-fall of what could have been a decent sequel. (You can do ONE movie without her Mr. Zombie!) I won't go into much detail for fear of spoiling this drivel, but let's just say Zombie must have just wanted to turn Micheal into Jason Vorhees...Add in the fact that Zombie decided to go to 1:85.1 aspect over 2:40.1 like the first film, bothers me. I am against changing a films aspect ratio like that for no apparent reason, especially when a film screams out to be opened up and given room to breathe in a beautiful Panavision landscape. All in all I wish i could have liked this movie, I tried so hard. The film starts out well enough, giving us a tease of what a true remake of ""Halloween II (1981)"" Zombie-style would be like. Only young Michael and his Mother ruin this film. The whole idea goes farther and farther down hill as the climax is more of a spiraling vortex into more crap.",Halloween II
187,weronews,Halloween and Zombies Don't Mix,2,15 March 2010,"More trick than treat, this redundant follow-up to Rob Zombie's decent 2007 remake of John Carpenter's cheapo cult fave stumbles onto the tacky scene, lingering there like a breath of decayed air. Michael Myers doesn't seem to have a clue why he was brought back to life, and even his kills are dull; there is no rhyme or reason for ghostly apparitions (horse included) other than Sheri Moon Zombie (aka Mrs. Zombie) can cash a paycheck; and at any given time, Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis seems one egg yolk short of a fruitcake. Somewhere in the hereafter, Donald Pleasence is shedding a tear. Longs to be realistic and artsy, but comes off an interminable mess.",Halloween II

189,carolinephillips-47427,An underrated study of mental illness,8,12 March 2017,"I hated Rob Zombie's first attempt at a Halloween film. I mean, I REALLY hated it. It felt like 3 movies in one, but none of them were developed enough to be satisfying. It was filled with scummy characters, constant useless f-bombs to seem ""edgy"", zero suspense, and as many serial killer childhood clichés as you can dream of.I had no desire to see Zombie's sequel until last night when I was staring at my Halloween Blu-Ray box set and felt like I needed to give it a chance. Boy, was I glad I did.While Zombie felt confused and pulled in too many directions in his first Halloween film, Halloween II feels far more assured, unique and from the heart. Granted, it's not a perfect film - it has far too many dream sequences, the ghost mom/little Michael/white horse stuff serves no purpose, and most of the death scenes feel shoehorned in just so they can still call this a horror film - but there's a lot to love.The central family unit of Laurie, Annie, and her father is a welcome change of pace from the first film. These feel like real people trying to cope with the horrors of Halloweens past and doing the best job they can to keep sane.Laurie has gone from annoyingly perky and ADD to withdrawn, angry, and borderline goth. Annie, who was the brash life of the party in the first film, has been reduced to a terrified, neurotic shut in. Their relationship is one of the film's strong suits and I wish the studio and/or Zombie had felt secure enough to make this the focal point of the film, because it's really strong.Dr. Loomis has now become a fame-hungry ass and it takes a victim's father pulling a gun on him at a book signing (one of the best scenes in the film) to jolt him back to reality.Dispensed in between scenes of family drama and angst are several uninteresting and suspense-free kill scenes (usually of rednecks, strippers, and other sleazy types.) Honestly, they contribute nothing and feel like afterthoughts or studio-mandated reshoots.The film's opening ends up being a truly terrifying and intense homage to the original Halloween II featuring a bruised and battered Laurie running down deserted hospital corridors.Maybe I enjoyed this film for what could have been instead of what it is, but there's a lot of really interesting and daring things here that people seem to have missed out on and that's really a shame. Give it a watch and make up your own mind.",Halloween II
190,alexhenderson-11711,LOVED IT,10,15 March 2019,"I was able to find the Theatrical Version of this movie, and I loved it so much more, than when I saw the Directors cut. The movie to me isn't meant to be a Masterpiece, but just a suspenseful, fun and Violent Slasher film, I Mean, isn't that what a Slasher film is? Gory, disturbing and wild fun? I think so, give this a watch if you haven't already.",Halloween II
191,omahonyjason,Rent the 1978 original - This is Brutal!,3,12 October 2009,"There was a time when Halloween was inextricably linked to Michael Myers. He was as terrifying as the holiday and when the original HALLOWEEN came out, way back in 1978, he scared the bejesus out of people. In the over 30 years since then Halloween has become the second biggest holiday of the year. Let me say that again – Halloween is the second biggest holiday of the year. People spend more money at Halloween then at any other time of the year, except Christmas. And so you can hardly blame movie studios for trying to cash in.So I can forgive them for digging up Michael Myers and putting out another Halloween movie, which they did in 2007. And I can forgive Rob Zombie for directing it. I can even forgive people for going to see it. What I can't forgive, however, is Zombie's latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise.According to the director, he was exhausted after the first remake. ""When I finished the first Halloween, I was burnt out, exhausted and never wanted to hear the words 'Michael Myers' again,"" said Zombie. ""But I feel that way after I finish anything that's exhausting."" He initially relinquished the responsibility but, ultimately, affection for the characters made him rethink his decision. ""I started getting possessive about it. That's when it became something I wanted to do. It was my Michael Myers, my Laurie Strode and my world. I didn't want someone else taking charge of it."" So both Zombie and Michael Myers are back. Again. And it's an awful pity. For some unknown reason Rob Zombie's first HALLOWEEN was something of a hit – it grossed almost $80 million at the worldwide box office, which isn't a fortune in film terms, but it's not a bad return on a movie that cost less than $20 million to make.Rob Zombie's H2 picks up at the exact moment that his first HALLOWEEN stopped and it follows the aftermath of Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) murderous rampage through the eyes of heroine Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor Compton).In this latest film, Michael Meyers has returned home to sleepy Haddonfield, Illinois to take care of some unfinished family business. Unleashing a trail of terror, Myers stops at nothing to bring closure to the secrets of his twisted past. But the town's got unlikely new heroes, if only they can stay alive long enough to stop the unstoppable.This latest is a snooze fest unless, of course, you like particularly incoherent films about people killing other people in particularly brutal ways. It's an insult to anyone that liked John Carpenter's brilliant original. If you want to watch a Halloween movie then I suggest you go rent his!",Halloween II
192,rhaynes1974,Finest horror film of 2009,10,25 January 2010,"Undoubtedly the finest example of true gut wrenching horror in 2009. No popcorn, balls galore and no gratuitous violence serve to make Zombie my new official favourite genre director, which is no mean feat since the man has only made four commercially released films so far, but he is, nothing short of a genius, We bow down to you, Rob, please continue to take us on this wild genre bending roller-coaster ride of mind blowing visual style and directing chops that quite frankly would even make the greats like Carpenter and Craven envy.I realise I'm gushing, but the emotional intensity of this film left me speechless.It's not often one is brought to tears by a death scene in a, what should essentially be another stupid slasher picture, but the death of one character in this film left me sobbing like a schoolgirl watching The Notebook, that's the level of emotional intensity he brings to this picture.respect respect respect A Rob who happens to be a Rob fan :)",Halloween II
193,Saturnfly,A good film for the Halloween series.,7,23 April 2011,"This wasn't at all like a Halloween sequel, in a sense it was more personal and contained less Hollywood cliché's which more often than not, plague the horror genre.Of course, one could say this film was just another cliché, but it had depth to it, and character development and a story one could relate to or become repulsed by. The first half hour or so gives you the impression the movie is going to be another about some girl running away screaming from some masked character wielding a sharp object, conveniently slipping over and eventually perishing at the hands of this lunatic.Zombie drags things out, something which I admire him for, he doesn't rush his plot to reach a dead-line, he takes his time to polish his art, because lets face it, it's going to be apart of his reputation for the rest of his career.The only downsides for me, was the wild nature of the main character, I couldn't sympathize with her all that well as she was always doing something which made her annoying, bluntly put.I was also a little unsure of the unmasking of MM, his face has always been behind someone else's that it was kind of difficult to grasp that he was actually a human being, and not just a character. But in a way it works, but it is also unrealistic, as how can a human being get shot in the head and walk miles and miles to find his young sister? Either way, a good, entertaining horror flick. Not as many jump in your seat moments, but I appreciate Zombie's style and his ability to create a film which is art and not just another Hollywood Cliché.",Halloween II

195,lndkramer,Why?,4,19 September 2009,"OK, so I had a lot of beef with this new Halloween. I'm not going to whine about it, I'll just start listing the cons of this film. -Why does the story take place in Illinois but everyone in the movie is a redneck with a pickup truck and a dog in the back? -The originals took place in the suburbs, not in hicksville where the houses are miles away from each other (Michael hikes it through miles of farmland) -Dr. Loomis is a huuuge dick until the last 2 minutes of the movie. He's supposed to be the hero! We root for him. Without him there's no one else to like except maybe the sheriff. -Michael Myers has to kill everything he comes in contact with. This isn't necessarily wrong but he does everything with way too much passion, like he planned it all out. It was over violent as far as Michael Myers movies go. He even makes noise while hacking people apart. He never even talked before but now they show him talking as a kid like he was perfectly normal. -Rob Zombie copied off of the Friday the 13th movies with the visions of the mother. Not to mention Psycho. Big ripoff. -Everyone feels the need to antagonize the 7 foot guy walking through the streets with his hood up. Need I say more?Rob Zombie put no original thought into this movie. It's totally clichéd and butchered the Michael Myers story to pieces. On top of all that, I can't stand the redneck theme that Zombie has added to the whole story. The movie moved along OK, but didn't get interesting until the last twenty minutes or so. No need to waste your time, unless B movie horror is what you're in the mood for.",Halloween II
196,Marjeez,Well-Crafted Fantasy Horror,4,23 July 2010,"Now fantasized, Halloween II proves that Rob Zombie never understood this franchise. Michael Myers is transformed into a psychotic but weak pansy. The aspect that made Michael so horrifying in past Halloween films was the fact that viewers hadn't a clue of what was going through Michael's head (couldn't see his face either)and the unpredictability factor he had. What does the viewer receive instead? A superman-like Michael that can magically flip over cars and for some reason sees his mom and his young self dressed in white, and horses. My prediction is Zombie loves his vivid imagery and uses this gimmick to make himself happy but leaves the audience annoyed. It's a cross between House of 1000 Corpses and his first Halloween film. I thought that, since this is a Halloween film, it should have been more claustrophobic by keeping the action in one town or area, but it goes all over the place; from a hospital to a farm. The overly-bleak and dark world (not to mention everyone says the 'F' word fifty times) makes it hard to feel any sympathy for the victims. Zombie tried to make this film somewhat emotional but failed. The main reason I dislike this movie though is the fact that Zombie did the unthinkable and actually showed Michael's face. Not only is that a huge no-no, but Michael looks like a normal person. He was a bit cute looking like Man from 'The Road'. He was huggable for god's sakes.Now for the good. Zombie knows how to direct a horror film. The directorial effort is quiet outstanding and I applaud Zombie for his work. He knows how to create real stabbing motions and sounds that will make you feel queasy. The movie has a great beginning and ending and is cinematic throughout. Halloween II is an unmemorable disappointment for fans of the franchise but it's also an entertaining, gory and cinematic horror flick that might be worth viewing for those Zombie fans.",Halloween II
197,hoju_31,ack,2,5 March 2010,"I'm thinking it's a bad sign when shortly after the movie begins, you are wishing death upon the main protagonist and that feeling grows until it finally happens. She couldn't have been made to be less likable unless it was revealed that she was somehow committing the murders herself after a hefty dose of Human Growth Hormone. I have a tip for Rob Zombie: Don't create pointless side characters for the expressed purpose of casting your wife. Also, making Michael Meyers a grizzled hobo isn't helping matters either. I get that Meyers is crazy and large, but Zombie makes it a point to constantly remind us that he is still in fact human. That being said, no person can take multiple blows from a baseball bat to the spine and head seemingly unharmed. You need to choose whether he's a person, or he's not, Zombie. You can't have both.",Halloween II

Because what a convoluted cliché ridden mess of a film H2 truly is. I thought RZ's Halloween was a shameless bastardization of the MM character but, that film still had some decent moments in it. But H2, outside of the brutality had really nothing going for it. Multiple Laurie dream sequences, weird ass white horse & mommy moments, Michael looking like Grizzly Adams, Dr. Loomis going from a concerned, professional psychiatrist in the 1st film to a self absorbed, money grubbing whore with no conscience, Michael's body missing for 2 full years & yet nobody seemed concerned? When the film started out, I thought, ""hey this might be pretty decent afterall"" with everybody getting hacked to $hit, a body pit filled with butchered hospital staff & Laurie trying to escape etc.. just like in the original H2. But alas, it all went downhill FAST after that (Weird Al-in a horror film?? C'Mon!!). Just like in the first film, I didn't enjoy or care for the characters & Loomis was the least likable. Michael Myers might as well have been Jason Vorhees for all intents & purposes, the ending was terrible & lastly, I never ever felt like I was watching a Halloween film.

201,maisyskinner,Brutal Study of PTSD,6,11 October 2021,"Halloween II picks up where the last film left off with Laurie Strode a complete and utter basket case. She lashes out at her friends, her psychiatrist, and anyone else in her way. To make matters worse, Dr. Loomis has just released a new tell-all book about the events of the last film, revealing that Laurie is actually Michael Myers' sister which sends her into an even deeper depression as the anniversary rolls around and Michael returns to carve up a new batch of victims.Writer/director Rob Zombie deserves a massive amount of credit for doing his own thing here. Whereas his first film felt like a less effective paint by numbers remake of John Carpenter's film with just a few of his own flourishes poking through, his sequel is one of the more interesting installments in the series.There's a lot in this film that feels forced or out of place like most scenes with Michael Myers visiting with visions of his mother, his younger self, and a random white horse, but the dramatic moments between survivors Laurie, Annie, and Annie's father are heartbreaking and played with an unbearable amount of realism.",Halloween II
202,johnfanning-53228,Ridiculous,4,10 August 2021,"As someone who enjoyed the Rob Zombie reboot, I thought his ""stab"" at the sequel would be as enjoyable. It was not.This film was one big turd burger that could only be swallowed down with the mustard Tyler Mane provided as Michael Myer's. His size makes him one of the most menacing actors to ever put on the Shatner mask, and he continues to deliver as the mute, rage-filled psycopath terrorizing Haddonfield.Aside from that, watching this movie gave me the feeling that it was created with the sole purpose of giving Sherrie Moon Zombie a job. She is brought back as a ghost or hallucination throughout the film, which makes zero sense and was unnecessary for this movie. It was as if Rob Zombie did not feel he could center the plot around the tried and true formula of Michael Myers going berserker mode on anyone that crosses his path in his quest to reunite/kill his sister.I am not complaining about his wife's casting because I think she is a terrible actress or anything, but her character met her demise in the first one as a grieving mother over the loss of her daughter (and others) at the hands of her baby boy. That was a perfect end and a believable end. But trying to make give a supernatural feel to this franchise with her ghostly presence is one of the most absurd, asinine, and unnecessary plot points in any movie ever. The only justification I could come up with for why he created a role for her character to return is simply because she's his wife and I guess he cannot make a movie without giving her a role with significant screen time.",Halloween II
203,ibanez747,Embarrassing piece of work that was hard to watch.,2,30 August 2009,"Halloween II is simply one of the worst sequels/remakes I have ever seen. Rob Zombie had a very simple and successful template to work off of and still his version embodied all of the bad aspects of his prior work. The movie writing felt rushed and thus cheap. The overall way the story was told was thoughtless.The one aspect that was incredibly annoying was the metaphor of the white horse symbolizing rage. He did this to write his wife into this movie. Never have I seen a more deliberate stretch of a story just to incorporate a meaningless character. Also Zombie did NOT use the classic piano music or any of past pieces that defined this movie. Are you kidding me??? How can you have Halloween and not use this piece of classic music in a killing sequence?? That's not unique. That's not Zombie ""putting his personal touch"" on the movie. That's just plain stupid! Everything that made this series great from the music, the innocence of protagonists like Laurie Strode and Dr. Loomis, the mask to the haunting sequences were gone. It was stripped of what made Halloween great.All that remained was a 7-foot bearded man who occasionally wore a white mask with the mentality of a 7 year old following his dead mother with a white horse roaming around killing people. I think about how stupid that is and think how could Dimension allow this to leave the cutting room floor.I saw it this weekend on a Saturday night at 8pm. It was a really pathetic draw, ~15 to 16 people in the whole theater. I hope that the financial failure of this movie will put to rest this embarrassing run of remaking the Halloween series.",Halloween II
204,thefilmguy7,Halloween rotten candy,3,14 January 2010,"I knew that this film was probably going to be bad but I didn't know that it was going to be terrible. I grew up with the original Halloween and to this day I still enjoy the first two films. I even enjoyed Rob Zombie's first Halloween film. It was interesting to see the same story told under a different light. I enjoyed the psycho analysis for Michael Myers. I had the feeling any sequel to that would be bad but I underestimated how much Zombie was capable of creating true crap. The film has nothing redeeming about it except maybe one or two cinematography techniques that I thought were interesting. Otherwise everything totally missed the mark. The screenplay screamed of formula and convention. Every attempted scare could be seen coming from a mile away. This film offers nothing new to the genera. What was up with wasting the first 20 minutes of the film on a dream sequence? True there are other horror films that have little nightmare sequences but they don't last 20 minutes. It was just a total waste of time. And don't get me start on possibly the weakest finale that I have ever seen for this series.Zombie also showed a total disregard with honoring the characters of Halloween. Loomis, who is almost as iconic to the series as Myers is, was totally mishandled. The characters was twisted into a ego maniac who only cared about himself, money, and fame. This resembles nothing of the man we were introduced to in the last film who was willing to give his life to save Laurie. Also his stupid subplot was just a rip off of Courtney Cox's subplot in Scream 2 of writing a book and making a profit from the events of the first film. They did a terrible job of finding a way to bring Loomis subplot into the main plot. His weakly written want to redeem himself didn't add up and was totally pointless in the end. Laurie was also terribly handled in this film. She was so over the top and came across more annoying than sympathetic. There were times where I actually wanted her character to die and that is something you should never want your audience to feel. It is essential in horror films that you relate to the lead character in danger or you won't fear for them. Michael Myers himself was handled with total disrespect as well. He came across more like a giant crack head than anything else. I don't know why Zombie thinks that making Myers a giant with super human strength makes him more scary. It puts the film into a realm that you can't totally connect to because you know it doesn't follow the rules of real life. It almost becomes more like a comic book. Real monsters don't have to be huge to be scary. I think Anthony Hopkins showed all of us that with Hannibal. I really hope that the series ends with this film but knowing the greedy suites of Hollywood, it's probably just the beginning. Well they certainly aren't getting my money again next time around. I don't waste my time with throw away films like this.",Halloween II
205,funnygy,If you thought the first one was bad...,1,30 August 2009,"I was one of the eight or so people on the planet who actually liked Rob Zombie's redo of ""Halloween"" when it came out two years ago, and I was hoping to see more of what made that entry so good in this follow-up. Instead, however, Zombie seems to have done in the sequel what a lot of people said he did wrong in the first one. ""Halloween II"" or ""H2"" is quite simply a piece of undercooked, overproduced and barely coherent trash.In one respect, the film brings to mind another cult horror sequel, George Romero's ""Day of the Dead."" As in that movie, there's seemingly no one to root for in ""Halloween 2."" Everyone here is a foul-mouthed, unpleasant cad who uses the f-word more than a drunken sailor. Granted, as in ""Day"", these characters have lived through hell and don't have a lot to be happy about, but if the audience doesn't care if a character lives or dies (or even worse, WANTS them to die) then you don't have much of a horror movie. Take a look at our ""heroes"" this time around - seemingly Sheriff Brackett, his daughter Annie, and of course Laurie Strode, who is living with them now. Annie has turned into a finger-wagging health nut, Laurie is a vegetarian who complains about the sheriff eating ""rotting flesh"" (i.e. pepperoni) on his pizza, and the sheriff himself is... well, just kinda dumb, like a sitcom dad.And then there's Dr. Loomis, who just goes all wrong this time. It's not even worth getting into. Now, a primary theme of the movie (as in the first one) is that Laurie is Michael's sister, which he knows but she doesn't. While I never cared for this storyline in the original ""Halloween"" series (to me it seemed like a cheap gimmick thought up to give Michael a reason to keep coming back), I thought it held some promise in the remake. In Michael's mind, Laurie is his last hope of getting his family back to the way it was. But Michael's attempt at getting her back (by slaughtering everyone she cares about) has essentially turned her into the type of cynical, jaded person he was trying to get away from. Thus, Laurie has started to become more like Michael, and now the two have a sort of telepathic bond (similar to the one between Michael and Jamie in ""Halloween 5""). Unfortunately, with the film's frenzied editing, all this gets lost in the shuffle. Apparently it doesn't bother Laurie that she just starts throwing up for no reason, which the audience knows is because Michael is eating a raw dead animal. We just jump to the next scene and move on.Cheap tricks like that are why ""Halloween II"" is a big mess. Zombie had good intentions for this sequel just like he did for the first film. But this time, he's gotten overwhelmed with startle scares, incredible lapses in logic, and all the other tired genre staples we've seen in a million other slasher films. On the way home from the theater, my wife said to me, ""Maybe you should just try to enjoy the scares and not look for anything deep."" But the whole point of remaking ""Halloween"" was to add something deeper to it; if there isn't anything new, why do we even need these remakes? Why don't we just watch the originals that did it so well when the genre was still fresh? And why doesn't Hollywood try to do something new, instead of giving us the same old same old with a new coat of gloss and seizure-inducing editing?If you thought the first ""Halloween"" was bad, you will absolutely hate ""Halloween II."" Trust me.",Halloween II
206,Hollywoodrulez,A well made film,8,26 June 2010,"Having not seen the first Halloween 2 by John carpenter. I didn't know what to expect from this version. I did see the very first Halloween with Jamie lee Curtis. The only things I found disappointing about this version was the amount of clichés rob decided to use. On the other hand this had a lot of great shots to make up for that the shots were complimented by very nice lighting. One type of shot used a lot in this film is a master shot where rob has put the camera on the ground at a rather long distance from the subject and then had a light at the other end of the shot behind the subject and I thought that worked rather well. The story was good but I didn't like how Lorie ended up being Micheal's sister. Cuz in the original Micheal kills his sister so that was a little out of place. Another compliment to the acting in this film it was dramatic,filled with trauma and very well pulled off. A well made film.",Halloween II
207,brennenearl,Misunderstood,8,18 January 2019,Theatrical: This movie is very underrated I can understand why people wouldn't like it. But I love it. The cinematography is great. The acting is strong. Michael is very brutal in this movie. My one problem with this movie is the white horse. Overall I think it's a misunderstood movieDirector's cut: The director's cut of this movie is awful. My one pro is Annies death it's a very sad scene and it's done better in the director's cut. The rest are cons I can't stand Laurie. I hate how it talks more about the white horse. Dr. Loomis is even worse in this version. The ending is dumb. Overall I if buy this movie make sure to buy the theatrical cut.,Halloween II
208,baileygiannini,TOTAL CRAP!!!!!!!!!!,1,30 June 2018,"Worse than the first one for sure. Rob Zombie completely destroys Michael Myers and the Halloween storyline in his 2009 sequel to his remake of Halloween back in 2007. Total garbage and if I had known what this movie was going to be, I would've never bought it on DVD. I was fourteen at the time of its' release, I feel pretty stupid the fact that I gave Rob Zombie money. Stay clear of this one at all costs, you'll end up wasting time, when you could've seen a film worth your time. I hate everything about this movie, there's one scene that's more suited for a heavy metal music video than a motion picture. I didn't like the fact that Zombie dressed him up in a hood. He makes Michael Myers have more of a human personality in this one. The film is terrible from beginning to the end. The shooting style is to gritty, a graphic blood bath. Once again Rob Zombie goes over the top with blood and guts, much worse than his 2007 remake, to try to scare his audience. I'm a huge fan of his music, After I saw the trailer for his newer film, 31, I can definitely say, Zombie, you're not the filmmaking type, it's either two options, 1. Take filmmaking classes or 2. Stop making movies and leave it to the filmmakers who know what they're doing. Sorry everybody, it's just sad to see everyone waste their money on this piece of trash he calls an amazing horror film. Also note that Rob Zombie's visions of creative art form, arent's working for him in his movies.For an overall rating I give Halloween II (2009)A 1/2 star.",Halloween II
209,mtess-1,This Movie Is Garbage and I Loved the Originals,1,8 April 2010,"Okay, I was into the whole Rob Zombie thing years ago when it was fresh, new and angry. I am referring of course to his music. I even managed to sit through the first half of Zombie's original Halloween remake and somewhat enjoyed the better, second half. I waited eagerly and with higher hopes for Zombie's Halloween 2,expecting it to be far better than the first for some reason. Well, within just thirty minutes this movie began to stink.The lead actress made me want to turn off the television: Scout Taylor-Compton was an over-the-top travesty of plastic emotions who spent most of the film screaming. I ""muted"" the volume for most of her later exhibitions of teenage lunacy. Zombie has taken a classic and used its name and character make another torture-porn piece of junk. I don't believe he even truly understands the story, tension or magic of the original series/character. Sure there is a ton of violence here, but without the mystery or sense of dread present in the originals. Zombie's Michael Myers is a buffoon tromping about destroyed things, and is without any aura of supernatural wonder. Worst of all, Dr. Loomis has been completely transformed into, well, an arsehole. The character if Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is a CLASSIC of cinema and Zombie really crossed a line messing with this character. It was very hard to find anything good in this film when I realized this had been done. You can't mess with the Loomis! It saddens me that kids today want more of this rehashed filth. It's all about flash and glam and blood and repeat. No story, tension, intelligent dialogue or mood-enhancing cinematography was present in this movie whatsoever. And no, the ""dream"" sequences do not count - I think someone was high or drunk and decided to throw these in to make it feel more sincere. His target audience is shamefully obvious: angry teenagers who can not see past blatant grabs at their cash and impressionable minds: What purpose was the naked chick serving as she was running around screaming? Oh yeah, she was naked and most of your ticket sales are to 14 year old guys. Next, you'd have us believe a girl who had been through everything Laurie Strode had been through would be sleeping beneath posters of Manson and Alice Cooper and acting like a snotty outcast of Evanescence? Are you forgetting that the hormonally imbalanced teens who act out like this are the ones who have never had anything truly bad happen to them? A girl like Laurie Strode would not be immersing herself in the world of Rob Zombie any more than a war veteran would be immersing himself in everything combat related. Next time let someone ELSE take care of writing the story and stick to the camera-work. I LOVED the original Halloween films. I collect everything Michael Myers. Yet it STILL took me three sittings on different days to finish watching this movie because it was just that hard to watch someone rape a classic for his own financial gain. This is NOT a Halloween movie in anything but name.",Halloween II
210,stiff5,Better Than Expected.,7,30 August 2009,"Last night I went to the 10:30 showing of Rob Zombie's Halloween 2. A few days before I had read all of the terrible reviews and went in with lower expectations. Let's just say, I'm glad I did. Just about everyone is saying this, but the hospital scene in the beginning was pure brilliance. I was very surprised about that. I was also surprised how damn brutal this film was. I don't know what the MPAA was thinking, but H2 definitely does NOT stray away from the excessive brutal violence.What I liked about Halloween 2 was that Rob definitely wasn't afraid to make this his own vision. From all the crap that he'd be getting, it didn't follow your normal Hollywood teen slasher flick. I really admire that. I also thought the acting was very good. I particularly liked Brad Dourif, Danielle Harris, and Scout Taylor-Compton. When I had read in an interview where Scout had been saying that H2 literally drained all of her energy out, she wasn't kidding. Her performance is raw and very real.Compared to Rob's first attempt at Halloween, H2 is more suspenseful and intense. This one had a more gritty uncomfortable feel to it. Definitely more like a Rob Zombie film. That is why I think Halloween 2 is better than Rob's first Halloween. With Halloween, Rob had to stay closer to the original Halloween, and Rob can't really do that. Two very different styles that only clash when you try to create a happy medium. I enjoyed the first Halloween, but some parts just felt like a jumbled mess. It was mostly decent.I did like H2 better, but the film had some serious flaws. For one, turning Loomis into a complete douche was a definite no no. Loomis is an incredible character within the Halloween franchise. In this film, he's nothing special here. Loomis is pointless, and when he quickly shows up at the end to try to make things better, it completely fails, and when he gets killed off, I had absolutely no sympathy. Another thing that got me a tad annoyed was the Deborah Myers/Young Michael Myers part of the story. I really really tried to accept the fact that this is Zombie's vision and however demented it may be, the Michael visions would be unique and compelling. I was alright with the majority of it, but Sheri Moon Zombie and the new kid who plays young Michael Myers were terrible. As a whole though, I did like the concept. There were also a few problems with a few random killings that had rarely any significance.In all, I did enjoy H2. I didn't love it, but I thought it would be way worse. The intense dramatic feel added along with a few really great kills make this a worthy Zombie film. Then again, I had known going in that this would be VERY different from your regular Halloween film. This one had guts and I liked that. H2 really is a roller-coaster ride. The emotion in this film just screams out to you and grabs you in. The ending was also brilliant. Seeing Laurie Strode walk out with the Myers mask on gave me EXTREME chills. H2 had its pretty big flaws, but the overall product was very intense, heartbreaking, and a worthy entry into the Michael Myers legacy. 8/10",Halloween II
211,evoapollo,One funny movie made me laugh so muc...,2,3 October 2021,Oh wait that's right this is supposed to be a horror movie. So why am I laughing so hard at how stupid it is. Ghost mommy Myers and and a kid ghost of who the adult version is standing literally right next to it. Wouldn't it make more sense to have the sister he murdered be there with the mother? Wtf is up with this movie. I normally am not this critical but I wasted literally 45 minutes watching this steaming pile of manure and my God was rob zombie on meth when he made this? Or was he trying to be some Shakespeare m night Shyamalan garbage director. TAKE NOTE ZOMBIE. WE DONT WANT A COMPLICATED CONFUSING STORY WE WANT TO SEE MICHAEL MYERS MURDER HORNY TEENS. THE FIRST ONE WAS GOOD YOU GOT THAT NAILED BUT THIS ONE? THUMBS DOWN MAN. THUMBS DOWN. Don't direct a movie unless your sure what it's about. It was just a emo-esque filled environment it looks like some edgy teen made it. And you've made some phenomenal movies. I mean the gore was top notch don't get me wrong it's what I'd like to see in a horror movie. But the story was just overall stupid and you had elements of the originals in it like when they gun him down. But why did the lady pick the knife up? Are you trying to say psychopathic behaviors are genetic? Wasn't she his baby sister or something? Are you saying if cop sees any one with weapon they shoot first ask questions later? You didn't say! Instead she's in a white room with her goth mom and a white horse? Wtf I think I'm getting a contact high from your bizarre story. Do better zombie. Really. Do better. Your like a horror icon to me and a metal icon and this is disappointing you'd think an awesome metal iconic musician who's directed horror films who had the pleasure of directing one of the most iconic horror villains out there would give the fans what they want when seeing a slasher film.,Halloween II
212,cdipatri,Rob Zombie Delivers,9,28 August 2009,"I saw the midnight showing last night and was so juiced by the film I couldn't get to sleep until way after 3am. Although this film continues where the first RZ version left off, it really took elements of almost all the original sequels and put them into one big, gory slash fest that was awesome to watch. RZ made Michael absolutely vicious and the killings were in your face and really gross...I LOVED IT. You heard and felt every stab and slash and bringing back Michael's grunting was a particularly effective touch.What really made this film so enjoyable was the use of Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis as comic relief. The movie's violence may have been unbearable for some viewers if this hadn't been cleverly used by RZ who I believe is a master at this genre. Sheri Moon Zombie was again great as Michael's mother. I'm just real sorry they didn't have Daeg Faerch return as young Michael. He was so creepy in the first RZ remake that he would have been perfect for this one.In summary, I'll say that if you are a fan of the Halloween franchise, this is a must see. However, I will warn you that this film is not for the squeamish, but even if you wind up puking up your popcorn and nachos, it's still worth seeing.RZ...you the man!",Halloween II
213,Jothos,"Are we done, letting Rob Zombie ruin movies???? Seriously",1,23 October 2015,"The first Halloween he did sucked ass. It was not scary. He tried to make it cool, not scary. It was not eerie, or creepy, or scary in the least. He doesn't belong directing movies. He's fooled people into thinking he's cool cuz of his name, and his lifestyle, and music, and persona. So people are always like ""Aw yea, Rob Zombie rocks"". But when ya think about it, does he really? The answer is HELL NO. He does not rock, he is not a good director. And his wife is THE WORST ACTRESS in history. And I have never hated an actress more based on her face and facial expressions more than Scout Taylor-Compton. She is SO AWFUL. She is a horrible actress. And please scout, do the world a favor, go into the bathroom, and work on making a facial expression that isn't annoying as hell. I doubt you'll have much luck. Her mouth and crying faces are so irritating. Asside from all that, the script, writing, acting from everyone else, and dialogue in this piece of crap are ridiculous. Rob Zombie, you even made Malcolm McDowell suck in this. And hey, lets be ""different"" and show mike myers' face in this one. And take ALL the fear out of his character whatsoever. !!!!!ROB ZOMBIE.....YOU......ARE.........NOT...........SCARY!!!!!",Halloween II
214,chewbaccawakka,Shameful display.,1,27 February 2013,"What the heck was this film trying to be? I thought it was meant to be a Halloween sequel. I don't blame Rob Zombie for this as he was basically pushed to do a sequel to his remake which was way better than this rubbish. THERE IS ONLY ONE HALLOWEEN 2 THAT IS THE 1981 SEQUEL TO THE CLASSIC ORIGINAL.But hopefully, a new Halloween film that will probably happen in the near future will be an improvement to this terrible excuse for a sequel. I thought Halloween 3 - Season of the Witch was even better than this and that had nothing to do with Michael Myers (as a stand alone film, it's pretty decent) but even as a stand alone film, it sucks. The 1 star is for the death scenes, seriously they are the only worth watching bits of the film (if you can survive going through the other scenes of the film), otherwise this is one of the worst films ever made. Highlander 2 was awful but at least it's watchable for the unintentional comedy it was.",Halloween II
215,GrayedMan,The Dog? Really?,1,7 July 2018,"Killing the dog so brutally was terrible. Doing that and snapping frame into the vegetarian pizza discussion was ridiculous. Was that supposed to suggest meat is meat, whether Michael is eating a dog he murdered or a cop is eating a pepperoni pizza? Seriously? Between the cow getting smashed all over the road, the pot belly pig getting cuddled, and the numerous comments by the annoying girls about adopting a meat-free diet, this movie quickly becomes socially pathetic. But that's all on top of the core of why this is so bad. The very opening scene between the mom and the boy is painful to watch because the acting is so bad. Throughout the movie there are single scenes involving well-recognized actors playing characters you don't get to know or like. The casting was focused on face-dropping, and not on good acting. Classic all-time lovable characters Dr Loomis and Lori Strode are both written to be so annoying that you aren't rooting for them to make it. The one girl curses out and humiliates the poor cop sent to protect her, so the feeling when she's being slaughtered is not one of pity. Why would the filmmaker do that? Why make us not care who lives or dies? So with no one to root for, and so much overdone blood and gore that the movie loses its horror value, it is hard to stay interested at all. Also, just like the over-done blood, the dialogue is so laden with the curses especially the f word, that it alienates you from the writing. I'm not a prude, I curse, but not in every sentence I speak to every person every day. It's used here to cover-up the extremely poor dialogue writing, and because the writer has no idea how normal people converse. Not only was the writer unable to compose dialogue, he was unable to compose a coherent story, which is why we have so many irritating dream sequences to fill in all the huge gaps where there isn't a plot. If you want to make 2 really terrible movies, just go out and make 2 really terrible movies. Why soil the iconic film history legends Halloween and Michael Myers? I never would have taken the time to write a detailed review like this of a random bad movie. I did this in defense of the original Halloween and all its glory.",Halloween II
216,dyl_gon,"Pumpkin men, Weird Al, and a ghost horse; Halloween II is one bizarre movie",7,30 August 2009,"It was quite the dilemma deciding whether Halloween II was a good film or a bad one. One thing is certain: it's a ""weird"" film, undoubtedly the most bizarre major studio release of the year. Rob Zombie's sequel or ""vision"" – as it's being touted – seems to have been envisioned with the aid of various hallucinogenics and mind-altering substances, withering away whatever was left of the original John Carpenter Halloween mythology after Rob Zombie's remake and leaving a nonsensical, uber-violent mess in its wake. This isn't a so-bad-it's-good movie, nor would I call it a just-plain-bad one; this is a so-weird-it's-good movie, a blood-drenched collage of absurdities and irrationality, which like a train wreck (a term some would use to refer to previous Zombie efforts), is hard to look away from. Little of the iconic original Halloween is left here – all that's left is Michael Meyer's mask, which itself is less recognizable beneath the grime and torn pieces – but perhaps it would be foolish to try to match the original masterpiece anyway. Zombie has crafted something entirely different; something quite frankly silly, dumb and, for lack of a more politically correct term, ""retarded"", but nonetheless entertaining, not in spite of, but because of this.Picking up where the remake left off, Halloween II sees Laurie Strode recovering from her ordeal with psychopath Michael Meyers. Mentally-traumatized after both the Halloween day massacre of nearly everyone she knew and her own dispatching of Meyers – by way of shot to the head -, Laurie finds herself dreading the one-year anniversary of the serial killings, plagued with the irrational fear that the deceased Meyers will return to small-town Haddonfield to finish her off. Well, low-and-behold, Meyers is alive, and he makes it his mission to track down Laurie and finish what he started.The general plot outline is as generic as can be, but it's hard to fathom or comprehend the insanity that occurs. Michael Meyers, the original mask-wearing soulless psychopath, the ""pure evil"" murderer, the ""Big Cheese"" of all horror movie villains, has now been transformed into a homeless vagrant who randomly eats dogs. Yep, that's right, he's a hobo that eats dogs now. When a film is remade, one expects some alterations, but this is akin to remaking Indiana Jones and turning him an extraterrestrial who molests children. There is practically no semblance of the original character...and the new ones just messed. As well, Meyer's is followed by his deceased mother, himself in child-form and a gigantic white horse, seemingly all figments of his imagination. Except they interact with Laurie as well...making them ghosts? Except Meyers isn't deceased, so it makes absolutely no sense for there to be a ghost version of him. Maybe Laurie is inexplicably psychic and seeing into Meyer's mind? Or maybe Zombie just ate a few too many shrooms. Either way, this mom-boy-horse trio follows Meyer's around as he kills various victims, instructing him on what to do next. It's as stupid as it sounds.Dr. Loomis has also been changed significantly. The remake hinted at Loomis profiteering slightly off the Meyers incident, but here it has been taken to ridiculous proportions. He's now a prima donna celebrity who travels around in a jet black limo with his publicist, throws hissy fits at reporters and threatens to beat on woman. One sequence has Dr. Loomis appearing on a talk show alongside Weird Al Yankovic, with the famed disc-joker lampooning the doctor and Michael Meyers (making puns about whether this is the same guy who starred in Austin Powers) until Loomis finally explodes with anger on air at the hosts assertion that Meyers is a shark. If it sounds like this has nothing to do with the film, it's because it doesn't. This irrelevance not only pertains to the Weird Al scene, but all of Dr. Loomis's scenes. His entire role is a completely separate, unrelated tangent in which he gallivants around the country promoting his book. For that matter, even Laurie and Michael have about ten minutes in the way of plot. Laurie, up until the last fifteen minutes, never encounters Michael. The near entirety of Halloween II is Michael fighting random people – farmers, strippers, tough-guy scumbags – while Laurie lives her life as per usual.The rest of the film is a compilation of pumpkin people, vans running into cows, ""golden showers"", discussions about fornicating with corpses, and sex with a guy in a wolf costume who sounded suspiciously like Michael Cera. It's weird, undoubtedly convoluted, but in the end it's pretty entertaining. It's punctuated with displays of head smashings, throat slittings, and other displays of excessively graphic violence. Nudity is slightly down from the first one, but there are still several scenes involving bared breasts. In the end, between all the nonsense, gore and nudity, Halloween II is a big-budgeted, toned-down Hollywood stab at a Troma movie. In other words, a pretty fun movie.I'm one of the few who actually enjoyed Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween – a lot. For reasons I won't get into here I enjoyed it immensely, but at the same time I could completely understand why so many disliked it. It took some of the things that made the original Halloween so great in many people's eyes and switched them around completely. Those who despised the first Halloween for that reason will likely loathe this second installment with a passion. However, if one can go into Halloween II not expecting a Halloween movie – or even a reasonably scary horror – they might just have a good time. It's not ""bad"" per say – although it's hard to say what Zombie intended it to be – but it's enjoyable in its bizarreness. Worth checking out if you don't mind Carpenter's story being completely bastardized.Dylan, allhorrorfilms.com",Halloween II
217,medsavingsu,Can we just forget,2,17 October 2021,"That this sequel exists? Probably the worst remake sequel in the books. Rob Zombie needs to quit casting his wife. His need to cast her in every movie completely backfires in this. He practically rewrote the movie plot just to have her star in this garbage, not to mention she's a terrible actress. There wouldve been no need for her and the alter storyline for it in this movie at all. If he wouldn't had went a different direction 20 minutes in just to include her storyline he probably couldve pulled off a decent sequel.",Halloween II
218,namideo,"Innovative, yet contrived, and ultimately unnecessary.",4,19 September 2010,"Or as Sam Loomis would say, ""that's an oxymoron."" Overall, I wasn't really a fan of this movie, but it was, let's say...interesting, at least for a slasher film. It's a worthy addition to what is otherwise a pretty lackluster series. It should be stated however, that outside the first film, I'm not a particular fan of this series. Yet, for some reason, beyond my own comprehension, I keep coming back.First off, I liked this movie much more than the one from 2007. Zombie improves on several aspects that had me cringing before, namely, the whole prequel concept, which in my opinion did not work at all and even seemed to contradict itself. This was a more traditional Halloween movie, with Michael Myers simply stalking his prey rather than all the hogwash explaining why he is the way he is. Zombie simply expands on the formula.It's two years later, Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis, both of whom died in the previous movie, return with no explanation whatsoever as to how they survived...but it's not the first time this has happened. Anyway, the killer is wandering the earth, or something, while Lorie Strode still has nightmares from the events in the first film. She's seeing a psychiatrist and trying to achieve some sort of balance in her life, but slowly ends up loosing her own mind from grief and paranoia and a strong addiction to an excess of alcohol and narcotics, which she uses to suppress sociopathic tendencies that creep their way into her mind from her past encounter combined with the realization that she shares a genetic connection to her stalker. She's afraid of her own identity and what she has the potential to become, and whether or not her psychological journey is a success or failure is up to the viewer, assuming the viewer even cares. Meanwhile, Michael Myers has inner demons that haunt him as well, this being really the first film in the series to show us what exactly it is that goes on inside this monster's head, but doesn't quite explain what compels him to act the way he does, or why he feels the need to keep stabbing people even after they're already FUBR-ed. By the way, this film seemed to have an excess of blood and gore in it to the point where if a character stubbed their toe, I'd expect red corn syrup to come spewing out of their foot.One thing I found interesting was the humanizing of Michael Myers. We're given a glimpse into what is life is like in between Halloweens...how he eats, where he sleeps, etc. Although, John Carpenter seemed to portray the character as more of a force, not a man, and the frailties that Zombie bestows on our slasher anti-hero would best be suited more for a character who is a little more human, like Leatherface or Jason Voorhees. Which brings me to another point...none of the characters in these remakes are the same people that they were in the original films. They've all been completely transformed and re-imagined, which to some may seem sacrilegious, but to others, perhaps a more practical direction to go with the series. In a way, I praise Zombie for putting his own spin on the story, as opposed to working within the confines of John Carpenter's original film, but I can't help but criticize these remakes as an impractical subject for such experimentation. It's a new direction for a film that didn't need to be made. At this point, Zombie may as well have just made his own movie with his own characters.Also, I don't feel like the whole death metal atmosphere is appropriate but being Rob Zombie's interpretation, I can't be too surprised. The problem is, it's a film that, at times, looks like it was made by a rock star, not a filmmaker. All things considered, this is the best effort I've seen from Zombie so far.On a side note, I strongly object to the idea of having Danielle Harris in this film, as I did with the previous film. Not sure what the logic was with that, but for any follower of the series it's nearly impossible to separate the idea of her as Michael Myer's niece from parts 4 and 5, especially in this movie. A minor gripe, but it doesn't help what is already a pretty flawed piece of work.I think the biggest issue is that Rob Zombie is trying to make something artistic out of what is essentially a non-artistic genre. On the surface, slasher films aren't really any different than porn, substituting sex for blood and gore, although not all the time. Mostly, the bits of dialogue are to get from one graphic sequence to the next. You can try to make a gourmet meal out of fast food ingredients, but it's probably not going to do you a whole lot of good. John Carpenter was an innovative filmmaker interested in exploring territory and telling stories that hadn't ever been told in the film world, whereas Zombie seems to be more about taking cheap entertainment and turning it into something its not. It's certainly not lacking in its ambition, but for all its merits, Halloween II is pretty hollow. For a Halloween movie, it's okay, or dare I say, ""good"" but, for a Halloween movie, that's not saying a whole lot.",Halloween II
219,Troubleboy,Even the post-Carpenter 80's/90's Halloween's Were Better Than This Dreck,1,13 December 2009,"More mindless rubbish form the mind of Rob Zombie.This time around, Zombie picks up where his first disappointment left off - with Laurie Strode transferred to the hospital and struggling to escape her loony brother.This follows a similar theme to Carpenter's second 'Halloween,' with no plot, lots of thunder and lightning, the usual psychiatric garbage and the requisite killings, heightened this time around by graphics and audio and distinctly lacking in tension.Zombie tops himself early with discussions of necrophilia and implicates 'Howard Hesseman, Margot Kidder, and - AND - The Moody Blues' in his nonsense with endless playings of 'Nights in White Satin,' but beyond this, it's the same old, same old.The movie will appeal to Zombie Nation (the 14-21 crowd), but not many others.Before he wastes his time on H3, Rob needs to rent the original to learn how to do it right. Score this one: amateur film making running amok.To further add insult; Zombie product places one of his relatives in the film.",Halloween II
220,crazy-ben66,"Not even trashy fun, just terrible.",2,17 December 2010,"Following a modernised remake of a horror classic is never easy, so it begs the question why Rob Zombie even bothered. His re-imagining of the brutal tale of Michael Myers was passable at most, at least featuring some mildly horrifying imagery. The sequel however, 'H2' is nothing of the sorts, with no story to feed off of resulting in a symposium of hysterical nothingness. Scout Taylor-Compton's performance in the first movie was arguably decent, her portrayal of 'scream-queen' Lori Strode was never going to beat Jamie Lee-Curtis but she at least took well to the part, making a convincing high-school sweetheart. Her performance in the sequel is truly awful though, partly due to the bare-bones script and absent dialogue. Any interactions she has with anybody, alive or dead, always results in a monotonous spew of unidentifiable garbage, either laughing or crying so hard its impossible to make out a single word. She does indeed scream a lot however, something which gradually becomes incredibly irritating, never registering as genuine terror and instead like it is forced. Her hollow character allows no real connection and the difference in life-style separates her being from her previous self, meaning even if you have sat through the first movie, there's still no chance you'll feel even the least bit sorry for her. The other characters too are dull and annoying, and are barely featured at all, used as merely pawns by Zombie to give his crazed killer something to slay meaning there is no space for the young Miss Strode to grow, giving her character no depth at all. The inclusion of Dr. Loomis also feels like a joke, his character almost completely flipped from the caring and incestuous psychologist we know from the original. McDowell's display of torturous stereotyping is almost insulting and the character's lack of impact on the story as a whole truly makes you wonder what the point of his screen time is. A large proportion of what made the first film decent was the back-story to Michael Myers, and his portrayal by the young Daeg Faerch who was truly excellent. However, due to growing issues, Faerch was not cast in the sequel, a problem easily fixed by cutting out his part, I mean, we know the back-story, no need for more of young Michael is there? Wrong, well in Rob Zombie's mind anyway. He forces in Chase Vanek, an untalented and inexperienced child to take his place (who also looks nothing like Faerch's Myers) into a part which is not needed and generally gets in the way. The presence of the Young Michael and his rather odd looking mother (in Gothic white) merely adds screen-time and confuses the rather dim-witted viewer-ship. Zombie clearly has no idea of how to approach a sequel, and in this case, attempts to force his slasher movie into a spiritually complex psycho-thriller which it clearly is not. Michael Myers is far from human (even if it is his physical form) and it is clear from footage present in both this film and it's predecessor (he eats a dog's intestines) so by attempting to give him human emotions, Zombie over-steps the boundary, which wouldn't be so bad if he'd done it right. Instead he constantly slices in random thought bubbles between the mindless slayings resulting in absolutely no enlightenment what so ever, and instead just complicates things. When the slayings do occur however, and they are rather frequent, they are brutally horrific, even more so than the first. The use of sound must be praised and a few instances of Myers' appearance from thin-air mixes in a some occurrences of genuine terror. However, it is this which is the movie's eventual downfall, as every-time Myers appears on the screen he just suddenly jumps out of a hidden crevice, making the movie devoid of tension and extremely predictable after a mere 15-20 minutes of viewing. As horror movies go, this is a lame excuse for a slasher flick as it attempts to be something it really isn't. The Halloween series is a beloved vessel of dark slayings and although there are plenty within this one, Rob Zombie mis-uses the legendary back-story and the characters known by all, creating a disastrously sickening gore-fest which is neither horrifying nor funny or anything other than terrible. Full of in-consistences, H2 is a cruel attempt at shaping the franchise into something it truly isn't, which is anything but a high-profile slasher flick. Sit back and wait for a hurried and blood-soaked sequel to keep the cash rolling in for the doomed rock-star Zombie, as with this tripe under his belt, he won't be doing anything else any time soon. 2.5/10",Halloween II

222,Suicide_Saint,Halloween 2: A Tragic Failure,8,28 December 2009,"To preface my review, I am a fan of Rob Zombie as well as a fan of the Halloween franchise. Furthermore, I am a connoisseur of the horror genre.This was by far the most deplorable and most forgettable installment in the Halloween franchise, including Season of the Witch. If you have seen SOTW, you know just how serious this statement is. Enduring this rushed, patchwork film truly has no reward. Analyzing it time and time again ,this really will go down as one of the most tragic failures of the modern horror genre.Rob Zombie posted many ""hype blogs"" about this film during the process of its creation. Through several clues, it was painfully clear this was nothing more than a paycheck for Rob. The aforementioned clues include: 1.) Zombie stated after the completion of his Halloween remake that he would not revisit the franchise as he felt he had exhausted the possibilities of the film.2.) Zombie often referenced how he was ""hauling ass"" to complete this movie. Reading between the lines, he was not taking his time to craft a masterpiece.The overall tone of this film is sleazier and more depraved than any previous Zombie feature. This filth-infested cinematography has worked well for Zombie in the past. However, in H2 it has quite the opposite effect. None of the characters illicit any connection or worse, any empathy. The characters are static, unchanging, and unable to rouse any emotions from an audience. What's worse is since when does Michael sound like an aerobics instructor when he kills people? His cold silence is a staple of what makes him an absolute villain.Perhaps the most frustrating element of all was the re-emergence of his wife. Apparently, Zombie is unable to make a film without her. She died in the original and it should have stayed this way. Instead, we get a pretentious recycling of the Friday the 13th storyline as the mother ""guides"" Michael in his slaughter. As an avid Halloween fan, I have never liked the cheap rip-off known as Friday the 13th and feel insulted that Zombie would include something that so closely resembles that film.In closing, Zombie should have went with his initial instinct and stayed far away from a Halloween sequel. I know he could care less what one fan thinks, but this has severely damaged my respect and admiration for him as an artist. Here's hoping that this is a one-time blunder and his future works will push creative and artistic horror in new directions.",Halloween II
223,crispin_13,Watching this is more painful than dying at Myers' hand,1,28 January 2010,"I am a man who has watched and owned a lot of bad movies. JAWS 4, Friday the 13th Part 8, Pirhana II, etc... My point is that a movie has to be pretty bad for me not to enjoy it. My friend and I have a gauge to ranking how good a movie is: How far into a movie are you before you look at the counter to see how far into it you are. I looked at the clock at 6 minutes. This movie is truly awful. I TURNED IT OFF at 17 minutes!! I almost never turn off anything. Don't watch this movie. If anyone in Hollywood is listening, ""Take this franchise away from Rob Zombie!!"" I think that we've learnt something here. If you are named after a dead person, you will direct like one. I have to stop thinking about this film; I'm feeling nauseous.",Halloween II
224,antoinecatry,Stop the massacre !,3,7 May 2010,"To do Rob Zombie credit, I congratulate him for not copying John Carpenter's work. In particular, I like the idea of giving more importance to Sheriff Brackett. The problem is : the general effect creates a serious boredom sensation, the flaws largely overpower the niceties. About Laurie Strode, not much to say apart from: why the inflation of the ""f..."" word ? Is it conceivable to shock in another ways than breathing cuss-words? In addition: no guts, not a bit of the ""adult sense"" that made Jamie Lee Curtis so brilliant in the original film. About Michael Myers: a dumb wrestler (which is what Tyler Mane was before his acting career), generous in the art of brutalizing. Yet scenes of extreme brutality are not harrowing at all, a good thrill does not equal the mere sight of blood, even in gallons! The original Myers had not such a stature and strength, but was far spookier. Rob Zombie tried to explain the Boogeyman's behavior because of a childhood fraught with poverty, negligence and an alcoholic father in law. That was interesting, showing Michael's torture of animals (and even eating the flesh of a dog) was purely pointless. About Doctor Loomis: worst of all. Rob Zombie did try to replace Donald Pleasence's sheer demonization of Myers with something more explicit. The intention is once again very noble, the manner is awful: the Doctor is depicted as a cliché of psychology, a mediatic sensation, haughty and sophisticated. When accused of strengthening Michel Myers'myth with his morbid and mediatized interest in his former patient, his words are: ""I'm selling the sizzle, not the steak."" Well, this steak tastes so bad I could become vegetarian. The sole fascination for blood and monsters does not work on a demanding viewer, a solid story and solid performances would have saved the film. Rob Zombie is a true horror fan, that is revealed, among other elements, in the selection of his actors specialized in the horror industry (Ken Foree, Caroline Williams, Bill Moseley, Brad ""Chucky"" Dourif, etc.), and in the multiple references to other works : the dream sequences featuring the mother reminds of Friday 13th and Freddy, the skin-like mask of Leatherface, etc. In spite of all my respect for his person and his music I used to listen when I was younger, I don't think that displaying one's culture by multiplying references suffices to sign a good work. Another slight reproach: Michael starts his killing spree two days before Halloween, which is a bit inconsistent considering the title's ""time determinism"", but from that point of view, Texas Chainsaw Massacre would be the only consistent franchise in the genre because the murders always take place in the state of Texas: Freddy does not always haunt Elm Street and Jason does not always strike on Friday, 13th...",Halloween II
225,t-g-orrell,Why Zombie Why,3,8 July 2010,"I just want to first say that what pisses me off the most about this movie is after the first 10-15 minutes of Myer's murder-rich, beautiful terror, you find out it was just a dream. The opening is horror at it's best and I thought I was in for something special thinking: this is what Myers is all about, this is his definition! *But then, it's like Mr Zombie decided to say ""I could do that, but I am not, just listen to his sister cry for the next hour and a half"".And then the story drags to a crawl. Sure there are a couple good Myers moments after that as his kills are brutal (the strip club being the one of the best), but 90% of the story after that startling beginning is about Lil Sis coping with her life after the first Halloween. She has crying fits, is in and out of counseling, and is anti-social. I understand WHY, but it still does not make it FUN.Also, Sheri Moon, you are adorable, but that weird mother role did nothing to build-up Michael Myers, the icon.What Zombie did was humanize a horror icon, giving him motives and reasons for him killing. Instead of a killing machine, he turned him into a wandering serial killer. No longer a monster, an icon. Rob Zombie, I am no longer a fan.",Halloween II
226,shmucking,"More consistent than first one, and more interesting",7,30 January 2010,"Okay, this film is a mess. Plenty of comments saying this. But it's still a more consistent film, and ultimately more interesting, than the first one.Zombie's remake of Halloween 1 had a great beginning, but grew monotonous after Michael escaped the sanitarium. It was hard to even watch it because it was so boring.Halloween 2, on the other hand, maintains a consistency in quality and tone throughout the entire film. It's not a great film, and has the usual boring splatter movie deaths. But there's some interesting qualities between the tiresome murder scenes.The scenes with Michael's mother and the younger Michael are intriguing, and the scenes with Malcolm McDowell as a greedy, pretentious exploiter of the murders have a darkly funny quality to them. Also, the scenes at the goth Halloween party are quite funny if you're into that kind of music and lifestyle. Additionally, the scenes of Michael with the long beard, travelling by foot to find his sister, have a certain power in their imagery and had the potential to be even more interesting.In the future, I think Rob Zombie should just abandon the splatter movie components altogether and make a movie that more accurately reflects his own unique vision. Whether he's aware of it or not, it's obvious that he's grown bored with the traditional horror movie trappings and has moved on.",Halloween II
227,lbabe29,another overly brutal and highly annoying remake from Rob Zombie..,2,1 May 2010,"As if the first one wasn't unnecessarily violent enough this one takes it to a whole new level. The film is just an ongoing bore of endless brutality, unlike with other films (texas chain saw massacre, Hostel, even at times Saw) the violence really has no point its just there to shock us, the problem is after the 20th time we see Michael stab another random red-neck it really has no effect what-so-ever.The films picks up exactly when the last one ended and despite a pretty well executed hospital opening this film fails to create any real tension, it all just feels like a re-hash of the first film which ill admit was not horrible yet it still suffered from too much in your face violence and the same unlikeable lead. On the to next vital flaw: the complete lack of likeablity in Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor- Compton). Laurie was painfully annoying in the first film and if its possible she is even MORE annoying here. Following the events of the first movie she is now depressed, needing counseling and dealing with anger issues. All this is fine and understandable and could have worked if played by a better actress (i repeat could have worked as the character is still written badly). But Compton fails to add any relatability, depth or sympathy to Laurie which results in lack of tension as you really don't care what happens to her. Much of Compton's delivery falls painfully flat and whilst not the worst actress I've seen she lacks likeablity which means she again fails as the leading role. Another annoying aspect is the addition of the white house, white lady imagery. I assume Zombie wanted this to be seen as a clever hint at Michael's inner psyche but it comes off as random and pointless.Its not all bad though, there is some nice imagery scattered about and the score is effective but those two pretty minor things cannot make up for the total overall fail of this film.",Halloween II
228,wesleywisejr,A WiseGuy's Review: Shockingly Bad - Please bring back Carpenter's original score,2,2 September 2009,"I believe H2 fails for three major reasons including the severe lack of John Carpenter's original score, drastic change to Michael Myers and the story itself, and lack of character strength from the two main characters, Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode. I just want to say first off I have lived and breathed the Halloween series my entire life after seeing the first movie when I was just a kid to seeing H2 now that I'm 26 years old. It's by far my favorite franchise and horror icon. That said I believe this film to easily be the worst in the series since Halloween 3: Season of the Witch.The Halloween movies succeed in scaring us because of John Carpenter's brilliant and haunting original score. This movie plays the original theme once (compared to three times in the 2007 remake). The soundtrack builds no tension whatsoever and that is the key to this series. Also, Michael Myers is dramatically changed. Many scenes of the movie he's not wearing his mask and only puts it on to kill someone. He's got long hair and a giant grisly beard, completely uncharacteristic of past Michael Myers. He grunts and growls as he kills, he wears a ridiculous over-sized hooded coat, and in many scenes wanders aimlessly killing victims that have nothing to do with the story. Being a horror fan I love mindless violence and gore, but I just didn't FEEL it with this movie. Finally, Dr. Loomis was a huge part of the original series. In this film he's reduced to a insignificant subplot, a frustrating mistake. The visions of white horses and Michael's mother seemed ridiculous. Loomis always was the one providing the insight into Michael's madness, and in my opinion that should've stayed the same. In addition, I wasn't too thrilled with Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode in the 2007 remake but I was able to deal with her. In this film she's just an unbearably annoying psycho who spends most of the movie screaming and crying from bad dreams. By the end of the movie I was just hoping Michael would kill her already and put an end to this nightmare of an entry in an otherwise legend horror franchise.I enjoyed Rob Zombie's 2007 remake. It was better than some of the later Halloween films. It was a fresh take and a solid effort to revitalize the Halloween franchise. How he could've fallen so far from the first movie to H2 is beyond my comprehension. There was so much to dislike about this movie I didn't even get to cover everything. I am thrilled to hear that 2010's Halloween 3-D will feature a new director. Hopefully someone can get this derailed freight train back on track. And for the sake of my all-time favorite horror movie hero Michael Myers, please bring back the original freakin music!!!",Halloween II
229,TheBigSnack,Halloween II - Grand Finale or New Beginning?,9,12 December 2015,"The Haddonfield locus of fame/infamy is again being challenged as Dr. Loomis releases his new book on the life of his former patient Michael Myers to a national bestseller audience.The candidates for fame are also rivals and form distinct would-be archetypes as the Rags to Riches figure (Michael Myers), the Lost Person figure (Laurie Strode), and the Healer figure (Dr. Loomis).There is a soap opera quality as the characters vie for personal triumph.Michael Myers continues a game of survival after being deemed a social risk to his less than famous relations. When society collapses around him years following his institutional sentence he is faced with the option of ending the challenge against him or living as a third wheel to losers forever.Dr. Loomis who has turned his idiosyncratic superstitions in Judeo- Christian precepts into a mediocre career has been a father figure to Michael Myers during 15 years of silent interviews. While it is clear that Dr. Loomis has no understanding or love to offer Michael Myers, it is unclear to what degree Michael Myers is superior to role model Dr. Loomis.After a night of thrilling and unexpected combat, an end is in sight when the three are displayed in a lifeless pose following a massive shootout with local and state police.Understanding is next when Laurie Strode is finally saved within the confines of a white-walled sanctuary, where she silently reveals her newfound love with a perversely satisfied smirk.",Halloween II
230,SilensMortea,Never before have I wished for death so strongly...,1,1 May 2010,"This movie was the absolute pits. Horrible doesn't even begin to describe it. There was just SO much wrong here! Firstly, Laurie Strode and friends...what can I say about these girls that can convey my absolute disgust at having to sit through a movie listening to these girls act up and try to come across as tough and sexy? Laurie did nothing but yell and whine the entire movie, gone from too goody-goody to an awful, unfitting ""tough rocker girl"" character. Her dark haired friend prances in and acts like the hottest thing on two legs. I'm actually ashamed to be of the same gender as these annoying children after having to stomach their crap. Laurie was a character that needed to die horribly a thousand times over. It is mostly because of her that I will never watch this film again. The blood effects were pretty great, I really enjoyed the killings although the dream sequences got in the way far too much. The killings themselves were thoughtless, brutal yet boring at the same time. I didn't like how they tried to throw in some feeling at the end, when her friend from part one dies. they made it very dramatic, with flashbacks to her friend as a young girl...slow music...overuse of the word ""baby""...but still I did not feel a single thing. It's a classic case of too much, too late! I did not agree with the fact that after Laurie discovers she is related to Michael,suddenly she has this connection with him, seeing the same visions he does. They should have left it with a vision or two explaining why he feels the need to kill her, and dropping it after that. There was no need for her ""ghost"" to show up every few minutes, or the vision of himself as a young boy. Speaking of the young boy- they made a huge mistake in getting another boy to play the young Michael! Daeg Faerch has such a unique face, and he really fit the role very well. As a fan of the first Halloween movie, I felt cheated to have to see another boy playing the part. I understand about the growth spurt and all that, but what they should have done was never allowed young Michael's face to be seen. He was always wearing a mask anyways, and it would have been less apparent that it was someone else in the role. That really distracted me.I also disagree with the showing of Micheal's face. He blatantly walks around without a mask on through most of the movie. To me, Michael Myers is a much the mask as Freddy is the knife glove. You just don't remove something so iconic. You can't have him without his mask- it isn't right. That's part of the mystery of the character! After watching this and realizing how utterly disappointed I was in it, all I can say is, ""What the Hell was Rob thinking?!"" I expected far, far more. Bland killings, overly annoying characters, all mystery removed from Michael, useless nudity, Laurie and friends calling each other ""baby"" enough to make a lesbian want to turn straight, too much cursing, a change of a main actor, overdone dream sequences...give it a miss unless you can see it for free- and even then, isn't there something better you can do with your time?",Halloween II

After not liking the remake to much, i was really worried about this one. I thought it would fail like the first did. Wow, was i wrong.I love the color scheme in this movie. Its very dark and depressing. I think I liked this movie so much because it showed how the lives of the people from the first movie were affected by past events. Micheal is also very brutal in this movie. I think more so than the first. I also like the crazy hallucinations Laurie had. They were very creepy and very dark. Overall I give this movie a 7/10.",Halloween II

We are brought into her traumatized world, played by Scout Taylor Compton. Compton gives a remarkable performance of a trauma victim dealing poorly with the recent traumatic events that are now plaguing her. She absolutely nails every scene and if this genre was ever worthy of oscar attention, her performance is one for the contending.
This film works as a fantastic follow up to Rob Zombies previous entry. It is much higher on the artistic scale and works as an often brilliant and always dark installation of madness.",Halloween II
233,iced_heart7,Way to nearly kill off the entire franchise...,3,27 March 2020,"While Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of John Carpenter's classic slasher film ""Halloween"" had some serious problems, it still managed to be somewhat entertaining. The sequel however is so inexcusably flawed that it would take 9 more years for another Halloween film to materialize on the big screen.And just like in his first attempt, Zombie's ""Halloween II"" starts promising - it picks up right after the events from the first part's finale. Teenager Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) has just shot the murderous psychopath Michael Myers and is picked up by Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif in a standout performance as the old and tired, but goodhearted town's sheriff) who then escorts her to the emergency room. Brackett's own daughter Annie (Danielle Harris) has also survived a near fatal encounter with Michael Myers and is in Haddonfield's hospital as well. The most exciting and suspenseful sequence happens right there and then - Laurie awakes in the hospital bed, only to find Michael there alive and well, and still bloodthirsty as always. The whole episode as he stalks her through the corridors of the hospital is pulse raising and nauseating, but then very abruptly the brakes are applied. Because, wait for it...the whole thing is a dream sequence. One of horror movies' most overused clichés. And it's all downhill from there. We get a flash-forward to two years later - Laurie now lives with her friend Annie in sheriff Brackett's house (her adoptive parents were killed off by Michael on that fateful 31st of October). Laurie is a nervous wreck, forever psychologically scarred by the violent events of the past and has regular visits to the shrink. In fact, she is so increasingly psychotic throughout the film that any attempt to empathize with her character becomes next to impossible. Hysterical overacting on Taylor-Compton's part doesn't help the matter either. But then again Rob Zombie chose her for her ""genuine"" quality and for being the least ""actor-y"" of all that auditioned for Laurie Strode's part. Well, I do agree about the last part. In fact, the real protagonist for me in ""Halloween II"" is Annie - Danielle Harris' performance by far outshines that of her colleague and her scene with Michael Myers towards the end of the film also turns out to be the one with the most dramatic effect.But enough about the acting - the main shortcomings of the film lie elsewhere. Whereas in the first part Rob Zombie tried to compromise between the traditional story elements and his own original ideas, here he has unleashed the full extent of his visions and doesn't try to stick to the status quo established by the franchise. Which should be good news, right? Finally, something fresh? Well...no. Because in his attempts to offer something new, Zombie also tramples on some of the elements that fans of the Halloween films have come to love. Take for example Michael Myers' s psychologist Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). In the original films, he was always shown as an honorable and brave man, a sort of worthy opponent to Michael Myers. In ""Halloween II"" Zombie demystifies his character and envisions him as a money-hungry opportunist, content with using other people's suffering as means to sell more of his true-crime books. In fact, here he reminds me quite a lot of a character from another popular horror franchise - journalist/true crime writer Gale Weathers, played by Courteney Cox in Wes Craven's Scream. Like her, Sam's character here is intended more as a humorous distraction, than a source of increased dramatic tension. Rob Zombie seems to struggle in finding a justification for Loomis' character to be in this second film and as a result Malcolm MacDowell quickly runs out of things to do in the movie until the very end, when the ridiculous script requires him to suddenly need a reason to confront Michael Myers again, which feels very abrupt and not in tone with the events depicted prior. And talking about justification for keeping unnecessary characters in the film, it's time to mention Rob Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie. While her performance as Myers's mom in the first part was quite good and of importance to the story, there is absolutely no reason for her to have as much screen time in this sequel, as she does. As her character committed suicide in part one, her appearance here is reduced to recurring dreams and hallucinatory sequences, of which Rob Zombie, for some reason, cannot get enough. Whenever she appears (which is quite often as already mentioned) the whole dynamic of the scene hits a full stop. The original film from 1978 also had a very strong psychological element to it and didn't concentrate on violence as much as in the following sequels, but...man, those dream sequences! They don't fit one bit. You want dream sequences? Here is ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" for you, Freddy Krueger will make sure you are entertained! And the whole idea of Michael and Laurie having some kind of shared psychotic delusion - it must have seemed already silly in written form, but on the screen the result is disastrous and vomit-inducing.Another thing about the Halloween franchise that is quintessential is the element of suspense. Zombie had already shown in the first part serious signs of inability to keep the viewer on edge of his seat, in the way that John Carpenter could. Here Rob Zombie experiences the same problems. It's as if he is quite disinterested in the stalking and murder scenes, he hurries to get through them, so that he can concentrate on the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. The result is Michael Myers quickly kills off a lot of people in the film, but to tell you the truth, apart from Annie's murder scene, I can't remember any of them in details. It's all a big blur. Part of the reason is that there are mostly no real characters on display here, just cards on a board that fall one by one. A bigger part of the reason, as I already said, is how Zombie proceeds to shoot those scenes. As in part one, we get again those dizzy, unfocused, almost shaky-cam shots and choppy editing, whenever there is a violent scene, so that you are often left wondering what the hell is going on, a method that is sadly used over and over again in contemporary filmmaking. In an interview about the making of the film ""Eastern Promises"" and the depiction of violence in it, legendary director David Cronenberg said: ""When I give you violence on the screen, I want you to experience it the way the characters really would experience it and so I don't look away, and I don't do a lot of quick impressionistic cutting, so you don't know what's going on, I really want you to see everything"". Apparently, Rob Zombie does not want us to know what's transpiring in some of the crucial scenes. To each his own, I guess.Finally, let's talk about the ending...what a travesty! I don't know about the theatrical finale, but the one I got served on the Director's Cut DVD is simply atrocious. After an unmasked Michael gets shot in front of a wooden shed surrounded by police cars, Laurie Strode walks out with a knife, attempts to stab Sam Loomis (I guess), but becomes target practice as shots echo in the air. Freeze frame of Laurie getting hit. Cut to the interior of a mental institution and Laurie grinning like a psycho and apparently having some of those hallucinatory episodes again. The end. Where does one even begin to comment on this aberration of an ending? It plays out almost like a mockery of all things that made the original Halloween so great, it's simply unforgivable. After managing to degrade the once respected character of Sam Loomis, Zombie also pulled off the impossible - he made us also hate the one character that stood out as a hero and as an antipode to Michael Myers in the defining Halloween films - the character of Laurie Strode. Way to nearly kill off the entire franchise...",Halloween II
234,savagerox-39160,Dreadful,2,17 April 2017,Scores a 2 because it's slightly better than Rob Zombies remake of the original film. You get an added bonus because part of this review mimics the first remake. I can accept that this movie is for a newer generation audience by turning up the violence and body count. I think what this movie unsuccessfully tries to do is to rationalize Michael Myers behavior because of an unpleasant upbringing. What Michael Myers does is scarier when we don't know what motivates him. This movie doesn't really give the viewer anyone to root for. The Laurie Strode character spends most of the movie screaming and acting like a drama queen. I'm actually rooting for Michael Myers to kill her and end my suffering as well. None of the characters in this movie are so likable that you really care what happens to them and that makes the movie fail in my eyes. Taste is subjective and I'm sure a lot of people liked this mess of a movie.Seeing the new Halloween Kills it ranks with these Rob Zombie nightmares and I dislike them as much. I can appreciate that taste is subjective and younger people like the over the top violence over style or quality of story. This movie is not terrible but it's not very good either.,Halloween II
235,jolex616,Tried too hard?,5,29 August 2009,"A lot of violence. Brutal violence. But...what a waste of 21$ (For those who have girlfriends) I love Rob Zombie movies, but this was horrible. I hated the whole Horse/myers mommy thing. What was Rob thinking? I liked the cow scene at the beginning, but everything after that was shallow and weak. There were even some scenes where they didn't even show the killings. I hate when they do that. Oh boy, by far worse halloween movie ever. Even the original Halloween 3 was better than this. He should of just kept to the story of having Michael invade the hospital like the original halloween 2. This one just didn't make sense to me. Not fun to watch at all.",Halloween II

But in 2009 Halloween II 2009 was a surprise for everyone. Making a box office money wasn't as popular with critics as you may think. Halloween II 2009 had weak moments at best and Rob Zombie said never to return for another Horror film Of Halloween again: Part in the movie: One of the parts I didn't like was the part where young Michael Myers' asks' 'his mom can I show you something? And Debra as a ghost says Alright and then Michael shows Laurie Strode in a cage or something! And then she screams after Debra says not yet Michael.

237,MJohnsontalker,Rob Zombie has evolved into one of the worst filmmakers ever.,2,28 August 2009,"First off, I have seen the 2007 Halloween, so I had a pretty good idea what to expect. In the 2007 movie, I thought the first 30 to 40 minutes of it, was good. The second half, just didn't make the cut.So I went to this sequel with very low expectations, and I am thankful for that. Had I gone to see this movie with high hopes, I would have been disappointed.The trailers try to build you up for this movie. I even tried to clear my head and push all the bad feelings I have, and tried to look at this as I do Halloween III, season off the witch. A different movie! It still didn't work because it just has too many plot holes. The violence, in my opinion makes it less scary. It does have some moments that make you jump.If you have seen all the trailers, you pretty much have the movie figured out, and the ending will not come as that much of a shock too you.Michael is violent, but just not that scary! Loomis shows no signs of any redeeming qualities, though he does have all the best lines. If played by anyone else, the part would not have been as intense.I wasn't expecting much from this movie, so I was not disappointed. It was about a 'good' as I expected.I give this movie a 2 out of 10, and that is being generous.There you go, I seen it....and I didn't like it that much!",Halloween II
238,TrentReznorandAtticusRoss,Just stay away from this nail gargling piece of work.,1,27 May 2012,"Rob Zombie returns to Haddonfield - and returning with him, is heroine Laurie Strode, doctor Samuel Loomis, and finally, the psycho-pathic killer, Michael Myers, on the vengeful path to destroy his long lost sibling, Laurie, which only leads him back to haddonfield to wreak more havoc.Not only does Zombie make debatedly bad remake of a cinematic horror classic, but he also returns again to ruin his own re-imagining. This script is poor, the acting is worse, finally proving that Zombie's work should only be heard, not seen. One of the key points in the storyline is Michael and Laurie sharing a psychic/telepathic connection. Despite Zombie stating 'What's real is always better', we're now faced with ghostly visions, and undead possessions. Myers is apparently being lead to Laurie by the ghost of his deceased mother, which only leads him to eating dead dogs, rummaging through peoples garbage, and crashing parties. The film isn't scary, no matter what the synopsis or tag-line says, deny it, you're only going to be extremely let down. Now I had previously read other people's synopsis of the film, and wasn't impressed... I though that perhaps because it was Zombie, he'd somehow make it work. Well, I should seen it coming. The only thing that was good and possibly amazing about this movie, was that it ended.",Halloween II

There is no suspense either it's just the same kills

241,annrie_1,What the hell!!,4,28 December 2009,"I don't understand why you would tamper with a classic the Halloween 2 of the 70's was brilliant. the reason i loved these films so much was that Michael myers was a normal boy who snapped, and then he just looked like a normal man who could do all these paranormal things. he was one place and then somewhere else 2 seconds later but the new rob zombie version just ruined all that!! i mean making Michael the size of a whestler what is that all about. he even went to the extreme of making him talk!!! HEllO!!! Michael myers never spoke and we never saw his face after the first briefing in Halloween, i mean the killings had no art to them what so ever it was just your dead thats it!! pathetic!!! And i know that rob zombie's wife is nice looking and stuff but for god sake does he have to use her in all his films can she not get a role unless he does the film or something??? Also what the hell did he do to Sam lumus?? a celebrity ??? someone who was completely self involved and had completely forgot about Michael. HIS WHOLE WORLD WAS MICHAEL!!!! I just wish someone would talk to these director before they start messing with classics and tell them that if they are planning to butcher the story line completely to rename the film and stop disappointing the people who have been fans for so long!!!",Halloween II
242,tonymo1977,Halloween II (2009) Just another installment in the series?,7,3 March 2010,"""Halloween II"" (2009) I once had this dream that I was being pursued by unkillable Michael Myers, (albeit the pace was quite slow,still scary non the less). After being chased to near breathless, I escape back into my haven of safety...my bed! I close the door and lock it, to only have it smashed in by the William Shatner mask wearing Myers. I awaken, heart rate jacked glad to realize it was only a dream. As I lay my head back down to the pillow, the door comes splintering apart reminiscent of the original 1978 Halloween. The infamous dream in a dream, very funny Mr. Sandman!! In so many ways Halloween II (2009) produces that same vision of true fear. The carnal product that is Michael Myers, how he should be portrayed and how I should feel when I see him.Halloween is a direct reflection of development of the franchise. Zombie's excessive violence is right on par. Michael Myers (Taylor Mane) is a deeply tormented supernatural force that cannot be stopped and any one that gets in his way....should do only one thing....move! Zombie's Halloween II (2009) achieves definitive success in more than one instance. 1) He truly understands the importance of showcasing Michael Myers strength....when he stabs you and lifts you off the ground with his knife( which has to be a custom made knife, no kitchen has a knife that big), I'd say he is pretty strong. A clothesline that inverts his victim in a rapid rate behind a dirty strip club sends him filling out an application for Vaudeville. 2) He keeps his killer on his home turf...the night! Zombie made this mistake in the 2007 reboot, bringing Michael out in the day does nothing but scream, not scary! 3) Recasting of Taylor Mane, at 6ft 8in Mane brings the bogeyman that is Michael Myers to new heights.The darker more violent direction that this film undergoes, Zombie really makes his own, to finally breakaway from honoring the past and paving a new route into the future was great to see.A few elements that I could have lived without were the return of his ""The Devils Rejects"" troupe. Typecasting is not an aspired ambition and should be avoided entirely in Pre-Production.With a budget of 15million for each film, I would guess that a higher rate actress, at least one with better acting ability would have been cast for the Iconic role of Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton). She almost inconceivably develops into a plausible character, in either film.Rob Zombie's second installment of the Halloween Mythos was simply carried by violence, any sibling link with mother and brother was lost in the slashing. As a fan of the series I enjoyed it very much, simply because Michael Myers is a bad mofo. Any time you get to witness the shocking strength that is Michael Myers you are in for a real trick......or treat? BruceVain",Halloween II
243,jjpurwitsky,The Halloween Saga: Rob Zombie's Halloween II,4,22 August 2012,"When Rob Zombie's Halloween was released it was a blast of fresh air that was sorely needed in the Halloween franchise. It was well made, scary, enjoyable and ended up making more money (unadjusted for inflation) than any other Halloween movie had before.Pretty much right after the release, and subsequent success of Halloween, the producers green lit a sequel. And due to the overall good word of Rob Zombie's version, the producers gave him carte blanche do do whatever he wanted for the follow up.While he worked on the exciting follow up more reboots were hitting the theaters. Friday the 13th came back and tried to reboot the series. The film started off really nicely but ended up rather weak at the end. Another reboot included the worse than the original Prom Night and news of an all new Nightmare on Elm Street.Even though the reboot was working and making money at the box office, it seemed like a new craze was taking off. One that has been tried many times in cinema's history but always only lasted a few years. That craze was 3D and movies like the fourth Final Destination and My Bloody Valentine raked in the cash.So when Halloween II was announced for an August 28th, 2009 release date it seemed to be coming in a turbulent time for the horror industry. Even still, after the great success of the first (ninth) film hopes were held high for the latest entry in the Halloween saga.Halloween II opens with a great 10 minute sequel that echoes the original Halloween II. But sadly, as soon as that opening ends, the movie falls apart and sinks in the overweight of it's own ambitions. It is truly amazing that the man most responsible for the best Halloween film since the original could go on to make one of the worst entrants in the series.Before the bad is discussed, let's mention the good. The entire surviving cast returns for this movie as does Sherri Moon Zombie as Michael's mother and for the most part, all the returning actors deliver solid performances. The opening scene is scary and tense and echoes not only the original Halloween II but Zombie's 2007 entrant in the series. That's about it for the good.Where to begin with the bad. To start off with, expect for Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris, the returning actors (who are all playing the same characters) seem to be playing somebody else. The characters are not at all like the people they were in the first movie. I understand the idea that the events of the first film changed these characters, but to such a degree just didn't work.Then there is the casting of young Michael Myers. A new child actor plays him and other than having the same hairstyle, this new kid just can't compare. He is bland and boring and unlike Daeg Faerch he just doesn't seem menacing, scary or believe. And Sherri Moon returns as Michael's mother, is given a much larger part, and totally destroy's all believability. Her acting wasn't strong in the previous film but here it is just terrible.Which brings me to the story. Supernatural links, ghosts, an egotistical Doctor Loomis, psychiatry sessions, and a whole slew of contrived moments make up this loose collection of scenes that somewhat resemble a story. What was Rob Zombie thinking when he wrote this. Its as if he took everything that worked for Halloween and removed it for this film.Even Michael Myers is bad in this film. In the last film he was perfect. Tyler Mane embodied everything that one could ask for in Michael Myers. Here, not only is he walking in fields for most of the movie, but he looks like a homeless guy (which isn't scary). A long beard and tattered clothes and he barely ever wears his mask. (Incidentally, it is never explained how he survived and why there is no hole in his mask after taking a close up shot to the head at the end of the first film.) In this film, for some reason, Myers grunts and grunts and grunts and even says something near the end of the film. What? Why?Halloween II is long and boring and not very well edited. It is very dark and shot terribly. Most of the time it is to hard to see what is going on. 2007's Halloween left a lasting impression on my psyche, this film I can't wait to forget about. With bad death scenes, stupid characters, bad acting, bad lighting, pretty much bad everything Halloween II has to be one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. So much promise based on the first film and nothing delivered (minus the first 15 minutes). That first 15 minutes really elevates this review and without it I wouldn't be surprised if this film even got 20%.Film Rating: 44%Breakdown (How Halloween II scored 44%):Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 5 out of 10 Re-playability: 2 out of 10 Originality: 7 out of 10 Costumes: 5 out of 10 Directing: 3 out of 10 Editing: 3 out of 10 Acting: 5 out of 10 Music: 5 out of 10 Script: 2 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com",Halloween II
244,YankeeDood,"Better Than The First, But...",2,6 September 2009,"Must admit this is a finer effort by Zombie. Michael is definitely more creepy and the visuals are much more stunning in this sequel (especially in the parts when we see Micheal's deceased mother and himself as a child). My remaining complaint is the acting. Scout Taylor Compton tends to over act in some parts and under act in others, making her role as Laurie Strode quite annoying. Plus, although I've always admired Brad Douriff and Malcolm McDowell, I got the feeling their ages didn't match their roles. When they became dramatic, I almost felt they were having a stroke! Finally, I still can't figure out when this series takes place. Is it in the 70's, 80's, or now? I do know some of the fashions are definitely exclusive to now, like the overdone tattooing. Oh, and this sequel continues the redneck foo, two of whom were almost as sadistic as Michael. But fortunately they got put in their place after a wicked attack on the hulking Michael (He does seem to be supernatural in this one). Now back to what I did like about the movie. I'm glad Rob brought in more of the original John Carpenter music, I even heard an updated version of ""Laurie's Theme"" which is always chilling to hear. No, these ""re-imaginings"" are not even close to the original Halloween, which is my favorite horror movie, but Rob appears to be learning from his mistakes little by little. So if you want to see one eerie and gory horror movie with plenty of rain to top it off, I recommend H2. But you prefer to avoid boredom, stay away from H1. Now, I just wonder what Rob has in store for Halloween 3, dare I ask?",Halloween II

246,cchires,An improvement...but still not a good movie:(,5,30 August 2009,"Halloween II was a better chance for Rob Zombie to make his movie as opposed to having to remake John Carpenter's movie and credit should be given to him for breathing life into the 10th film in the series. It's fair to say that Zombie can be classified as an auteur as opposed to a hired gun and his style is the best thing about the new Halloween. He knows how to make a shot interesting: with gloomy lighting, askew angles, shaky camera movement and he gets a lot out of his use of art direction for creepiness. It's narrative that's his weak point. In the last movie Zombie had to condense a lot of his story (michael's childhood, the time in the sanitarium and the night he came home) to appease the requirements of the remake. Here he's given much more freedom, but unfortunately he is not able to follow it through with a strong narrative force. My biggest complaint along these lines is that the movie begins with a cheat - the 'it's only a dream' sequence - so for the first half hour, you're trying to figure out what actually happened in the opening scenes and what was part of Laurie's dream. Furthermore, when they pull the same 'dream' trick later in the movie it gets a bad laugh. The other problem is that the stories of the main characters are not well intertwined, so we see scenes of Michael, Dr. Loomis and Laurie that have little to no payoff later on. The best example of this is the massacre at the strip club where Michael kills all the inhabitants which apparently goes unnoticed by the rest of the community as it's never referred to again. Zombie clearly is not interested in normal behavior and all of his characters in this movie have issues, but, because of the constant changes of perspective, it's hard to develop much interest in any of them. There is a feeling that Laurie needed more screen time and Dr. Loomis less. To their credit, the actors are able to keep plausibility throughout the course of film, however; the only one who seems to put together a complete performance is Brad Dourif. Because of it's artistic qualities, Halloween II is fun to watch, but it's was hard to care about the events of the movie because I didn't feel like there was any meaningful linkage from one scene to the next. In relation to that, the hallucination and dream sequences made it difficult to know what was based in reality an what was in the character's head. Rob Zombie has a style that is well suited for horror movies, but he would be better served in the future if he could collaborate with a screen writer that would help him with story structure.",Halloween II
247,qmsrocker,A Valueless Creation,2,27 October 2018,"Get ready to see Michael Myers as a horrifyingly hairy, giant grunting bear in this movie... With way to many Unicorn hallucinations, and a lot of random swearing. Without a quality storyline. This movie pathetically attempts to validate itself as a Halloween movie by including Danielle Harris from Halloween 4 and 5 as Annie. But, a movie without a quality storyline will always fail. Shockingly, Busta Rhymes was more fun to watch in Halloween Resurrection than anything in this movie.",Halloween II
248,jtpapp,Better than Zombie's first attempt...but not that great,2,16 March 2011,"I really, really didn't like Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween, so I went into this film with expectations set fairly low. In the end, that might have helped me like this film a little more than the original. This is by no means a good movie, but at least there are shreds of good ideas that made it onto the screen this time.One problem pops up right when the the first title card pops up, which is explaining the symbolism of a white horse. It's nice that Zombie tries to put symbolism in his films, but if he really thinks its too obscure for anyone to actually understand, or just thinks his audience is too dumb to actually comprehend the symbol, maybe it shouldn't be put in there. So throughout the film, Myer's mother continually appears with a horse. Myers also makes grunting noises and screams on occasion in this film, so it just adds to Zombie's distancing of the mythos.The film starts out at breakneck speed, with Myer's continuing his rampage at the hospital where Laurie is taken. This was a great way to start the movie...but then Zombie counters it by showing it was all just a dream. It is instances throughout the film just like this that bring it down.The writing once again is not very good, but it rises slightly above it's predecessor. But when Laurie is holding a beer can and says ""meet my new best friend"", one has to really question who thought that would actually sound good coming out of an actors mouth. And on another point, the acting is a little better than the Halloween remake, but nothing spectacular.THe story tries to continually show more motivation for Myer's murderous rampages, something about bringing his family back together and reuniting everyone, but it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. He just lumbers around town killing people. Then, when Zombie makes the genius move to make him lose the mask and just show up to kill people looking like a large hillbilly/bum, it just gets a little ridiculous. He has a full mountain man beard! It turns out a mask less Myers isn't scary, just very dirty looking. Dr. Loomis has also turned into a fame-mongering, money-hungry author with a new book coming out that reveals that Laurie is Micheal Myer's sister. But by the part of the film where that plot point is revealed, it is just another aspect of the script that was phoned in just to keep the movie going. Psychic connections are dipped into between Micheal and Laurie but never explored, and the family reuniting aspect of the film just doesn't work This is another case of Zombie's lack of being able to build up tension or suspense and instead relying on gore and jump scares. This film works much better than the first, but by the end the narrative been long off the tracks. Zombie swings and misses once again in his newest ravaging of a classic.",Halloween II
249,joselnieves81,Horror film NOPE...BRUTE FORCE SLASHER... YUP,7,28 August 2009,"I have been a huge Michael Myers fans for many years since the original (1978) and beyond that. John Carpenter set a blueprint for what many slasher flicks copied and some mastered. Michael Myers is the original slasher and only a sick twisted mind as is ROB ZOMBIE could remake and in a sick twisted way make it his own!!! Halloween 2 is not a remake as the movie does not take place inside a hospital and its not a hide and go seek fest. This movie is a runaway train. Michael Myers in H2 is a beast that kills for the fun of killing. Rob Zombie really made Michael Myers into a beast, a killing machine. The plot is pretty simple as are all the Halloween movies, but the unique twist I find is that Rob Zombie tried in his own way to explain what motivates Michael, what keeps Michael going as no other Halloween movie even tried to do. The movie is not one i would take my child to see because as I said its a murder fest and it's done so sick and twisted no child should see it. Rob Zombie yes is not a great story teller, doesn't have the most interesting characters but he is a breath of fresh air in the horror/slasher genre. He takes in back old school to the early 70's and shows you what a slasher movie is really about.If your a Michael Myers fan you will not be disappointed at all the movie is a fresh idea, a fresh look into the mind of Michael Myers. Rob Zombie has showed us what a real horror/slasher killing machine looks like. Many death's in this movie will have the view saying ""oh man stop already, he's - she's dead"" Myers is relentless and its a good way to end the summer of CGI trash!!! GO SEE HALLOWEEN 2!!!",Halloween II
250,ricky_may1,The Best Remake Sequel Ever!,10,21 December 2010,"Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 picks up where its predecessor left off and continues the bloody carnage that began with Halloween. Laurie Strode is suffering from nightmares and hallucinations of her brother and living with Sheriff Brackett and his daughter Annie, who also survived Myers wrath the year before; Dr. Loomis also survived but is writing a new book from the ordeal to try and relieve his troubled conscience and his failure to help Michael. Brackett discovers Loomis new book reveals the dark secret connection between Laurie and Michael and tries to prevent her from finding out. He fails and Laurie is grief-stricken to learn she is the sister of the man responsible for the deaths of her friends and parents from just the previous year. As Laurie spirals out of control and with Michael on his way back to Haddonfield, Loomis and Brackett are forced to join forces once more as the rampage gives way to a stunning and provocative climax.What makes Halloween 2 better than the remake is the sense of realism throughout the movie; you feel what all of the characters are going through (particularly Laurie) and it makes you feel sympathy for all the people involved. This fact alone establishes it from most horror films as it gives it more emotional depth not many have. Don't skip on this film or you'll definitely cheat yourself",Halloween II

252,hitman_1980,"Rob did it! Yes, he pulled it off! He buried the franchise!",3,22 October 2009,"I've been a BIG Halloween fan, for years. I will always love John Carpenter's classics and enjoyed Halloween 4 and H20. The rest were really lame sequels that had some creepy moments and a STORY. Halloween 2 doesn't have one. It's just a Michael Myers wannabe (sorry, Rob, but your psychotic white trash kid will NEVER be the real Myers for us, REAL fans) that takes a random path of blood and gore. Yes, random, if you can believe that. The movie looks good at times, and that's it. There's no suspense, no story, no character development, and what's worse, just like in Rob's first re-imagining bull###, most of them are unlikeable and you end up yawning and not giving a damn about who survives and who ends up butchered. I was against any remake, sorry ""re-imagining"" since I first heard the first rumor, years ago. Unfortunately my gut feeling was right, and more damage has been done to the series. I just hope the next generations will still be able to pick up the classic Carpenter movies, because that's what Halloween was all about. Mystery, pure evil, a boy that suddenly snapped. Not a cheap, abused psycho. I hope this is Rob's last Halloween project and that the franchise will stay buried from now on, for its own good. At least until a clever, inspired director that actually understand what made the first two movies work will know what it takes to respawn them. Until then, I'll just keep watching the classics every now and then and try to pretend Rob's movies don't even exist. Happy Halloween!",Halloween II

254,rascal67,Zombie's Redemption,7,3 August 2012,"This one knocked me for a six. Immensely disappointed with Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's horror classic—my expectations may have been too high maybe—but as far as I am concerned it is a turgid overblown mess of a film. Personally, I felt he should have left it alone or done another sequel. Instead, he has ended up paving the way for a sequel to his own vision of 'Halloween' and has come out on top. The strength of this film lies with the strong visual approach and while loaded with dark and negative imagery, he has also made it look beautiful, potent and alluring, with oodles of atmosphere.The psychotic Michael Myers is roaming the countryside after escaping a formidable ambulance crash that was transporting his presumably dead body. He is aided by ethereal, schizophrenic visions of his mother and a symbolic white horse in search of Laurie Strode—played with hysterical relish and anguish by Scout Taylor-Compton—to unify them as a family once more. The first act is set in a hospital and I suppose in a sense is Zombie's remake of Rick Rosenthal's creepy and bloody 'Halloween 2' from 1981'. After that it opens up for a dark; violent; gritty and sometimes surreal journey of Myers hunting down Laurie and dispatching any unwary victims in bloody and brutal fashion that get in his way.Malcolm McDowell returns as Dr. Loomis and along with his cohort played by Caroline Williams offer some comic relief as they both ham it up, but in a harmonized way that blends quite conscientiously with the reign of terror usurped by Myers. The violence perpetrated in this film is quite raw. While graphic and brutal, it is not overdone and is edited in a skillful and frenzied fashion that can give the appearance we are actually seeing more than we really are. Zombie's grasp of the film medium is professionally realized here. While there have been many detractors to this sequel, I feel that from a cinematic aspect this film is a very strong accomplishment and another deep dark notch in Zombie's tenebrous career.",Halloween II
255,dannylennon1981,Thank you Rob Zombie for killing Halloween!!!,3,24 July 2011,"This movie is awful, I was not a big fan of Zombies remake of the first movie either. Do teenagers really speak like they do in these movies! I watched this movie maybe 2/3 times and each time it gets worse and worse apart from the opening scene when Laurie is being chased through the hospital and Micheal is killing everyone in sight in brutal fashion. And Mr zombie just because your a rock god apparently what was the need for the hidden messages and hard soundtrack. Myself or anybody else who has seen this movie thinks whats the crack with the horse and Micheal's mum. The acting in this movie is not great, the death scenes are not bad and brutal but if you wanna see real brutal killings check out (The Orphan Killer) I am so glad that Mr Rob Zombie is not making the third and i hope that they kill off that white horse rubbish as that killed the entire movie for me. The only people i know who like this movie are spotty teenagers who have not seen one of the original Halloween movies and like Zombies other movies which have pretty much the same dialogue in.",Halloween II
256,shaneschoeppner1,Halloween II: The First Death of Laurie Strode,8,2 September 2009,"2009's ""Halloween II"" begins with a very brief sequence in which Michael and his mother Deborah are talking during his prepubescent days in the asylum. He speaks of a recurring dream of his, wherein Michael is reunited with his mother and baby sister Angela (who grows up to be Laurie Strode) as well as a white horse which seems to symbolize Michael's nihilistic and beastly nature. It is a brief sequence, but effective, and it really sets the events of the sequel in motion.Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) is then seen wandering the streets of Haddonfield, immediately after shooting Michael Myers in the head and believing him dead. Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif) who has already seen his own daughter Annie (Danielle Harris) off to the hospital, brings Laurie to Haddonfield General to be treated for her wounds. Michael is hot on her trail, however, and kills a nurse and a security guard while trying to get to her. Suddenly we realize that the entire hospital sequence is a nightmare of hers...or is it? Zombie takes us into Laurie's head so thoroughly during the course of the film that we are unsure sometimes of the difference between reality and delusion, and it's quite disorienting and fascinating, and is in fact one of the film's great strengths. Real or imagined, Zombie's hospital sequence is a wonderful homage the the original ""Halloween II"".When she wakes up from the hospital nightmare one year has passed, and Laurie is now living with Annie and her father. Annie is damaged goods herself at this point, and seems to have taken to staying inside a lot, and nurturing both her father and Laurie. Sheriff Brackett is angry at Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) especially when Brackett reads Loomis's new book on the Michael Myers case, which reveals Laurie's identity as Michael Myers' sister, a fact that Loomis agreed not to reveal. Laurie reads the same book and naturally finds her world shaken by the news.To make matters worse, the morgue van carrying Michael's body crashed on that fateful night one year ago, and Michael's body was never recovered. He still has the visions of his mother, now a Gothic Barbie doll in white satin, accompanied by a white horse, and Michael's own young self. Together they set out to find Laurie once again and be reunited, one way or another.Laurie returns to the Brackett house with Mya after a Halloween party, and finds Annie horribly wounded on the bathroom floor. Mya is killed when she goes to call 911, and Annie dies in Laurie's arms in one of the film's most touching and poignant scenes. All of this barely has time to register before Michael is busting down the door to get to his sister. Laurie escapes and is picked up by a driver who quickly dies at the hands of Michael. Michael rolls the car into a ravine, knocking Laurie unconscious, and abducts her to a decrepit barn for the family reunion that he's been waiting for.Brackett, Loomis, and the rest of the police force surround the barn and wait for a good shot at Michael. Inside the building, Laurie finds that she is also experiencing Michael's visions of their mother, the horse, and young Michael. She and Michael become mind-locked; both have been damaged enough by their lives to finally be connected, virtually as one. It is the very connection that Michael has been hoping for; but of course it has disastrous results on Laurie's mental well-being.Brackett shoots Michael and he is impaled on a wicked, multi-bladed farm tool. Laurie, absolutely divided by her own feelings, at once loathes and loves Michael at this point. Ultimately she stabs him with his own knife until he is unquestionably dead. But the price Laurie has paid for her own survival is a big one, and it is at this point that we see the first death - the emotional death - of Laurie Strode. Gone is the charming, carefree Laurie of Halloweens past. What's left is her ruins.There's a wonderful, horrible asylum sequence that finishes the film, heavily borrowed from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", which finds Laurie locked away just as her brother had been for so long. There is no saving her, and it is a beautiful, nightmarish end to a fantastic sequel.Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode does a terrific job; she's already improved as an actress since her performance in the original. She plays a great heroine (or anti-heroine) and she hits most of her emotional marks perfectly.Danielle Harris as Annie very much contributes to the emotional core of the film. She is such a sympathetic character, especially when you consider that this is her second tangle with Michael Myers. Annie's death scene is truly heartbreaking, and is an emotional turning point for several of the other characters. Her death is violent and gruesome, epic and beautiful, rendering unexpected emotions.Tyler Mane plays Michael to bloody perfection, so much so that it is truly frightening to look into the character's eyes. His hulking physicality dominates the film, and he is much scarier in this film than he was in Zombie's original.Malcolm McDowell as Loomis, with his speaking engagements and press exposure, has become as conscious-less as the monster he is obsessed with. In so many ways he too is torn between what is right and what is wrong.Sheri Moon Zombie as Deborah Myers is eerily effective, and her flat acting style, which hindered Zombie's original, is perfect for the part of Michael's ghostly mother.Margot Kidder, in a brief role as Laurie's therapist, is also memorable.",Halloween II
257,gerrard2,not sure whether its good or bad,5,28 November 2010,"Halloween 2 is probably the hardest review I'm gonna write. Despite having a fairly promising opening 15 minutes, after that the film slightly turns into a trashy rushed piece of film making.The plus side of this film is Rob Zombie added a few nice kill scenes in the film (the bit where the guy gets his head stamped on is amazing). I also liked how he..... actually their is nothing else i liked.Now onto the negatives. When watching this in the Cinema ( Theatre for all you American readers out there) the first thing i noticed was how extremely dark and grey the film was. The colour of the film reminded me to much of Sim city and 300 (and i didn't like those films) and it just seemed so off putting for me. Many people would agree with me that Michael Myers should not be walking around with his mask off through the film whilst looking like a reincarnated John Lennon. In respect to Rob Zombie i can see he was trying to make this film as realistic as possible but throughout the films Michael is known as Michael for his white featureless mask not his beard and long hair.What i also found unnecessary was the pointless dream sequences. Many critics say it was good breaks from the excessive violence but id of rather seen the violence than those dreams sequences i mean lets be honest it is a Rob Zombie movie. Another annoying point what Rob Zombie did with this movie was make the trust worthy Sam Loomis into a complete and utter jack hole. I believed that proved to be the turning point in the film for me.Michael in this film is by far the most brutal Michael in all the Halloween series. He truly shows that nothing gets in his way in pursuit of his sister Laurie. Talking about Laurie, Scout Taylor Compton did a descent portrayal of Laurie and i hope that she appears in Halloween 3D. Another special mention is to Brad Douriff and Danielle Harris who were both pretty convincing in there respective roles.I'm not saying to you viewers out there don't go and watch it because if your a huge Halloween fan like myself you will find it watchable as its an Halloween film. For those who wanna see a scary film don't bother with this one. And for all those who love gore, this is a must see for you guys.",Halloween II
258,harmisjack,A Bloody Mess,3,25 November 2009,"Okay, Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween scared the hell out of me, and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Now Halloween 2... I don't know where to begin.First we have a flash back of Michael in Smith's grove with his mom before she killed herself, which I thought was a decent beginning. Then we have Laurie in the hospital after a fight with Michael that ended in a blood bath. Those scenes were acceptable, but the rest of the movie had bloody violence for no reason, a ghost and Michael as a kid as a ghost too! Okay, first off that was uncalled for. This was a Halloween movie, not a ghost movie! We have Michael and his mom watch Michael as an adult do all the work. There were no scary chase scenes, and the worst of all... They killed Loomis! Loomis has always been the awesome one hunting down Michael, instead he believes Michael is dead and does not even come in until the end for a fight which didn't even have any fighting. The story was terrible, the violence was happening for no good reason. What was Rob thinking?! They should've just said Michael finally gets accepted into hell after being shot in the head at the end of the first movie. Horrible... absolutely horrible.",Halloween II
259,savagebiteme,More dreadful than the first Zombie remake,2,19 September 2013,"I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying.Kudos here this is slightly better than Zombies first remake. In a nutshell this film lacks the simplicity and style of the 1981 film. Part of it is the Laurie Strode character isn't even likable in this remake. I kept on routing for Michael Myers to kill her which I know isn't the point. I know I'm old school and this newer version isn't made for me. I must admit I love Zombies The Devil's Rejects, I love the rawness of it. This movie aims for a higher body count and not much else.",Halloween II
260,enteredapprenticering,No likable character makes it impossible to like the movie,4,3 April 2012,"Even though Rob Zombie has created a great setting for a great slasher movie, there is not a single likable character in the plot. The most important character Laurie, portrayed by actress Scout Taylor-Compton takes the theme of the mentally heavily unstable sister way over the necessary limit which makes her extremely unlikable, she is disturbing in a very negative sense, it does not add suspension to her character but leads to disliking her. From a commercial point of view I believe she was not the optimum casting choice. As you will most likely fail to like any character in this slasher movie just like me, it is impossible to connect to the great setting or the movie. My vote: 4 out of 10 out of respect for a great director, otherwise I would have given this a 2.",Halloween II
261,Film-Fan,A Painful Movie-Going Experience,1,28 August 2009,"I want a refund! This ranks as my worst movie-going experience of all time.The first Zombie ""Halloween"" is eons above this disaster. My primary complaints (besides the ridiculous, convoluted plot): annoyingly loud sound effects that take the violence to comedic levels (all you need are SPLAT, CRUNCH and ZAP title cards a la ""Batman"" to make it complete), always way too dark photography (no one thought to plug in a few lights?), a Michael Myers that looks like Vincent from TV's ""Beauty and the Beast"" (what's with the flowing robes?), and a love for characters that give the phrase ""poor white trash"" a whole new meaning (do these people EVER clean anything?). I also resent the introduction of characters just to butcher them off 45 seconds later.The actors try their best, but have nothing to work with. A script overburdened with profanity (The F Word over and over and over) really doesn't allow for much ""acting."" I love Malcolm McDowell...but NOT in this movie. What a waste of a good actor.I admit horror movies are not my greatest love...but HALLOWEEN II is just plain painful to watch.",Halloween II
262,jtq-56435,Completely Ruins What Halloween 2009 Did,1,15 October 2021,"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie, it feels like it was written by one of the trash movies you see on Shudder, but even those to be honest are written way better. I freakin hate this movie, it's nonsensical, its disgusting to watch, and it makes Laurie herself unlikable and wishing for her death and THAT is unforgivable. The best thing this movie did was set it up to where he's stalked her to the hospital, that was tense and wonderful and they RUINED IT by making a ""woe is me"" PTSD mind fu** of a movie that is a complete waste of time and honestly makes you sick to your stomach with the character assassination of Laurie, Loomis, and even Michael himself. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING Halloween 2009 did great is absolutely destroyed here in favor of some abomination and something I never want to watch again, it doesn't even feel like the sequel to the 2009 movie, it feels like some college film student's attempt at making it and it fails SPECTACULARLY.",Halloween II
263,nhaynes84,Rob's best work yet!,8,28 August 2009,"H2 was absolutely not a remake and was its own movie entirely. Parts of it seemed familiar, but overall, H2 did not seem like a typical Halloween movie. Halloween (2007) was pretty original but was watered down by the ending being too similar to the original. Zombie seemed to be much more original in H2. The biggest difference was that, in his first Halloween, Rob had to introduce his vision of story, but in order for it to be a Halloween with Michael Myers, he had to follow some guidelines. With H2, Rob had complete creative control to do what he wanted and go where he wanted with the characters and the story. Since this was its own movie and not a remake or a tribute, and was totally original, I thought it was head and shoulders better than the Halloween from 2007. The fact that the young Michael was played by another actor didn't bother me, as it was not that big of a role. The acting in this movie was top notch, and so was the editing and style. Rob Zombie has come a long way since some of those early films of his. Lorie Strode really shined in this movie, and the actress who played the role couldn't have been better. The psychological aspect of this movie was its only weak point, and I have to leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Nothing about this movie was cheesy, and very very little was cliché. H2 was very violent and unrelenting. One thing that got me was the fact that the movie seems to be set in modern times, but it has several aspects of the 70's, everything from music to hairstyles. Being that it's a Rob Zombie movie should be explanation enough since he seems obsessed with making movies with a 70's tint. It neither adds or takes away from the enjoyment of the film though. Overall, H2 was a solid ending to this classic horror series.",Halloween II
264,SoloHero5,If you watch it... Watch the Directors Cut!,4,23 February 2010,"I'm not going to say this is amazing but I'm certainly not going to say this was unbearable. I can't judge the negative reviews because I never saw the theatrical version of the movie but I can say that the directors cut was rather enjoyable. I'm no die-hard Zombie fan but I did like devils rejects and Halloween and this was not quite as good but worth watching if you liked the first.The acting was mostly good. Malcolm MacDowell is always a treat. And Brad Dourif was also nice to see. The story had many flaws but also an entertaining and disturbing feel that is expected from Zombie.I say avoid the original version and try out the DC version, if you don't like it then I'm sorry for the recommendation.",Halloween II
265,Philattio,Intense.,6,24 April 2010,"This movie only just released in New Zealand a few weeks before I have written this review. First of all I am a Halloween fan. I have seen all the Halloween films at least ten times each. When I first saw Rob Zombies remake of Halloween 2007 I was completely blown away, it was a masterpiece. Halloween 2 kicks off straight away. I will begin to start with Laurie; she has changed so contrastingly from her nerdy, quirky, fun and ""bookwormish"" character as conveyed in the first film. Laurie Strode is now extremely unwell and has developed symptoms of a mental disorders as she suffers from hallucinations, panic attacks and severe nightmares. Scout Taylor Comptons portrayal of a messed up Laurie is so convincing and so intense with raw emotion that I believed she definitely deserved an award. But please let me remind you that she is like no other Laurie you have ever seen, she is swearing and cursing non-stop, she is drinking and taking large amounts of prescription drugs, her style has changed drastically to a hippy, alternative style look. I am every pleased with Scouts performance, and its good to see the lead girl actually reacting long term wise to the massacre in the previous film.The depressing yet radical cinematography is very dark and dreamlike with more dull with the look of even a classic horror film. I was not too happy with many off the kills scenes in fact I was more interested in Laurie's character development than disturbingly brutal death scenes. Such as the murder in the Rabbit in Red strip club. I found most of the deaths unnecessary and I felt that Mr Zombie may have crossed the line. Now the white horse. Yes, Sheri Moon Zombie is back again as a white angelic dressed woman who appears with a white horse and Michael Myers as a young child who stands by her side. I know that sounds terribly weird. But I did like this idea as it touches on psychiatric themes and hints a motivation for Myers's killings as Debra Myers says ""Only a river of blood and hold us together."" I usually don't like when a actor is recasted though it has sometimes succeeded with Maggie Gyllenhaal replacing Katie Holmes in Batman or Julianne Moore replacing Jodie Foster in the Hannibal movies. I really did think that Chase Wright Vanek did a much better job than Daeg Faerch, either way I did like them both equally, but Chase Wright Vanek conveys this eerie evilness with his and deeper voice. Halloween 2 is not a waste of time. It is no doubt a very intense movie. Before you press play on that DVD player be aware that this is a very seriously INTENSE, EM0TIONAL, SYMBOLIC piece of work. Right now I do not know if I like this film or not, but I definitely do not hate it. I'm just not attracted by such intensity.Dear Rob Zombie, Please direct Halloween 3. Do it with care, make Laurie kill Michael in a big dramatic vengeful and brave way (again 2007 ending was awesome). bring back Loomis, Annie, Laurie and Sheriff Bracket. END your series as a trilogy. Resolve Annie and Laurie's rough patches. Tone down Loomis's unpleasing desire for blood money. Create one more Halloween that resolves every characters problems. And look at some of your murder scenes and think... Should I really keep that in the film? Peace.",Halloween II
266,chrisbarker187,Atrocious!!! An absolute slap in the face to the original series!!!,7,24 October 2014,"Words cannot even express how much I hate this film!! First of all they made Michael into Rob Zombie himself, which was a truly pathetic thing to do. It is a white trash, over the top, foul mouthed rotten piece of dog poop of a film. They changed Michael's look, turned him into a hillbilly. Dr. Loomis is an absolute S.O.B in this one. Laurie was annoying and whiny as can be. Annie was a B.I.T.C.H. The only likable character was Sheriff Bracket. The kills were, granted, inventive but because of too much shaky cam you didn't know what on earth was happening. Their was no use of the theme, which didn't make sense, and Rob even said himself, the theme didn't fit in any of the scenes, that clearly means it's not a Halloween film!!! They copied the story of Jason as Michael sees his mum and some pointless white horse. Young Michael, played by a different actor, looks like a little girl yet again. Michael hardly ever wears his mask. The swearing is atrocious, the nudity is too much. This film is just terrible, compared to his 1st, this is complete, utter garbage. So over the top. If I could give this film 2 things it would be the acting and the opening scene. That's it. Everything else about this film sucks. It is horrible. Complete and utter trash!!!",Halloween II

269,GoddessCeCe,Absolutely terrifying! Scared me out of my mind!,9,29 August 2009,"Let me preface that I am a frequent solo movie goer. I often like to enjoy movies by myself without others talking or interrupting my experience. I can honestly say this is the first time I regret going to a movie alone. This film is absolutely terrifying and I wish I had brought someone with me. I can't remember the last time I was that genuinely scared, freaked out and just overall spooked by a film. It takes a LOT to frighten me. Most horror movies don't scare me in the least. This one knocked the wind out of me.Rob Zombie truly is a master of horror. His direction is eerie and haunting, the cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, dizzying and brilliant... it never fails to freak you out. As always, he hired many actors that have that hippy, back-country-psycho look about them. They give each scene more true authenticity. One thing note worthy is that Zombie did cut back on the nudity and expletives in this one (compared to his original HALLOWEEN). He did not, however, cut back on the terrifying and gory scenes, keeping true to its roots.Scout Taylor Compton is back, and has upped her A-game. She is a wonderfully skilled, genuinely real actress who breathes life into every single scene she is. There is something so beautiful and heartbreaking about her portrayal. She has mastered the ""scream"" in a way that Jamie Lee never could (IMHO).And I won't say much more about the movie specifically (I don't want to ruin it for anyone), but I want to point out the two scariest scenes in my opinion were the Ambulance scene, and one in which Laurie Strobe was having a nightmare. Just thinking about them... oh, man.If you want to be scared stiff, go see this movie. I still have finger nail marks embedded into my palm.",Halloween II
270,Funboy1615,My opinion,2,31 August 2009,"Rob Zombie hit it good with House Of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects. Now hes milking it and trying to redo a classic. I saw his Halloween...It was garbage. Why redo a classic when the movie still stands? Im so sick of all these 70s/80s horror remakes. The originals are always better...We just proved that with The Last House On The Left. The original is more than 25 years old yet its more experimental and more hardcore Ruthanne the remake. Look at something original.....Frontiers...Martyrs.....Versus...Fudoh. All American ""horror"" nowadays is remakes or Asian ghost stories or remakes of 70s/80s films. Where are the new ideals?

272,njscreenwriter,Intentionally trashed?,4,1 February 2010,"My first thoughts after watching this were that maybe Rob Zombie intentionally made a movie so horrible that no one would dare try to continue with a sequel.The best thing about this movie is the look - really I thought the shots of Michael trekking his way through the fields and woods were beautiful shots. I like the grainy look, and the muted colors in many of the scenes. I kept thinking if anyone were to ever adapt an Edgar Allen Poe story into a movie this would be an appropriate look.Malcolm McDowell was fantastic - his portrayal of such a disgusting excuse for a human being made me feel that he is the villain in the movie rather than Michael. By the end, I was rooting against Dr. Loomis.The rest I won't even bother with - much of the movie just didn't make sense, whether it was the way a character acted or reacted, the dream sequences or the timeline.

273,massivelaughs,Was praying for Myers to stab me 50 times!!!!!!!!,1,3 January 2010,"I have seen several reviews on here and anything above 1 out of 10 is a downright disgrace. This is one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life, and i cant offer anyone one single reason to watch it. This seems like it was scripted by someone who was making notes on toilet roll whilst taking a dump, if film companies are bankrolling this, it gives all of us out there a chance. The main characters make you wish you could teleport into this nightmare and slice their throats open, Scout Taylor Crompton who plays Laurie Strode has one of the easiest jobs in acting history and still does it terribly, she runs around for 2 hours screaming her head off and shouting the 'F' word, Malcolm McDowell isn't much better why Zombie has made him into a total a**hole is beyond me, and it just makes you appreciate Donald Pleasance's performances in the originals all that more. (Also in the first one, unless i was watching a different version of the film, didn't McDowell get his eyes squashed by Myers yet they are totally intact in this film.) And don't even get me started on the ghost lady with the white horse, i don't even think the creators are aware what she is doing in it, the fact is the film is so dark and depressing they probably thought 'Oh lets stick something nice and bright in the film so the viewers don't get sleepy' oops too late!!!! The original had the action taking place the same night as the original, in this one there is a year gap between the two, which does not make sense and how come it took Myers a year to get back and what has he been doing in this time, oh god i am boring myself even talking about this. The only saving grace for me is there is excessive and i mean excessive amounts of gore which to me is acceptable for a horror movie, but when i saw the word 'Zombie' on the poster i always thought it as referring to the director, not the actors in the film.

Utterly pointless and terrible story. If you can even call it a story. Too bad, Rob. You really surprised me with the first one, so I had high hopes going into this one. I was even excited.

275,celebration72,Rob Zombie ruined the Halloween movies with part 1 (2007) & his train wreck sequel,1,28 October 2020,I am a HUGE FAN of the Halloween franchise & Halloween 2 (2009) was beyond awful & when I saw Halloween 1 (2007) Reboot in the theater I was so disappointed & Rob Zombie made it so gory that it was just way to much. Rob Zombie ruined the Halloween movies & yes at the Box office Halloween 1 made 80.4 million BUT I think just like me everyone was excited to see it because it had been 5 years since any Halloween movie had been made BUT Rob Zombie's sequel Halloween 2 (2009) only made 39.4 million huge difference from his 1st movie with a box office difference of $45.5 Million. I didn't even see Halloween 2 (2009) in the theater I ended up watching it DVD. IF you're a huge fan of the Halloween franchise & haven't watched Rob Zombies Halloween (2007) & Halloween 2 (2009) I BEG YOU NOT to even waste your time to watch Halloween 1 (2007) or Halloween 2 (2009) because both are just so awful BUT thank god to Director: David Gordon Green for continuing the Original Halloween movies with Halloween (2018) not sure why he named it Halloween when the original 1978 movie has the same name & it takes place after the original Halloween 1978 movie 40 yrs later so Halloween 2-8 don't exist with this 2018 movie but in my opinion it should take place after Halloween 2 1981 because Halloween 2 pick up where Halloween 1 left off it opens up with the end of Halloween 1 1978 & Halloween 2 (1981) starts on the same night from Halloween 1 (1978),Halloween II

The script is a absolute joke, the first 20 or so minutes are Lauri walking in a f**kin hospital and getting chased by Michael. Oh and guess what its a f*cking dream. Halloween 2 begins with a f**king plot twist. I could not bring myself to like any of the characters whatsoever, they're all f*cking annoying and i wanted them to die. If Lauri wasn't annoying enough in the remake, she just b**ches and moans throughout this one. Zombie even managed to utterly destroy the character of Loomis, he completely denies the fact that Michael is alive on all levels, whereas he should be the only one concerned that he's alive. The plot is even more clichéd then say the 5th halloween, its a year after the events of the remake and Lauri just gets drunk, and get's everyone around her killed. She goes a lame ass party, and her friends that host the party get killed, than Michael kidnaps her. The directors cut has a different ending but oh my god was i ever laughing so hard. If you think this is a waste of time so far, it ends with Michael getting shot to death(he falls and thats it.), than Lauri pulls out a knife and gets shot to death. Wow, really?

278,Roxasneo44,"""A Bloody Good-Time!""",9,11 January 2010,"Rob Zombie's slasher 'Halloween II' tames a lot of the story's dynamic account of symbolism. It also rehashes much of the characters. Like Laurie Strode, for example. Zombie breathes life into this hopeless blob of a character. Much like Michael, Laurie is destitute of realism. She continuously blacks out on and off during this entry of the series. What I love about this movie is just how genuine, or acute the characters had seemed. Rob really fleshed out the dialogue, as well. By that, I don't mean the excessive use of the word 'f**k'. There were some pretty witty lines in there that really had me going for a while. He also scored some points with me on how frantic the characters appeared. ...I'm not going to spoil anything for you all, but I will tell you that it didn't blow. However, this movie isn't a normal Halloween film. It's so . . . unique that your typical fangirl (or boy) would protest about any given aspect. Such as the OMFG!LAURIE'S EVIL! theme of this symbolic film. Everyone describes this as being most off-putting, which isn't true at all. You don't bounce back from a freak accident like it's nothing... People don't seem to understand that. This, thus, characterizes H2 as an innovative step in the right direction. Halloween was being dumbed down with each horrific entry after another. After I watched H2O, I nearly panicked and lost all faith in the series altogether. Halloween: Resurrection butchered the franchise, too. Those films as a whole were a mistake, and I feel as though that Zombie actually put an end to the path that Halloween was leading. This also leaves me to say that more half of the people on this site are wrong about Rob Zombie. He's not a money-hungry fiend that wants to murder John Carpenter's compelling story. He's an artist . . . one who objects to milking a similar style . . . And that's why Halloween II had a gritty feel to it. It was his own vision; something that no one had ever touched before. Rating: 9/10Pros: Amazing Story - Fleshed-Out Characters - Symbolism - Drawn-Out Dialogue - Screwed-Up Slasher ScenesCons:Poor Acting - A Horrid Fanbase(It's true. Whether you like it or not, the Halloween fanbase really has gone to hell. I love the majority of the films, with the exception of H20, Resurrection, and the Curse of Michael Myers. H2 and the original are two of the best entries in the series. Whoever disagrees with these statements obviously didn't understand the substance in this movie.)I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Rob Zombie films. Although, I'm not much of a Rob!fan, I do adore his take on the Halloween series. If you disliked his remake, then I strongly suggest that you don't view this movie at all. However, if you love gore and guts and whatnot, then go ahead and pick up this title. You'll probably like it. Maybe not . . . But, y'know, it's all about taste--in my opinion.",Halloween II
279,PinkPurple,More Trick than Treat:,5,21 October 2010,"I would have to call my experience of viewing of this modern 'retake' of Halloween 2 as sort of the equivalent of what you'd imagine a cinema experience if you were viewing on drugs might look like. I've sat through a number of films such as this, where the storyline invites you to keep guessing what's real and what's supposed to be imagination or fantasy and this story's atmosphere was extremely distorting and confusing even for me. Admitably the imagery will hold some appeal I'm sure, it's certainly ominous looking and detailed but it also has a tendency to distract from the story.It's like watching a graphic novel or a dark morbid painting coming to life on the big screen. The constant visions of Michael's mother looking like a white witch, standing next to a white horse are such vivid iconic images, a comic book panel made flesh. I personally thought they made some wrong choices with the direction of the series here. At this point they were free from the introduction baggage of the previous movie and as such I honestly feel that their aim should have been to go to different places with the stories they could tell with these established characters but they chose here to basically rehash things that had already been done within the original series of films, most notably the twist at the end. I felt the opening went on a little too long as well, especially since again, it's nature turns out to be another time worn-out oldest of the old horror movie film making tricks. So I would have liked to see the remake series actually explore other established characters that were left originally untouched upon. For instance, I had heard somewhere that one of the original sequels was initially going to tell the tale of the kids who were baby sat by Laurie on the original film's 'the night he came home', Tommy Doyle and Lindsey Wallace all grown up and how everything had effected them. Now I would personally have preferred to see the remake series at least take that sort of premise and run with it as it would have been a fresh take on the established myth of the series and would have utilised areas uncharted and provided the opportunity of the reboot gaining it's own identity rather than rehashing the same basic plot lines over and over.Michael Myers for example has been cost his unique appeal as both a genuinely terrifying villain and questionable force of nature. If ever there was a character who didn't need to be explained and probably shouldn't be it's him. Michael himself is the disturbed mute human being while his persona known as 'The Shape' represents his superstitious mystique, the powerful 'idea' of him, this mythic perception of what he supposedly really is, his being a boogie-man arch-type. In the original movie this remained up in the air and thus created an air of the unknown about him and anything scary is the unknown of something. Thus in these remakes he's become to comfortable, we know too much. His revamped look is a combination of emo and hobo, although actor Tyler Mane's sheer size is the sole plus factor in the presence department. I also didn't care for this take on the Dr. Loomis character. While I actually enjoyed Malcolm McDowell's performance in the first remake, here I find he's strayed too far from any recognisable traits; he may as well be an entirely different character. The 'fame going to his head' character arc they gave him was interesting on paper but I don't think it was so well executed in the development thus he comes off too straight down the line unlikeable and the supposed pay off in the climax doesn't really add up too much. I feel that even if he was going to cash in, as it were, he probably would have done it before he actually failed to rehabilitate Michael. He did after all fail by his own admission, in his own mind and it affected him so significantly that this now drastic a switch in gears is pretty much a one hundred and eighty, so how his character can supposedly carve this media hero status from the ashes of his career is puzzling. I also didn't get how he survived the first movie; I had remembered him being killed off in pretty clear cut fashion. Malcolm is a great character actor but Dr. Loomis is just one of those parts that the original actor, the late Donald Pleasance simply made his own and left too permanent a stamp on for me to be objective about I suppose. He embodied the character so well, you don't associate him with Donald all that much, you see him and think of the character, where as looking at Malcolm, you can't get past this sense of 'it's Malcolm doing his impersonation of an iconic role.' On the other side of the coin, I found the new Laurie very appealing, even if I wasn't always found of some of the aspects of her character development, particularly her direction by the end of this film.But ultimately the difference between the modern and original films is the fact that it was like watching a live documentary where as the modern movies may be interesting to look at artistically, yet unlike the originals you won't be so draw-en in, that for moments you forget it's staged. The best thing I can say is that I'm sure some people may get an art form appeal from its imagery alone.",Halloween II
280,sygtnok,A new candidate for the worst movie ever. Nothing of the original masterpiece remains.,1,30 September 2013,"There is nothing in the films that isn't bad. How it's possible to make such a bad remake of one of the best horror movies ever made is beyond me. Everything is wrong! Why does the mother appear as a ghost? Why are all the talented actors of the original replaced with ugly lousy wannabes? And how is it possible to miss everything about Myers!!! Michael Myers were not angry in the original, he didn't make angry grunts when he killed, he didn't rape and NO, you didn't see his face! And when we are at it: Why does his face need to be so hairy? What makes Michael Myers one of the best horror villains is that he is not angry or any of those things. He is true evil. He has no feelings at all, as they say in the originals; in his eyes, there are nothing but an empty darkness. He moves to kill, but he does so without any showing of emotions, like a tidal wave of dark emptiness, removed of everything that makes us human. And none of this is captured in this piece of excrement.",Halloween II
281,p1u9,Why does everyone hate this movie? H2 Is a great film & here is why!,7,3 September 2009,"First I don't understand why everyone is hating on this film. Did you people not know what kind of movie you were going to see when you bought the actual ticket? It is written by Rob Zombie.So I honestly knew this movie was going to much different then the Rob's 1st Halloween film.So all the people complaining about all the cursing & the *F bomb* being thrown all over the place.If you have seen any of Rob's previous films you should have expected this.Now on to more important things.I love the way the film started with Laurie waking up on the stretcher in the hospital & all the screaming.That was sick really cool plus it sort of freaked me out. I also like how Rob kept it somewhat authentic to the original H2 in 1981.By having Micheal chase Laurie through the hospital. I thought those were some of the best shots in the film.Especially when Laurie is running outside in the rain & Micheal is behind her!Why are you people complaining about all the killing. It's supposed to be SLASHER FILM people! I don't understand what you people are thinking.Rob Zombie gave us more of Micheal's background story in the 1st Halloween.So I knew in this 2cd film there was going to be more kills & blood & less of a story plot.Which is exactly what I wanted.Because in the 1st film I did enjoy having a little background history on why Micheal is the way he is.But I still wanted more killing.Which is what Rob has delivered us here.This is a strait slasher gore fest.Micheal kills everything & everyone in sight trying to get to Laurie. He even kills a dog & eats its insides! Very cannibalistic! I also dislike how people are dissing on the characters of ""Laurie"" & ""Annie"".Would you be the same a year later if something like what happened in the first film happened to you?Why are people complaining about Rob Zombie putting his wife in every movie? It's his film he can put whoever he wants in it.Seriously why complain about her in this movie when she barley had any lines or much acting to do.Why would he not he put the same mother in the second one? She did an alright job to me in this film due to the main fact that all she does is stand beside the white horse telling Micheal to bring Laurie home.Some of the people that are writing reviews on IMDb need 2 think a lot more about what they are thinking & typing when writing a review.For all of you still complaining & wondering what the ""White Horse"" has to do with anything? Did you even watch the movie or did you miss the first five minutes while buying Drinks & popcorn at the snack stand? The White horse theory is explained & written in the first few lines at the first of the film. I believe it is an excerpt from ""The Subconscious Psychosis of dreams"" Rob can't be perfect people you have to use your own imagination when watching a film.Not everything can be explained for you in a movie!There is only one thing that people are saying on IMDb that I do agree with.That is Dr.Samuel Loomis's character.Rob just did not give much thought on his character because he was thinking about what to do with the rest of the movie.I'm not sure but you can ask Mr. Rob if you like! Because I agree Rob did make Dr. Loomis look like a complete *DoucheBag* That is one of if the biggest flaws in the movie. Now on to the middle & the ending.I was sort of very sad when Annie died in this one.I really wanted her to live for some reason. I liked her character & sort of had goosebumps when Laurie comes in to find her best friend dead & slaughtered again in the bathroom! Now to give my point of view of the ending is my point of view. So many of you Halloween fans might take the ending in different. But I almost sort of expected it.The thoughts in my head before seeing the movie was that in this 1 Laurie is either going 2 die which probably most likely would never happen or that she would kill Micheal & end the series all together.I believe that Laurie simply went crazy after the first encounter with Micheal &then having to deal with him again in this second film made her a bit more how can I say this Hardcore, stronger, & a lot more crazy.Oh & the thoughts about her taking Micheal's mask off in order for her to kill him is a good theory.But ya I strongly believe that Laurie lost it after the first encounter & having the visions in this film only backs up my theory more. So I loved how she stabbed Micheal to death & came out with the mask on! I thought that was so cool on Rob's writing &directing part. To sum it all up to the very last shot in the movie with Laurie smiling at the end in the psycho ward should tell you all something!Come on people think about it?! Use your imagination.I know Rob's not going to do another one and I appreciate him for that. *Hint Hint* He did only continue ""House of 1,000 corpses"" with ""Devils Rejects"" & hopefully will not return for a third installment! I believe Laurie Strode is now somewhat sort of Micheal Myers in a way.Thank you Rob Zombie for completing & ending the franchise the way you wanted to do it! I enjoyed it. No one walked out of the theater where I watched it here in Oklahoma. Thanks Rob Zombie & I hope you continue to make more films as good as this one and your previous works of cinematic art.",Halloween II
282,gabegiddens,Enjoyable but not great,6,22 April 2018,"I enjoy this film. I like that Rob Zombie tried to make something different rather than making the same movie over and over but there are several things wrong with this movie. First, what I liked. I liked Malcom McDowell, Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris. I liked the hospital sequence. But the writing sucks. The dialogue is pretty bad and Scout Taylor Compton is awful. The movie still suffers from overly gory violence, over the top swearing and unnecessarily gratuitous nudity. I didn't hate the fact that they showed Michael unmasked but it was jarring. On one hand, it made sense. Why would he walk around everywhere dressed up in a costume. On the other hand, it made him less menacing. In the end, this film is mediocre at best.",Halloween II
283,snivlem138,"The 1st one was AMAZING, this one is AWFUL",1,31 October 2010,"Rob Zombie's first Halloween film is awesome. I like it even better than the original and it's my favorite Halloween film. Rob Zombie's Halloween II however is awful. I really looked forward to this and it was a huge letdown. The story is awful. The characters are awful. It's awful all around.The most obnoxious thing about this film is that the whole thing is just an excuse for Rob Zombie to stick his wife in a movie. Her role is pointless, intrusive and dumb.On the plus side some of the kills in this are really great. Lots of gore and violence whenever Michael dispatches someone. However not even that can save the film. It's just bad.I wish this was never made.",Halloween II
284,nZulauf71,Michael Myers is back and he brought his family,6,3 November 2011,"I enjoyed the first Rob Zombie Halloween installment, but I am still deciding how I feel about this. If you are looking for a good Halloween movie you won't like this, but if you want a good Rob Zombie movie, you will enjoy Halloween II. I liked somethings about this movie and I disliked somethings.A big complaint from last movie for me was the shaky camera, this rarely happened in Halloween II. As the aspect of a Rob Zombie movie I actually enjoyed it. The blood, gore, and the extreme violence was worth watching, even though most of the time it was very hard to watch. At one point I felt sick to my stomach. I did not like a few things about the characters. Sheri Moon Zombie reprises her role as Deborah Myers, and was very good again. I did not like the new boy that played Michael Myers at the age of 10. He did not say much but the one scene at the beginning with his mom in the asylum, did not have me believing that he had just killed his family. He seemed to innocent compared to the boy in the first movie. And once again Scout Taylor-Compton was a poor choice as Laurie Strode. I did not like her in the first Halloween and I think she was even worse in this one. All she had to do was scream and cry....not a hard job. She annoyed me just doing those two things.Somethings I enjoyed about this movie, most things I did not enjoy. But as a Rob Zombie movie, I enjoyed this. So my advice is if you're looking for a good Halloween movie, stay away from this movie. But if you are looking for a gory, violent Rob Zombie movie, you will enjoy this. Oh, and beware you might get ticked off in the ending!My Final Review: 6 out of 10",Halloween II
285,dinosaur-darrell,Awful,1,22 October 2009,"This could not have been any worse, the way it has been made the way it doesn't really seem to flow are just a complete contrast to Rob Zombie's 2007 Remake. The film starts very promising with a kind of remake of the original Halloween 2, its intense and actually scary. From there it goes down hill... nothing happens for around an hour of the film, there's 4 different stories going on and i think Rob had difficulty choosing which one was most important. There's Laurie who's mentally broken after the events in the first movie which is kind of interesting except for another story line which is her dreams where she sees the most annoying things such as her mother and young Michael and a white horse, it just doesn't work well in the film. There's Micheal's story which is by far the most pointless story he may as well have not been in it because all that happens is he pops up at some location in front of someone who then thinks they can take him on... they die obviously, the noise effects and gore seem a bit over the top even to the point where they arnt scary. and Michael grunts which is just the most annoying thing, he didn't do it in the first one so why do it in this one it seems a bit pointless. Then there is Loomis. One of the best characters in the entire series. Rob just had him in it for the sake of it, he doesn't add anything to the film except to pop up chatting s**t about his book which isn't important. He just should have not made this film. I didn't feel there was any effort put into it, it just seemed to be made off the top of Robs head and there were some good ideas there but we weren't given time to focus on them because another story would come up. By the end of this film you cannot wait for it to end and the end is just rushed you see Laurie and Michael together for around 5 minutes in the whole film and its a complete let down. I wouldn't even bother to watch this film there's no point in being let down just watch the 2007 remake and leave it at that.",Halloween II
286,charlies123,A Big Disappointment,1,1 February 2010,"Wow, what a disappointment. I went into this expecting to be thrilled, and to experience horror. Unfortunately that is not at all what I got.I want to say from the start that I am a Rob Zombie fan. I also thought his remake of Halloween I was pretty good. Not great, but good. And, therefore, I think it was fair to expect this one to be good.What we get is really pretty awful. What a shame. I have many complaints. First, the volume. My gosh, my ears are still ringing. Way too loud. Second, the profanity. Way, way, way too much. Seems like every other word was the 'f' word. It is very noticeable, what is up with that? Third, and this is a big one, killing of the characters before we got to know them at all. Some character development would have been nice.I love blood and gore. I usually complain that movies do not have enough. But this one has way too much. Sheer volume of deaths does not necessarily translate into a good movie. (Jeez, I can't believe I am saying that, lol) Finally, the actress playing Laurie was a terrible choice. Not likable at all. And Rob Zombie gave his wife a roll with a little real time in the movie and that was a big mistake. She is not a good actress at all. She should practice her acting skills (which are presently non-existent) somewhere other than a major motion picture.",Halloween II
287,murnank,"Disturbing, Distressing and Seeped in Atmosphere.",10,31 August 2009,"In ""Halloween 2"" Rob Zombie returns to Haddonfield, Illinois the fictitious small town Americana whose residents are slowly recovering from the legacy of serial killer Michael Myers who's trail of bloodshed one year earlier on Halloween night hangs over the town like a monument to death. The story picks up moments after Zombie's original ""Halloween"". Laurie Strode has survived her initial violent encounter with Michael Myers and is being rushed to the Haddonfield clinic along with her seriously wounded best friend Annie Brackett and Myers Psychiatrist Dr Sam Loomis. We quickly discover that (Surprise of all surprises) Myers isn't really dead and the first 20 minutes of the movie becomes an exercise in relentless terror and suspense as Myers slaughters his way through the clinic to find Laurie and finish off what he started. Flash forward one year later. Michael Myers is now missing, presumed dead. Haddonfield and its populace are preparing for the Halloween celebrations and among these small town folk we find Laurie, Annie and her father Sheriff Brackett cooped up together in the same remote farmhouse outside town. Dr Loomis is also in the area promoting his new book ""The Devil walks among us"" based on the previous years murders. Each character is dealing with the aftermath of last years massacre in varying self-destructive ways. Physically and emotionally scarred Annie has become a recluse and won't leave the farmhouse. Sheriff Brackett has become a neurotic, thinly masking his anxiety for his daughter by playing happy families. Dr Loomis is wallowing in the escapism of fame from his best selling book and Laurie has become a functioning bi-polar individual who from frequent visits to her counselor (Played by the excellent Margot Kidder) we learn her troubled and disturbing nightmares are challenging her sanity.What Zombie has created here is a clever character study. He reveals to us a universe where nothing and no one is pretty. His characters muddling through disaster and loss are portrayed with such ultra realism and powerful emotion we care about them deeply so that by the time Myers returns to Haddonfield to kill again the tension is incredibly high while rooting for them to survive. Zombie could easily have taken the formulaic root, phoned this one in and dealt us a sequel that mirrors the original series. Instead he takes us into his world. This is His Haddonfield and His Halloween. A movie seeped in dreaded atmosphere and menace where the charming, wood framed shops and houses, the cutesy but creepy decorations of Halloween old sparsely hide the grim reality of what could actually happen when a violent, deeply disturbed killer targets an unprepared town.This movie is a work of art, especially compared to most of the ""Halloween"" sequels and most other horror movies of late. It's intelligent, it challenges you to ask questions, doesn't spoon-feed the viewer and has four main characters (Laurie, Annie, Brackett, Loomis) that are so realistically developed and driven by such diverse psychological responses to the same problem it almost feels like you're watching a documentary on their lives. The spectre of Myers mother could very well be the spectre of death. We are dealing with folklore here also. Halloween is a time when traditionally the veil between this world and the so called supernatural world is meant to be so thin beings can pass from one to the other. It's true she is meant to be one of Myers multiple personalities, his justification or rationalization for slaughtering those around him. This is what Zombie intended. Or is it? What if she is ""pure evil"" taking on the guise of someone Myers trusted the most. A demon manipulating him into believing that ""Only a river of blood can bring us together""... This opens the movie up into a whole other world. After all, Laurie as she slips further and further into insanity starts to see her as well. Could Zombie be saying that the insane are closer to evil than we could have believed. This is a movie that leaves you unsettled long after the credits have rolled.",Halloween II
288,simon27203,What a disappointment,2,21 October 2021,Don't waste your time on this movie. And I thought that Halloween 3 was the worst movie in the franchise until I saw Rob Z Halloween 2 . This movie was bad .,Halloween II
289,dangitsdanny,Hear me out...,8,6 February 2021,"I actually really liked this movie. It follows Rob Zombie's sequel to his remake of the horror classic 'Halloween.' Zombie's remake of the original mostly follows its original storyline, while adding some storyline of Michael in his childhood, that honestly I didn't feel like it was necessary. But Zombie's sequel strays far from the original Halloween II and basically does his own thing. If you're a Halloween fan but not a Rob Zombie fan I could understand if this movie isn't for you. And if you're a Rob Zombie fan, you'll probably enjoy this movie. As a Halloween fan and a Rob Zombie fan, this might be one of my favorite Rob Zombie movies to date.The main reason being is I love how Zombie was really able to capture Laurie's struggles with PTSD accurately, specifically in the director's cut. This is something that H20 touches on lightly but really missed the mark. The only thing with this that I really didn't like was Laurie's visions of her birth mother with the white horse. Like how, why? But her attitude change from the first to the second is something I really appreciated and is something we almost never see in horror sequels. As much as I love the Scream franchise and Sydney Prescott, she kind of just moves on with her life as if nothing has happened, she only becomes smarter and stronger, which is a cool idea but just so far off from reality.There were some certain things that a lot of people have already mentioned that I didn't like. First of all being Michael grunting and even speaking. Why? Michael Myers has always been a silent killing machine and even was in Zombie's first depiction. Another thing I didn't like and mentioned above was the visions shared by both Michael and Laurie of Deborah, often accompanied by a white horse. I felt like this was just completely out of left field and just plain off and was only put in for Zombie to put his wife in yet another one of his movies (no disrespect to Sheri Moon Zombie).But ultimately I felt like the good outweighed the bad and I know for certain that I'm in the minority here but I think if you just keep an open mind, you might actually like this movie.",Halloween II
290,adamdoyle-40893,The perfect example of amateur hour filmmaking,1,11 September 2018,"Ive seen this film, both versions a couple of times and it is so badly made - the narrative, the direction, the framing of shots all horrid - basic conversations are filmed so closely to characters faces - there is zero world built up outside of the filmmakers redneck exterior - the fact that he can't see past his own vulgar existence is only hammered home by the fact that his wife (who is a dire actor) is is all of his films.Any scene involving her in this film is completely unnecessary - thinly veiled symbolism for the most pedestrian of plot lines - this film is a trash fire.",Halloween II
291,hannahclac,Nonsensical and ridiculous,2,8 August 2021,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to start. Rob Zombie is an interesting character. I liked House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Reject. I even liked his first Halloween. But this one was just ridiculous. I don't know why he decided to add supernatural elements to it. It's a slasher, not supernatural although you could argue that Michael Meyers is supernatural since he never dies. However, adding ghosts to this was just dumb. Why is he seeing his mother and his younger self? You think it's just his imagination but then it's revealed that Laurie can see them too. And if they are ghosts then why are they seeing a young Michael? It just doesn't make sense. Rob Zombie must have been on something when he wrote this. I also don't understand why Michael's ghost mom encourages him to kill. In Rob Zombie's first Halloween, we see that his mom is horrified by his crimes and doesn't encourage them. So why is this version of his mom so different? It seemed incredibly pointless like literally the only reason Rob Zombie created these ghost characters is so he could give his wife screen time. Also, the child actor who played Michael in the first one was a much better actor and was really good at giving off creepy vibes. It seemed unnecessary to even have scenes of Michael as a child if they couldn't get the same actor to play him.My other issue with this movie is that it's incredibly violent. Don't get me wrong, I love horror as much as the next person and I'm even a fan of Saw and Hostel which are known to be violent horror movies. However, this movie just seemed over the top on the violence, blood, and gore. That's not what makes a movie scary. Hostel and Saw were violent/gorey but they had a plot. This movie doesn't. It's just violence, blood, gore, slow motion scenes, and ghosts. We don't need to see someone be stabbed 50 times in order to be scared. We just see random characters get killed along the way of him searching for Laurie. Literally no plot and no character development. Also, writing Michael as a homeless woodsman who eats dogs doesn't make the movie scarier either. That dog eating scene was incredibly pointless.Dr. Loomis is also incredibly pointless in this movie. He serves no purpose other than to be the reason Laurie finds out she's Michael's sister and get killed at the end. He's suddenly a Prima Dona who adds no substance to the movie. And finally, why is Laurie a completely different person from the first movie? I understand she went through trauma but there is no resemblance of who she was in the first movie. All of a sudden, she's a rock chick who doesn't know how to use a hairbrush. There are just so many things that don't make sense. Nice try, Rob Zombie but I give it a 2/10. The only reason I don't give it is 1 is because it obviously kept me entertained enough to watch it until the end, and I liked the surprise appearance of Octavia Spencer (she was less known at the time so it makes sense) although I didn't enjoy watching her get stabbed over and over.If you enjoy watching violent movies with no plot or story to tell, this movie is for you!",Halloween II
292,stormplayz,yikes,2,8 October 2021,"The first Zombie remake was a bad movie, but not terrible. The realistic gore and special effects, Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of Loomis, and Tyler Mane as Michael Myers helped keep it from going off the rails. This time, Zombie clearly has 100% control over where the story is going, and that's not a good thing.The acting is atrocious; Scout Taylor-Compton once again has the screen presence and charisma of a table, McDowell looks bored and confused the whole time, and none of the supporting actors do much to help out. Mane is still scary as ever, but it's a little hard to focus on Michael doing his thing with the awful editing, which just cuts between camera angles every second and completely takes away any of the fear factor.As for the story, there's not much of one. Michael's mom is thrown back into the plot simply because Rob Zombie wanted his wife to be in the movie. There's a subplot with some ghost and a white horse that makes no sense. Loomis is doing a book tour for no apparent reason. And did I mention the kills are bad too?I'll give the movie a little credit for the hospital scene (which ripped off the original H2 by the way) because it wasn't half bad. Other than that, you can throw Halloween 2 in the trash, because that's exactly where it belongs.",Halloween II
293,Aeromaxx777,These guys aren't that religious,8,10 April 2010,"This movie puts a new meaning to the phrase ""What the heck is going on here?!"". I mean if you watched the original series back in the 1980's, you will be confused as I am. First of all, what is with this mother agenda that's been Michael Myers' issue throughout the film? Don't tell me he is the new Norman Bates. And that costume of his; It looks just like Jason Voorhees' clothes back when he's fighting Freddy Krueger. And let's not forget his face; two words Michael: ""SHAVE UP!"" he looked like a beggar in a dark forest. It's a nightmare to think how his long beard and mustache fit in that rubber mask. Although his methods of murder is as spotless as ever; A true blue slasher.At the middle of the film, I somehow noticed Laurie Strode/Angel Myers, is not as innocent as I liked her to be. She became a God hater didn't she? I mean just look at her bedroom, there is a poster of Charles Manson and a slogan that says ""In Charley We Trust"". My attraction to her just went down the toilet. I must admit though: ""SHE DESERVES TO DIE!"". I hate people who turn their backs on God. That's just wrong! The same goes to most of the characters involved Michael Myers' killing spree, they all deserve to die painfully slow. Don't worry Laurie darling, I'll come visit you in your mental hospital sometimes. But I won't ask you to marry me |o|.Anyway, the story is something I can't put my finger into. It is a mixture of all the movies until Halloween H20. But Laurie is still a teenager and still blabbers the words S***, F*** and B**** all the time; bad girl, Bad Girl, BAD GIRL!.P.S: I love Michael Myers' new knife; it's hardcore. Can I have one too? It's for my weapons collection.",Halloween II
294,jdaughtry002,"Good if you like Rob Zombie, Bad if you like John Carpenter's Halloween...",3,22 May 2010,"I will have to say first off, I'm a true fan of older horror movies, and what they stand for in today's modern society. Older horror films from the 70's and 80's shaped, and formed the fear we have today in such films. That being said, I will say I think Rob Zombie ruined this film with his over-the-top weirdness of flashbacks. This film possessed the ""white horse"" ideal of psychiatric nature....whatever that means. Adding too much whipped topping to a dessert makes it taste terrible in my opinion. The beginning was great, with the hospital scenes, very similar to the original Halloween 2, however thats where the similarity stops and the movies falls short of being a typical re-make. However, if you like Rob Zombie (and I absolutely loved House of 1000 Corpses, and Devils Rejects), you will love this flick, but if you are a new-aged horror fan seeking a comparison to the original steer clear. Today there are entirely TOO MANY RE-MAKES of horror films...are directors not talented enough to come up with an all new story and idea?? Who knows..I will wait until someone can ""Thrill Me"" (Night of the Creeps- Tom Atkins) with something truly new.",Halloween II

First of all, why doing remake of such brilliant movies? and the worst part is that it completely ruins the original. Well my idea of Michael Meyers was of a deadly silence , calm, like "" you 're running and i'm walking and I'm still gonna get you.."" that was what scared people. But this.. come on.. whats up with all the blood, and all the rage noises he does when is killing somebody.. And whats with all the stabbing and cutting of heads.. seriously? is this suppose to be scary? just gross nothing else.. Oh and please, Michael, kill this Laurie once and for all because she's a really pain in the ass.. At least Jamie Lee Curtis was classy while she was running away from Michael.. She wasn't screaming and crying and drooling the whole movie..",Halloween II

I've seen much worse horror movies with much more annoying main characters then this movie. IE cheer leaders and boring yuppies. i don't think the movie swears that much for horror as stated. if you were in highly tense scared situation.. you wouldn't say oh golly gosh... you'd say 'uck 'uck 'uck.this is not devil rejects style, rob zombie wanted this film to be different from his others. i think this shows courage and maturity. people who are spoilt on fodder of movies may get uppity and whinge. movies aren't suppose to answer all your questions, aren't suppose to be realistic, just entertain. this movie does this. i had no problems understanding the cut away scenes with the mother in it. this movie is just completely different to anything rob zombie has done before. he doesn't have the horror comedy....the shock morals horror....so don't expect it. the movie is violent but not overly as his early stuff. the main character Laurie is not annoying to me. she's freaked out , that's what she suppose to be. acting is good but not brilliant, but its not Hollywood. its much better than his first halloween and i enjoyed it. readers should make up their own mind and not get swayed by negative criticism like i was. this movie in the long run holds its own and hooray for zombie to try something a bit different. cheers",Halloween II

I prefer originals over remakes. Especially 70 and 80s horror. And Asian and french horror. Now there have been some remakes that I can deal with. I understand this is a new generation andwe gotta put a fresh twist on things. Do I agree with that? No. But they gonna do it anyway so might as well not complain. But for god sake this movie was just horrible. If you wanna go off and put a new twist to Halloween fine (why is beyond me but wutever). But this movie was just completely off. Acting: HORRIBLE (especially by Laurie and Dr. Loomis) were they suppose to be funny? SInce when was Halloween a comedy? The one liners had me annoyed. To be honest the first 20 minutes seemed promising until ::SPOILER:: we find out it was all a dream. THe movie went completely downhill from there. Direction: Horrible. Where was ROb Zombie going with this? Rob Z. pleeeeeeaaaassssseeeee stop directing horror movies. House of 1000 corpses pretty good but just a copy of TCM. And why does his wife HAVE to play in every movie he directs? And why must he have all the same actors in all his movies? Devil's Rejects, not bad. But please NO MORE!!!! Storyline: PATHETIC Suspense: NONE Gore: Pretty good but horror is about atmosphere, creepiness, suspense, twists, uneasiness, musical score, etc...aren't horror directors suppose to know these things. Thank god i didn't pay to see this movie I woulda been so upset. And since when does Michael Myers grunt when he stabs someone???

299,troylcook-1,Better than expected...,5,28 August 2009,"First off, I have to disagree with the comment I just read above. I am a TRUE original Halloween fan and I liked 2009's Halloween 2. I don't think I've ever met anyone more into Michael Myers and Halloween (I've dressed up like Michael Myers for Halloween every year since I was about 13). This is not a remake of Carpenter's second, but a re-visioning on Zombie's behalf; or even a sequel to Zombie's first. It is very gory, very violent, very ""slasher-esque"" with some descent dialogue and not much of a story line. It's a great SLASHER film. I thought it was much better than Zombie's first, although parts of Hall 2 were a bit strange. I think they could have left the horse and the Mom out of it, but that's just my opinion. All in all, 7 out of 10. I'm looking forward to Zombie's next film, Laurie Strode. haha",Halloween II
300,sirseef,And You Thought a Nurse's Costume was Cliché,3,9 September 2009,"I can't speak for his music, but his movies have never been anything too original. He copied the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with 1000 Corpse's, Devil's Rejects wasn't groundbreaking, and then he remade one of the best horror movies of all time. Now, he's remade the sequel. And man is this thing loaded to the brim with junk.Hollywood has a knack for over-explaining everything until it all looks the same and Zombie does nothing to prevent this. This is ironic since everyone featured in the film is trying ever-so-hard to not conform. From the bathroom to the attitudes (though you cannot deny Zombie has his own style). In fact, everyone in the film appears to be a fan of Zombie's music, including a guy driving down the highway. Either way, Meyer's is over-explained even more in the sequel, but if that weren't enough, we're now drowned in this bizarre flashback world that introduces another method of explaining something that has already been explained when there was no need to explain it in the first place. Am I explaining this alright? When you take out the key elements, this movie does exactly what it and its characters don't want to do - conform to the usual standard. This movie is just another girl in a nurse's costume on Halloween, and this girl isn't a looker.",Halloween II
301,avalosraul,What the hell Zombie,1,14 September 2021,"This movie is so awful to start. The violence and kills are amazing as they were in the previous one. However every thing in between is a loss for words, story line goes off the tracks I wasn't even sure I was watching a sequel. 1 and done would have been better. This wasn't a movie that you casually watch it is brutal and the story line is dogshit. Why leave characters just to kill them off anyways

302,corpsebride01,Zombie has an interesting perspective on Halloween,5,7 January 2010,"First off, I liked Zombie's 2007 version of Halloween, my only complaint, if you could even call it that, was the *rape* scene that was included in the directors cut, I just preferred the alternate scene when Michael leaves the institution, apart from that I felt it was an interesting re-telling of John Carpenter's Halloween. Halloween 2 (the directors cut) is not as introspective, or inventive, which I was prepared for. I was also prepared for it to be a bloody mess, literally.What i wasn't prepared for was how much the character of Michael changed, and I don't really like the change. (i.e grunting when he kills, not wearing his mask and talking(!))The movie follows Laurie Strode and how she is dealing with the Michael Myers attack that occurred one year earlier. At the same time, Michael is on his way back to Haddonfield, killing anything and everything along the way, with the apparition of his mother Deborah at his side.Zombie makes Myers' goal clear, he is trying to reunite his family. The movie is a big mess, with the story randomly jumping around and a lack of character development. The only characters with any real development at all are Laurie and Dr. Loomis (who has just published another book, and has completely changed to an egotistical jerk) but even then the progression is minimal. I suppose judged as a stand alone film, it isn't that bad, its a slasher-horror movie, and in that area, it arguably delivers, however, after the way the first Zombie Halloween remake was, it definitely doesn't compare. it's worth seeing to come to your own conclusions, but don't have extremely high expectations.",Halloween II

In the second one it was more just like random violence. Sheri Moon was good, but then the movies seem to have been written to showcase her, so it would be surprising if she wasn't. Brad Dourif absolutely shone despite the fact that he didn't really look the part. I really could have done without the lethargic version of Love Hurts at the end. It sounded like Sarah Mclachlan on lithium. Something that is lacking in this movie is that it doesn't stand alone. If one hasn't seen Halloween then there's just no fathoming what is going on at all. I must give Kudos though for the homage this movie pays to past flicks with the costuming in some of the scenes.

308,jstedmund,"Rob Zombie's ""Halloweens"" by themselves.",10,25 August 2010,"Going through these reviews, I am appalled by the ridiculous rants and mindless attacks from people who just want more of the same. These are REMAKES not SEQUELS coming in from the same series. People are saying Rob Zombie's ""H2"" is the worst in series, which is absolute garbage! Look how much bouncing around and ignoring of past movies the original series did where they really are goofs and inconsistencies!!! Doing a remake of source material opens you up to making new and fresh takes on the material. If you look at the 2 new movies done by Zombie, they have far more character development and psychological studies of characters than the original series ever did! There were so many different takes on relationships and people that I never even thought of because there was no room for that with how the original movies. Appreciate this as a psychological study of Laurie Strode, the Myers family and other characters of Haddonfield, Illinois mixed with a dark and sleazy horror film with a 70's feel . . . This movie is good and sad in ways that none of the original movies were. It's different, that does not make it awful. Yes, I love the original series and how they were made and are, but that would not say much for Rob as a writer or director to have just created more of the same . . .I suggest people that have just bashed this crazy notions like ""This is the worst horror movie ever"" re-watch the director's cut of this film and put aside your cookie cutter notion of how this movie ""Has to be"" based on what the old ones were . . . They are great by themselves; look at this one and the '07 remake by themselves and see where they really are interesting and more-psychologically-in-depth new takes on this series!",Halloween II
309,endeyequote,like staring at a blank wall,4,1 September 2009,"Where do I begin when it comes to Rob Zombie's Halloween 2? Well first I should say that this review has virtually nothing positive to say about the movie. That does not mean I am trying to hate or troll, I hate trolls. I am just attempting to detail my opinion of the movie, which unfortunately, was not very good. When I walked out of the movie I tried really hard to place how I felt, and what occurred to me is that I felt like I had just left a doctor's office where I was made to wait in the waiting room staring at all wall for two hours (which happens to me at one doctor in particular all the time). Does this mean I hate the movie? Not exactly. I can't say it was a bad movie and I can't say it was a good movie either. Staring at a blank wall really is the perfect analogy. Why? Well because this movie offered absolutely nothing new or different to realm of movies much less the genre of horror. A sequel to a remake. What does that mean? Nothing in reality. If the quality of the movie is good, to me it doesn't matter the source. Sure we have been inundated with way too many remakes, too many movies that were way to derivative of things that have come before, but on occasions even those have been excellent movies. (an example of this would be The Ring and Ringu, the movie which it remade. Imho The Ring is a better movie). Saying that I am making it known I tried to walk in without any preconceived notions, though I had a feeling that it may not end up being very good. I dismissed that so I could go in unbiased. I am a fan of Rob Zombie and Halloween. I dug House of 1000 Corpses, thought Devils Rejects was incredible, and though I know a lot of people didn't like it, I enjoyed his Halloween and his take on it. And I am a big fan of Halloween 1,2,4&5. I went to show support and with hope that it would exceed expectations. I even went on my own because I know not a single person who wanted to see it, and I have a lot of big horror and rob zombie fans as friends. So as I said, this movie offered nothing new at all. It was a series of recycled ideas, concepts, and scenes from so many horror movies that came before, pieced together in a different order, but still just a carbon copy of 40 years worth of horror. The movie was filmed well, lit well, cut well, the actor's performances, while not mind-blowing, were decent enough. The pieces were all there, what was missing was a good story and an original and unique film. The only reason I am even bothering writing this out is because I feel that it is sort of a sad thing have had happened. Rob Zombie was given free reign to do anything he wanted with the sequel, a freedom he did not have in the first film. This was the reason I wanted to see it, and despite the negative buzz, wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. With his ability to take the plot anyway he wanted I was hoping to get something that would surprise everyone who assumed it would be terrible, but was sadly disappointed.",Halloween II
310,ThomEure,Halloween + Rob Zombie = White Trash Angst,4,7 September 2009,"Even though the remake of Halloween had some quirks, ala Rob Zombie, it was still a decent remake. What Rob Zombie added probably hurt the remake more than it helped it. For instance, turning young Michael into a sympathetic character with a bad home life, characters that over use profanity (especially the ""F"" word), sleazy, low class characters, and way too many minor characters to keep up with. Mix that with some unfortunate casting (Scout Taylor Compton and Malcolm McDowell), and you have a remake that could have been so much more. However, Tyler Mane as the towering, powerful new Michael, and the return of Danielle Harris to the series were both big advantages. As I said a decent remake when you weigh the pluses against the minuses.I had high hopes for Halloween II. After seeing some of the pre-release photos, I was really excited. However, I can't say that I am that excited after the fact. Rob Zombie's vision of a post-Halloween Laurie Strode is apparently a foul-mouthed, tattooed skank who has dreams of a mother she never met (a desperate attempt to bring back Zombie's wife in a really unnecessary role). As for Dr. Loomis, Zombie found a way to make him even more sleazy than he was in the first film. The only sympathetic characters in the film were actually Danielle Harris and Brad Dourif as the Bracketts, and Zombie even managed to turn them into backwoods hicks. It seems if Zombie wants to focus on the gritty underbelly of everything. What he did with these characters was dehumanize them to the point that you really don't care if Michael mangles them or not...well, you are more or less hoping that he does mangle them to put them (and you as the viewer) out of their misery.Now, Tyler Mane as Michael was still awesome. There were some really effective moments with him out of the mask or with the partial mask on, and the ending, though not shocking, provided a good conclusion that could take the film series into a fresh direction. Other than that, you have a sequel that just plain falls flat.In hindsight, which is always 20/20, Rob Zombie probably should have never been considered to remake Halloween. It just was not the right film series for him to put his spin on. He tried to take a film series that was based on such a suburban, everyday landscape and make it gritty and seedy. Now, if this were the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, I would say gritty is good.My hopes for Halloween 3-D is that they either get it back on track or send it out with a bang. My only request is no more Rob Zombie. I do not dislike Rob Zombie, but he needs to be separated from the Halloween series permanently.",Halloween II
311,edoslan,well maybe it shouldn't have been called Halloween II,8,5 September 2009,"I'm shocked by the negative reviews for this movie. I think it's a well made, intelligent horror film through and through and furthermore, it might be Rob Zombie's most ambitious film.There are a couple of problems and I think the worst may be its somewhat clunky structure, especially the first 30 minutes or so, I think, (not sure didn't time it) almost ruin it but it was redeemed throughout.And yes this movie is VERY violent. I'm pleasantly surprised (as a horror fan) that this received the coveted R rating which movies of this nature generally do not. Thank goodness because censorship is WRONG! With that all said this movie is a horror film, a character study and a social critique rolled up in one bloody good mess of a time. Basically the film follows a typically gory path but its the discovery from the main character Laurie Strode (Scott Taylor-Compton) and how she deals with the incidents of the previous film that drive the plot. She has nightmares relating to incidents but deals well; she's a survivor and honestly Rob Zombie's characterization of the three female leads is believable without condescending into mindless bimbo behavior; after all they are punk girls with killer taste in music! The movie also has a subplot involving a greedy Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowel) whose recent book about Michael Myers has made him millions but earned the ire of all those involved. He creates some unique moments of comic relief while also raising some questions of responsibility and tastefulness in media.And it seems as if Rob Zombie really isn't taking any sides here - which I assume he wouldn't since he wrote enough songs about Charles Manson in the past.With that all said the last sequences are great, the movie has great buildup. And yes all the icing for a horror/punk/weirdo are there as well including a neat rockabilly band at the end and wicked soundtrack including such obscure bands as Void (!!) and Scream (!!) in a big budget Hollywood movie, cool!!!!! I didn't like the ending. I should point that out that the very ending really cheapens the movie.",Halloween II
312,JCaseyChapman,Rob Zombie delivers the most brutal Halloween ever,7,28 August 2009,"Let me begin by saying I am a true fan of the Halloween series. I own them all. From the original John Carpenter masterpiece, through the horrific 3rd entry ""The Season of the Witch"", up through the latest John Carpenter remake of the original. I also am a fan of Rob Zombie's films on the whole. Although ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was a bit of a outlandish mess, I also found it very enjoyable and creative. I loved his follow up which was the brilliant ""The Devil's Rejects"", and I will admit that his reincarnation of ""Halloween"" was my favorite film of his to date. I think he nailed it. When doing a remake, I think you have to build on what was already there - or make it in your own vision. Rob definitely did both. It was a different film, it was the same film.Make no mistake, Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 has NOTHING to do with the 2nd entry in the series. Although it starts down the same path in the hospital scene in the beginning, there is where the similarity fades. And THANK GOODNESS. If I wanted to watch part 2, I would. It was a great film. This is a new Michael Meyers outing. Take away Laurie, Loomis, and Annie and you could easily have had a new 10th film. However, it serves as a great sequel to what Rob Zombie started.This Michael is unlike any we've seen so far, even in Zombie's first film. He is often seen in shadows without his mask (which bothered me a little at first .. then I was intrigued .. then I was hooked), he became audible at times (a bold choice on Zombie's part .. and truly frightening) .. and most of all this Michael was BRUTAL. Not to say any past Michael has been anything but .. but there is no holds barred kills here. I am SHOCKED this film got an R rating. I can only imagine what an unrated directors cut would look like.Overall this is a NEW film, with a new Michael, a new image, and a new sense of unadulterated brutality. It may be too much for some people. I for one found it one of the most interesting entries in the ongoing Halloween saga. I will admit, with the way it ended ... and I won't spoil that ... I hope we see another COMPLETELY different Halloween adventure in the future.",Halloween II

Well i hope the money was good because he can give me a few dollars for what i just saw. Lets be clear i was never the biggest fan of the remake i know that some people loved it and some thought it was garbage. I was in the middle, i mean we did not need a remake but at least it was trying to bring something new and at least it was midley entertaining. I was looking forward to see what could Rob Zombie bring to the table for the sequel and see he is directing was improving, because lets be real house of a 1000 courpes was garbage and devil's regect was surprising good (acutally it was darn good) and the remake of Halloween was so-so, but what in the world happened here. Where should i start with the screenplay or with the filming of the action or where i could not see what the heck was going on. First the screenplay was no good, i mean really did we need Rob Zombie wife to come back into the movie again at Micheal mother really i mean i know she needs a paycheck but really did rob zombie feel the need to write here a part for her to get paid. Oh yeah that comes to the other part of the script what in the world is all the flashbacks or hallcunations of Micheal, i mean i know rob zombie was trying to give Micheal some meaning to the killings and try to get into Micheal's head and i guess to give him some emotion. Rob zombie script also has more F bombs than a Quentin Tarantino movie, i mean really does a f word need to be said every second. ( i am not against language in a movie). The acting was another problem ( i know it is a horror movie i am not expecting no Oscar work here) really what in the all that is holy is Malcolm McDowell doing in this movie and what acting class did he go to because i want to sign up. I mean i like Malcolm McDowell in other roles and yes he does have a tendency to go over the top but really i mean i seen better acting in a Segal flick. Speaking about Segal flicks who the heck shot this movie, i mean i have seen better photograph in a sci fi channel movie. I mean even the day time scenes seemed dark and don't even get me talking about the murder scenes i could not even tell what the heck was going on (people that know me know that i hate camera shaking, i mean if you ain't filming a war movie don't shake the darn camera). And the ending oh the ending i won't give anything away but really, really mr rob zombie what the......Look people i am a horror movie fan i love all good slasher movies and heck i own a lot of bad slasher movies ( come to think about it i own more slasher movies than action movies, what happen to my taste in movies) that are fun heck one of my favorite bad slasher movies is jason x. Yes i said jason x it was total garbage but it was sure fun garbage, sadly Halloween 2 does even get to that level, which means you know it's bad, and i thought summer movies could not get more worse than Transformers 2 ( lets be clear transformers 2 is the worse movie of the year).

315,darksideofthespoon-622-36121,Horror Fans should give it a chance.,7,8 January 2010,"The first time I tried to watch Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween, I turned it off about 30 minutes into it. Its always very testy ground trying to enjoy someone else's version of a film you hold so dear as a testament to its genre, especially in an industry full of remakes!So when a sequel was made by the same guy, I dismissed it as another cash-in like most sequels, even worse, sequels of remakes.However, as time passed, I guess I've learnt to be a little bit more forgiving. It is inevitable that at some point, films you love are going to be remade. Unfortunately, some of them hold no justification for its existence, as they give no further insight into the subject, or at least give an entertaining and different approach with a steady eye.So I watched Rob Zombie's Halloween again. We have to put aside the original version to enjoy this. The original Michael Myers was more mysterious, almost ghostly in his presence, and Dr. Loomis encouraged this feel by the way he acted. In the new version, they wanted to give a fresh angle, more brutal, more insight into WHY Michael Myers is a killer, and the new Dr. Loomis is very different, intelligent, but devious, cowardly yet desires attention.Not forgetting that Rob Zombie has a penchant for white trash hillbilly inbred types, he flesh's out his own vision of the Myers family to give justification for Michael Myers. He doesn't want the mask Michael wears to be an excuse for hidden identity like the original, it is now mearly a symbol Michael chooses to use, and of course sets him apart, we identify him with the mask, but we also know who and where he comes from.I can understand why people did not like this approach compared to the mystery of the original, disregarding the many sequels and the ridiculous plots. Halloween II starts where the first left off, Michael's body disappears, and 2 years then pass to show us how the victims are coping in everyday life. I've read people complain about Laurie Strode in this film, and how annoying she is. I didn't find her to be that bad. Also people didn't like the dream sequences Michael keeps having of his mother at every turn. But Zombie is trying to show us that Michael is haunted by his mother, and this signifies his mental instability as well.Its a brutal vision of Michael Myers, the deaths are quite horrific and the film rounds the story off in a satisfying end that makes you think but also you know that another sequel wont happen, at least not by the same person. Watch the film with an open mind, forget the original, and enjoy the violence for all its worth.",Halloween II

It was poorly made on all aspects. The acting was awful. The story was even worse. What it did do was make a great nap movie. Do not even rent this movie even if it's free. Buy yourself a soda instead. I am dead serious, this was the third worst movie I've seen in my 34 years. It makes you want to barf, not just because of the killing scenes but this movie will make you want to choke on your own vomit. I love horror movies if they're done well. This is not done well at all. At all. It's not original. The blood scenes are really weak. Warning, do not rent this movie.",Halloween II

319,knoyourrole04,I'm at a loss,1,30 August 2009,"Reimagining or whatever you want to call it. Zombie has ruined an icon. Michael Myers is the Boogeyman plain and simple. Evil personified. After seeing devils rejects I was excited when he took on Halloween. The first one was decent only because of the child back story, I liked that. After watching 2 I'm appalled. Michael Myers is my favorite movie monster. He ISN'T Jason Vorhees. He is Michael Myers, they are two totally different killing machines. Vorhees is the real brutal in your face killer. Myers isn't he's subtle, he's scary, he's creepy.. If Zombie wanted to make a Jason-type killer he shouldn't have called it Halloween and the killer shouldn't have been named Michael Myers. I understand he wanted his own image but you have got to keep Michael true to form in order to call it Halloween. These two movies were like watching a Gothic version of Friday the 13th and just switching a hockey mask for the myers mask. Please if you are an original Halloween fan don't watch this movie.. If you've never seen the original you will probably find it enjoyable that this killer is so brutal. Too bad its not the true Michael Myers. This is a crazy man who wants to kill people. He isn't the personification of evil that he was INTENDED to be. Thank you rob for completely ruining the greatest of all horror movie icons.",Halloween II

I enjoyed rob zombies Original Halloween released 2007 which was very scary and creepy to watch for me it brought back old memories i enjoyed this movie. But this movie Halloween 2 for me had a good story line just like the old Halloween 2 with the amazing Jamie lee Curtis and this movie actually had some creepy scenes i think Halloween fans should watch it for what it is mike myers wearing a creepy mask and out there to take you out for good, I give it a scary 10 Thats because i seen this movie in the dark by my self LOL thanks and enjoy this evil freaky legend",Halloween II
321,mikefoxx666,Slaughtering the Halloween Franchise in one easy step!!!,1,9 January 2010,"I haven't been moved to write a movie review for ages, but if I can save just one human being from defiling their poor, poor eyes with this terrible 'I Spit On Your Franchise' piece of garbage then I will be a happy and fulfilled man! Rob Zombie, despite a passable effort with his remake of Halloween, has here produced an insulting, confused and self-indulgent mess of a movie that, quite frankly, I imagine will cause fans of the Halloween film series to detest both him and this awful piece of cinema.Not only has he managed to reduce the character of the charming, sweet and vulnerable Laurie Strode (from the original films) into a whining, shouting, (gurning!!) self-obsessed little bitch with no saving graces whom I actually WANTED to see brutally murdered, but he has also somehow transformed the cinematic enigma that is Michael Myers into what looks like a psychotic homeless-person who would look more at home with a copy of the Big Issue in his hands than a carving knife! Sam Loomis, the tortured and guilt-ridden soul portrayed so well by Donald Pleasance in the original films has here become a (badly played) fame & wealth obsessed a*hole, and I can only surmise that the completely unnecessary (and unwanted!!) appearance of Sheri Moon Zombie as Deborah Myers was engineered to yet again showcase the director's reasonably attractive wife (OK ROB - WE KNOW YOU MARRIED OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE!!) and to boost the family bank balance.Among other reasons why you should (and would) hate this massive slap in the face of Halloween fans is (the only reason I rented the DVD): I thought it would at least be gory & imaginative death-wise - WRONG AGAIN!!! Most of the gory action happens off screen and I think there was one kinda inventive death involving deer antlers but I've seen that before (and I did doze off for a few minutes near the end so I may have missed one or two of the other deaths!!) Finally there is the iconic image of Michael Myers himself.....Well, THINK AGAIN GUYS & GIRLS!!! He only has his mask on for a tiny fraction of the film and for the rest of it he is resplendent in a huge (Brian Blessed style!!) bushy beard that makes you think more Grizzly Adams than Michael Myers!! I have to admit I'm being totally honest when I say that this film has absolutely NO redeeming features whatsoever, not a one!! And don't get me wrong, I'm not one of the anti-remake gang, I LOVE remakes and with the exception of maybe 2 (this one included of course) I actually prefer remakes....but not this time. In a nutshell, this movie should NEVER have been made (or made by somebody else) and as for Rob Zombie, well my respect for him has gone from 'Not a Helluva lot' to some fairly large minus figure!! Save your time (& your money) and give this floater a wide berth!!!",Halloween II
322,jeff-theis4,Rob Zombie delivers a totally unique vision,10,29 November 2017,"Once again, Rob Zombie has created a film that I love far more than I should. While his first remake delved into origins of Michael Myers to the frustration of many Halloween fans, I couldn't help but find it an engaging alternative to the original, and allowed for that film to stand on its own without begging comparison to John Carpenter's version.With this entry, Zombie takes even more risks and refuses to abide by any rules, not just ones of the Halloween franchise, but the slasher genre itself. It has a cerebral, ethereal tone, giving way to the infamous dream sequences, and has uncompromisingly brutal levels of gore. It completely reinvents the characters, and barely resembles a Halloween film at times. These are probably the main criticisms of the film, and they're exactly why I love it.Despite the obvious reasons why this film shouldn't work, it fits together these various elements thematically and creates a totally unique experience that I've almost never had with a horror film. It takes the events of Zombie's first Halloween and uses them to take our characters to unexpected places, in order to explore themes of loss, trauma, and familial bonds by exploring the cyclical effects of violence. All the major characters have been seriously altered, mostly for the worst, due to their near-death experiences, and struggle to retain their humanity. Rob Zombie takes us into the minds of both Laurie Strode and Michael Myers, bringing the audience to understand both what drives these characters, and ultimately the demons that plague them both. The film doesn't shy away from the violence because it wants to submerge its audience within the carnage, entrapping us within the grotesque and the macabre just as it does the same to the principal players.This isn't mention to fact that Halloween 2 might be the most visually stunning horror film in recent years, with its 16mm print serving to emphasize the dark, gritty atmosphere that every frame of this film is soaked.At the end of the day, Halloween 2 isn't without its problems, but its a totally engrossing and unique cinematic experience that leaves far more of an emotional impact than your typical slasher fare. Despite the polarizing reaction, to say the least, Halloween 2 comes recommended.",Halloween II
323,Peter34,Could someone tell me what's going on here?,1,9 September 2009,"I heard a lot of bad comments about this movie before I went to see it with a few of my friends last week. However, I have an open mind so I decided to go and see it, seen as I'm a fan of the old Halloween's. Rob Zombie's first halloween wasn't that good, but it certainly wasn't that horrible. First thing you'll notice is that there's no character development, it's just as if someone pitched the characters and said, just act! Michael kills anyone, and at anytime, too many killings with no story behind it! Every time we Michael's sister, she cries or screams or she says she wants to get high nd drunk. I mean really? Is this supposed to be a horror movie or some comedy? Dr.Loomis has completely changed, he's not like the Loomis we knew from before, he laughs for no reason and has no meaning in the story. Most scenes in the movie are like if they were brought out of a comedy, low budget film. Halloween 2 is a horrible movie, one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It's sad really, don't go watch it guys, trust me.",Halloween II
324,balozoli,"Oh, Rob Zombie, how can I ever forgive you?",4,25 October 2021,"It's raping the whole franchise. Lorie and Loomis are just disgusting. They messed up all the characters. Giving Michael real feelings, thoughts, a face, the visions... just horrible.4 points for the cool photography and the brutality. They also got the sound mixing and editing right. And of course Brad Dourif is exceptional in his role, as always.Still one of the worst of the franchise.",Halloween II
325,justin_of_the_dead,"My My Myers, You sure look like you should take a dirt nap",6,28 August 2009,"Briefly , if you liked the first one there's a good chance you'll find something to like here. Sure there's violence, gore, nudity, the occasional scare and Michael is bigger and sicker than ever. But sadly he's less imaginative. That isn't to say his imagination doesn't get the best of him. That last one will make sense once\if you watch the movie. So what's wrong with the film you ask?Well if you were a fan of the original Carpenter film. You might be a fan of off screen kills. This movie, has many moments of what could very well be off-screen deaths but Zombie decides to zoom in for kills that are brutal, and often sick. If that's your bucket of blood then enjoy, but for those less into brutal, realistic violence, be prepared to squirm a little.The story starts off pretty much where the first remake ended. Samuel Loomis, who was noble and unrelenting in his plight against evil (Michael) in the original, who was less noble in the remake, is now... less noble. This is not a spoiler, you find out about his less than kind attitude five minutes into the film. Laurie Strode is also less than kind. She pleads that she is an angel and wants to change her ways, but you'll surely get the feel she's no angel early into the movie.The movie's characters are not kind and Zombie has managed to extract any pity you might have felt for their deaths. They are rude, obnoxious and dirty. I mean dirty. Washrooms, kitchens, house exteriors, faces and clothes, everything is dirty in the movie. The police chiefs washroom is covered in spray painted obscenity's. Which I find strange...If you like horror movies, I'm sure you'll have fun finding some of the cult movie references splashed throughout the movie. Zombie does handle the scares well when they come. And they often come as a surprise. What is more surprising is the amazing speed with which Myers can walk or run. He seems to fly from one location to another in a moments notice, but never drives any vehicle to get there. I think he even climbs walls with what must be his hands, but you never get the chance to enjoy the ridiculous sight of him punching his way up a house.The soundtrack is actually really well done and sparse, the real terror in the movie comes from seeing deaths with no music, there a no cues as to when Myers will appear and the only sound you hear from his kills are the pounding of flesh and bone, cracking under his fists\body\feet. There are many psychological symbols in the movie and Zombie, partially succeeds in showing Myers vision of his world. Zombie has a semi clear vision of his ""re-imagining"".I still prefer the original sequel, or even H20 in terms of continued story but the movie is intriguing and definitely takes an original direction not seen in the first 8 films of the series. It has cult appeal all over it and will surely be enjoyed by those who like explicit, brutal gore. Simply put don't go into the movie expecting a feel good, thrill ride, fun time like sleep-away camp, Friday the 13th or even April fool's day. It is it's own creation and for that I give it a 6\10",Halloween II
326,Mr_Alphonso,"Incoherent monster-mash. Repulsive, pointless, & retarded film-making at its finest.",1,7 September 2009,"Zombie has successfully ruined a beloved franchise with his vulgar re-envisioning of Carpenter's classic.Sorry man, WHITE TRASH is NOT scary. The brutality and profanity of the characters are a complete turn off. Of all the cast, I wished that Laurie Strode had died in the opening. You screwed up the remake, so why not slaughter our beloved heroine rather than turn her into the horrible character you created in the first. She was never ever likable to begin with in 2007. Audiences hated what you did. And with this remake you've surely flipped fans of the film the bird and robbed them at the same time. You're no damned auteur...you're a hack that thinks he can direct. And for the love of god, what was up with your wife and her white My Little Pony? Is it foreshadowing of a film you're making in the future?H2 is a laughing joke. From beginning to end. There's no tension whatsoever, scares or even three-dimensional characters. Wishing to god that he'd left his trailer park cast in the trailer park and crafted an origin tale in 2007 that goes beyond the beautifully simplistic layers of the 1978 original and 1981 follow-up. Zombie should be blamed for the demise of the Weinstein's company.",Halloween II
327,sdtownse,It was what I expected,8,31 August 2009,"There are a lot of people who are giving this movie a bad rap, but did none of you see the first remake? Have none of you seen any of Rob Zombie's movies? Every character Zombie uses is a grunge metal, hillbilly dirt bag, period. Why is it that people are so surprised that he made the characters of his re imagining of the Halloween series rednecks? I know, it is not like the original series, but that is what it means to re imagine a series. It means take the basis of an old idea, and fuel it with a new story and new development of the characters.Now, with that said, these two re imaginings of Halloween were pretty terrible. I really enjoyed the work print of the first, but the cinematic release was awful and full of plot holes and ridiculous events which was a result of last minute revamping of a large chunk of the movie. With this second instalment, I found myself less impressed with the plot than I thought I would be, but the make-up effects were fantastic and gory, the killing was intense, but boring all wrapped in one, and the characters were annoying, but what I expected.I think that the main thing that killed these movies is that Rob Zombie isn't the greatest writer, and if he had maybe had a better writer working with him to sort out his vision, he would have created a stellar re imagine of this series. Going back to my point that the killings were intense but boring all at once, it is because Zombie couldn't write it properly, but he directed it brilliantly which left me in the torn state.All in all, the film was quicker than the first, and didn't have the ""let's stab the roof of the entire house for an endless amount of time to try and get Laurie"" scene *THANK GOD* but unfortunately Rob Zombie just couldn't write a good two part series. Also, he should keep the wife out of some movies. She isn't the worst actress, and she was great in House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects but not in Halloween 2 and she was okay in Halloween 1 but that was because her character made sense in the first one. Her sequences in this movie killed this movie though.Rob Zombie, please direct more films! PLease direct a third Halloween instalment!! But for the love of god, let someone else write the frigging' thing!! I think Zombie is a great director, and terrible screenwriter with good ideas, and that is the problem with this movie.",Halloween II
328,phillo74-1,You want devastation and horror??? Try this horrible script on for size!,3,31 January 2010,"Where do I begin?? Ever since I was a kid I was a huge fan of the 'Halloween' franchise!! I even saw some good in Halloween 3!!! Then Rob Zombie comes along and tries to resurrect a film which should have been left as nothing but a fantastic festive memory. Instead, he attempts to remake these classics and butchers them worse than one of michael myer's victims! Okay, maybe i'm being a little overzealous. The first remake was bearable, only for the annoying appearance of Scout-taylor Compton! Man, she was annoying, albeit slightly good looking. She brought the character of Laurie Strode onto a new plateau of complete irritation. Laurie strode was suppose to be the quiet, good-goody heroine. Whereas Zombie's/Compton's portrayal is of a new-age Hannah Montana type, in your face, fool! I was rooting for Michael Myers by the end! As for part 2...here we go! Zombie brings us a whole new standpoint of the original halloween 2. Fair enough, he remade it COMPLETELY...hence, 'remake'...but what he chose to substitute John Carpenter's vision with was absolutely ludicrous! For one, he stole from Friday the 13th, with Myers seeing his mother from time to time. She had a white horse with her of all things! Perhaps it had some 'profound meaning', but this is a horror movie folks!! Save us the depth and bring on the scares! Loomis' character was a complete power hungry tool in the remake. Donal Pleasence ruled as Loomis; yearning to be heard, without a consideration for his own well-being so long as Myers is stopped! Malcolm McDowell (though he's a good actor) just didn't do it for me. To be fair, I blame the script, not the actor.The only good thing going for Halloween 2 is the severity of the fatalities - the stripper and the mirror for one. But a few brutal scenes won't save a storyline, in my opinion. Then we have Compton back again, annoying me; freaking out every 2 seconds, then acting fine the next. Annie Brackett would have been a much better candidate, i think. She had a look about her that just fitted. Either that, or the script writer should have reversed the attributes of the characters, at the very least.All in all, there are gona be some people out there who loved this movie! I don't see why, but each to their own.If you ever fancy sitting down with a bowl of popcorn and watching Halloween 2....rent out the original Halloween 2 instead.",Halloween II
329,tonymanno,"Typical horror sequel or genius, psychological thrill ride?",10,16 December 2009,"""Typical Horror Sequel"" Rob Zombie's 'Halloween II' is a challenge to watch. It is filled with brutal violence, but that is nothing compared to the offensive language. At least two characters say the ""F"" word for what seems like five straight minutes. We also get treated to an onslaught of dreams and hallucinations. Reality is lost in transition. Zombie follows the rules perfectly—more violence, less plot, and a twist that leaves us with rolling eyes. 'Halloween II' is the typical horror sequel that everyone expected it to be. So why are we complaining? Because nothing makes sense. (2 out of 10)""A Genius, Psychological Thrill Ride""Rob Zombie is a genius. He gives us what appears to be the typical horror sequel, but it is so much more. 'Halloween II' is a psychological thrill ride into the mind of a young woman losing touch with sanity and reality.

Does Laurie Strode have a psychic connection with Michael Myers?Zombie makes viewers read between the lines, and the final answer seems to rest in our personal opinions.

In stead of following the old story it's almost a new movie (not much things are the same). I liked the old once and I liked Halloween 1 by Rob Zombie. Zombie messes up the characters pretty bad. Dr. Loomis is just an arrogant bastard in stead of helping like the original. Laurie (Angel) is pretty normal in the first movie but a totally f*ck*d up b*tch in this second movie. Okay it is not bad acting from Scout (Laurie) she makes a good performance but to different from the Laurie in the first part and nothing in common with Jamie-Lee Curtis in the old one. I liked the Michael Meyers in this movie. And if you like a lot of cursing, violence and blood then you will eventually like this movie enough. If the stupid scenes with Michaels mother and himself as a little boy were left out then I would have rated this movie a 7 out of 10 but because the scenes are that stupid I rated it a 6.",Halloween II
331,jamesoshea91,why the bad reviews this movie was excellent!!,9,31 August 2009,"Halloween despite the bad reviews is a fantastic horror, rob zombie really knows how to take things over the edge. this was my favourite one for sure (mostly because i hate the actors in the old ones and lack of blood also) Micheal in a hooded jacket was awesome it made him look so cool and a little darker, it was a great change to the 8 other movies which are all the same . Now i must admit that those weird dream sequences were stupid but its also a good way to dive into mikes mind its called symbolism for all u bashers but ill let you figure out what it means by your self just know its necessary to show mikes not exactly normal he is in fact insane,also its a freaking scary movie and its the best horror I've seen in years. They kind of strayed off with the character but this is rob movie i like a remake not following every line of the original plus if you witness a massacre and lose everybody you love your gonna lose it a little( and laurie loses it) but its called realism. if your looking for weird scary gore fest you've got it and trust me there gore and a lot of it. I think the ending was great and i hope they leave it there because rob did a great job at making mike seem human ( except humans cant lift cars) and if he comes back after how he was killed it will just take away the work that has been done. So great movie great ending and it will be considered a classic in the future.",Halloween II
332,georgesalazar33,GREAT!! I give Rob and Scout props!!!,8,18 March 2010,"I got to admit,it turned out great!!! Scout Taylor-Compton is amazing and I love her playing Lauie!!! Let me say what I don't like about the film, I don't like how Laurie's hair was tangly and messed up. In the directors cut, Laurie is super grouchy and ""F"" this and ""F"" that and I know it's because she's going through a lot but still, she wasn't like that in the Theatrical Version. I also don't like the awful clothes she wears. I don't like the way Dr. Sam loomis was a jerk. All the random scenes of Deborah Myers and little Michael Myers were lame, some were okay. Sheri Moon-Zombie is an awful actress as a ghost. The clothes and hooded jacket that Michael wore were cool but I don't like how we can clearly see his face throughout the film, also the horrible beard. I also thought that Michael and Laurie should have had a longer chase scene. Some of John Carpenter's creepy music scores would have been nice. The ending was OKAY but I don't like how Dr. Loomis died and Laurie went crazy. It's like a spent a whole hour and a half to see my favorite character go crazy in the end. The Directors Cut ending is just PLAIN TERRIBLE. The directors cut was good except the ending. I though Annie and Dr. Loomis should have had more screen time. Other than that, H2 is a really great film. The dream sequences are great. Scout Taylor-Compton is amazing. I HIGHLY recommend the Theatrical Version.

The plot seemed to me to only try to get as much blood and random killings pressed down into 1 movie(sometimes less is more right), and the ending.... well kinda NOT in the spirit of the old movies again. IF you make a remake of a classic and then decide to do a sequel to it, at least keep the original plot in mind if you ask me.In short..

First item to explain is the white horse. This is a bit lame and a weak metaphor at best I admit. Micheal Myers, as obviously established over this over used and abused super serial killer series, is the harbinger of death. What color horse does death ride? A pale one -albeit not exactly white. That is what makes it a weak metaphor. Second, why does Micheal see his mother and himself at the time from a serious break in sanity? He's f'ing crazy people! Jeez is it that absurd to believe Micheal Myers sees people that aren't there? Besides it beats the explanation of Myers' driving force that Halloween 4 try's to establish out of the blue in the series -druids. I admit the acting isn't great and none of the characters are likable. By the end of the movie I literally was cheering Micheal on to please put these poor people stuck in a hilly billy late seventies, mid-nineties time warp out of there ever-loving misery. To sum it up, this movie is what it is, a horrifying expose on brutality which is something our country obviously drools over. I mean a man in South Carolina humped the same horse twice! Is it so outlandish that a crazy serial killer in a movie would eat a dog raw?",Halloween II
336,jayjosephjones,It's not your typical-rundown Halloween film,10,30 October 2020,"At first, I absolutely hated this film. Don't get me wrong but through the years, I started to love and appreciate this film for what it is. It's not your typical halloween film. It has more of a psychological take on the character of Laurie strode and what trauma can do to someone. For a change, Michael Myers isn't just going around killing people for the majority of the run time. This isn't michael's film, this is Laurie's film and that's what people tend to forget. This film should be categorized in the same field as Black Swan, Suspiria, and Midsommar. I never understood trauma until I hit the age I am now and this film captures it beautifully and realistically. But to understand is that this is Rob Zombie's vision of the character... Not Carpenter's - Sometimes I think part of the reason why this flunked was because it was mismarketed in a way. I really hope people could finally see for what this film is and gain a cult-following.",Halloween II
337,pgtmatrix,letdown.,5,27 August 2009,"Yes I'm one of the few people who thoroughly enjoyed rob zombie's remake of halloween. So I was extremely excited to find out he was making the second one.I love Zombie's directing style and I do think he is somewhat talented. But this movie just wasn't his best. The style and feel of the film was perfect. But the storyline was complete trash. He should have stuck to the original story.Zombie's ""re-imagining"" of the second coming of Michael Myers was way off. Yeah he spiced up the original with Michael's backstory, but he completely redid the second one.So if you just want to see people get stabbed with a cool directorial style and nice lighting(oh and boobs, lots of those) then yeah you might like it.But for what it's worth, the backbone of any good movie is good source material, and the source material for this was Zombie's lackluster screenplay.Shame. The first one was so promising. This one definitely ended it. Not only because Zombie says he won't direct another, but because it went so far downhill from the first one it basically killed itself.Oh and the final scene in the movie is ridiculously laughable and will most likely give you a WTF look on your face.5/10 for this one. Just don't take it too seriously and think of it as another slasher flick and you may enjoy it for what it is. Just another slasher flick. Nothing special here.",Halloween II

But what he did in the first was establish Michael as this troubled boy turned inexplicable mad killer who gives no reason or incentive for his actions. This move completely ruined that.Spoiler ALERT: Bringing his mom back into the picture and using her to basically ""coach"" him through the movie destroys the image and figure of Michael myers Zombie created in the previous film, basically rendering him to a ""Jason Voorhees"" murderer.And what is with the characters? They are so shallow and all in all the same. For god sake Zombie, everyone in the world does not have tattoos all over their bodies or live in trashy shacks with graffiti. And throwing the ""F bomb"" into every sentence does not always make for drama and intensity. Laurie's character didn't even deserve sympathy really if you actually watch the movie. And the ending.....folks if you have seen the ending you know exactly what i am talking about.Bottom line...Zombie really hit rock bottom and ruined what could have a been a good attempt at revamping and re-imagining Halloween.

SPOILER REVIEW
As for my flaws with the film, I wasn't a fan of Micheal Myers talking. He yells ""Die!"" which is only line if dialogue in the film. Also, at certain times, the Deborah Myers-White Horse dream sequences didn't always work for me. However, I was a fan of the Myers Mask. It not only looks terrifying with it dirty, grungy, torn up look, but it serves mire if a purpose in this film with Micheal only putting it on when he's ready to kill someone.Halloween II: A",Halloween II
340,gfink02,Train Wreck,2,14 December 2009,"I read the reviews and had low expectations going in to watch this movie. I actually liked ""Devils Rejects"" and ""House of 1000 Corpses"". I actually enjoyed Zombie's first remake of Halloween. I didn't think it compared well to the original but as a stand-alone horror flick, it was actually a good movie.Rob Zombie should have stuck to his guns and refused to make this sequel. Though it was strong visually, well acted (as in the actors did their jobs well considering the script) and the editing was top notch, the screenplay was horrible. It wasn't scary at all. What makes a horror movie great is good suspense. This movie had none. It was bloody and brutal but at no time was I at the edge of my seat. Worst of all was the whole dream sequence mess. It simply made the whole story seem silly. If it occurred once it would have been bad but forgivable. But it became an integral part of the ""plot"" and pretty much destroyed an already negative experience.I still have faith in Rob Zombie but this film was obviously a big mistake.",Halloween II
341,kellywells26,Zombie needs to give it up!!!!,1,13 February 2010,"I have seen all of Rob Zombie's movies and I have nothing good to say about any of them. Not so much as a single ""flinch"" of fright! The chase scenes are long and drawn out and then very anti-climatic when they do come. I also found the plot line to be very hard to follow and it was hard to figure out what was going on throughout the movie. In a well-made movie this tactic can make it more fun trying to figure things out, but in one like this it makes it hurt just that much more! I guess if gore is all that does it for you, one might like them. However I don't recommend this one or any other of his films! I hear he has a film in development titled T-Rex, maybe I'll give him one more chance?!?",Halloween II
342,porkepik,Not a Halloween movie,4,25 February 2010,"What has made me angry enough to log in IMDb and post a review: the use of Carpenter's theme right when the rolling credits start... That was quite unnerving from Zombie to use after making a movie that took everything that Carpenter created and put it in the dumpster. Forget the intensity, creativity, suspense and good soundtrack, here you just have a stupid slasher movie that if it didn't have the word ""hallowen"" in it would just be badly rated like so many of these cheap horror flicks.You can literally count from 10 to 1 before for any of the murders happening as Zombie is using every horror cliché of the book. Gore, there is LOTS of it. But unlike a movie like Hostel managed, you never feel bad or uncomfortable. So many of those butchering scenes are so boring, i just couldn't believe how it was possible to make it that way!Let's not forget that as always, since zombie has to put his wife into every movie of his, he created ""the ghost mother"" a WTF character that makes no sense ,besides helping the people with absolutely no clue to understand that Michael wants to kill his sister. And you get that same reminder/scene SEVERAL times (think the Matrix movies where you get explained a dozen times the same thing to see how boring it becomes)Most of her apparitions actually give you an impression of watching a video clip and gets you out of the movie(especially the first). Back on the photography, actually if there wasn't a few scenes with for example a flat screen TV in Loomis room or Mr Weird apparition you would be certain that the movie is happening in the 80s!The problem is that just like the first Halloween, zombie tried to remake again his own ""The devil's rejects"" except that he doesn't seem to know/care anymore how to create a sick and disturbing atmosphere, so you just get brainless gore scenes that inspire absolutely no-thing (not even humor like in ""the hills have eyes"")I actually have no problem seeing Zombie modify the characters (Dr Loomis becoming a scumbag and using M.Myers for his own career, or Laurie Strode being a complete wreck, or even Zombie style of making any place look like a dirty ****hole located into the white trashy Midwest stereotype. But not being able to make a horror movie at least a tiny bit scary is the worstBTW fun-fact: Did you know that in the 21st century an entire hospital can be run by 1 person at night? Well at least in a rob zombie movie that's what happens.",Halloween II
343,riril_32,This is where it should end.,9,11 November 2011,"A sequel to Rob Zombies Halloween seemed a bit far fetched considering the ending of that movie, it seemed like the story had nowhere to go.But Rob Zombie really came through and he gave us a very different Halloween movie. It's not just about slaughtering in brutal ways, it's about the characters, emotions etc. He did a great job with the character Annie, she is really developed in this movie. All the characters are great, and most of the actors do a wonderful job. The only character that needs work is Laurie, she is not really believable, she comes off as kind of a mean person, but I think thats the point.I'm not gonna spoil anything, but I will say this; It ends Rob Zombies series. You can easily see this and think of it as the last Halloween movie in his franchise.And what a great movie it is! I really recommend it.Now let's hope that they cancel Halloween 3D...",Halloween II
344,oldfrisco8,Great movie with the wrong title,8,31 August 2009,"If you enjoyed Zombie's previous works, this film should be mandatory. If you have children with you, or dislike gore, stay far far away.Rob Zombie's sequel to his remake of the original Halloween stays with the story of John Carpenter's Halloween 2 for about the first ten minutes before it breaks off into a remake of Halloween 4. Staying true to the original two films, this story starts off where the first ends, with a trip to the hospital on the night of a brutal massacre. However, after a blood soaked ten minutes of terror in the hospital, the audience is ripped away to the story of Halloween 4. Danielle Harris is even there, just like in 4, only this time as the friend instead of Michael's last relative. Just like Danielle's original character Jaime, Laurie is haunted by the image of Michael in her dreams while living with an adopted family. After the carnage, with the nightmares of her brother running through her head even while she is awake, Laurie sports the mask and becomes the family's new killer, just like Jaime who dons the clown mask to kill her mother and become mute.The only differences come from the fact that Jaime was a little girl, while Laurie is a teenager, and that Rob Zombie is nothing like John Carpenter. The story is unoriginal, but it is a great addition to a great horror franchise with Rob Zombie's brutal violence and filthy language saturating every second. John Carpenter's originals keep the blood and gore at a minimum, with knife swings penetrating flesh off screen. Zombie celebrates every chance to show people inside out, making audiences white-knuckle armrests as the body count rises.",Halloween II
345,craighepworth,Is this the worst film of the decade?,1,16 December 2009,"OK the original Halloween remake was bad, lets not kid ourselves, i know the 18s and under found it fun and gory with lots of swearing but that was not Halloween. Rob Zombie has to be one of the worst writers ever, hes directing is not much better. His idea of Horror is to add as much bad language as he can and throw blood at the screen. The problem with this though is that he's remaking a film that was known for its atmospheric dark and almost silent tones to add tension rather than gore. The 1st remake was a huge misfire, tripping up at every point from script continuity to destroying the myth of Myers. Halloween 2 (2009) managed to make his first remake look like a masterpiece. Never have i been so stunned at what was happening on the screen as i was with this.The major problem (apart from again the swearing for the sake of swearing, far to much OTT gore) is he failed to create one likable character (which is an achievement). We the audience are supposed to root for the last girl standing, a common theme in slasher movies since the late 70s but Zombie's Laurie is annoying and vile, her friends are made up of the kind of people you are hoping die violent deaths and the one girl who you can attach to (Harris Character) suddenly turns in to b***h before her big send off. The script was uneven at best, the acting horrid. The only reason Myers mum was in the film was to give Zombies wife some work because her scenes were laugh out loud bad and made no sense whatsoever, the ending was dreadful, the plotting slow and to have Myers walking around looking like a hitchhiker for the most film was possibly one of the most idiotic decisions ever made in a horror film (don't get me started on him grunting and talking).If Zombie is the future of American Slashers and Horrors then god help us all. The industry would be a better place of Zombie vanished in to the night. His directing was horrid (you have lighting people, use them) the shots had no continuity (you have a script supervisor use them) his shots are stolen from other movies and he knows nothing about pacing. His writing is beyond a joke, people don't talk that way, the youth of America does not talk or act that way. His vile representation of that youth is misguided and quite odd. Learn to write a character, give it a go, just once, you might like it.The world (except a few) knew this film would be a stinker after the dreadful 1st one and that's why it did so bad at the box office because people stayed away, let's try and forget that Zombie ever did anything to the Halloween series. He did achieve in one way though...he made Halloween Resurrection look great.",Halloween II
346,thecinemaissue,In Theaters: Halloween II (2009),6,1 September 2009,"There has never been a ""Halloween"" film quite like this, a fact that is both its blessing and its curse. Rob Zombie has crafted a supremely unique film that is both groundbreaking for its series and yet undeniably odd. Zombie began his journey to remake the horror masterpiece, ""Halloween"", in 2007 when he, equipped with a strong cast, gave new life to the iconic Michael Myers. His goal was simple: make Myers frightening again. His result: a mixed bag of good and bad that amounted to an entertaining, but uneven film. The primary problem was that Michael Myers was still not scary and the film lacked necessary suspense in favor of an excessively high body count. Zombie's token hillbilly flare did not mix well with the subtle elegance of John Carpenter's classic film. The good news about ""Halloween II"", horror fans, is that it occurs solely within the world Zombie established and lacks unnecessary ties to the original franchise. The bad news is that, if you don't like that world, you won't like this film.Read My Full Review At: www.thecinemaissue.blogspot.com",Halloween II
347,kaaria1-1,Ummm... What the f**k this?,1,1 September 2009,"Okay, I am a huge fan of the Halloween franchise. I wasn't in love with the first Zombie film, but I did buy it and tolerated the movie. This one is an utter disgrace. I had to go home and watch the original Halloween 2, to erase the memory of this horrible piece of crap. First, what is with the dang white horse. That was the was so ridiculous and my first clue that this movie was going down hill. And of course his mom telling him to go have fun. This is Halloween not Friday the 13th. I saw this white horse and mom in the movie only so Sherri Moon Zombie could be in the film. Then Laurie Strode who is almost killed and family murdered and she has all this devil worship and satanic crap in her room. Then she says f**k so many times, if I was playing a drinking game I would have alcohol poisoning in the first 30 minutes. And what was going on at the end of this film. Is she now the killer, is she crazy and why does she see the mom throughout the movie. Then Doctor Loomis is completely destroyed. Why did this character need to be in the film? He was an arrogant, self-absorbed bastard. I wanted to have high hopes but they were just shot down by this crap. There are so many other ways this could have went. But with this version of the film, the franchise has been murdered for good. I will never see another Halloween film. Please save your money and precious minutes in your life. You will not get that time back.",Halloween II
348,TheFilmBloggerdotcom,So bad it's funny...,4,11 October 2009,"Some critics have been quick to dismiss Rob Zombie as a man with no talent as a filmmaker, and although Halloween 2 joins an increasingly disappointing résumé for the White Zombie rocker, he is better approached as a frustrating filmmaker rather than one without talent. House of 1000 Corpses was dreadful, Halloween was so-so, and Halloween 2 is pretty poor itself, but these films are all problematic in the same area – each film has a lacklustre script that undermines Zombie's considerable visual flair for sordidness and grime. His films are the sort that through sheer visual composition alone make you want to shower, and I mean that as a compliment. Consequently, it's one of the few things to praise about the sort-of-but-not-really remake Halloween 2.Continuing a year after the first film, H2 grants masked villain Michael Myers yet another ludicrous means of escape, this time as the dumb lug driving his ambulance crashes into a cow. Led by a vision of his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) and a white horse, Michael embarks on another murderous rampage through Haddonfield, once again on the hunt for his sister, Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton). Even for the murky standards of the latter entries into the original series, the setup is bad, but it's the sort of bad that you can (and inevitably will) laugh at, so in the right mindset this isn't so much an aggressively unwatchable film as much as it is a daft and unintentionally amusing one.Meanwhile, the supporting characters are given slightly more sensible things to do, as Michael's former psychologist Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) tours a book he wrote about the Myers murders, and deals with accusations of encouraging not only the mythopoeia surrounding Myers, but the murders themselves. On the downside, it means you'll have to sit through a very strange Weird Al Yankovic cameo, and Loomis' story is largely too isolated for most of the film to coalesce well with the mayhem in Haddonfield. More interesting is Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif), who spends most of his screen time trying to protect Laurie and his daughter Annie (Danielle Harris, returning from the previous film, as well as several entries in the previous series as a child), who survived an attack from Myers in the last film. Thanks to another reliable performance from Dourif, Brackett is the most believable and sympathetic character in the whole mess.Rob Zombie falls foul chiefly on two counts with Halloween 2 – through indulgence and through rudiment. Although Zombie's got a keen visual style that befits this sort of material, he too often believes that his vile dialogue – most memorably involving a discussion about necrophilia between two medics – has a sort of feral intelligence that makes it valuable, or more scarily, Shakespearian. What's more troubling, though, is the awkward symbolism that Zombie pigeon-holes into the film. The film's first shot is a title card defining the mythology of the white horse, and throughout the film we get numerous glimpses of the horse accompanied by Myers' mother, which seems more like Zombie showing off his wife rather than him injecting any depth or meaning into proceedings. Furthermore, Zombie indulges several strange dream sequences, most memorably as Laurie is laid out on a dinner table at a Halloween party attended by strange pumpkin-headed monsters, in probably the film's funniest moment. Aside from the aforementioned cow incident, anyway.As far as rudiment goes, Zombie makes things as pedestrian an entertainment as possible; there's a lengthy and downright deceptive dream sequence early in the film that serves little purpose and pads the film out by a good 10 minutes, and he lingers too long on pointless dialogues between Laurie and her friends as they get ready for a Halloween party. The film's true crime, though, is how yawn-inducingly tame the whole thing is; Myers kills with ice-cool, mechanical efficiency, but it's never exciting, largely because the film barely justifies its 18 rating. While it falls under the BBFC guidelines for sadistic violence and a focus on injury detail, Myers too often slashes out of shot, or Zombie is too close up for us to really tell what is going on, or it is expected that we'll be satisfied with a few squishy sound effects. This is a vile film for sure, but one would hope that Zombie, of all filmmakers, would at least deliver on the visceral side of things.Halloween 2 is occasionally daring enough to challenge the conventions of the series mythology, particularly in its ending, but I haven't a clue where Zombie hopes to take things with the inevitable third instalment (other than the already announced 3D element). Halloween 2 has solid atmosphere and decent direction, but it's also got pompous symbolism, a truly cheeky dream sequence, and most alarmingly, a distinct lack of satisfying gore. It's difficult to imagine many being pleased with this uneven, flimsy, so-bad-it's-funny sequel.",Halloween II

Why F$#k it with this piece of trash? -_- Its annoying! Im a really fan of the Halloween Movies (Except for the 3rd one...I almost fell asleep! O.o) The only things I can say are good of this one are some good gory scenes (Like the stripper club scene...when Michael stomps the guys head! That was cool!) and the ending of the THEATRICAL ONE! This is very important...if ure gonna see this...watch the Theatrical One...don't watch the Unrated Directors Cut! I have watched both and when I saw the Unrated one I almost cried blood...the ending was freakin awful! *Mayor Spoiler* I think the only thing worth wasting your time in this movie is the ending of the Theatrical One...cause its something new to the franchise...Halloween its all about Michael Myers...but in this one and for the first time in history...Michael really dies and the new killer in the next movie will be...his little sister! :D Laurie Strode kills his brother and she is the new crazy one...u know...it runs in the family! xD Overall: This movie sucked except some scenes and the THEATRICAL ENDING! The ending is the only new thing Mr. Zombie introduce to the franchise in this one! If ure gonna watch it...remember...THEATRICA VERSION and if u wanna see how they can mess up a great ending...watch the UNRATED ONE!,Halloween II
350,TheRothOfKhan,"Not bad, but no good either",7,29 March 2013,"I had low expectations for Halloween II remake, as I anticipated a re- tread of the hospital killing spree of the original Halloween II. The original sequel was dull, uninspiring and not very scary at all. However, despite the negative reviews this film frequently gets, I found this to be a refreshing take on a story that has been done to death in no less than 8 films (excluding Season of the Witch of course.) Once again, Rob Zombie treats us to a brutal tale of revenge, with Michael Myers returning to his old killing fields to finish what he started. In a nice twist, Michael's form is depicted as decrepit and almost hobo- like. His mask is damaged so as to be almost hanging from his face, and the iconic boiler suit is covered for the most part with a tatty hooded jacket giving him the appearance of a demonic scarecrow. Laurie Strode herself is subject to an image change, which is to be expected only 12 months after she was almost stabbed to death by a masked madman. New Laurie is now a depressive goth living very much like her trailer trash blood relatives did in the first film. A first for the Halloween series was the use of hallucinations in an effort to explore the mind of Michael Myers; whilst these flights of fancy are somewhat indulgent on Zombie's part (they feature his wife all dolled-up in her Living Dead Girl attire,) they are nonetheless effective in distracting you from all the blood and gore. Perhaps disappointing is the slant Zombie took on the character of Loomis, who appears to be somewhat irrelevant in this film, and shows his true colours as a money-grabbing, arrogant man with little regard for the plight of Laurie Strode. Only in the final act is he redeemed when he confronts Michael and ultimately ends up getting killed. Overall, this is a worthy sequel to the Zombie remake, once again being different enough to set it apart from other entries in the series.",Halloween II
351,engagedtoprecious,A daring movie that many people will not appreciate.,8,9 January 2012,"I may be in the minority, but I actually liked this movie. I love the dark and depressing atmosphere that pervades every part of it. I guess a lot of people can't handle movies that make you feel like crap, but a happy movie this is not and I'm glad it wasn't. The film just FEELS dirty. Like you need to take a shower after it's over. The characters all waste away with their various neurosis, drifting through the dark farmhouse they now live in to the record shop Laurie works at with her new friends. Even Laurie's bedroom is a dingy-looking, drab little hole of a place with pictures of serial killers on the wall. And don't get me started on that bathroom.Darkness and mental illness seep through every part of the film and by the end, every character loses something. This is just as much a tragedy as it is a slasher. There's barely anyone to root for. Zombie made a bold move portraying Laurie as a screaming ball of venom and anger. Many reviews mention how horrible her character was or how annoying. I doubt we were meant to sympathize with her in such black and white terms. If you want a clear-cut protagonist, go watch something more simple. Why does every movie have to have nice characters? Life isn't nice. People aren't always worthy of compassion. Sometimes we all just get lost. I admire the risks they took in making every character despicable in their own way and for daring to blur the lines between protagonist and antagonist. The film took me back to my depression days and made me remember what it was like to exist in this closed-off little world, drifting in and out of situations like a lost soul on the way to some destination you aren't aware of. In the case of this movie, the destination begins and ends in darkness but not without the possibility of relief for everyone. The ending doesn't force-feed anything to you. Just as in life, it is what you make of it. You can either choose to look at it from a bleak perspective or search deeper to see death as a cathartic release for these miserable people, with the survivors possibly living to see better days.",Halloween II

Laurie is irritating and I had no sympathy for her at all, none of the characters were particularly engaging, except Annie and her Father for whom I felt I tremendous amount of sympathy, although even Annie proved irritating over her Police 'guard'.

Then he signed on to write and direct, because he didn't want someone else to ruin his vision.*His vision?? His vision??? O my...
I don't think it could have been any worse than his vision imho.
This movie made little sense and basically annoyed from the moment the opening sequence was all a dream. I'll accept the fact that MM was sometimes not wearing his mask and grunting when killing another victim. Even yelling ""DIE"" at Loomis at the end. If that's your take on the persona of MM; your personal vision so to say. But Loomis himself being a totally different person was something that made it all not very convincing. Loomis stating that MM is dead (although they never found the body), is a complete opposite of his attitude in part I. And exploiting his book like that, aiming for fame and fortune, is totally not Loomis-like.Then there's the performance of our other main character, Laurie Strode. Annoying to the bone. You almost hope she doesn't make it, so the end was quite fitting.Last but not least. The visions of the white horse, young Michael and his mother. What. Was. Up. With. That? I'm sorry Rob.

John Carpenter didn't go to much into the Michael Meyers back story, which Rob Zombie did exceptionally well.First of all, Dr. Loomis' character is completely destroyed in this film. Loomis wasn't a prick in the original films, why does Zombie choose to make him a VERY unlikeable, money hungry character? 2nd, Scout Taylor Compton can't act her way out of a paper bag. She was a little whiner and drunkard in this movie, it got really annoying really quick.Thirdly, the hospital scenes being a dream were a total slap in the viewers faces. They advertised this movie to be like the original ""Halloween 2"" and then to pull a stunt like that. Shame on you, Mr. Zombie.I'm glad this piece of garbage tanked at the box office and didn't get #1. Hopefully it will be out of theaters within a few weeks.

357,anwaar-morales,Over Exaggerated totally takes away true Horror,2,28 May 2013,"I think its safe to say Rob Zombie likes the gruesome killing and using a lot of swearing in his movies. The F word was so many times in the film, I had to ask myself was there any other swear word in the foul language dictionary. On another note some of the killings were very exaggerated, to the point that you almost did not take the movie seriously anymore. For example in Laurie's nightmare being at the hospital (Post-first movie events) we see Laurie's bloody nurse trying to get away from Michael collapsing on the floor and he stabs her a total of nine times. The scene is very graphic but also very exaggerated. I think it was truly unnecessary to have him stab someone that many times, John Carpenter would of never recommended that. The film experiments with something that has never been done in past Halloweens. We witness Michael eating something for the very first time. The issue with this is that once you start giving a ""monster"" human actions/Characteristics your taking away the true horror. The intention should be to make him as inhuman as possible. We also see Michael Myers having these illusions of his mother and his younger self who apparently inspires him to kill. What made the original (Halloween 1978) so scary, yet fascinating is that we don't know what made him kill besides Loomis describing him as simply being ""Pure evil"".

364,michaelm1979,"My Review On ""Halloween II"" ***SPOILERS***",5,30 August 2009,"OK, I went into this film with nothing to compare it to as it was simply a sequel to ""Rob Zombies Halloween"". But after seeing it, I still have a blank spot in my mind that something was missing.The film focused SO much on blood and gore to the MAX that it made the legendary Michael Myers look like a ""Jason"" type character.Did I expect this to be anything like the original ""Halloween"" movies, not at all. But I DID expect them to sustain the pure evil that invaded Michael Myers and keep that going with leaving certain things to the imagination. For example what he fed off of and how he survived.Many of the characters were everything and ANYTHING you would expect from a Rob Zombie movie. But in this genre, it went a little too far. The escape scene with the 2 cops or whatever they were talking about having sex with corpses was just out this World and SO unrealistic. Michael Myers is supposed to be the psychopath, not the one's carrying him away.Laurie was obviously a weathered down young girl after the experiences of a year earlier. Do I think it was showcased well, yes, but in all honestly, the acting on Scout's part seemed a little contrived and rushed and not really giving the viewer anything to feel bad for. I know she lost her Family in the first. That's enough to *beep* up anyone. But my sense of dread of what was coming her way was just not there.I'm a MAJOR fan of Danielle Harris and still believe she is one actress that for some reason Hollywood overlooks. She's amazing at what she does. If ANYTHING, she and her Father (Brad Dourif) were the only characters in the film worth watching.Annie was obviously strong and moved on to what had happened to her and her Friends in the first film. She was a MAJOR asset to ""Halloween II"". Laurie on the other hand seemed somewhat annoying in some scenes. Just a personal opinion. ;) The music score in this film was HORRID. I mean absolutely TERRIBLE. There was NO sample of ANY of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" theme throughout, only at the very end. That score is a MUST for ANY ""Halloween"". I don't care that it was a sequel to Rob's first film, he had that score in remake vision, it should have been in the follow up.The layout of the story seemed to be all over the place. Sherri Moon Zombie, whom I love as an actress, seemed somewhat out of place. I know she was a vision Michael was having as was Laurie. But what the heck was up with the white horse? Unless I happened to miss something.Dr. Loomis became a character no different than Michael Myers if you ask me. I could not STAND his presence in this film. He had no compassion. He had no regrets on making a book on the deaths of young teenagers from the first film.I'm giving this film a 5/10 and that's being NICE. LOL. I ONLY rate it that high because of the stellar performance that Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris offered the film. That is really all it had going for it.Other than that, we know Laurie inherits the evil that is Michael Myers. But the movie to me was no more than just a body count. Heads being crushed, dogs being eaten alive, throats getting slashed, torture.And to add on top of that, they show Michael Myers without his mask on. THAT was a HUGE mistake. He's supposed to be the ""Boogeyman"", someone VERY dark and VERY mysterious. They completely lost any mystery of Michael Myers by showing what he looked like without his mask.Sorry to go on and if I'm being repetitive, I guess the reason being is that the film really did not me with any lasting impression.That's all I can say for now. If you liked Rob's first attempt and are planning to see this and expect him to follow the same formula of some sense, then I say go in with NO expectations and then MAYBE you'll feel you SORT of got your moneys worth. Me, just a flat out body count slasher flick that held no lasting impression and POSSIBLY the WEAKEST of all ""Halloween"" entries tracing back to 1982.",Halloween II
365,hashtagpantz,Oh god...,2,9 July 2020,"This movie is an embarrassment to the Halloween franchise. Sure it was scary and gory, but there was also a side plot of possession and ghosts. It didn't really feel like John Carpenter's and Debra Hill's shape, it felt more like an aggressive mix of Saw and Evil Dead (which are both good movies, but very different from Halloween).",Halloween II
366,silentbob_rulz,Australian Theatres?,7,7 February 2010,"Australia didn't get to see this film at the Theatres, or was it just me, and it past me by?I would have paid (as i did with Mr. Zombie's previous films) just as most of my friends. And people wonder why people download films.I thought the film was OK. I knew immediately it would be nothing like the original sequel, i knew the story would have taken a different approach on how to end Michael.If there are anymore sequels, i just hope the man in black doesn't come back (GEEZ, was that a b.s. add-on)",Halloween II
367,plasppus,Polarized,6,12 January 2010,"DVD Directors(?) Cut, 120mins I'll start off by saying I'm a die-hard fan of the Halloween franchise and have seen all the films in the series multiple times (Except Season of the Witch; Once was enough). I went into this movie having heard terrible things about it. I really wanted it to be great but to be perfectly honest I was expecting it to, well, suck. But it didn't.I enjoyed the majority of the film and absolutely loved parts of it (Which shocked me) but with that being said, there are a few too many instances that really do not work at all. In the end, I managed to take that in stride considering the good qualities it has, but I can still see why its getting trashed. Zombie was let completely off the reins here and it shows. Again, that has a polarizing effect; Part of the time it results in an amazing piece of cinematography and others an awkward, illogical mess. It can come off as very artsy and ""subliminal"" at times and that's where it tails off. When its done properly in film it can be tolerable. When its done perfectly it can be beautiful. When its done poorly, it can be terrible. In this case, you'll either feel its both beautiful and terrible at times, or just terrible.Keep that in mind going in. I won't spoil the experience for you, but just give it a chance. If you go in with an open mind you may find yourself appreciating it more than you would've guessed, and this is coming from a devoted fan of the series. Zombie has a lot of great qualities as a film maker and if he ever manages to filter out the crap that comes with it, watch out.6/10 (The scale was filled with peaks and valleys throughout the 2 hours)",Halloween II

369,dominic-harrison-1,A disappointing let down!,1,10 December 2009,"What started off with a great deal of promise just drifted into an extremely annoying mess, which in turn was extremely annoying. From the moment Laurrie Strode first uttered the 'F' word the film started its slide down hill. Not the swearing; just her voice!The gore was impressive in its eww value and I was impressed with the standard of FX in this regard; from jaws hanging off to heads stamped in.Myers was ably played and the physique and general look of him was good and I was happy to hear some aggression coming from him as he stabbed and stomped his way through victims.What tore this film apart was the insanely irritating actresses at every turn. A film is so easily ruined by bad casting and this is one of those films. I guess they had to work with what was put in front of them but I doubt they had the skills to work with anything better.It also dragged on a bit here and there too, which is not uncommon with slasher movies, but still I think this dragged on in its own special way.Worst off all this film was not in the least bit scary or suspenseful, it was instead riddled with the ridiculous aberration of Myers mom and a child version of himself egging him on in inane ways.All-in-all this film got on my and my girlfriends nerves, so much so that we'd say avoid it and avoid the annoyance. If you're not bothered by crap films and fancy watching out of curiosity then why not, just don't expect much at all.",Halloween II
370,feedbackfrommrroy,Rob The Snake must change his skin on THIS rock,5,29 August 2009,"There's a good and a bad surprise in this movie. The good: the appearance of Weird Al Yankovic (a sure value). The bad: the incredible lack of... surprise! I was one of those who strongly took the defence of the first Rob's Halloween but this time, i must admit that i am really disappointed. Rob manages his art in a professional way, no doubt about it but it seems that maybe he worked a bit too much with the head and less with feelings on that one. The only trace of what-we-can-call imagination seems to be the horse and ghost things which, in my opinion (please Rob, stop reading right now) were..., no, I just can't say that... Critics should create a new movie category, the micro-waved; same stuff without the vitamins. This new flick should be showed in college as an example of that.For the last few years, there's a very annoying tendency to shot violent scenes with what- seems-to-be Parkinson/ADD ill cameramen and Ritalin-free cousin editors (just kidding). But seriously, without insinuating a sell-out accusation, I suspect these displease-to-watch process to be an avoid-the-X-rating tactic, offering a something tried to be free-of- graphic-violence-result as possible. Let me put this clear; the point is not to have violence scenes but it's hard for the audience to focus and try to see (or guess) what's is happening, period. Beside, we must share the grief with the guy; making a movie is expensive and a X- rating means to renounce to the big part of the profit in theatres : the teens, main horror- movie goers. But still...By the way, talking about teens, why the hell Mr Zombie puts those stupid nude and teens- killed-by-sin scenes, as those bad B-movies did: to arouse them? Come on, it's out of date and under-estimating their IQ. Believe me, they smart enough to get fake ID to rent porn movies. Even without this, now with the Internet anyway...As Tarantino, Rob Zombie likes to reproduce the cliché from the paradise lost, nostalgic about the past and everything but it seems that, unlike Quentin, he made it (this time) with bad taste; he got lost and fixed on the cruise control. And what about the «I love you» stuff at the end of the movie, just before Sister Myers kills the Big Bad Wolf? I thought we were about to heard violins at this time. Talking about the sound, there's a well use of it: right place, right tone, you're going to jump with the audience when Michael viciously attack.Personally, I would preferred Micheal Myers releasing his fury without hearing him breathing by the effort. It seems to me that he would be more cold and creepy but it's only a personal opinion, not a blame; he got enough like this, let's give him a break. I could still go on about the black spots of Halloween 2 but after somehow wasting my time watching it, why should I waste some more writing about it? I got a life after all, you know... Nevertheless, my feeling about this mess goes to this: FORGIVENESS. Rob Zombie did not went to movie to built a career, money and fame; he already got these. He made his turn by (and only by) a deep and sincere love for the genre, it's obvious; he proved it before. He's respectful enough to ask the permission to Master Carpenter before to remake his creation and Rob deserves the same respect in return and not only for that. As any great director (or individual), Rob lost feet on a rock and it's on this very same rock that the snake must change his skin. Yes, it's honourable to recognize the predecessors and their lessons who fashioned our cinematic world but if he stop to ape respectfully the respectables, he's going to make his real contribution and still be an honourable heir, as he already is. I forgive to Rob Zombie for his misfire and I keep my trust in him. It's my opinion. I ask nobody to share it but I wish at least you enjoyed the comment. And enjoyed it or not, if YOU want to comment mine, feel free to give me your feedback at the address right at feedbackfrommrroy@hotmail.com. Sincerely yours.",Halloween II

372,grega_salabajzer,good story and great ending!,7,17 October 2009,Rob Zombie did a good job whit this movie. I know a lot of people will disagree whit me but I like the movie because Rob Zombie present us his idea of Halloween 2. A lot of people expect a remake to 1981 Halloween II. But Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 is a different vision of Michael Myers and why he is a psychopath. His dead mother presents whats happening in his head. So in a way Rob Zombie made Myers more human. I like how he transformed Dr.Loomis in to a celebrity so the character presents what is happening whit people when they become famous and that their words can destroy some people lives. But the film has some problems. The camera is sometimes to fast and it's shaking too much. Also the first 45 minutes of the film is too slow not boring but too slow. But than the movie transforms in a good thriller. Than comes the spectacular finish that shows the connection between sister and brother(Laurie and Michael)! Beceause of a slow start and too fast camera in some parts of the film I give Halloween 2 7/10.,Halloween II
373,shaunpiersonx,Typical Zombie Material,7,31 January 2011,"Since Rob Zombie's epically terrible re-telling of the first Halloween film, many people have been praying, ""Please don't make a sequel"". Guess what? He did. Halloween 2 was released in August of 2009 and grossed a rather small amount. Reviews from critics have completely bashed the film saying that it was just bad. I tend to think otherwise.Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 is a solid slasher remake flick. A gory horror infested nightmare. In this film, Zombie brings back much of the first cast but tends to stay as far away as possible from the original Halloween 2. This is what makes the film better. In his remake of Halloween, Zombie stays close to the original and almost translates the entire thing. But in this one, Zombie directs with style and sometimes even artful intentions. Even though, a lot of the time the artsy things don't pay off as much as they should, it's good to see something attempted. The film starts off boisterous and gory with it's 26 minute opening scene where murderer Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) once again attempts to kill Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor Compton). This scene gets really long at times and feels much to dragged out.Most of the film doesn't really deliver any good scares because of it's predictability but it sure delivers tons of gore and buckets of blood which are enough to make you cringe. The acting in this movie though, is also cringe worthy. Sherri Moon Zombie does a terrible job, once again, portraying Michael Myers ghostly white matriarch. Every word that comes out of her mouth is preposterous (partly blaming the script). Scout Taylor Compton is OKAY as Laurie. At times, which is most of the movie, all it is is Scout screaming her head off. Overall, the movie is very stupid and campy. But thats what makes it fun. I appreciate the film for attempting to be do something and not be boring. Even though the acting is dreadful and the script could use a makeover, Halloween 2 will leave you either mad, sad, horrified, cheated, happy or disappointed. I would recommend this movie only to horror fans.",Halloween II
374,Bradley-Grube,I know I'm the only one who liked this...I know,8,4 August 2013,"I understand the hate for this movie, I do, but I loved it. Here's why. I hate remakes, especially horror remakes. I am a huge horror fan and if I see Michael Bay ruin one more classic, I will freak out! So I get that Halloween fans hated this movie because it ventures way off the path of the other Halloweens, but is that such a bad thing? I ask you Halloween fans, did we really want another movie with Busta Rhymes?? Really?? The franchise was at a standstill and the studio decided to change it up by enlisting the talented (I said it) Rob Zombie to breathe new life into the franchise. The first movie (2007 Halloween) was good but Zombie said he felt compelled to stick with the original's premise. OK, fine. He changed it up for the first half of the movie but had to eventually circle back and recreate the original. The second movie is where Zombie is able to do his own thing. Now in the original Halloween 2, its the same night and we really don't get to see the psychological effect that the events of that night had on Laurie down the road. This is where Zombie chose to focus his attention and I agree with it. Of course Laurie is going to be affected by what happened! So why not show it? It's real. I applaud Zombie for taking a chance instead of dishing out the same old script which he very easily could have. He decided to try something new and put his own creative spin on a tired story. Good for him. Now with all th complaints from Michael Myers purists, the franchise is stuck in limbo again. So thanks! Because guess who now has his hands on the franchise? That's right kids, it's Michael Bay! Yay! Anyone looking forward to the new Halloween in the same capacity as 2009's Friday the 13th or 2010's A Nightmare on Elm St.? No? Oh well! That's what you're going to get.",Halloween II
375,LBfan84,The 3rd worst movie of the franchise,4,30 September 2009,"As if Rob Zombie's bizarre, white trash vision of Michael Myers wasn't misguided and ill-conceived enough, this film managed to exceed the awfulness of the first Halloween (Zombie's not Carpenter's). John Carpenter's original vision has yet to be surpassed and this film has simply reinforced that. Were I to list the worst Halloween movies, this would be third in line after Halloween 3: Season of the Witch and Halloween Resurrection. For die-hard fans of the original films, they'll know exactly what I mean by that. Zombie's hulking, overly grunting, monstrous behemoth version of Michael Myers is a stark contrast from the deceptively average yet horrifying Michael Myers that John Carpenter created. The continuity behind Zombie's idea of Michael Myers is badly disjointed as well. Whereas Zombie's original film tends to display a villain that is the result of childhood trauma and neglect, this film tends to indicate an inexplicably supernatural force that is guiding his hand. We're left with a conflicted understanding of who Michael Myers even is. And don't even get me started on the antipathetic antihero that Loomis is portrayed as. With minor positive flourishes concerning the intensity and passion as the movie progresses, it still manages to fall flat as a reasonable vision of the story and characters that John Carpenter created.",Halloween II

So honestly I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed and lets just say my gut feeling didn't fail me I think this film is to far fetched and it pays no respect to the original sequel the characters are dull Malcolm McDowell's performance was no match to compete with Donald pleasance the direction the film went in was highly predictable coming from a director like (Rob Zombie) it's wacky,weird and in my opinion Rob Zombies worst film yet...........Rob tried to go his own way with the film which is respectable but he failed to follow carpenter in this film and in the 2007 remake to sum up this very criticizing review it sucked if your not a fan of the original two Halloween films go ahead and check this one out but I can not and will not recommend this film",Halloween II

Michael was always my favorite. My friends and I sneaked into see h20 because we weren't old enough, I saw the disappointing resurrection and the first rob zombie Halloween in theaters as well. I waited eagerly for H2 but left the theater a little disappointed. Upon DVD release I got the unrated version and watched it in absolute amazement. This was not the movie I saw in theaters and as others have stated rob zombie is no john carpenter but that isn't a bad thing. It doesn't skimp on the blood, violence, nudity, cussing, or any other forms of ""sin"" so if you're uncomfortable with any of that then pass on this, everyone else give it a chance with an open mind.This is Halloween the way rob intended it to be, this is Michael Meyer's nightmares. From start to finish the line between reality and delusion is blurred. We are seeing survivors with much more than physical scars. Laurie is a b**** who is getting by on pills and parties while pushing everyone away. It's hard to like her character but I don't think we're really supposed to. In real life she would probably be just as messed up. The actress who turned in the best performance in my opinion was Danielle Harris returning as Annie. Her death scene was the first time someone dying in a horror movie actually made my eyes water. That scene alone shows what rob was going for in this movie. Yeah it's a slasher but it's a living man haunted by his own demons chasing real people with flaws and demons of their own. These people with all their imperfections have loved ones who are just as devastated by their death as anyone would have been to the seemingly perfect Laurie we watched Jamie lee portray. The only difference is this Laurie or this Annie could have been sitting next to you in high school. Was it perfect? Not at all. Was it supposed to be? No and real life isn't either.",Halloween II

The main characters aren't likable at all especially Scout Taylor Compton as Laurie Strode. We cared for and wanted to see Jamie Lee Curtis survive every time she played Laurie. Compton is so bad, she should have been the first to get wiped out. There is no real story either, just ideas and visuals ripped from Freddy, Jason, and Leatherface plus other stuff that must have come from cocaine and or meth usage. Think of the worst Nightmare, Friday, Texas Chainsaw, or SAW volume you've viewed. I guarantee that this is worse. Zombie should start paying people like Sam Raimi, Wes Craven, Sean Cunningham and others to ghost direct his films. Uwe Boll could do a better job.",Halloween II

all i can say, in the horror genre, this isnt a bad movie at all.
Yes it is very clearly a rob zombie movie, which means cursing, needless nudity, trailer trash and this and all that, but also, human emotions.
I feel this is a very strong point in Rob Zombie's films, and hardly ever gets pointed out.If you're looking for rivers of blood, or a slasher movie where the victims just pile up without anyone caring, this isnt that.
Instead, Michael myers himself, and his victims, are allowed to have a more human side.
yes people scream and curse a lot in this movie, but hey... its better than the standard ""30 year old actors acting like teens and talking a lot of ""ow mygawd""I rate this a seven,

I honestly was surprised at how well the cinematography was done. It wasn't to shaky cam and it was very clear. Really there wasn't too much blood, except for the hospital scene. Some might not be able to stomach that scene, but I was able too. Scout really and truly stepped up her game. There was one scene with Sheriff Brackett and Annie that had me in tears. The ending of the movie was brilliant. Michale Meyers was a lot more frightening this time around, and Sheri's performance was great. Overall the only two things i did not like were Loomis and Harley. They both bugged the crap out of me and I just wanted them to be left out. One thing I can say is there is only some minor nudity and no sex what so ever. So everyone go see this film and enjoy it :].",Halloween II
384,greendaybeans,I actually liked this,7,30 August 2009,"For all the bad hype this movie is getting, i actually liked it. I liked it for the exact reason others hated it: it's DIFFERENT. Rob Zombie was able to make his own original story line with slight psychological elements that i enjoyed. Also, i liked the fact that there wasn't as much sex in this as the first one. Being an art student at an art college, i enjoyed the trippy, artistic dream sequences that he put in the film, but a lot of people will hate that because they are afraid of change or something, i don't know, i think the haters just wanted a remake of the original Halloween 2. Whatever.Anyways, another thing i liked about this movie were some of the heart-wrenching scenes acted out by Brad Dourif near the end. He is a great actor and i am glad he was chosen to play Sheriff Brackett for these two films.Now, all that aside, it's not perfect. For one, and this made a LOT of people angry, the traditional Halloween theme barely makes an appearance in this, as does Laurie's theme. Also, there wasn't too much to the story--in other words, a LOT of blood and guts. I am indifferent about Samuel Loomis' character change, i like it but i don't at the same time...All in all, it's a solid attempt at Zombie putting his own lore into the franchise, and yes, some of the scenes actually DID scare me. Zombie's good at what he does, i believe. If you aren't afraid to see something original tried to put into an old franchise, then go see it. Just don't go in expecting an Oscar winner...expect a slasher movie with some good scenes.",Halloween II

The characters have no depth and Rob puts too much of his Gothic rock vibe to the picture!hmmmm what else can i say... horses, white dresses, Michael grunting when he kills, pathetic Dr loomis character, no scares at all= the worst Halloween movie ever! shame on you Rob for unleashing this pile of rubbish on the public!!",Halloween II

387,davebyron17,Simply Idiotic,3,17 January 2010,"What can I say about Rob Zombie and his crappy ""psychological"" twists??? Basically, his twists are an excuse to get his crappy acting wife into every one of his movies. Rob Zombie, you ruin all of your movies because you keep putting your wife in them. And your white horse concept might sound good in theory, but it looked absolutely retarded on screen. The only people in this movie who didn't make asses of themselves were Danielle Harris who played Annie Brackett and Brea Grant who played Laurie's normal friend Mya. Other than that, you made Laurie look like a cheap prostitute and turned her good acting from the first Halloween into an annoying, rebellious, horrible actress who screams about thirty times too much in the second film. Did you not watch this film before you released it? Like come on, the necrophilia talk at the beginning of the movie followed by the coroner's wagon smashing into a cow?? That's how you bring Michael back???? Idiotic.Your image of Michael Myers really made me shake my head. He looked like a hillbilly who lived in the same woods that Deliverance came from. He all of a sudden starts grunting and talking??? I bet John Carpenter really appreciated how you butchered his masterpiece.If it didn't have some of your creative gore, this piece of garbage would've been ranked 1 out of 10. Keep your wife out of your movies. She ruins all of them.",Halloween II
388,steaston,"wo wo, whats with all the terrible reviews?",8,29 August 2009,"I cant believe what I am reading here, or I cant understand what people were expecting from this film. Sure Zombie's screenplay is a little weak. Sure it is gory. It is a slasher flick. It is a fricking good slasher flick. Rob Zombie continues to carefully and effectively elaborate on genre conventions with bold cinematography and edgy direction. The cinematography, on that note, is ridiculously good. The sets and soundtrack are right on point. Zombie's trademark hardcore hillbilly characters are present and in good form. It may not have the emotion of devils rejects or the tidiness of the first halloween, but it is a f'ing good slasher movie. And if this is what Rob Zombie does with a mediocre script, we should all be excited to see what he does with his next really good piece of writing. Keep it up Mr. Zombie...",Halloween II
389,mikeschultz,The Best MIchael Yet,10,27 August 2009,"OK before anyone gets all on my case about this i not comparing this to the original Halloween 2 or anything like but this movie blew me away. so he goes...i suggest seeing the first movie before hand but its not a must you can get through just find not seeing it.the movie picks up right where the first left off and right from there the movies goes on a violent rampage for 2 hours. Laurie is supremely f****d up and rightfully so considering what happened in the first movie. she is trying to get over the stress and emotional s*it show she went through one year prior. this is where I'm gonna stop telling what happened in the movie and explain why the movie was so great. this movie does something that no other horror move or slasher flick ever has, it goes deeper into how f****d up you would actually be if you parents were murdered as well as friends and you were attacked.its a struggle day to day just to get by, i put my self in her shoes several times and i could 100% see why she does the things she does in the movie.rob zombie does a awesome job of conveying that Laurie shares the same psychotic gene in her DNA as her slasher brother and how it progressively eats away at her until it comes out. this flick will catch a lot of flack cause its not a stupid teen flick with little pg-13 love stories and good guys winning this is an old fashion f****d up horror movie something that fans of the genre have really wanted. body count ,check, nudity check, gore,check and a ton of new surprises. the movie still gets people to jump even when you know someone is gonna bit it and it also knocks people off when you thing the might make it. it has the thrills chills and all things a great Halloween movie needs and gets you amped up for October. if you like horror, scares and a movie with a lot of emotional charged characters this is it for you if you like those fake pg-13 horror movies then well i heard the haunting in Connecticut just came out on DVD",Halloween II
390,Buzz_act,Underrated masterpiece of Slasher Horror,10,29 July 2010,"Halloween 2 is awesome. It's the after horror movie, movie. I don't know about anyone else but I've always kinda wondered what happened the victims of a horror movie after the movie had actually finish. I know Sally from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is meant to go into a mental hospital but you never get to actually see it. Halloween 2 shifts from focusing on Myers (who is the protagonist of the first) to Laurie (the victim from the first), which works really well for it. In this movie you get to see just how messed up an experience of surviving a mass murdering rampage makes you. Scout Taylor-Compton does a great job of this think. Normally I hate a load emo stuff but this is not what's going on in the movie. Laurie does a lot of whinnying and of lot of angry lashing out at people she cares deeply for but she is genuinely trying to stop this behaviour, it's just that everything that she's been through keeps replaying in her head, everything is a constant reminder and she can't cope with it.OK the majority of the deaths are the fairly standard slasher deaths and pretty much what you'd expect. This is actually what I didn't like about the second half of the first movie but I think they fit in much better here. It also has in it one of the creepiest deaths scenes that I have ever seen and that's the one of Annie. Annie is a instantly likable character. She is a survivor too but has got herself together far more than Laurie but there is still something there that suggests that she might crack at any moment, kudos to Danielle Harris for that great acting. Annie try's to support Laurie as best she can and takes far more crap from her than she really has to or deserves and whilst she does lose it a couple of times she always push quickly back giving us an intensely human support character that is a great mirror for Laurie our protagonist. These traits endeared her to me as the audience a great deal. When Michael Myers comes to the house I was rooting for her to get away but knowing that she wouldn't. This truly had me on the edge of my seat and having her killed off screen to let my imagination do the work, with the fast whispered ""help, help, help,"" and the sounds of struggle made the whole thing truly horrific. Laurie's reaction is great. Such pain in her voice as she apologies for being such a bitch and admits that she needs Annie to cope with everything that's happened. Then her father the Sheriff (Brad Dourif) find her and the pain in his voice as he hold her is almost unbearable. Never in a slashed movie have I cared so much for a character who's been killed or the pain inflicted on those who loved them, as I have in the case of Annie. It's without a doubt the best death scene in a slasher movie that I've ever seen and I think one of the best death scenes ever.I suppose one of the reason why I might have liked this movie more than other people is because I haven't seen many of the other Halloween films and the ones I have seen I watched in no particular order. I never really liked Michael Myers or Jason for that matter. I preferred Freddy and Chucky and Pinhead for the reason that they had loads of personality and that all of that personality was driven on killing you. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I came into these remakes with no preconceptions of what I thought Michael Myers should be but with an idea of what I thought a good horror/slasher movie should be. Halloween 2 surpassed my expectations and then some. It had some good death scenes where I was glad to see the victim get taken a part, it had some death scenes where I was rooting for the victim and it had one horrific death scene which will forever stick in my mind, probably because it was mostly my mind doing the work. It had fantastic character development with believable and emotional humanising of these characters, which made me root for them even more and did what a good horror movie is supposed to do, scare me.I think the problem with this movie, which is one that I think faces a lot of remakes; is that people have a certain ideas about the way certain characters should act or behave and are upset when they don't. If you're going to watch a remake you have let go of your preconceptions and be prepared to embrace someone else's new ideas and imaginings. This is exactly what Rob Zombie's Halloween films are; a re-imagining. It's not meant to be like the originals, the characters in them are not the same characters in this. I think this film would have been received much better if the title of the film was something different and the characters names where all changed but the plot and the cast remained the same. This is probably why remakes in general are a bad idea and film makers should start making new things whilst only taking inspiration from old movies rather than entire plot premises. For now though I'll just say that Rob Zombies Halloween 2 is what it is, an underrated masterpiece of slasher horror.",Halloween II
391,dorit28,Could've Been Much Better,3,31 October 2010,"Going in to this film i expected 4 things blood,sex,cussing,and an un-loyal follow up. First the cussing in this film is straight up ridiculous. I have never heard so many F-bombs in one film. It was ridiculous all the cussing. That makes the film almost dissolve away because it takes away taking the character seriously and making it as if i don't care about them. Second the acting was so bad, it was a joke. Only Brea Grant,Danielle Harris,Brad Dourif, and Tyler Mane took this film serious, the other cast members were just god awful.Plus the fact that Rob thought making Dr Loomis a rich,snobby,narcissistic,jerk was a smart idea showed how much negligence he showed to the film. Then the biggest mistake was not having it all in the hospital.The classic 1981 sequel was iconic for having the film take place in the hospital, but only the opening sequence contained a hospital.Although a pretty good grindhouse type horror flick this was a lazy attempt to remake a classic.",Halloween II
392,jenniferjsnow,Not So Much,4,15 January 2010,"I'm going to avoid commenting on this movie with regard to it's place in the rest of the Halloween franchise, or in relation to other Rob Zombie pieces. I believe this is a generous, if not overly fair, approach to this film.The main character, Laurie, fails in terms of acting and as a protagonist. I'm great with problematic heroes, and the wholesome sweetheart thing is obviously trite, but she truly sucked. I was pulling for Michael Myers after about 15 minutes of her b.s. This was a major problem for me, as I couldn't wait for her to die.Another major problem was Michael Myer's mother. The scenes involving her were way too frequent, and they were like a bad Heart video, minus the attractive women. I appreciated the backstory and the way she was used to explain why he would be relentlessly working to murder his sister, but this lady needs to go. Making her the evil force behind his actions, not as a result of abuse but by directing his actions, is too lame and empowers a dumb and unnecessary character.Two smaller issues I had with this one were the length and setting. It is 20 minutes too long, and this could have been easily resolved by cutting out most of the scenes including the mother, and the entire strip club scene. And the historical revisionism was an absolute joke. It's insulting to have stuff with some particular nostalgic value at current thrown up in your face just because it technically existed back then, but in a totally different context. As if a convincing setting can merely be constructed around kitschy objects with no regard for social/cultural and technological norms of the time.But the kills were pretty good. The suspense just goes down the drain when you wish you could just grab the knife from Micheal's hand and murder the main character yourself. I've truly never felt that way before. But at least my favorite character made it, the P.R. lady for the author-doctor. And the shrink wasn't too bad, either. Hopefully we see more of them next time.",Halloween II

Dr Loomis in this film has suddenly been turned into a complete arrogant fool, with this the character that everybody loved has now dyed.i know rob zombie is a poster-boy for white trash but why o why does everybody in this film have to look and act in the same way, its just so awfully put together i was in the cinema and as the film was finishing i still was waiting for it to get started i know i am no professional critic but i do no when a director tries to remake a classic and fails miserably...",Halloween II

What I dislike about this film is the ""White horse"" thing..Yeah I didn't like that. Then, what they did with Sam Loomis.. I hated Sam in this film. Nobody should EVER play Dr. Loomis but Donald Pleasence.. Then, what they did with Laurie Strode.. The acting was great.. But what they did to Laurie was absolutely terrible.. I was impressed with the remake of ""Halloween"" though. Also, The last part where Laurie was shot..I hated that part. Laurie Strode is a SURVIVOR not another body that has been killed in the movie. But, I must admire Rob Zombie's creativity in this movie. I can handle watching it.. But not without shaking my head at the end..",Halloween II
395,marcgroves1996,The Best Rob Zombie Film,3,4 November 2009,"Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 has its flaws but is a strangely enjoyable film. After the 2007 remake which was a big hit at the box office (US at least) he returns for the sequel but brings a darker, grittier and more brutal vision of Michael Myers. The film opens with a stunning Hospital scene involving Laurie and Michael. It then fast forwards a year and follows the survivors of the 1st films events trying to get back to normality. Laurie, Annie, Sheriff Brackett and Dr Loomis all cope in different ways. Loomis turns to greed and selling books about the murders, Annie is a recluse, while Laurie is plagued by haunting nightmares and visions. Of course its Halloween again and Michael is all set to return for a family reunion with Laurie who is about to discover just who she really is, Michaels sister! The film is stunning looking, the kills are brutal and harsh. Yes there are some flaws, the pacing is poor in parts and the ending feels rushed while the visions involving Deb Myers (Michaels mother) and a white horse are a bit naff and overdone. This is Halloween like you have never seen before, the suspense of John Carpenters vision has been replaced by a harsh, brutal unstoppable hulk who kills viciously and aggressively. Some will like it, some will hate it. I like it, a lot!",Halloween II
396,ethaskins,Halloween II was a total waste of time and money!,1,28 August 2009,"First off, I am a fan of Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""House Of A 1000 Corpses."" Also, I liked Rob Zombie's first Halloween. It wasn't great, but it was decent. I was looking forward to having a lot of fun watching this sequel; only to be set up for extreme disappointment. The movie lacked suspense. Also, for some reason, Rob must have thought that to be extremely loud is to be scary. Wrong! Also, Laurie Strode a/k/a Angel Myers was so whiny and unstable, I couldn't wait for her to be killed, which, sad to say, never happened. Every character was just a cookie cut-out waiting to be killed. There were many of the actors in which you didn't even get a good look at their faces before they were killed. The movie was disjointed and extremely loud and gory. I love gory, but this was a bit over the top. Michael Myers was popping up everywhere. It was too much like a Wile E. Coyote cartoon. Oh, I guess Sheri Moon Zombie wanted a bigger role. Wow! What a big mistake! She cannot act. And she was annoying. Also, Sam Loomis's character was only there to be killed off. Believe me, by the end of the movie, you'll be cheering for his death. I also didn't like the fact that the movie veered so much into her nightmares that most times you didn't know if it was real or just a nightmare; or was Michael Myers like Freddy Krueger and he could be anywhere. All of the characters were white trash and severely stupid. I never thought a movie could be so violent and gory yet be so dreadful and boring at the same time. As I was watching the movie, I kept thinking about the original Halloween 2. It was a much better movie. Also, Rob Zombie should know better! Introduce the characters and let us get to know them before you go and kill them. In this movie, Michael Myers went on a happy and silly killing spree, popping up everywhere at the same time, with such silly and extremely loud stabbing sounds! Rob, do you know what overkill is? Do you actually know how to write a decent screenplay without excessive ""F"" words? And can you write a movie without having to put your wife in it? It's not enough to have style, Rob, you also need to have some substance in there. Halloween 2 (2009) was just a stylish piece of crap.",Halloween II

398,mandylozon,retro 70's style splatter,8,31 January 2010,"If it wasn't for the excessive unrealistic use of the ""F"" word I would rate this even higher. I'm no prude and have nothing against cussing it just didn't fit in certain scenes as it does in films like ""Scarface"". This film really reminded me how cool the downbeat horror films of the 70's were. Oddly enough when I walked out of the theatre I hated the movie. I watched it again on DVD and did a complete 360. I like both the directors and theatrical cut. My complaints other than the above were the changes made to Loomis and the look of Michael. I was unprepared for it but when I re-watched it I got it. It makes sense Michael would be homeless and it is silly that in the original sequels he always manages to have fresh coveralls and a pristine mask. Not sure if was intentional but the hood and mask combination reminded me of lesser known cult films like ""Alice Sweet Alice"" and ""Don't Look Now"". When mask-less, Michael reminded me of ""Dazed and Confused"" in Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same"". This movie is gory, violent and gritty and other than Michael's homicidal rage and relentless quest to reunite with his sister it has little to do with the original sequels. The cinematography is incredible and I can't get over how it feels so 70's no hope, no survivors, evil wins. Michael's mommy visions are vary nightmarish and surreal. Everyone seems to either love or hate this movie(Iv'e done both) and it probably won't win over fans of the original series. I only really like the first 2 originals, thought 4 and 5 were OK and didn't care for 6,7,8 at all. I didn't include 3 as it has nothing to do with the Michael saga. Warning to the weak of stomach this is graphic!!! Animal lovers beware(I'm one myself) Michael kills and eats a dog. He also does this in this original ""Halloween"" but this time it's on screen and in your face. A truly original take on the series. A no holds bars trip into psycho hell.",Halloween II
399,Snoody,Fantastic brutal film,8,4 October 2011,"I saw Halloween 2 in theaters, despite having LOATHED Rob's previous films, including the original Halloween remake. But I was really glad I gave this one a chance.For one thing, his wife Sheri has no more than 8-10 lines. It would of been absolutely fantastic had he managed to get her out of the film altogether, but a very limited role is still very positive. So on that note, I will go into the film itself..This movie is very brutal and realistic, which is a great fresh new element that American horror films are missing. I am tired of death scenes being 'cut away' (IE Hostel) and the actors are just seen covered in blood. I want to see the blade enter and hear the skin pierce! And it was nice to see some of those elements in this film. I was very excited/surprised to even see a boot-smashed in face death scene make it in. The death scenes make this movie by far one of the best American horror films in years, another one that comes to mind is the Hills Have Eyes Remake. Michael's journey to return to Haddonfield is by far the best story line for me. I really liked his unbending and unflinching desire to get home. I didn't care too much to see the development and post traumatic stress of the Laurie character. When I come to see a horror film, I come to see people die, not feel empathy for them. The 'hardcore' element was just a little too much, not unbearable. But by the end of the film, I was definitely cheering for Michael (as I wanted to be). The best part of the film for me by far was the tone of the death scenes as well. It was not the typical 'silly' death scenes that you see in horror films. They really do feel dark and sinister, as they would in reality. There's no cheesy cheering going to be coming from the audience- this is really not your 80's horror films.On a personal side note, it was also really awesome to see a Moody Blues cameo!And now the downside to this film- the messy plot and awkward acting. I was very much over the bit about Michael's mother playing such a large role in these remakes. And this film definitely drags that element out. The flashbacks were overdone, and the boy actor as Michael is very uncomfortable on screen with his lines. They really should of replaced him or minimized his role down to a 1 or 2 lines. I also can't say much for the main actress, although she was not a terrible at acting, the F word became uncomfortable to hear because it was very overused. Also I was not a fan of the way Dr. Loomis was portrayed in his new 'egotisical' direction.Overall, its a great horror flick to watch with friends who also love brutal films. I would recommend this film to people who really love to watch on-screen deaths and lots and lots of fake blood!",Halloween II

402,the_ka-tet_of_one,"A Glimpse Into Insanity? No, Stupidity.",2,24 July 2012,"I watched this movie today on Netflix. Before I start I have to say that I am a big Michael Myers fan, and always have been. When Rob Zombie re-made Halloween I was very skeptical; but in the end thoroughly impressed. It was an extremely intelligent movie (for a horror movie anyways) delving into the madness of Myers rather than just an excuse to watch teenagers get killed. Going into Halloween II, I was very excited. And was left with a bitter taste in my mouth to remind me that yet another franchise has been ruined.First off, there was a very uneasy balance of good and downright terrible acting. Malcolm McDowell gave an amazing performance (as he did in the first) and I truly cared for his character. The Sheriff was also a very well done character. But that is unfortunately where it ends. All 4 female leads were terribly done and unrealistically portrayed, enough said. Michael was OK, but its not like he really ""acts"" anyways.The plot was decent (once again, for a horror movie which tend to have horrible scripts anyways) and until midway through the movie, I was enjoying myself. Then the twist came, if you can call it that. SPOILER ALERT: The main character is Myers' sister! Uh... wait a minute..? What? Aside from recycling a previous plot point and passing it off as a twist, the characters acting and reaction is simply abysmal. Here's how she acts: five minutes of repetitive F-bombs and tantrums, drives to her friends house, more F-bombs and tantrums, and then she blurts out ""I WANNA GO PARTY!"" And I swear I was ready to turn off the movie right there. However I persisted, simply out of the hope that she would get her comeuppance for being such an idiotic character. But no! Her friends die, random stripper dies, hillbillies die, Loomis (the only truly well done character) dies, and then the stupid blonde sister of a serial killer somehow miraculously kills Michael. Needless to say I was furious.As if it wasn't bad enough there, the last 2-3 minutes of the movie is the audience being treated to another ""twist"" as she comes out of the ordeal wearing Myers mask, then cut to her in an insane asylum, smiling. It was more than I could take, and I'm seriously doubtful of any future Rob Zombie movies being good at all.To me, it ruined the whole movie (as if it wasn't already bad enough.) Please Hollywood, do NOT let Rob Zombie get his hands on any other well established franchises, because it's clear that he doesn't know what he's doing with them. At all costs avoid this movie, watch the first R.Z. Halloween, it was good. This movie sucked.I give it a 2 out of 10 simply because of Malcolm McDowell. We weren't treated to anything surprising or unique, and instead of us getting to delve into the mind of a madman as we did in the first, we get to delve into the mind of an idiot- which is passed off as insanity. Terrible, terrible movie.",Halloween II

Why any film company would put their money in his hands is beyond me. His film-making skills are like that of a high school student, only with millions of dollars at his disposal.

Please stop."" Brad Dourif was cool, and it was nice to see Dobber (sp?) from Coach make a cameo.

404,dumpy666,Just not feeling it this time (major spoilers),3,30 August 2009,"I really have to say that I set my expectations far too high. I haven't seen a movie this summer that I liked and I was hoping for this flick to be a saving grace. It wasn't. All the elements that made the first Halloween great for me were missing. I miss Daeg Faerch as young Michael myers. So when the movie opened with a really bad flashback, and a different kid playing young Michael Myers (i knew this in advance), I was already skeptical. This new kid lacked that ""it factor"", and really made the dialog feel forced. The explanation for the ""mom's ghost"" shtick felt too reminiscent of Friday the 13th a la Jason Vorhee's and his mother.To top it off the whole controlled by the will of his mother's ghost, or a delusion of it, spoils the thing that makes Michael Myers who he is. That is to say, an insatiable need to kill with no explanation of the true nature of his motivations. What makes him an effective killer persona, is the anonymity of his actions. Sure we know where he went crazy, and sort of why, but by Rob Zombie spelling it out so clearly in this narrative it takes away the allure. Like the adage says, ""no one buys the cow, when they can get the milk for free"".As another poster has said their is a strange need to overuse the ""f"" word en mass, multiple times. So the dialog I found to be weak. Scout Taylor-Compton and Brad Dourif were good in there roles (Laurie Strode and Sheriff Brackett, but Danielle Harris as Annie Brackett was reduced to a secondary character with a lack of depth. As were Laurie's new friends, we'll call them ""the slutty interchangeable-cliché twins"". Because both of these characters performances were phoned in.I'm not feeling the whole angry drifter angle they put Michael Myers in. Tyler Mane still conveys utter brutality on screen, so kudos to him. But they honestly didn't give him the proper vehicle this time, letting the whole flashback/hallucination/dead mother thing get way out of hand. How many times can you put your own wife on camera shamelessly before you realize she's impeding the flow of the characters progression. And how weak was the way Laurie found out she was really Angel Myers?, really, just read a book. It works, but it just seems like they threw it in last minute in a pitch meeting where they were trying to tie up loose ends.This movie felt like a miss-mash of Halloween and The Devils Rejects. I really must say I was so excited to see this movie, but I guess when you factor in that Rob Zombie originally didn't want to make a sequel, but magically had a 'change of heart', I should've seen the writing on the wall. The first Halloween felt fresh because Zombie took an already good formula and expanded upon it with great character development, and a rare sense of hunger that made the brutality of the killings stand out even more. As a slasher movie, Halloween II works, but as the ""Laurie Strode goes mental/psychological thriller"" they hyped this as, I'm very disappointed.",Halloween II

406,johnnyboy6204-117-186828,A good sequel to the first of his movie with great film techniques,9,13 September 2017,I really enjoyed this film I think Rob Zombies film techniques are great especially with the horror dream montage which is not done too often that for me was my favourite. This is why films are good when they get modernised its never normally the story its about the directors take on the setting/environment and state of mind of main characters and portray with techniques and aspects that other directors would not include. People that bad mouth this film mainly just don't like Rob Zombie.,Halloween II
407,jasonward-19758,Better than the first but still a bit rubbish,4,12 December 2018,"Was it just me or did Zombie remake Halloween or Leather face , by the end of this film I thought grandpa was gonna turn up and hand leather eh sorry Michael his chainsaw back and he was gonna do that crazy dance. Zombies style was always closer to chainsaw than any Carpenter vibe. So no surprise this looks washed out 70's and has its main heroine doing a Marilyn Chambers . its violent and delivers on the shape being an unstoppable killing machine, but again lazy writing (dream sequences and visions, come on) and poor use of good actors, Loomis is now just a complete A hole but glad to see his eyes have grown back and Dourif gets more screentime but doesn't get to go full Brad, both characters and actors deserve better than this script. While not 1 star, its not good, see it once, then go back to watching the original Texas or the devils rejects.",Halloween II
408,zegrosowl,So I know this movie was bashed to the stone age. . .,5,2 September 2009,"I suppose rightfully so too, but I am one man. I think I was the biggest fan of Saw V as well.Anyways, I liked it. Everyone I know disliked/hated it. Every review I heard/read claimed disappointment and I can see why. The film is flawed, some aspects were unnecessary, and it feels a bit rushed. Nevertheless, I managed to really enjoy it.Scout-Taylor Compton was really good as Laurie. I really felt for her. I recall her best line was (as she is flipping through Dr. Loomis' new book to explain to her friends what is wrong) when she says something to the effect of ""this is my f**ked up life"". That brings me to Loomis. I hated him, but I believe that was Rob Zombie's intention: to hate what he has become. Michael Myers becomes a real bad-ass (as if he wasn't already). He often goes 'overkill' with some of his victims. We also seem to understand more of his motives by getting a glimpse of his overall psyche.I do not own the 2007 remake, but after seeing this, I want to own them both. Excellent effort from Mr. Zombie",Halloween II
409,tlkasde13,An unlikeable film from start to finish; doesn't attempt to scare but to disturb,3,28 August 2009,"I am endlessly and forever a fan of the Halloween franchise. John Carpenter's classic original film is not only one of my favorite movies, but it has become a yearly tradition to watch the film in its appropriate time of year. The dream-like Autumn atmosphere that sweeps me away to that season every time I watch it, the haunting score, the down to earth (although slightly cheesy) performances, the perfect cinematography borrowed partially from the great minds of Argento and Hitchcock. It is safe to say that I know Halloween, and I know my Michael Myers. At least how it should be done.And maybe that is where my problem lies with this installment, and with Rob Zombie's first attempt. I have seen the idea work. This doesn't work.The film substitutes suspense for buckets of blood and endless amounts of gratuitous violence. But most of you already know that. It is Rob Zombie, he doesn't know how to create suspense. The film substitutes likable, relatable characters with whitetrash cardboard cutouts of actual human beings (who likes these characters or the vulgar-for-the-sake-of-vulgar conversations they have?). But most of you already know this. It is Rob Zombie, he doesn't know how to write actual human beings.There are not any memorable chases. The characters, of whom descriptions serve little purpose (all of the girls are essentially the same character, some marginally more trashy than others), don't stand a chance in this movie. Michael Myers doesn't haunt. He kills. He isn't the boogeyman, he's a freight train.Zombie also decided to add some bizarre plot points to give us an idea as to why Michael Myers attacks, but these mirages only look ridiculous next to the gritty, brutal, too-realistic to be realistic violence.I don't understand how anyone could like this movie. I don't know how. I have thought about the mind that could appreciate such horrible film-making and such horrible...just general humanity. I love horror films. Love them. But this is not a horror film. This is smut.However, I do have a proposition as to how this film can become beneficial to society. Policemen should guard the doors to the film, and as patrons exit the cinema every policeman will ask each and every person who viewed this film if they liked it. If they reply with ""no"" they are allowed to leave. If they reply with ""yes"", they are put in handcuffs and hauled off to jail. The mind of a person who appreciates this film should not be allowed in society, and is not morally okay or mentally stable. Zombie, watch out.(If you are reading this, looking for a film to watch this weekend, go see Inglourious Basterds, or District 9, or 500 Days of Summer, or the Hurt Locker. Rent the original Halloween and view it again... Just avoid this film.)",Halloween II
410,mjesus,Pretty good.,7,29 August 2009,"I thought this movie was a very good follow up to the remake. It was different than what I expected it to be. This is definitely a Rob Zombie movie. What I liked: -The violence was intense and harsh -Dr. Loomis side story was humorous and entertaining thanks to MacDowells performance -The creative dream sequences -The bizarre appearances of the ghosts of Myer's mother & child self -The ending was very fitting -The film was very well paced and i was never bored while watching it -Great cinematography -Good music selectionWhat I did not like: -The recast young Michael was unfortunately not as good as the one from the remake. -Sheri Moon, i did not like the opening scene with her, she was fine as the ghost though. -Michael has the ability of teleportation -Scene at the Myers house was clearly not shot on the same set as the last movie, Haddonfield no longer has a suburban feel which is sort of weird.",Halloween II
411,killbillfanatic2005,The Worst Movie I've Seen In A Long Time,1,29 August 2009,"I have been a huge fan of the Halloween series for a long time, and have seen every movie (aside from Resurrection, for obvious reasons) several times. When Rob Zombie released his original remake of the John Carpenter classic, I was intrigued and interested in seeing a new interpretation of the killer. Now, I didn't hate that movie, but it was overall just too much ""Rob Zombie"" and not enough Michael Myers. I don't exactly know what I was expecting when I heard that this movie was coming out, but I (for some unknown reason) was excited to see it. I got my tickets for the midnight showing well in advance, and was ready to go. As midnight on Thursday night finally approached, the more excited I got. And then the movie started. As it kept playing, the worse it got, and to say the plot was underdeveloped or even non-existent would be giving this film a compliment. I don't know what exactly was going on in the heads of the filmmakers, but obviously nothing related to the Halloween series. This piece of garbage ranks among the worst movies I have ever seen, and I have seen The Island, and many other things by Michael Bay, so that is definitely saying something. Even for me, however, there are horror movies that are ""so bad that they're even more enjoyable."" But Halloween II is about as far away from that as possible to be. I would rather have Michael Myers actually kill me than sit through another Rob Zombie Halloween movie. Avoid this disaster at all costs!",Halloween II
412,NeoNightmareXX,"The best part of the original ""Halloween 2"" was Sheri Zombie (Director's Cut Review)",2,31 July 2011,"If there's one thing I thought the original franchise lacked, it was a nonsensical storyline. Thankfully, the first remade movie (which was a gritty retelling that COULD have made sense) didn't have much at all to do with this movie - the child actor was replaced, as was the entire original plot, and the motive of the killer, and the role of every character...but don't worry, Rob Zombie's wife was kept in. The original Halloween franchise described a mysterious invincible serial killer who was bent on killing everyone in his path. The remade two-part series is about a hobo who talks, and sometimes kills people. If you thought Michael Myers was mysterious before, just wait until you see him in this movie - basically homeless and nonchalant. He walks around with the same intensity that you might have when going to a gas station for a soda. In the director's cut, he doesn't wear a mask too often, which might excite you to think about; however, the implementation of this is horrible. It's not a ""Jason Voorhees"" unmasked, where you wonder how deformed the face looks...it's literally just a tall dude with a beard. This isn't a spoiler alert because I'm literally saving you a few minutes of going to look this up. I'm saving you from disappointment. Throughout the film, you may wonder why Myers is killing again. I certainly did, until Strode eloquently screamed (through tears) a reason which I couldn't make out without subtitles. While I was originally quite worried about her character's integrity and ability to confront such overwhelming obstacles, I was relieved a minute later when she confirmed ""I'm drunk, I don't care anymore! I'm drunk, let's party! I want to party! I'm drunk! I don't care!"" Again, I was worried - what if she couldn't party? Thankfully, her friends who were never fully introduced were convinced they should all party. The hospital was the main setting for the original Halloween 2. For the remake, the setting is WHEREVER A LIVING CHARACTER HAPPENS TO BE.The psychiatrist who understood and tried to help the killer in the original was replaced by an author who, honestly, had nothing to do with the plot until the final few minutes. Loomis's character really hit a nerve with me; the audience knows ""Halloween"" isn't renowned for its storytelling, but to take a fantastic character, remodel him into a flawed character, and try to tell a totally separate story that has nothing to do with the plot of the overall movie only to end with the same result...its just sloppy. Its insulting to anyone who has enjoyed the first two ""Halloween"" movies. It's like remaking StarWars with Luke Skywalker as the bad guy, only to have a big reveal at the end to show that he's really the good guy - YOU KNEW THAT ALREADY. But my favorite part was that the anonymous mother in the original series was replaced by Sheri Zombie. By the end of this movie, you'll wonder if the original remake and this sequel weren't exclusively written to bolster her career, and you may even wonder if you could get married and have your wife star in a once-great series. Imagine if Batman was remade, except Bruce's parents were never killed, and maybe four times during a movie they called in to say nothing but ""Hey, how are you? We love you"" before looking meaningfully into the camera. And even when they died and you were like, wow, it's about time, they'd still show up in sequels as ghosts and just sort of hang out. When Batman gets into the Batmobile you look off to the side and see them looking at him and nodding in approval. When he arrests a bad guy, you see them clapping. And maybe you love the series enough to say, ""Hey, isn't Batman (or Michael Myers) enough of a character to stand on his own?"" Not according to the Zombie family.",Halloween II

The part that I was most unsure about from the trailer was Debra in the visions in all white. What was refreshing was that it worked. It showed the driving force behind Michael and choosing to have the child Michael speak for adult Michael was clever. It shows just how much the rage manifested so young and grew into what it is today. Laurie, was a train wreck! Totally to be expected and if all that were to happen to me, id most likely be the same way. I enjoyed the direction her character took. It wasn't bookworm, it was more edgy. Sheriff Brackett, was one of the standouts. He did so well as his character and when he saw Annie in the bathroom, I had chills. It had emotion. We all loved Donald Pleasance as Loomis, so I was happy to see that they showed a very different version of Loomis in this take. It worked for Malcolm and the film. If i wanted to see the same Halloween i would have watched the Carpenters version. On all accounts I feel this was successful and a good time. Leave all expectations of a Carpenter Halloween at home....and experience the mind of RZ. Its twisted and I feel the best is yet to come from him.",Halloween II
416,zach88,This is not a horror film. This is pure Shock,2,1 November 2010,"There is nothing scary about this movie. Well maybe the acting and the script but to the point.This isn't a horror film. Nothing about this movie made me jump, kept me on the edge of my seat, had me clenching my fists or anything that happens when I watch a good horror movie.What Rob Zombie doesn't seem to get is that ""shock"" is not scary. It makes you cringe but that's about it. This movie is just predictable. There is no suspense before Myers kills some helpless victim. In the originals there would be an extremely tense build up before he would pop out of nowhere, and the eerie music would play. In these last two disasters of a movie, it's almost as if he'd casually walk through a doorway and just start stabbing people. And often excessively as seen in one scene, this was never the case in the original. Myers never went Hulk smash and stabbed anyone 50 times and he certainly was growling while doing so.There also wasn't an influx of swearing. Which just makes this film seem juvenile and appealing to the younger generation of kids. The type who find their dads playboy magazine and flip through it laughing hysterically. Rob Zombie is ruining these classic films by basically taking an Eli Roth/Hostel approach to it. All shock and no suspense. Gore is not scary and that's pretty much all this movie has going for it.",Halloween II

Like all of Zombie's films, there are no Beaver Cleavers (haha... cleaver) or Mr. Wilsons... They are just the type of people that you see every day and your average white collar worker wants to stay away from. The movie is meant to make you uncomfortable, and it does this fabulously. I honestly don't know what everyone is upset about, it's a movie! I appreciate RZ's effort to take a classic such as this and put his own demented, modern twist into it. Great movie, highly recommended, but if you want to see the Carpenter version, go to Blockbuster!",Halloween II
419,frankloiacono,Not Fkng great but not Fkng bad,8,3 September 2009,Not the greatest of fkng places/direction to take the film but hey what better direction could you have taken the film? Everything has been done. By now most ppl are pretty familiar with ghosts and their inclusion in the movie associated with MM is acceptable2me at least and why the F not? Some killers report some kind of other worldly perceptions so the ghost sub plot is OK by me.What I had to come around to was the LOUD grunting made by MM. When you realize your simply dealing with a monstrous serial killer It makes sense but this isn't just a serial killer its MM-the dude who cant die- so why over personalize him? If he grunts then let him stay dead now.... The F bombs in the movie were 100% right on imo.

I figured they wouldn't be clever, and would make money based on his name recognition meaning not much substance would have to go into making them. Well my friends, every movie is the way horror movies should be for my taste.A lot of negativity has surrounded Halloween 2 and people need to remember that this is 1. a horror movie and not a slasher, 2. it's not just a remake but Zombie's take on the Halloween story, and 3. watch Halloween before passing judgement on Halloween 2.This movie is horror at its finest and is a perfect transition from the first. It's not for the weak and for those that love horror and appreciate slasher.Anyway, I hope Rob Zombie makes many more movies as I find his style perfect.

421,rekabeduts,Ultimate Horror Movie?,8,20 January 2010,"I've never felt the need to write a review for a movie, although I read lots of reviews myself and generally trust the public opinion, but after watching this film and reading others reviews about it, I am appalled by how bad people have bashed this film. I think that this is possibly the ultimate horror movie, it had all the components of what a real horror film should be. Who cares if Zombie took some creative liberties, I thought they were much needed and for the most part well done. Some say that the characters weren't likable, so...they're probably going to die anyway, I personally like what Zombie did with the characters, they are more real, more believable.Yes it veered from the story line of the original, but that's what a re-make should be, who wants to watch the same exact movie that is just slightly different, why make it again in that case? And any of you that think the original eighties, one-dimensional, cookie cutter, piece of garbage ""horror"" movie was a classic or even remotely good, should break out your stone washed jeans, members only jacket, flock of seagulls cassette and snort another rail, because you must be high.Do not be fooled, if you don't like Rob Zombie movies, or true horror movies for that matter, don't bother watching this one. But if you do have a true appreciation for a real gory blood-bath of a horror movie with a limited, although much more well done than the original, story line check this one out, it's a bloody good time.",Halloween II
422,BigBTheOneNOnly,I really enjoyed most of the movie...until the end,4,28 August 2009,"Okay first of all this movie seems to rip off Halloween 5 very much. The whole concept that Michael Myers and his relatives are linked together psychologically has been done before. I could buy into the white horse and ghost because I just chalked it up as Michael Myers is messed up in the head and wants his family to be together in heaven. I could also buy into the aftermath of the characters, with Laurie being messed up and having nightmares. My roommate thought that Scout over acted and at times she did, but most of the time the loud screaming and constant crying from her was appropriate.I thought that Zombie focused too much on Michael in this one. A lot of the scenes could have been left out, such as the strip club scene and the scene where he is found wandering in the film by two hicks. It did nothing to help the evolution of the storyline and was merely there to show that Michael Myers is a cold blooded killer, which is already well establishedDanielle Harris did a fantastic job dieing, and I enjoyed the back and forth of Annie getting ravaged by Michael and Laurie discovering the scene. However, I thought that they overplayed her death a little bit by putting in the slow motion of Brackets reaction to her death.However, on that note. Why didn't Rob explain that Annie is afraid to leave the house? I think he could have had Sheriff Bracket make an off-put remark about her situation.The ending was completely ridiculous when they got to the part where Laurie could see her mothers face and have the same images as her brother. And the part where she said she loved her brother before she killed him was dumb. I can understand they wanted to turn her character evil but there are more tasteful and subtle ways to do it then how they played it out. I thought Rob should have left more to the imagination when it came to Laurie's turn in personality. If I were to do it differently, I wouldn't have had Laurie see the images of her dead mother who she has never met and just had her kill Bracket or even better have Loomis wind up treating Laurie in therapy and then having him find her standing over a dead corpse with a knife in her hand.I believe that Rob made a big mistake by not building up the characters a little more. Granted the ones worth building up are from the previous movie and so he may not have felt a need to give them more depth, but he made a mistake by assuming that everyone in the audience saw the previous movie.The one thing I did enjoy was the directing shots. There was some cool camera angles and new techniques for Zombie in terms of getting the angle and telling the story.Also I don't understand the point of Loomis being around other than to help reveal that Laurie is actually Myers' sister.Finally what was up with the grunting by Michael? Not that I mind it but why put it in this movie and not in the last one?

I knew Rob Zombie would ruin Halloween I, which he did. I wasn't even going to watch Halloween II by Zombie, but had a chance, to watch free on demand, I barely made it half way through the film. I literally fast forwarded it the last 55 minutes just to watch, at high speed, what happened in the movie.Not only is it a terrible movie, but Zombie makes the likable characters from the original Halloween series, unlikable!

Michael Myers, supposedly one of Rob Zombie's favorite horror movie icons is displayed here in Halloween 2. The only problem? Zombie decided that it was time to ruin a horror movie legend.The problem from the get go is that the main character, Laurie Strode, a horror movie icon made famous by the talented Jamie Lee Curtis is played here as a grungy girl who doesn't care. Laurie in the original series was a strong female character and in Rob Zombie's movie she has been reduced to two modes: 1)Screaming Laurie and 2) Crying Laurie. The only likable characters in the movie is Annie and her father.The story is ridiculous. The constant presence of Michael Myers mother is annoying and too much reminiscent of Friday the 13th. The plot drags on and the theater I was in was reduced to laughing every time that Mrs. Myers showed up on screen.Do yourself a favor and rent originals. They are much better.

They are gory but in a way that you can barely see what is going on, I mean Annie's death was a complete cop out surely the best actress in out of all the Halloween films should get a pretty decent death! 2. The film feels like an add on to the first one and doesn't feel like a proper sequel if the 2 had been gelled together to make one big long film I think it would be better. But thats just me.

I thought Rob Zombies Halloween was excellent and while the 2nd one isn't quite as good, if you like his previous films, you'll enjoy this. The bad reviews that I read gave the impression that Sherri Zombie dominates this film when in reality she is only in it for about 12 mins all together and she isn't great but she isn't that bad either!. Some of the shots are haunting and simply stunning, and while the script isn't the best, he truly is a gifted director. I for one can't wait to see more of his work and as a Halloween series fan I think he has done us proud.The only thing i think let the film down was not having the same boy who played young Michael in the first film, the new kid just didn't have the same screen presence or the eerieness about him.",Halloween II
427,fur_fighter,Inside the mind of Michael Myers.,10,27 April 2010,"A very well executed horror film from the visionary director Rob Zombie.Warning: It contains fairly strong sadistic violence and anti- characters, recommended for exploitation and extreme film goers, otherwise you might want to steer clear.Halloween II starts straight from where the 2007 remake left off, it weaves a thoroughly brutal web of violence from the perspective of Michael Myers, his sister, Angel Myers and Dr. Samual Loomis.For the first time we see from the perspective of Michael Myers, we see the strange hallucinations and visions brought on by his mental illness. It is all handled by Zombie in a very realistic clinical manner which makes it all the more disturbing. The dirty and rotted away Micheal is played again by the spookily convincing Tyler Mane. Unfortunately some of the cast was changed from the first remake, like young Micheal and his sister. A lot of the cast returned and were very good, like Danielle Harris, Brad Dourif and the always brilliant Malcom McDowell.It has a very dark grindhouse look and feel to it, similar to the also very good Texsas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Realistic, ultra-violent and surreal makes Rob Zombies Halloween II a cult classic that will be remembered as a great time in horror history.Fantastic job again Rob and Crew, I would give anything to see Rob Zombies Halloween III and I am greatly looking forward to whatever you do next.10/10 (Wow!)",Halloween II

In the original, Myers grew up in a white collar area, his parents came home that night in nice clothing. Even in the Halloween remake 2007 Lorie grew up in the same kind of town, middle class, nice area, so why suddenly in this movie does she live in the most white trash area suddenly? why is Zombies wife in this movie, it was a joke every time she popped in...holding a leash to a horse. SHE HAS THE WORST ACTING ROLE IN ANY LARGE BUDGET MOVIE EVER!!!! and that also goes for the "" child michael myers"" who doesn't look anything like the original child michael. THERE IS NOT A SECOND IN THE MOVIE WHITH THE HALLOWEEN THEME MUSIC OR ANY OF THE MUSIC THAT MADE THE HALLOWEEN MOVIES GREAT......till the credits...wow. Zombie said the music wasn't added because he inserted it into the movie to see how it sounded and it didn't go with any scene...maybe because it really isn't a Halloween movie.

I got bored in between the movie and really wanted it to end quickly.The only positive thing I could comment on about the movie is that I liked the ending nevertheless I can't imagine how someone (since Zombie has declined to direct another Halloween movie as of this date) would resume the story with continuity from the given climax. Maybe who knows there would be another reboot in next decade(s).",Halloween II
431,FireJewel70,2 Stars for Halloween 2!!,2,8 August 2010,"This one is nothing like the original, cant even compare, in any way. The Halloween from 2007, was not even as bad as this one. I mean come on! In the theaters, watching this awful movie, I honestly felt as if someone was screaming at me, the loudest they could, for 2 hours straight, and myself having those negative feelings the whole time! Its the same thing. There was nothing to this garbage. If you like horror films that are all about the gore and guts, and not really about a story or plot, then you will fall in love with Halloween 2. It has plenty of the gross disgusting scenes. Too much of it. Now, I know that a lot of horror fans, go to the movies to see that, when there is a thriller involved, but this one goes to an extreme!! It seems to me Halloween 2, is all about the actors being knifed, in every way possible. Rob Zombie must have been feeling down or depressed when he was thinking about this garbage. I can only imagine what the next Halloween will be like, It cant get much worse, or can it? Seems to me, every Halloween movie they make now a days, gets more and more dramatic, intense, and brutal. But, in a wrong way. There doesn't seem to be any common logic or smartness to these movies. Especially the ones with Zombie in charge! I am glad to hear that Zombie wont be returning for the next 3D picture. If he were to direct the next, I can only imagine how much worse it would turn out. Zombie made the first one back in 2007, a nightmare, and this one, Halloween 2, a complete failure! Hopefully the next writer/director of the Halloween series, will be more intelligent, someone who can actually come up with a worthy script. The first Halloween, was a classic, and always will be. So why embarrass the Halloween name, with this nonsense??? Anyone who gives this Halloween more than two stars, has gone bonkers in the head. There really is nothing to this movie, its not just my opinion, but as you can see, throughout the film, its all about the gore, and less about a story, that goes somewhere. I gave this one, two stars rather than one, because the acting was amazing, I must admit. However, they usually are in modern day horror films. All in all, don't throw your money away, even if its 10 bucks, just don't! Do not believe those who give this Halloween a perfect rating, 10 stars. Just don't! Sorry to say this, but this movie really was/is 100 percent pure trash! Thats my review. Hope it helped in some way.",Halloween II
432,master_blaster-7,Very very disappointing,4,19 October 2009,"I am one of the biggest fans of the Halloween series there is. I've seen the whole series at least 2-3 times from start to finish. I didn't liked as much the new reinvented Halloween 1, but i digested it, since i liked the fact that Rob tried to make the whole action have some logic behind it.So i went with my girlfriend, both horror freaks, with high expectations, and for the first 30 minutes i loved it. Than we see the last 20 minutes were just a dream. I said OK, but what a hell, they can make the whole film end like it was just a dream in this style. The part with the dreaming would be OK if it wasn't used so much.I liked that we were shown a realistically Michael Meyers, a money/fame driven Dr. Loomis and bearded MM. BUT...If i ask anyone on the street about the old series they would immediately recall the HALLOWEEN THEME. How can you make a Halloween movie without that awesome theme and save it for the....credits. How can you make a Halloween theme without Michael walking chasing his victims, sitting in the fog with his knife in his hand, looking cold as ice and not standing still.And the most important, how can you make a Halloween movie and kill, what seems with no coming back, the main reason people liked the series, Michael Meyers. I don't care for his sister, she can't take his place. They will make one movie with her, everyone will see what an epic fail it will be, and than in the forth H, they will somehow make Michael Meyers come back, realizing what a huge mistake killing him was. It looks like Rob Zombie left the movie to end in a horror way because he knew he is not responsible for H3, so wtf, i can do anything because i don't have to clean this mess up.Very, very, very disappointing. There is no cool element that made the original so hot left in this ""new vision"". The new vision is to make it up side down and it blows.",Halloween II
433,andrew-towers,ummm well what can I say,3,12 June 2012,First of all I love Rob Zombie and I love Halloween movies so I'm not sure what happened here. The first Halloween remake was good for the first half but lost me when it went onto the actuall remake part and sadly its the same with part two. I enjoyed the first fifteen minutes or so set in the hospital but then it was all downhill. Laurie was such a sooky bitch in this that I spent the whole movie hoping she would get killed. Brad Dourif is always good and manages to save this mess a litttle bit. Now the plot Michael returns pushed on by two ghosts one his mother and the other a child version of himself(WTF)to finish the job he started in part one and thats about it. One of the reasons I really didn't like this was because Rob unmasked Michael and he went that way most of the movie(big no no Mr Zombie) and the Loomis Character just seemed pointless as he spent most of the movie plugging his book. I realize the old school Halloween sadly died when Donald Pleasence did but is this what we will be left with?,Halloween II
434,SweetNSpunky,"Creative, Fresh, Scary, and Haunting",6,29 August 2010,"While I wasn't a fan of Rob Zombie's re-imagining of the original 1978 classic, the second part anyway which I felt relied a little bit to much on the original, I was pleasantly surprised after leaving the theater for this one. The film stars Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode who two years after the events of the original film is haunted by Michael in her dreams and feels as though she is slipping into insanity. She regularly sees a psychiatrist, Which is a brilliantly done cameo by Margot Kidder who features in quite possibly THE greatest Slasher film of all time, Black Christmas '74, and is now living with her best friend Annie Brackett, and Sheriff Lee Brackett. The film works as an excellent character study. We see how all the survivors from the first are dealing with the trauma.Laurie has become a party girl, Annie a hermit, and Dr. Loomis takes to dealing with his problems by writing a book about the murders and becoming somewhat of a pompous snob. While they try to put their lives back together, Michael returns to Haddonfield to reek havoc lead by his mother who wants Michael to ""bring us together again."" Us being The Myers Family. Laurie reads Dr. Loomis' book and discovers she is Michael Myers' sister, Angel Myers, (Big surprise :P.) While I wasn't to fond of ""Halloween II's"" overly gory nature, I enjoy how it worked as a psychological horror and a character study and I'd recommend the Director's Cut for a perfect viewing experience. The T-Cut doesn't have nearly as much detail put into it. This is becoming a trend for Rob Zombie, to write a so-so original film and deliver an excellent film for it's predecessor.",Halloween II

But this one I thought was great. I was pleasantly surprised. It was Very gory and psychotic. None of the original Halloween movies have ever scared me but there were a few parts that made me jump in this remake. I wasn't even really wanting to see this flick but my brother talked me into going with him because he is obsessed with them. Im glad I did go, definitely worth seeing. I don't care what anyone else says, Rob did a great job. This movie was a successs. P.s. The first killing in my opinion was the sickest.",Halloween II
436,creepinthecellar,"Might Not Be Perfect, But Way Better than the Remake, Series Best Sequel In Years... Thank You Mr. Zombie.",7,27 August 2009,"For a person who took a strong disliking to Rob Zombie's Halloween remake, I must say the follow-up, HALLOWEEN II was a breath of fresh air for an avid fan of the Halloween series. It might not be a return to the ""Gone of the Wind"" of horror movies, but an overall improvement in story, suspense, as well as a pacing that clearly shows Zombie was not in clutches and struggle of trying to rehash John Carpenter's original film while trying to put a spin on it. There were story elements to pick a bone with and the constraints of the 2007 film are obvious. Luckily, Zombie has his white-trash-reality pieces to a minimum in this movie. Though there are accidental homages to the Rick Rosenthal's Halloween II, don't be mistaken. This entry is very different and something completely of Rob Zombie's sole vision. THIS IS NOT A REMAKE, THIS IS A PURE SEQUEL.The direction was much more focal and clear and Zombie actually delivers some scares, which the first round lacked very much. I also liked the element of Michael Myers having a serious sense of overkill on his victims. And it was also enlightening to see emotional points as well as examinations of the crazed mind, as Michael sees apparitions of his mother as well as him as a child, and as Laurie learns more about herself, begins to have visions and dreams of her own, leading us to question her mental state as events unfold. The characters were way better and the rhythm of the film was refreshing.Not that it didn't have its moments with necessity to nitpick a bit. Though the ""death rides a pale horse"" theme of the movie was an awesome story element, it also seemed at times corny as hell. People who aren't big fans of Sheri Moon being in his movies might find it somewhat hard to stomach, but overall the concept had legs. The ""ogre"" hobo look made Michael Myers seem less threatening at times, but there's also some cool shots as he wanders on his journey. My biggest stake with this film is how much the Dr. Loomis character has strayed into a complete slimeball, instead of the crazed doctor out to get Michael. That left a disheartening taste in my mouth. The score lacked the Halloween themes until the ending, but thankfully what was there throughout wasn't a pretentious modern horror score, playing as more of an ambiance than a shrieking powerful score, which intensified the film a bit to my surprise.Where all the movies have entertained to a small or large extent, the Halloween series in general has had its extreme highs and unbearable lows. And though there are story elements in this movie that some might dislike (including the ""un-reality"" sequences), it sure beats Michael's Curse of Thorn or the Man in Black from Halloween 5 & 6, where the filmmakers strayed away from continuity. Only to get busy in series reboots like H20 and Resurrection (the latter being the worst of all the sequels and the first being a weak recharge). What I recommend for next time is a straight ahead sequel to tie up all the loose ends left by sequels that failed to take things in different directions, seeing as tho this is Rob's last venture into Halloweenland. But as his closing film in the Halloween saga, this movie was a serious improvement and I give kudos to this as opposed to a remake that half loved and half could barely fathom.7/10",Halloween II
437,themonolithisi,Horror movies can't possibly be good in my book,8,8 September 2009,"This movie had a bad case of shaky-cam, where the camera is shaken and this is supposed to induce terror. I found it cliché The few scenes where murders were done with a steady camera hand were very cool. The imagery with the lights behind fog and the camera a good distance away, so the viewer is almost really seeing it taking place, this was engaging.The movie still had goofy ""I don't think that person needs to be stabbed that many times to die"" moments, which were interesting I'm also sick of the women having the same hair styles in all of Rob's movies.I'm giving this movie a 8 instead of a 5 because I loved seeing my girlfriend scared to death",Halloween II
438,tarheel09,Complete and utter Garbage,1,29 August 2009,"How this movie was even allowed to be made is beyond me. I wasn't a fan of Rob zombies first remake but this just took it to a whole other level of trash. First of all this is NOT Halloween. If you are a fan of the franchise you will be severely disappointed with this movie. White trash beyond belief, constant use of the F word for no particular reason, horrible dialogue, and pointless killing all factor into my 1 star. Also this is NOT Michael Myers. This is a 7ft. tall lumbering giant who has a beard down to his nipples wearing a hoodie. All he needs is a trident and he would look like the God of Thunder Zeus. I can't blame any of the actors for the poor acting considering the script they were given. Annie gave the best performance IMO. If Rob Zombie wanted to make a movie like this he should have done so by not using the Hallowen title because this is the furthest thing from it. Rob should have known better to have so much in you face gore in a Halloween Movie, Thats not what Halloween is about. Save that for Jason. The whole Kill for mommy plot kind of sounds like someone we know... Jason Voorhees. For Zombie to say all of the other Halloweens after part 2 were horrible is comical considering what he just made. I'd rather watch 4-6 and H20 any day over this mess. I could go on all day about how bad this was but in closing I will say- If you are a fan of the franchise or just a casual horror fan DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE, DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, DO NOT EVEN WATCH IT FOR FREE. When the credits role you will only want your 2 hours and money back. I'd also like to thank Rob Zombie for doing his best job to ruin the O.G. Michael myers...thanks Rob.",Halloween II
439,abaccus,Halloween 2,3,29 August 2009,"I had low expectations going into the theater since this is a slasher flick and even those low expectations were not met. This does not stay true to John Carpenter's Halloween II from 1981 (most of which takes place in a hospital) which surprised me since Rob Zombie's Halloween stayed pretty true to John Carpenter's original. The killing scenes get quite repetitive and often have no connection to anything. Michael roams Haddonfield quickly, without direction or reason, but he's an unsophisticated, invincible, psychopathic killing machine with the mind of a six year old so why wouldn't he? Unlike John Carpenter's 1981 sequel, this sequel takes place a year after Michael's first rampage, whereas the 1981 film takes place the same night as the original, which was the only reason I was almost able to tolerate it. However, there is some decent cinematography, a dark, eerie look to the film and its antagonist, and some of the acting isn't half bad for the type of movie it is. The film attempts to focus more on Michael and his psychopathy, giving him some traits of a paranoid schizophrenic (due to his hallucinations and delusions) but doesn't go anywhere with it, eventually becoming somewhat annoying(as do the dream sequences). It is ignorant of me to expect much out of a slasher flick so if you like mindless killing, blood, gore and no plot or characterization, you'll most likely take a liking to this predictable, run-of-the-mill slasher.",Halloween II

I really enjoyed Halloween, House of 100 corpses and The Devil's Rejects and was looking forward to more of the same. This movie was a disaster, I actually contemplated leaving halfway through because I was so bored. There were a few entertaining ""kills"", but mostly it was a big suckfest. Malcolm McDowell, who is an awesome actor, was brought under in this fiasco by the horrible script. The lead female character isn't much of an actor and just came off as whiny and weak, I was waiting for her to get the ax. The supporting cast was just as annoying. Also, the whole movie was way too dark. I could hardly see what was going on. Just horrible. I can't believe Zombie, who I always thought was a true horror fan, would put his name on this and be proud of it's release. Rob, you jumped the shark, oh, and I hate to say it, but your wife can't act.",Halloween II
441,nathancarson-1,Re:Worst sequel/remake ever,6,5 September 2009,"Whatever man.I thought it said a lot without saying anything, which I appreciate a whole hell of a lot more than when they started doing that druid sh-t in the later series.That's not even the worse Halloween sequel/remake. H20 and Resurrection are pretty freaking AWFUL. Yet I own them. Cause Halloween 1 & 2 are my favorite slasher horror of all time.That Michael bay abortion of Friday the 13th was WAY worse than this, which I actually enjoyed.They changed Dr. Loomis entirely in this. Cause no one's ever gonna be Donald Pleasance, baby. Michael McDowell is a fantastic actor but he even got on my nerves in the first one, as good a job as he did. Cause he's not Donald Pleasance. So they made him into more of an as-hole. It worked well. I was glad to see him die. Plus his death set Mikey free. It was very symbolic if y'all didn't catch that.I was also glad it was only 90 minutes. Damn sitting in the theater for 3 hours. I'm sick of it. I was entertained. By the time I was ready to go, the movie was wrapping up.OK, um, all that transition mixing/whatever where he tried to use ""nights in white satin"" did NOT work. Maybe, as a musician, he(RZ) should have chosen a song HE knows, rather than try to re-work what's been done.Also, where did party come from? I always thought the point was Haddonfield, IL is a small town. All of a sudden there's this kick as- party?? With like strippers and all kinda good drugs and stuff?? I know it was Halloween and all... but still. Plus alright, the main character was a little inconsistent. However, she was also crazy. I'm crazy, I tend to be a little inconsistent.

Loomis a complete jerk in there original Halloween he was a nice guy. I don't think they had to make the remake completely the same as the original but they didn't have to change the story so much. actually better yet they shouldn't have made it to begin with. what were they thinking? hopefully they don't remake all of the Halloween movies.",Halloween II
443,bondjamesbond,Loved it,8,30 August 2009,"Halloween 2 was never an enjoyable experience for me. I never had a good time watching it, but I still loved it. This film may be the most brutal and bloodiest I've seen. Rob Zombie set a stark tone to Halloween 2 that was executed perfectly. Michael Myers is a psychopath with visions of his dead mother guiding him towards his sister. When he kills her, the family will be complete. Michael of course kills anyone else that happens to get in the way, and his rage has worsened since Zombie's first Halloween. The way he kills his victims is mostly simple, no elaborate traps or any of that crap to contend with. Using mostly his trusty butcher knife, Rob Zombie's Michael takes people out in some of the most vicious and violent kills ever put on film. There is a lot going on underneath the surface here, as we see a remarkable Scout Taylor Compton become completely unhinged as her nightmares begin to take over her life. The mental health problems that run in her family are taking effect in her, and it's a sad thing to witness Laurie, once a sweet and innocent girl, unravel into madness. Halloween 2 is a depressing, haunting, troubling and ultimately sad film. The feeling of emptiness that I was left with is hard to describe. It's hard to watch what happens to these characters that you care about because you know there won't be any kind of happy ending for anyone here. Rob Zombie has taken a lot of crap for his vision of Halloween. I absolutely appreciate what he has accomplished with his two films, and especially with part 2. The original Halloween storyline, as convoluted as it became, will always be there. I'm thankful that Zombie stepped in and showed us his vision, but I think some people would rather watch Michael Myers get in a brawl with Busta Rhymes. Halloween 2 is not an easy film to watch, but I highly recommend it for the surreal, haunting images and storyline that I think, unfortunately, not enough horror fans are appreciating.",Halloween II
444,JaegerMeister85,Garbage!!,2,20 January 2010,"I have had respect for Rob Zombie before, I actually think The Devil's Rejects is a well thought out, well acted horror movie but my respect ends with that movie. The original Halloween is one of my top 5 all time horror movies and Rob Zombie has destroyed this franchise. First off, Sheri Moon Zombie does not need to be in EVERY ONE OF YOUR MOVIES. She isn't a good actress and her role as Deborah Myers clearly shows this in both movies. Second, why is Michael Myers portrayed as an old homeless man in this movie. He basically just looks like someone looking for a place to live or his next meal to eat, he isn't at all scary. Third why does Myers have superhuman strength, I mean he flips over a CAR! A CAR! What does that have to do with being a masked psychopath. It is unnecessary and over the top. All in all this movie is just disappointing. I expected more since this was his own movie and not the copy of the original Halloween but in the end it is just garbage.",Halloween II

DO NOT RENT, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SEE IRON MAN 2. the acting was horrible, the idea of the original characters was nice. these characters well lets just say i was glad they all just... i've noticed that Zombie movies deal with a s____t load of trailer trash, but come on you moved them from a trailer to a house, but still trailer trash.

447,willburcham,Small Beam of Potential Quickly Covered Up,4,2 July 2011,"There is a lot of promise for a modern-day Halloween remake, Rob Zombie just isn't the right director.Most people don't want to see blurred flashes of a horse and Rob Zombie's wife throughout what is supposed to be a slow suspense-building thriller; Zombie tries to turn this into a action/sci-fi film.The problems start at the very beginning when Zombie gives away WAY too much of Myer's character. In the original films, Myers was dubbed ""The Shadow"", and that was because you weren't supposed to know him. He was just there, and he was following you wherever you went.The kills are too frequent and too gruesome, all cliché of today's ""horror"" films. Myers runs around like he doesn't care who sees him, spilling his buckets of blood in the process.The only thing I liked about this film were Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode, her two close girlfriends were also well-cast, and Sheriff Brackett, who I think gave the only truly fantastic performance in Zombie's two Halloween films.Overall, this is a disappointment. There was potential, especially with a few of the cast, but it was quickly bloodied, made vulgar and modernized.4/10",Halloween II
448,sabresaw,What year is it anyways?,8,2 September 2009,"So out of all my major gripes about this film, is the inherent shift between times. Is this a 70s, 80s, 90s, or 00 flick? Sure when you're in Haddonfield its the death to any decade with a vast number of 80s and 90s references. In the outside world there's flat TVs and fancy cell phones. I think Zombie wants us to feel ageless so that anybody can relate, but it just seems to corrupt the story a little bit.Now on to my main thoughts. I think with less shaky cam we would have possibly the best Halloween film since the original part 2. His use of dreams kept the film going down the road of insanity. Frankly I'm glad we didn't have to watch the bubble gum princess Laurie for 2 hours like last time.In my opinion Zombie brought Myers back to his roots as the shadowy figure like in the original part 1. No more of this obvious giant walking around in the open and looking like a overgrown child. Just shadowy jumps out of nowhere ending in bloodshed.Speaking of bloodshed, there is no holding back either. Every kill is nice and bloody like a true slasher film should be.",Halloween II
449,sethdil,Hold your nose when watching this stinker,2,10 December 2009,"The film is so bad that I can't even be sure it is a serious attempt at a remake or someones basement script written when jacked up on weed.Rob Zombie has taken Michael Myers who was created by John Carpenter as this living evil, a thing of nightmares, and reshaped him into a common place nutcase. There is no real terror behind Michael in this film in fact, the only terror comes from watching a film that has taken ""the shape"" (as he has been referred to) and made him into a carbon copy serial killer. This is why a classic should never be remade, it is a true disappointment and rates right there with Halloween 3: season of the witch.The film is a total avoid, but if your feeling up to watching(fast forwarding) through this film I would recommend it as a rental and NOT a purchase.",Halloween II

Zombie didn't do a horrible job like everyone claims here, the movie contains loads of atmosphere, interesting camera shots and use of color, and a creative twist to the Halloween series(the dream sequences are very David lynch) Worst film of the series? I think not, obviously no one's taking Halloween:Resurrection into account. There are negatives to this film, mainly Scout-Taylor Compton playing a psycho clichéd crust punk with a pension for dropping the F bomb when times are required for her to convey angst and emotion. I'm really not sure if it's her lackluster acting ability, or just bad script writing but its really hard not to hate the character. Michael Myers on the other hand plows through people like a locomotive, kudos to Zombie for making the character uncompromising and brutal, something severely lacking in most of the other more recent films. It's also great to see Brad Dourif in a role that's just more than a cameo as well, the man is sorely underused and is a great actor.

451,mrjman1234,"People who hate on this movie, kindly remove the stick from your ass and go back to 1980",10,29 January 2015,"Before I begin, let me say that I am a huge fan of the original Halloween films. I fell in love with the original masterpiece and (most of) it's sequels before seeing the remake and it's sequel. I seriously cannot understand or justify the amount of scathing hatred towards Rob Zombie's Halloween or H2. Sure, they were different, especially this one. Say what you like about RZ, but his originality and insight is admirable. He did what every other director was afraid to do: he re-invented the franchise in a completely original and effective way. The dream sequences, the character development, the gore, all chilling pieces to create a true masterpiece of film. I'm not sure why everyone has such a huge issue with changes being made to the films. Again, I am a huge fan of the original movies. But in the words of Rob Zombie himself: ""Why remake something if you don't plan on changing anything?"" So to all you traditionalists, up on your high horse, calling yourself a ""real fan"" of the franchise because you want all the movies to stick to the same template: ""Angel says F**K YOU"" (see what I did there?? :P) Nobody is forcing you to watch these movies. If you don't like them, fine. Stick to watching the original movies (I'll be happy enjoying both). But don't crap all over somebody else's work just because you don't like it. Personally, I can't wait for the 3rd movie. I'll finish by quoting my own summary: ""People who hate on this movie, kindly remove the stick from your ass and go back to 1980""Thank you, goodnight :)",Halloween II

I thought the change in Laurie's character was pretty interesting and Scout Taylor Compton really nails it, especially with her performances in the therapy sessions. The dream sequences are INTENSE and memorable, the movie features some of the best soundtrack work from my personal favorite composer Tyler Bates, it holds the place for the only movie to make me cry (Annie's death scene) and Rob Zombie's cinematography is not bad at all. However the cussing did seem a little excessive, and there are some unnecessary death scenes that didn't really need to happen, and Dr. Loomis being a media sell out is a little cheesy. And how did Haddonfield go from an nice average town to Hickville USA? All that aside, this is one of my favorite Halloween movies and it doesn't deserve ratings THIS low.",Halloween II

I was a fan of Zombie's remake of the original, my only criticism of that film was that it took too long setting up the back story. I know many people who felt this way. But with the addition of the new movie Zombie has gone above and beyond.The new movie jumps right into the action and never lets you go even at the very end you are enthralled.

This Halloween sequel absolutely had various different plot holes and made me as a viewer completely lost on the direction he was going with the story. The ending with Myers talking was absolutely horrible. To me Myers should remain unknown and have no real explanation on why he does what he does, only speculation.

(Standalone follow-up?) Rob Zombie has taken Michael Myers and made him his own creature. Gave him his own look, a new toy and a method to his madness. Do not expect this film to fit the mold of any of the previous Halloween films. I personally did not care for the 2007 version, but it grew on me. I love it now! I had to train my mind to accept that this is not 1978. Society is not as 'simple' as it may have been back then. With that in mind, Zombie has taken his 'stab' at making some sense out of a story that we have all come to accept and love without any real explanation. We now peek at what is inside Michael's head, and Lori's for that matter. In a sense, Lori's experience in this one was similar to Jamie's in part 4. I did enjoy the mask donning callback scene to that movie. It seemed to make part 4's scene make more sense. Few points that I did not care for: New Young Michael was just okay. Nothing creepy about him really. Just seems to be a kid actor in a clown outfit. Another, Loomis becoming a real d*ck. If not for his book and the info revealed therein, I found him to be unnecessary in this movie. Also, I know Michael is fast, but he just happened to 'teleport' a bit more in this movie. In one location with a victim in one scene, then behind a door (or similar) with another victim in the next. My main gripe with this movie was that Zombie went a bit Michael Bay at times during some of the action/death scenes. I really hate not being able to see what I'm looking at. And some of the nightmares didn't seem to mesh well with the movie as a whole. Other than that, the suspense was good. The brutality was indeed that. I, unlike many others here, liked the back-story. Michael in not only a psychopathic maniac, he's also a tormented soul with a human desire for love. I know that sounds nuts, but his ultimate goal is to be a normal little boy again with mommy and sis. Many negative reviews from what I assume to be hard core 'Halloween' fans. Masked figure walks through a town undetected and kills people for 7, 8, 9 movies. Going in I knew Zombie was making this from a different angle and direction. I saw this as a fan of horror, Rob Zombie and Michael Myers, not so much of the Halloween franchise. Anyway, don't expect this to be anything that you're familiar with. Go with the flow and you just might enjoy this flick. I sure as hell did!",Halloween II
456,Jams25,It had potential...,5,6 July 2015,"It's a shame this movie gets a lot of slack because I honestly don't think it's near as terrible as people say. That's not to say it's without faults either because it has plenty of them. I liked the fact they dealt with the aftermath of the first film (which I think is far worse than this) events and Laurie having Ptsd and all of the survivors' trauma.However I never liked Scout Taylor Compton's portrayal of Laurie at all. I found her irritating and her voice is extremely screechy. Although I think she did a much better performance for Laurie in this movie and the acting was very good all round. The characters, yet again, are unlikeable and I don't know why Rob Zombie always has unlikeable characters. It's cheap and you just don't care when they die, so it loses something. Another problem was the dialogue. Oh, the dialogue. This was another big problem with the first film. I'm sorry but people don't talk like this! Or at least I've never heard anyone talk the way they do, with at least three swear words in every sentence. It's too Ott and the dialogue itself is cheesy.I thought the story was OK, nothing special but still pretty good and I liked the characters relationships together, especially Annie/Laurie, Annie/Lee, Samuel/Michael and Laurie/Michael. They were handled well. Another thing I would recommend if you haven't seen the film, or even if you have, is to watch the extended uncut version. Imo it is far superior to the theatrical with scenes that make the plot actually make a lot more sense and add a more emotional aspect which is why it was really stupid to cut so many of them.",Halloween II
457,gelboy4,A Beautiful Frustration,6,14 January 2010,"Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN 2 Bluray / DVD REVIEW: A Beautiful FrustrationThis review contains SPOILERS.The film is stronger and more accomplished than reviews suggest. Rob Zombie is an artist, and Rob Zombie made an art film. He crafted one of the more striking looking genre pieces of the decade, sprinkling in compelling visual nods to Ridley Scott, Dario Argento, and Kubrick into a mix clearly his own. What he did not do is make a commercial, by the numbers, slasher affair because he's obviously bored with that. And any time the film dovetails back into this formula, I got bored too. Here's Michael chasing someone up the steps. Here's characters solely introduced to die. Here's Michael breaking through a door. I've seen it. I get it. I'm bored too.The truly frustrating thing about H2 is that Zombie is clearly a bright man, yet there are still giant miscues even within his own architecture. The biggest case in point, is there's absolutely no reason for Sam Loomis to be in the film. You could remove him completely and lose nothing. If a script is well crafted, you should not be able to remove a major character, and Loomis only underscores the need for a likable lead. The Loomis archetype is Ahab chasing the white whale. And if you're going to alter that, it still needs to matter beyond just doing something different. In this work, Ahab only decides to pursue the whale in the last 10 minutes and is metaphorically eaten. One, maybe two early scenes could have established where Loomis is mentally with his book tour, but instead it becomes 97% of his screen time. Loomis lost nothing but his pride, and since he's now such an arrogant, unlikable man, I didn't care. The film needs someone you DO care for, and while Chief Brackett comes closest to fitting this bill, he is additionally underscored and robbed of any real closure with his character arc. With tighter crafting even within the existing authorship, the baton could have been passed from Loomis to Brackett as the keeper of the flame, and ""chaser of the whale."" Brackett somewhat blames Loomis for what unfolds, and I would have liked to have seen Loomis fall at the hands of his revenge driven blood lust, via a cathartic ending with a resolute Brackett tracking Myers down through the wet streets of Haddonfield to avenge the loss of his daughter. The pieces and potential existed existed for the ending to be so much more emotional. The film was arguably Brackett's story as the protagonist, since the audience can in no way relate to Laurie beyond her being the screaming mentally ill girl because that's how she's presented. The ending would also have benefited from a larger set piece, perhaps that great barn setting where the Phantom Jam was, or, bringing the Brackett point home again, literally, at his place of residence. Or honor the fundamental premise of the series, that evil intrudes where we feel safe, and have the finale crash in on a completely innocent family and their home, and heighten the peril by having other lives in jeopardy while still accomplishing the same narrative beats.I don't even mind the white horse, although feel there were missed opportunities here as well. The story is established as being in the country with farms and open fields. What if, mid-chase, Michael sees horses who have broken out, one of them white. How would he react? Michael is clearly crazy, and the resulting confusion could have allowed a creative way for the heroine to slip him for a beat. That would be more organic to what was already set up than some of what happens instead. Also, there are a lot of nagging questions which all evidence points to Rob being bright enough to answer. For example, why does this notorious serial killer show up at a raging party only to randomly pick off one couple in the back of a van and then move along? Was he trying to isolate Laurie? If so, when is it established he knew this was Laurie's friend? The scene was a completely random piece of predictable horror carnage. If you want to do something different, please do. But ""something different"" should still operate with a degree of internal logic.I enjoyed the visual of the Deborah Myers ghost, but she should have remained a spectral phantom, haunting the corners of a mind. Her eyes communicate what we don't necessarily need to be told. Also, recasting Daeg was a mistake. He simply pulled off the oscillating menace in a way the replacement never nears. If we can accept a shot-in-the-head Michael functioning, we can accept that Daeg is now taller. It sounds like I'm finding much fault, but in reality it's only mild frustration because what surrounds is so well done. Impressive shots elevate, only to have the story anchor things back down to earth. It seems Rob likes to create on the fly, and I would argue he should edit while in script mode instead of shooting things he doesn't need, which ultimately eats up the time to shoot what he DOES need.Bottom line: If you want the cookie cutter slasher mold, it exists x 100. If you want something that at least flirts with being more cerebral, creative, and stimulating on other levels, (something the third sequel, Season of the Witch also strives for) then watch H2 with an open mind. See it for the artistry if not the story, but it's still easily one of the top entries in the series because it's better crafted and more interesting than virtually all that followed Carpenters involvement. John Carpenter is an artist, and the reality is there's mostly a giant absence of artistry until Rob shows up.",Halloween II
458,SomeOLdAccount,"Guys, the unrated director's cut is worth it!",8,19 January 2018,I hated the theatrical cut because the story was poorly executed with script problems but version of the film fix it. I gave the theatrical cut a 2/10 and I'll say again and I'll not say it again the reason why I made this account because the review the unrated director's cut of the Rob Zombie film or maybe review the producers cut of Halloween 6. Anyways I enjoyed this more than the first one because it does have more of a eerie setting compared to the first one. The story is told well including the script. If I was actually a fan of both of the Rob Zombie film than I'll think the second one is better. Anyways I like this version of the film.,Halloween II

Now I usually don't care for remakes as a whole but there have been some that I think are alright (The Fog comes to mind) but this was just a REALLY bad interpretation and film as a whole.I guess I'm not the best person to judge Zombies work as I'm not a raving fan as many are. I did like House of a 1,000 Corpses but hated The Devils Rejects. I was on the fence about Halloween but after some thought there were some good parts to it. But I can't say the same for this.The characters were forgettable, the use of gore to try to cover a weak plot was obvious, and well the movies timing seemed off. The only reason I give it two stars is that they show Michael looking like a crazy drifter out in a field. That 30 seconds of film was about the only good part of the movie.",Halloween II

461,comic_crypt979,Back with a vengeance,8,29 August 2009,"I'm a die hard Michael Myers fan, love all the original movies. Yes they include 4,5 and 6. I did not enjoy 7 or 8, they were the worst in the franchise imo. The remake (1) was OK for what it was worth, it was nowhere near as great as the original by John Carpenter, but it was better than the last two films in the franchise.Halloween II is better than the remake, a different take on the series that isn't a remake of anything in the entire franchise. The small tribute in the beginning was great I thought, from the original #2. This movie, gives Michael Myers life again. He is the brutal serial killer he should be, and is not getting beaten up by Busta Rhymes or LL Cool J. This film may not be the best horror movie ever made, but it gives great new life in a dead franchise. If your a horror fan that just knows the Saw franchise and Hostile then yeah you probably won't like this. However if your a fan like me who enjoys gore, disturbing death scenes and brutality then you will love this flick. It gives new life to the Halloween franchise and puts it in a step towards the right direction, no longer is Myers being beaten up by over the hill rappers. He is the unstoppable force he should be, pure evil that cannot be stopped and has no sympathy for anything that gets in his way. The original Saw was great, but everything after it wasn't. Not every horror movie needs a ""twist"" in the last few minutes. You go to see a horror movie for the gore, disturbing scenes and to be frightened. I don't go to a horror movie expecting to have a story like Schindler's List or Casablanca. I go to a horror flick to be disturbed and see brutal death scenes. I'm a fan of Romero, Fulci, Argento, Carpenter, Craven etc..",Halloween II
462,sdbridgewood553,I loved Rob Zombie's Halloween 2.,8,31 August 2010,"I know many people did not like Rob Zombie's version of Halloween 2. Well, I did. One must look beyond the f bombs. Michael Myers was not seeing ghosts. Michael Myers was nuts and he was seeing what he thought was himself and his mother. I think Rob Zombie was showing what was making Michael tick.I loved the actress who played Lori Strode. She delivered the scream queen role with passion. The kill scenes did not seem lame like in the awesome slasher 80's horror movies. I thought Rob Zombie showed a more intimate kill. The people who were getting killed seemed to be more scared and the kill scenes were brutal and nasty. I liked that.Could Dr. Loomis have been more deep in the movie? Yes, but oh, well.I think Danielle Harris's death scene was amazing. The scene where she sees Michael in the bathroom and the slow motion starts and the look of terror on her face as she was running away was amazing. She pulled that scene off well. I also liked how they showed the picture of her with her dog when she was young. I took that as a shout to Halloween geeks who are fans of Halloween 4 and 5. I thought the way that scene was shot was done well.I own this movie and will watch it again. One must look at the acting and the characters and the way in which Rob Zombie was showing how hardcore crazy Lori was getting. Over all I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 3 stars.",Halloween II

464,rooted-1,Painfully Disgraceful!,1,6 January 2010,"After the first remake or ""prequel"" as Knob Zombie calls it i wasn't expecting much but i could never imagine it getting that much worst, I had been putting myself off watching this film because i am a huge fan of the Halloween franchise.. Carpenters Halloween was one of the first scary films that id seen and have been a huge fan of Halloween all my life. I knew Zombie would balls it up again but tonight i decided id watch it.The pointless unnecessary use of bad language was cringe worthy, There is absolutely zero character building throughout the film.. Lauri Strodes character is extremely unlikeable, The other characters look like they've just spent a week in a skip. Dr Loomis is even more unlikable who is a self indulged greedy idiot, Nothing like the original Dr Loomis played by Donald Plesence who's performance was flawless and the complete opposite of Malcolm Mcdowell. As for Myers.. The shape that Carpenter created is well and truly finished and has been replaced with a bearded redneck. Also the trademark white mask which makes Myers who he is gets stripped half way though. The use of Sherri Moon Zombie, white horse and the young Myers is unnecessarily pointless. One performance that i did rate in both films was Danielle Harris, She was great in Halloween 4 and 5 also. If your looking for suspense and scares then this film is not the one to watch.All in all Halloween 2 is one of the worst films I've ever seen and Rob Zombie should just leave Halloween alone. I enjoyed ""House of 1000 corpses"" and ""Devils Rejects"" but rob should have stayed in bed for this one.1/10If i could id give it a zero.",Halloween II

But this one is an EXTREME disgrace to John Carpenter. This is no remake whatsoever. I won't spoil anything for anyone who may see this, but it you do, I am almost positive you will regret it. The film is extremely brutal and inconsistent in every way. With numerous, constant and repeated stabbings, and gruesome executions, this movie makes Michael look like, well not the Michael you know at all. And the sound effects are just ridiculous. The snapping, crunching, and slicing noises make you question yourself, ""what the hell was that."" Over the top loud and completely unnecessary.Another thing that bothered me was the grunting he makes when slicing, and stabbing up his victims. In one scene I didn't know if it was dog or him. the almost complete absence of John Carpenter's themes. Not any are used until the end credits.I will say this is not a Halloween film. If it wasn't for the mask, I wouldn't know what the hell I'm watching. Rob Zombie puts a complete spin on this so-called remake. It's like you are for the first time in Michael's head, which I personally think ruins his background. The whole ""kill for mommy"" thing i hated. This turns out to be the driving force throughout the entire film.This movie had the potential to be a great follow up, but Rob totally killed this one. Basically it's Devil's Rejects meets Halloween. The movie was unbearably hard to watch. I went in with an open mind and was crushed by how terrible it was. Halloween II comes off as an awkward, unsuccessful attempt at an experimental film.Sorry if this flushes away any excitement, and this is just my opinion. But if your a Halloween fan, I think you will be greatly disappointed.",Halloween II
467,staglieri,Summary of Movie with a Photo,6,31 August 2009,"After watching Halloween 2 I decided to create a photo that summarizes Rob Zombies version. Please see below... http://www.sft79.com/images/MM.jpgHalloween II is a 2009 American horror film written, directed, and produced by Rob Zombie. The film is a sequel to Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween (1978). Halloween II follows the aftermath of the events of the 2007 remake, particularly how they affected Laurie Strode. The film will see the return of lead cast members Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, and Tyler Mane, who portrayed Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and Michael Myers in the 2007 film, respectively.Zombie originally passed on doing a sequel to his remake, feeling as though he had no energy left to make another Halloween film. Two years later, after unsuccessful attempts to draft a script for a sequel, the Weinstein brothers, Malek Akkad, and Rob Zombie, who had a renewed interest in the film, secured a deal for the director to return. This time around, Zombie focuses more on the connection between Laurie and Michael, and the idea that they both share similar psychological problems. Halloween II was released on August 28, 2009.",Halloween II
468,kingmarkat13,This is ROB ZOMBIE'S Halloween,7,9 October 2009,"People moan when you repeat the same old same old. When someone comes along and brings a fresh take on something, they get slated for doing so. I don't really get that. Rob Zombie has tried to bring something original to the Halloween franchise, which was long dead to be fair. I for one find this a breath of fresh air. Who the hell wants to see the same old plodding Myers going through the motions in a disintegrating story carry on from one lame sequel to the other. The slating this film has had is unfair, I understand its not to everyones taste, yes its not scary, yes there are mistakes, but there's also plenty to enjoy. John Carpenter went for tension with barely no blood, and created a classic. Arguably the best slasher ever made. Rob Zombie has gone for disturbing and in your face. Thats his style. And its refreshing to this franchise, its visually the best horror film for years, is largely unpredictable and feels quite fresh. The performances go from OK, (McDowell) his Loomis feels underdeveloped and gets some embarrassing dialogue as was the case in Zombies first. Good (Compton), to very good (Harris and Dourif - though they don't get as much screen time as they should, especially Dourif, who is a terrific actor). People have moaned about the lack of the infamous theme, i personally don't think its required, as it didn't seem to fit the previous film. Zombies H2 doesn't desecrate Carpenters original, nothing can spoil the impact of that film, even after 31 years. Carpenter himself apparently told Zombie to make the film his own when making the 2007 remake. He didn't succeed then, but he has now. This is Rob Zombies Halloween. If you're looking for a Halloween film that is different from Halloweens 1 - 8 and an improvement on the last one, give it a try, with an open mind.",Halloween II

Its a complete disgrace and insult to those of us who have been fans of the Halloween series and looked forward to something good. Rob should have his face stomped... lets make a movie on that. In this movie Michael is obviously hallucinating or smoking some good sh!t throughout the entire movie. chasing ghosts and a damn horse he probably ate. Nothing is explained in this movie. and now Michael apparently makes noises like if he is having intercourse with the victims. he hacks at them like for like 5min as if it makes it better (Zombie prob thinks it does). You know what, just wait for the work print or for the cam version if u wish to WASTE your time. i tend to be patient with these types of movies but god damn! there has to be a limit and this is def it. DO NOT WATCH IT... at least don't pay for it. if this Zombie bimbo can direct movies, sh!t man, we all can.

Acting by the main cast members and minor was way better than the first, especially the added screen time of sheriff and Annie bracket. The only main problem I have is the actress Laurie is nowhere on the level of Jamie Lee Curtis was, but she was at least better in this one. Liked the whole horse and white clothes thing of Miachels mom and Miachel as a child. Malcolm MacDowell was excellent as usual as was Tyler Mane as the psychopath Miachel Myers.

471,thenew400,Dare I say it ... the best Halloween so far,9,1 September 2009,"I honestly don't understand all the hatred for this film. I just saw it yesterday and thought I'd give it a good day to settle in before I commented on it. After constantly thinking about this movie, I have come to the conclusion that it is the best of the Halloween series as it stands so far. I think the problem people are having with it is that it is in NO way like any of the other Halloween movies and that is actually its triumph. I would have been upset leaving the theater if I had seen a typical Halloween sequel like #4-6, H20 and Resurrection, the absolute worst Halloween. I think people thought after the first Rob Zombie Halloween that he would continue and make almost an exact remake of the original Halloween 2. I could see how they would think this as the first Rob Zombie Halloween was exactly like the original, with the exception of the whole Michale Myers back story. I am so glad he decided to smash the typical Halloween conventions and evolve the series. Don't get me wrong, I don't think the movie was perfect. I thought the use of the F bomb over and over was a little excessive, but when you think about it, that is how a lot of people talk in today's society. I think the word has lost a lot of its meaning and maybe Rob Zombie is commenting on that with the dialog. In any case, Rob Zombie has created a dark gem of a horror movie. The cinematography is beautiful and this is by far the darkest Halloween film, visually and story-wise. I don't know if Zombie is a fan of the film or not, but this movie reminded me a lot of Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer, which is an excellent film that you should also see if you haven't. I think this Halloween also has the best acting of any of the Halloweens. I thought Brad Dourif was outstanding in this film, and contrary to popular opinion, I actually think Scout Taylor Compton is great as Laurie. I don't know why though, but she reminds me of Alicia Silverstone, only Scout is a better actress. I honestly hope they keep these actors around for the next movie even though Rob is not directing. Anyway, I think if most of the people that gave this movie a bad review revisit it when it comes out on DVD, they will probably sober up a little bit and see that while this isn't a typical Halloween movie, it is still an excellent one. Even if they don't, I still loved it and think it is the best Halloween and one of the best horror movies I have ever seen, SO SHOOT ME!",Halloween II
472,mas18966,SOO Disappointed!!,2,6 February 2010,"Wow... where to start.. This movie was just way bad for a hand full of reasons. One is that, the movie was based on flashbacks and illusions and a crap load of screams for no reason as well as all out f*** words. It also had very few killing scenes in it as well. In addition, to the killing scenes it wasn't creative when Michael Myers went in for the kill. Also, the movie was very jumpy and didn't give any scents in what the movie was trying to deliver. Also, the ending is by far the worst ending i have seen in a while. The ending of the movie ended with a white hallway with a white horse and a white witch walking toward Lorry Strode and to kick it of with a very gay song from the 70's which is ""Love Hurts"".

473,lightningmikester,The best one since the original! Wow!,9,28 August 2009,"I caught a matinée showing of Halloween II earlier today, and let me just say, I thoroughly enjoyed every last second of it! First, some people who didn't like it claim that there is no plot, just blood, guts, and gore for two hours. I thought this movie had enough violence as it did a great plot. The movie basically focuses on the ghost of Michael Myers' mother using her son as a puppet to kill Laurie and bring their family together again, and Dr. Sam Loomis has written and promoted a new book titled, ""The Devil Walks Among Us."" Had I not eventually urged myself to finally check out the remake a couple weeks ago, I never would have thought to check this one out. Rob Zombie has brought the spirit of the ""Halloween"" movies to surface again, after the stupid sequels to the original. The acting was awesome, and the new characters starring with Scout Taylor-Compton were funny, stupid, or just a little amusing. This has got to be the best horror movie I have seen (besides the remake) for a very long time. It is so nice to finally get a much-rewarding horror flick compared to some of the other horror films we get these days. If you have a free time this weekend, I highly recommend that you see this movie! I already can't wait for it to come out on DVD! 9.5/10",Halloween II

Why the hell does Myers have to grunt every damn time he takes a whack at someone now. What is he getting old? I wish I could say better luck next time, but instead I would just rather say give it up Zombie. Your no John Carpenter. I may have been expecting maybe a little more with this film, but damn come on now. I guess we can all look forward to next year when the new Nightmare on Elm Street comes out.

475,Rumdawg,Almost Anyone Could've Made A Better Movie!!!,1,30 August 2009,"That without a doubt was the worst Halloween ever. I honestly thought that Rob Zombie would have done much, much better considering his success in the past. I won't go into any in particulars and ruin it for others(though I can't see how that would be possible), but the word ""F**K"" was used so many times, its like thats all they could come up with for dialogue. It was almost like I was watching a Tarantino flick (except for the fact that there's usually some crazy action soon to follow). Also the crappiest suspense scenes I've seen in a while. I think Rob Zombie should've focused on what worked in all the other Halloween movies, Michael. I was so hyped to see this movie, only to be there sitting at the end, saying ""What the f**k was that!!"" I thought Halloween: Resurrection was the worst, but this crap was the worst by leaps and bounds. There wasn't one thing that wasn't totally predicable in this movie, especially if you've seen the trailer, because that basically shows most of the plot right there. Anyways thank goodness Rob Zombie isn't doing anymore of these and hopefully someone who knows horror, will have us all a quiver in the next one. Cuz u know they can never truly kill the greats like Freddy, Jason and Michael! Come to think of it maybe they would have been better off making a movie that had all three of the greatest slashers on the silver screen in it, rather than make this total piece of trash! And no I wasn't drunk when I watched it or wrote this review, even though I wish I was!!!",Halloween II
476,talksalways,Halloween 2 ... best of the best!!,9,10 September 2009,"I know many people say that H2 was the worst Halloween movie they've seen...but i have to strongly disagree. Rob Zombie put a whole different twist on the movie and jumped more over to H4 which was better. I would have been bored if he would have made the same movie just newer. That honestly would have put me to sleep and been a waste of money but I think most of the people that didn't like it think that way because they expected it to be the same as the original. The F word is used an over abundance in today's world and I think people who think other that say the F word or any other ""foul"" language are ""bad"" people should lay off. Also many people don't come from a world like the Rob Zombie Myers' did. They lived in a trashy life style more or less and Zombie portrayed it as simply that. So many people who don't understand this wouldn't see this movie as original because it's not. Another thing is if you've seen the other Rob Zombie movies and seen how much killing and brutal death scenes there were, wouldn't you expect it? I mean if you went to go see a scary death Halloween movie, wouldn't you expect to see brutal death? I mean, Rob Zombie does always put a crap load of bloody deaths in his movies and they're modern movies, not old school ""oh I'm gunna die now"" movies, they're more ""holy F*** run, he's gunna kill me!"" movies. That's what the public wants to see nowadays, so directors, writers, etc. are making movies that they will get money for...and this is what they will get money for. So those of you that didn't like the movie...don't go see it if you don't want to see that much blood or brutal killings when you know it's by Rob Zombie or it's a scary movie.",Halloween II
477,Nightly-Days,Halloween II...Not So Bad...Right?,6,6 February 2010,"I never went to see Halloween II in cinema and when released on DVD I was rather sceptical to purchase the movie due to the general negativity surrounding the movie. However, having been an avid fan of the series I felt a necessity to purchase and watch this movie to convey my loyalty to the franchise. Within the half hour of watching the movie I felt a real sense of originality projecting in front of my very eyes, it was tense, emotional and at times scary. The darkness of the movie is, to me, very special in allowing the audience to 'feel' Laurie's turmoil and to engage in Michael's world. The originality of this movie makes it extra special. I do not like any franchises with the same formula repeated over and over again. The best thing, in my opinion, was Michael Myers, Rob Zombie certainly created a whole new dimension to this character in the remake but he took Michael's appearance to the next level in this sequel. However, having said that, I felt the way Michael grunted was just nonsense & it is better when he is silent due the mysterious character which he is. An element which was not fully explored in the previous movies was the way Michael lives & with this sequel it is portrayed rather well. Halloween II is more about dark characterisation and Rob Zombie captures this exceptionally well on screen. The lack of the classic music from Halloween had vanished until the end credits but then again this adds to its originality. A major throwback however was the change in Malcolm Mcdowell's character, Dr.Loomis. I felt no connection with this character,This was largely because of the general attitude and behaviour Dr.Loomis had. If the Dr.Loomis character had been dropped from the movie and more time was spent on the story of Laurie and Annie the movie may have played out better. Having watched Rob Zombie's re-imagining of Halloween, I was surprised by Scout Taylor-Compton's (Laurie Strode) performance, but in this instalment her acting varied in the scenes, at times her performance was poor but at other times she was spot on. Danielle Harris and Brad Dourif did not have much screen time which is such a pity as they gave the best performances in the movie.Finally, I would certainly recommend this to any Horror fan and to any Halloween fan.Yes, I know people do not like the significant change in this movie from its predecessor's but there has got to be some originality in every movie sequel because if there is not you are just as well to watch the classic 1978 version over and over again.",Halloween II
478,aMovieManiac,Halloween II had potential...,5,28 August 2009,"Lets start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the Halloween series. The original Halloween and Halloween II were excellent. I thought they were clearly perfect examples of good horror. Now Zombie is an excellent director I have seen all of his movies and have to say that he has talent and has his own way of creating horror. Now lets get to Halloween II.I have been waiting to see Halloween II ever since it was announced shortly after the Halloween remake. Zombie doesn't copy the direct storyline of Carpenter's Halloween II and I respect that. Who wants to see a remake of an exact same story. People like to see change. Now, Halloween II starts off as Laurie walks away after shooting Michael Myers (Direct continuation from the first). Sheriff Brackett then gets Laurie to the hospital. She is in the hospital for only 5 minutes when Michael myers comes in and starts the mass slaughter of the hospital. Laurie runs off and then the movie changes its plot as it goes to 1 year later. Laurie is living with the Bracketts. She is mentally disturbed from the horror of Michael Myers and constantly wakes up from nightmares. Michael Myers is trying to find Laurie while killing people on the way. Now, the worst part of this movie is that Dr. Loomis is promoting his new book which tells the story of Michael Myers and tells that Laurie is his sister. Dr. Loomis goes to a TV talk show where weird Al is there. This was a terrible choice, the setting of the movie changed from being a decent build up of horror to almost a comedy setting. I did not like this. Then Michael eventually meets up with Laurie. Sherri Moone Zombie is in the movie as a spirit telling Michael to kill Laurie so that the family could be together. This is a good way to change the storyline of the movie. At the end of the movie Loomis is killed and Laurie becomes twisted as if she is going to be a new killer. I gave this movie 5/10 because it had potential but many different parts of the movie could have been left out. Zombie said that he is not doing a Halloween III so I guess the Halloween remake series will be over. It is to bad because Zombie could have created a new story that could actually involve Laurie as a killer in Halloween III. This would be good because the original Halloween 3 was terrible and did not have Michael Myers in it.",Halloween II
479,dsigler2010,"The Plot is obvious, use ur imagination!",8,29 August 2009,"Alright Alright...so it wasn't the best film by Zombie. BIG DEAL! I think people are looking for too much in movies nowadays and can't just sit back and enjoy it. I liked H2 because, as a horror film should, it delivered many great death scenes. People are so stuck on the whole plot thing. Well, sometimes you have to use a little imagination to figure the plot out. Yet most people can't pick up on that and just ignore the talent that goes in to making movies while trying to look for a plot and expecting it to be explained through the dialog. The people who talk about plot and give movies like these bad reviews are the same that would give Fast and Furious 5 stars and Devil's Rejects zip. If you pay attention to the beginning, you will understand what his mother and the white horse represents in the story. Let's be a little bit more open to new ideas people, and stop expecting an explanation for everything.",Halloween II
480,Darren50,Brutally Disgusting,1,11 October 2009,"I've never been so disturbed, disgusted, sickened and shocked by a film in my life. Zombie has created nothing more than a horrific stab fest. The scene when the nurse gets killed at the beginning was awful, the blood just drained from my face, i felt ill and actually sick in the head when i was sitting there realizing that i just payed money to see this. the sound effects when she was getting stabbed and the noises he was making while he stabbed and stabbed while she screamed in agony. Well the scene was realistic, i'll give that much to zombie... thats not a compliment. WARNING TO ALL: DO NO WATCH THIS. will cause a sleepless night...",Halloween II
481,Moviedude2008,Too Many Haters,10,31 August 2009,"Since when are brutal killings, middle of the country trailer park dialog, skillfully paced edits, great camera shots and a solid score/soundtrack a bad thing when horror films are concerned? Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 is a complete throwback to the way horror films used to be made, without a care in the world as to what the backseat critics here on IMDb have to say.Thank you Rob Zombie.However, that is not to say that this film, or its predecessor should ever have been made in the first place. John Carpenter's Halloween is just one of those things that's untouchable and because Zombie decided to re-make the series people cannot and will not find it in themselves to enjoy his versions at all.",Halloween II
482,JJMinshall,Worst film I have ever seen,1,13 September 2009,"Bottom line....This film was awful. I have never walked out of a movie in my life...until this movie. I don't care how it ended. It was awful. It had NO story line and was very brutal. Now...don't get me wrong I know it's Michael Meyers, but even the old Michael didn't kill like this. I should have demanded my money back, then again I should have known it was bad when there were only 8 people in the whole theater. I think even some of them walked out. Rob Zombie turned the characters into white trash whores that just wanted to drink, smoke and screw. And don't even get me started on Loomis. It's really to bad I had to give this one star. Maybe 1/4 of a star....nope...even that it to much for this film.Don't waste your money people. Wait till it's in a Redbox....even though I wouldn't even spend $1 on it.",Halloween II
483,prferguson3,My Review,6,2 September 2009,"Okay first off. I do like Rob Zombie, i think he's talented, story wise and visually, however, being a fan of the original Halloween, i was pretty disgusted with his ""new"" vision of Halloween, and i was equally disgusted with this one, although that doesn't make them bad movies. They were good films for their time, just not my style. However, Halloween 2 was extremely unique because it took a new style, direction, etc than its 2007 remake, while keeping the same writer and director. I walked into the theater expected the same thing as the remake, but was pleasantly surprised, it was an intense movie. If i got anything from this movie, it was astonishment. Kudos to Rob Zombie for trying new things, although he isn't the greatest storyteller. My biggest complaint was what a ignorant ass, Dr. Loomis was. In the original series, we would have been so sad had he been butchered to death, in this film, i was rather pleased to see him die. It means i won't have to put up with his crap again in future films. I guess we'll have to see what the 3rd film brings, since Zombie isn't doing it",Halloween II
484,weathers-jm,Not Halloween,5,27 January 2010,"John Carpenter startled a nation with a gripping story about a mass murderer by the name of Michael Myers. Since then the series has been taken to new highs and lows. After seeing the remake done by Rob Zombie...I loved the new direction that Zombie took the film on his first attempt and it shows the motives and twisted thoughts that pass the mind of serial killer Michael Myers.Thinking that Halloween 2 from Rob Zombie would further along the great direction the franchise was taking I was looking forward to seeing it, but I am sorry I did. Rob Zombie managed to take the story and make it into House Of A Thousand Corpses meets Jason X, tasteless gore-fest with no plot or direction. The story starts with the last film wrapping up what happened with the supposed death of Myers, but it just seems to go off track with noticeable changes from the original storyline.I could babble on for days about how disappointing the film was, but if you don't believe me....see it for yourself.",Halloween II
485,phoenixdark69,Meh not great,6,29 August 2009,"I think Rob Zombie is a very talented director and I absolutely loved the first Halloween however this film was much more lacking. It's pacing was very strange and didn't flow nearly as well as the first movie. The first Halloween has a very good well developed story but for the most par the second movie is just random murders by Michael Myers up until the last half hour or so.Zombie did not let up on the gore or violence which is good to see but it still lacked the substance of the first movie. I felt as though he was trying too hard to work on character development which i felt is something that he hasn't spent much time with in any of his previous movies. However, despite the decline in quality it is still an above average horror flick and worth seeing. The gore and violence is excellent and can thoroughly gross out the crowd. The first half hour or so is an excellent homage to the original Halloween II and is very suspenseful but the film goes flat form there. The end was not as climactic as I'd hoped and almost makes me wish that the first one was just a stand alone film.I however see this as a positive step for Zombies career as it tells me he is much more conscientious of character development. So I look for good things from him in the future.",Halloween II
486,xxfireballxx,i thought it was enjoyable,6,1 September 2009,I know every ones trashing this movie but i thought it was pretty entertaining now I'm a big horror fan so I've seen the original Halloween and its sequel as well as the remake and dare i say it i liked this movie i thought the kills were brutal which i loved i thought it was odd how Micheal was a hobo and just sat in a shack for a year i liked Micheal's costumes the only thing that i down right hated is Doctor loom is WTF went threw rob zombies head if u seen the original and its sequel Doctor Samuel Lomis is so driven to kill Micheal because he knows how much of a monster he is and in the 1981 sequel he blows himself up in order kill him but in this one he doesn't even confront him in that kind of matter i thought he was going to chase him down as soon as the killings started but no and u know what they do wit him as soon as him a Micheal are finally reunited theykill him right away WTF the ending was a little disappointing but if u take this movie seriously u wont enjoy it but if u just watch it for what it is its pretty enjoyable,Halloween II
487,shatteredtears72,perfect!,10,4 September 2009,"I absolutely loved this film. I saw it opening night with my boyfriend and a surprisingly uncrowded movie theater. I was truly terrified of this movie. It became somewhat more supernatural than a slasher film, which I personally like better. I love the new Laurie, all punk'd out and what not. The mom was pretty creepy as well. Although beautiful, the mom was most likely the scariest looking character in the film. There's a sequence in the film that truly terrifies me and it's one of Laurie's first ""dream sequences"". I literally had to turn my head away from the screen because it was just so horrifying. I believe that movie goers need to understand that this is a ROB ZOMBIE film, and yes, there will be millions of F bombs in the film, but surprisingly no actual sex took place (for once). Therefore, if anyone complains about dialogue or nudity, do a little research on the movie you're about to spend 11 dollars on. If you haven't noticed the world around us, especially the generation depicted in this film uses vulgar language in almost every sentence spoken. Overall, I give Halloween 2 two thumbs up and a ten out of ten rating. Great job Zombie!!",Halloween II
488,DGlee666,Should NEVER have been made!!!!!,1,18 October 2009,"1??? There should be a minus chart for movies like this! Possibly the worst film I've ever seen! Would I care as much if it hadn't the Halloween title, probably not. It would just be a bad film, but to be a Halloween film!!! Oh My God!! Rob Z should be ashamed of himself! How it was even excepted & given the go ahead to be made is beyond me. ????? Rob writes like a child - the dialog is from a 10 year old's mind who is trying to be rebellious, its so bad it funny! It even makes Good actors look like they cant act, but speaking of people who cant act........ Has no one actually told Rob that his wife cant act to save her life?? She's terrible! Its like he writes a part for her in all his movies just so she can get a wage, I cant see anyone else ever hiring her other than Rob. Im gonna leave it at that, TERRIBLE MOVIE! Long Live Michael Myers (but not if their gonna make films like this for his character)",Halloween II
489,bdjames30,Tired of the FANBOYS bashing a decent film.,5,4 September 2009,"First of all, give it up fan-boys, Rob Zombie did a good job no matter how you put it! He got asked to do a sequel when he planned not to, as an up and coming director I would not say yes to a sequel at all. Especially when I clearly wrote in the demise of the main character, ie. Laurie blowing Mike's head off in the remake. Anyways, I can't wait till Aug. 2010 as Rosenthal starts up his 3-D piece of crap, when clearly Mike, Loomis and literally Laurie aka Angel was all destroyed in this film's weak climax. I can't wait to read the message boards after that showing LOL.Secondly, how in the hell did a perfectly sane girl see her dead moma and mysteriously can't move because lil' Mike is holding her back who doesn't exist because big Mike is standing there watching the whole episode? Then you get a young fella that doesn't look nothing like the original Mike Myers and you write a whole story around this kid damn Zombie; shouldn't you have consulted with the kids parents before you write a whole script involving a critical character???? By the way the film flowed great until the last 30,45 minutes then it seemed to drag, due to all those M.M. hallucinations. These scenes actually looked like it came from David Lynch and Guillermo Del Toro's love child, but I liked it just not during the climax. Overall the film was good not great especially when the original had a lot to prove. H2, go see it during a matinée and I'll bet you It'll be the best thing showing at that time of day anywhere in the world. However, remember it is a horror film about a passionate young man who wants to be reunited again with his family.P.S. The passion is why Mike is yelling and or grunting in this one. He feels like he lost Boo and he will do anything to get her back. Plus did ya'll realize that M.M. Left town to return 2 Haddonfiled on Halloween???",Halloween II
490,Trayew,Misunderstood,7,27 October 2009,"I think this movie is misunderstood. I think they are both misunderstood. We're used to watching these horror movies with some stupid explanation for why the killer kills. Revenge most typically. Freddy and Jason kill everybody and everything for revenge there is no fancy reason like everybody is pretending there is, simply revenge. It's an easy reason to have a character kill. Of course the original Halloween is better I'm not crazy but Zombie's movies aren't awful. Look at it as a movie and ignore the Michael Myers aspect. It's a movie about a kid who is completely devoid of any human emotion and is completely insane. This is the reason people hate it so much. It's very realistic as far as why he's killing. Most real murders are crimes of passion, others are for profit, the rest usually are committed by crazy people. This movie is brutally violent as far as the death scenes go. So much so it was hard to watch. So that's not good. However Zombie will tell you this movie isn't about Michael it's about Laurie. This movie is for Laurie what Halloween was for Michael. It's her journey into insanity. It's about her going slowly insane and turning into a killer. Her eyes at the end of the movie are exactly like his eyes were in the mental hospital. Empty. I thought that was cool. If they make a sequel it would almost have to be about Laurie getting loose and going on her killing spree. They'd never let him do it which is why he probably won't be involved.",Halloween II
491,tyler-richardson,Falls very short of it's predecessor,2,20 March 2010,"After seeing Rob Zombie's Halloween, and thoroughly enjoying his adaptation of the original film, I had very high hopes for the up-and-coming sequel. I waited months for it to come out. Finally, the day of it's release. I walked into the theater ready to see an amazing movie.The movie started out very well, continuing from where it's predecessor ended. The first few scenes were very intense and had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen next. But this feeling, sadly, did not last. We are introduced the reasons behind Michael's murderous rage. Michael's mother. Michael is led from victim to victim by the spirit of his mother, his younger self, and a white horse. A little odd, but not too distracting. Let's continue. We find out that Laurie is now living with Annie Bracket, and her father, our in the country. Because of the events of the previous film, she is suffering from nightmares. Dr. Loomis is hard at work promoting his new book about his history with Michael. The film revolves around these three plot keys for the rest of the film. Now that you know the basic premise of the film, on with the review.Now, my first complaint. The whole ghostly mother spirit was very out of place. It seemed very forced and as though Rob Zombie just added the role for the sole fact to have his wife in the film. Still, it wasn't too bad until the last ten minutes of the film when she somehow goes from being a spirit, to actually being able to hold down physical objects, and other people. Next, Dr. Loomis seemed out of place. Malcolm McDowell did a fantastic job in both the first Halloween and this Halloween, but in this film, his role is less involved with the story, to the point that you could have cut him out, and the story of the film would be almost unchanged. Now, I don't have any problem with the use of profanity, but when that's the only thing that I hear for 2 minutes straight, and when it's almost half of the script, I have a problem.Overall, this film just takes all the things that make cliché slasher films, and everything that was said to be wrong with his original Halloween adaptation, and focuses only on those, and magnifies them ten-fold. By far, one of the worst entries in the series.",Halloween II
492,bry905,Great movie by a great director,10,13 January 2010,rob zombie did it again great movie and great cast. movie was dark and twisted from start to finish. The end was very different but very original. I watched it and was turned on by how there was action from the begin of the movie all the way up to the end. I don't understand why people are hattiing on this movie so much. Rob zombie does a great job making Michael myers very real and human but unlike what most people are saying it does kill him it makes become more suspenseful then ever before.O YEA and PEople HE ONLY TALKS ONCE IN THE MOVIE AND ALL HE SAYS IS DIE THATS NOT ACTUALLY TALKING.

493,kirewa5,Halloween II was so awful.,2,29 August 2009,"I don't even know where to begin.Im a huge classic horror movie fan. I Have to say that Rob Zombie did an awesome job of raping the Halloween series. ill give you a hand. The first 10 minutes of the movie weren't bad. I got kind of excited with how fast everything started out, but no it all had to be a dream. I was so annoyed that everything half exciting was all a dream. seriously, the girl doesn't need to dream 50 times a day. There was terrible, terrible acting. but thats the least of the problem. The thing that ruined it all for me was the visions of his mom and him when he was a kid and that stupid awful white horse. Like seriously, how do you come up with that? and it doesn't happen once, oh no, it happens a good 5 times in the movie. Not only that, the main girl sees them too! and Micheals ""child spirit"" or whatever was holding her down? are you serious? NO classic Halloween movie would have stupid things such as illusions walking around holding people down. and then at the end when she was like ""oh I love you brother"" and comes out in his mask. I've never heard so many people laugh during a horror film. the whole theater was cracking up.",Halloween II
494,MangledPrivates,My Halloween 2 Review,6,29 August 2009,"I saw the movie earlier today and I must say is lived up to my expectations. The beginning hospital sequence was brilliant. Brad douriff was sensational as bracket. The movie was a lot more emotional then I thought it would be, playing a lot like a drama with horror elements tossed in. What I love most about it was how real it felt, the kills had a documentary type feel as if I was watching real footage. The movie really showed the effect on not only individual characters but on the community as a whole and there infatuation with myers. One of the best scenes IMO is when loomis is at the book signing and linda's father confronts him. It was an emotional scene and you feel for the father. THIS MOVIE IS VERY BRUTAL!!! One of the most brutal movies i've seen. ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN IN A MOVIE THEATER, it wasn't a specific seen but there was at least 15 elderly people in there that really surprised me lol. Most seemed to have enjoyed it, tears were definitely shed in the theater and not during the scenes you would think, not the Annie scene. But some of thie kills got huge reactions from the crowd because of how real they felt. I felt as if I was witnessing the brutal slaughter of these people. The acting was a big step up in this than in the first movie. I don't have a problem at all with Loomis in this movie I found his character to be a more realistic view of what loomis would have become. In the real world people sell ad capitalize on controversy and that is what he was doing. This movie was very good IMO the only things I have a problem with are some of the Sheri-moon scenes. She plays a great psycho-path, and was amazing as Baby in TDR. But she has no range and was terrible and down right laughable at some moments. Her acting wasn't quite MARKY MARK in the happening bad, but it was terrible. Getting to see what's going on in Michael's head is cool but the acting was ridiculous by moon. A good actress could have pulled it off. This movie mos. def. had it's share of HOLY *beep* moments, and keeps you entertained. I'd say this is right on par with THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, if not better.4 out of 5 Sheri and chase kept it from being a five",Halloween II

Its a good movie, with great moments, great OST, great cam angles, great gore and kills and a story that is pretty good taking in account its a halloween movie, and a horror movie. Stop being this way and truly watch a movie, don't watch just in the end say :"" OH Rob Zombie Wrecked the halloween series completely!""Which is not true, I believe he started a new generation of Halloween.A pretty good one..Good Movie, Great Gore, Amazing kills, Amazing story 7/10.",Halloween II
496,mata-30,This will definitely widen the faction.,8,28 August 2009,"Where most people my age grew up with Barney and the Power Rangers, I was raised on slasher movies. I watched everything from the fathers of the genre (74's Black Christmas and 78's Halloween of course) to the ""Golden Age"" slasher films (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and the Halloween follow-ups). For me, 78's Halloween has always served as a staple and set the bar for not just the horror movies that I watch, but every film for that matter. What has always fascinated me about the Halloween series was the atmosphere that it's films gave off. The semi-barren streets, the dead trees, the breeze in the fall leaves, all served as a ""mask"" for an evil that lingered in one of the streets or homes, an evil that carried more characteristics of a voyeur than a cold-blooded killer. Thus we have the term ""the shape."" Here is where I believe the faction will widen. Following 2007's Halloween fans found themselves on one of two sides of a fence. Fans either saw it as a attempt that was misinterpreted (Michael was too violent, too big, content was too crude, etc.), or they saw it as a breath of fresh air. I personally found myself on the side of the latter. After all, what couldn't have possibly hurt worse than a ninth film trying to clean up the train wreck of Resurrection... For those who found themselves on side one of the fence and hoped Zombie corrected his ""wrong interpretation"" of the atmosphere of the series, prepare to be EXTREMELY disappointed. It is twice as violent, twice as crude, and ten times more dark. The overall atmosphere of this new installment tips its hat more towards The Devil's Rejects and a Tim Burton film than it does the previous Halloween series. Much if this film spends its time in a ""dream"" state (serving as an insight into both Michael and Laurie's mind as well as their ""link""), and it is here that we see Zombie's real influence in terms of cinematography. The table scene (which bares a striking resemblance to the Last Supper) is a prime example. The difference between the series' original characters and their R. Zombie reincarnations are also twice as big. Michael's standard wardrobe has changed (as most of you already know), and Laurie's character has drastically changed, yet we can see vague attempts by Laurie throughout the film to retain some of her previous innocence that was robbed from her. There are only two problems I had with the film. 1.) I would have liked to see more of Haddonfield. I personally have always been in love with that town. 2.) Even though I welcome interpretation on Zombie's part, I wasn't particularly fond of where he took Loomis' character. Dr. Loomis has always been a staple in the Halloween franchise, and he seemed to turn than upside down, making Loomis seem as more of a nuisance than a real situation character. The only reason I am not more upset over this change is the introduction of another Loomis-type character in Sheriff Brackett. I without a doubt see Brad Douif's Sheriff Brackett as the new Loomis. In short, if you welcome new interpretation and fresh air for the greatest horror series of all time, then be prepared for a great film. No longer can one see the Halloween series as a teen slasher (which I don't think it EVER was). The remake gave us a breath of new legitimacy that was desperately needed, and this follow up adds to that ten fold. The deaths are perfect, the change of scenery in regards to overall vision is refreshing, and the music is PERFECT (ex.Brackett finding his daughter in a rather unpleasant state). If you don't appreciate the face lift that Zombie brought to the remake, then be prepared for a wasted movie ticket. I for one loved it.",Halloween II
497,BloodLilly,The Spirit of Halloween returns,8,3 September 2009,"SPOILERS:::: First off, I will be the first to admit that the script for this movie was a tad lacking. The ""f"" bomb is used quite frequently. But really what would your reaction be if your friends were being slaughter by your homicidal brother? ""Oh dear?"" Rob Zombie has said countless times that this film is NOT a REMAKE! So i cannot stress to people how unlike the Halloween by John Carpenter is. Zombie has a completely different approach to just about every subject. But still maintains the scary MIKE MEYERS persona.The film has the usual horror movie garb. Screaming and blood. Lots of blood. Not to mention the extreme use of nudity. But this generation is certainly used to seeing nudity. I mean nudity and horror films kind of walk hand and hand in this film.All in all, I was very pleased what this movie. Basically everywhere from the emotional mess that had become Laurie Strode/Angel Meyer (Scout Taylor Compton) To the eerie presence of one hauntingly beautiful mother Deborah Meyers (Sheri Moon Zombie) And all the slaughtery goodness in between.The ending is truly something to expect. After all we all go a little mad sometimes. And who wouldn't go crazy after seeing all of their friends killed.Or surviving death TWICE.This movie is a haunting masterpiece. I look forward to more of the brilliant yet psychopathic humor that is Mr. Rob Zombie!",Halloween II
498,marcgroves2009,Rob zombie is good but not the best!!!!,10,1 September 2009,"I love the Halloween series. The original is one of my alltime favorite films, and I love Part 2 along with H20. The others aren't great, but I still enjoy watching them from time to time. The remake disappointed me a bit, but I still thought it was an OK film. This sequel blows the remake away, and is better than any of the other films in the series besides the ones I mentioned above.The film started out great. I loved the shots of Laurie walking the streets after shooting Michael. Then we moved to the hospital, where there was some actual suspense. After that, we move ahead one year. This is when it really gets good, as we get some brutal deaths along with some crazy dream sequences.I love how Rob Zombie spent a lot of time focusing on how the massacre in the last film affected all the characters. He really fixed a lot of issues from his last film by making the characters more likable and toning down the sex and language slightly.I also liked that this had the spirit of Halloween. None of the Halloween films have really had that, but this did. I also loved the scenes with the white horse. It sounds really stupid, but the scenes are actually quite eerie. It's like something straight out of a really creepy dream.Overall, this was a great sequel that to me, surpasses the first film. As long as you expect to be entertained watching people die brutally, along with a few suspenseful scenes, you should like it.",Halloween II
499,shaggyfields,Stop screwing up classic franchises,1,27 August 2009,"Thanks once again Rob, (and the Hollywood bunch all together) for destroying a classic film. Cheapening the experience with nothing but sex and drug references. The original Halloween was perfect, suspenseful, terrifying, and didn't sympathize with the boogie man. I watched the remake of the first Halloween and i was crushed when Mr. Zombie humanized the monster that is Michel Myers. The same can be said for the remake of Friday the 13th. I can't believe that these movies are going to be some peoples first introducton to these character. And now Hollywood is doing the same to Freddy Kruger. For god sakes people, if you can't think of an original idea maybe you shouldn't be writing scripts, leave the classics alone and write your own damn movies.",Halloween II
500,griffey1986,I cant believe how upset I am,2,27 August 2009,"I literally just walked into my house from seeing halloween 2. Honestly, it was the most disappointing let down i have ever witnessed. Not only can rob zombie not direct, but his distasteful lack of knowledge (he must have no knowledge of the previous halloweens, when you see this movie, you'll know what i mean), has made this movie feel nothing like a halloween movie, and honestly almost comical. Now before you start to say ""oh well this kid has no idea what hes talking about, hes just a hater"", i want to say that i am obsessed with halloween, and everything about it. His first remake wasn't terrible, i thought he could of done better, but it wasn't bad. Unfortunately this was NOTHING like it. The original halloween 2 was terrifying because it was in a creepy hospital at night, you didn't know where michael was, or what he was thinking, and there sure as hell wasn't a stupid ghost mother telling him what to do. Like, am I watching Friday the 13th, or halloween? Anyway, his ""hospital scene"" was 10 minutes long, and a joke. And rob, we've all seen boobs and heard cuss words, and i'm no saint, but really? every two seconds? And then after all this hard to watch crap, he decides, oh well maybe ill make laurie start to turn evil and see if the fans like that. Yeah rob, we love it, let me tell you. And the kills, oh my god. A head gets cut off, like come on thats so played out. And EVERY death scene is sooooo elaborate. Like it goes on and on and on. He cant just kill them, he has to mutilate every single body. And in the originals Dr. Loomis was so likable and wasn't a money hungry snake trying to sell a book. Can anyone guess which one he is in this movie? I'm rambling and i'm sorry, but if any other producer gives this man the permission to do his movie i'll be shocked. It was that pathetic. I can sit here all day and tell you whats wrong with this movie, but honestly,I'm just gonna throw in the original second halloween and go to bed. Don't give this bum your money, please. Go buy the original halloween 2. I've never been more excited for a movie, then so upset about the same one.",Halloween II
501,heathsaints,Seriously? This is the best Rob Zombie could muster?,2,28 August 2009,"I remember back when horror movies were scary. Rob Zombie should never, EVER be allowed near a movie studio, or even a movie theater or a Blockbuster. This had to have been the worst movie I have seen from any movie franchise. There was very little in the way of storyline, but that is expected with most slasher flicks. But does Zombie have to find a way for his wife, who is a terrible actress, to be in every movie he does? I sat through the whole thing waiting for it to get better, and it finally did when the credits rolled. I should have seen The Final Destination instead. Please, for the love of humanity, do not go to the theater to see this, don't rent it, don't watch it on cable, don't even watch the trailer if it comes on. You can thank me later",Halloween II
502,jcoleman62,"storm coming, maybe not",6,28 August 2009,"When Rob Zombie remade Halloween he did a very good job. I saw the movie and it was like an F 5 tornado. It blew me away. When I heard he was making Halloween II I could hardly wait. Today (08-28-09)I saw it. The first few minutes were the storm clouds on the horizon. I was ready for another F 5. I got a blustery day with a few showers and a little thunder. The storm clouds were a long scene in the hospital and out in the rain. That scene when on way to long for the way that scene ended. The entire movie was a major let down for me. I am a 46 year old man in Memphis,Tennessee who grew up on horror movies. I love them! Thank you Mr. Zombie for the first remake of Halloween, the second well not so much. At least I saw it at the matinée price and not the evening price. That is my silver lining to this storm cloud.",Halloween II
503,torykins3,Did not have the Holy Guacamole scared out of me,2,28 August 2009,I guess everyone deserves a screw up in their film career .... What I always liked about Robs films was the white trash dialog .... I saw only a brief glimpse of that in the Jam/Jello joke ... although we were already supposed to know the characters there still needs to be character development.... In 1000 corpses and Devils Rejects you understood the characters and found them somewhat humorous.... ..... also great character development in the young Michael ....This seems like one of those pointless killing movies that they turn into a video game...... unless they do a first person Michale I'm not sure how that would work.... I digress Rob you can do a lot better I am not giving up hope ....... and your wife was great in corpses and rejects ..... the ghost horse thing was just a crappy part..Don't go see this It will be in blockbuster in a couple of weeks...,Halloween II
504,smash_bandit,"I'd like to say, Rob zombie....",1,28 August 2009,"Thank you dearly for RUINING this series for me. Personally, in my eyes, the series should have gone Halloween 1, 2, and ended at H20 skipping 3, 4, 5, 6, and not making Resurrection. I've been huge on Halloween in all its entirety since i was about 13 years old. Absolutely love the plot, the theme, and most importantly the man in the mask. Zombie's re-make in 2007, though trashed upon, i actually enjoyed. It wasn't the best, nor was it better than the original (I M O), but i did like it, and was very excited about this new flick.for die hard Halloween fans, this movie is a puke pile. The first 10 or so minutes of the movie rocked! it got me psyched up. I loved the eerie blood soaked Laurie strode wielding a pistol walking down the street constantly muttering ""i killed him"". sets the mood beautifully...the hospital break in, Laurie hurdling down the stairs, i was in bliss! it was a nice shed of light reminder on a similar scene from the original Halloween 2. then, when Laurie wakes up...the movie goes to sleep. The rest is just a horrible train wreck of occasional slashing, constant images of Michael seeing his mother in white with a white horse and himself in child form...excuse me for sounding totally inconsiderate and politically incorrect...but that retarded Alice in wonderland bull-sh** made me so bored. every time you see his mother and his child form, it makes you roll your eyes and sigh. every scene with them is just confusing and UN-entertaining. they don't even act well...they just talk blandly. then, at the end? Laurie saying ""i love you brother"", killing him, then walking out of the shack with his mask on? are you joking? I guess what i'm saying is, Michael throughout this series on through fan clubs and through internet and etc. etc. has been noted as ""The shape"" because he's, as doctor Loomis had originally said, not human. This movie, made Michael turn into a cat killing homosexual mental case like Jeffery Dahmer, and totally ruined the aspect of Michael being an unstoppable killing machine set out to murder his family blood line. the whole point of the blank white mask with no image of his blank black eyes was because Michael was a mystery...and thats what was terrifying...not seeing a beat up over done cut up raggedy mask barely covering a normal guys face with long hair and grizzly beard which we even see a few times! this movie took the whole scare element out of the story, and turned it into a stupid LSD influenced fairy tale about a fu**ed up guy with a fu**ed up sister and nothing is accomplished...this movie wasn't even worth seeing for free, never mind the near 10 dollars i had to pay just to wish it was over with already.don't waste your time.we'll classify this one under the ""Miss"" category of rob zombie's flicks",Halloween II
505,charles-wilson-2,Pathetic - Straight to video would be too good for this flick.,1,28 August 2009,"Holy cow, I just got back from this movie and it's a total piece of crap. we almost walked out in the first 10 minutes but I thought, no, lets ride it out and see if it gets any better. I wish I had left and got my money back, because by the end I had felt completely ripped off. I've seen Rob Zombie's other movies and really liked them so I'm left wondering just what the hell happened here. It's as if no effort whatsoever was put into writing the screen play. I like gore but come on man, give us a little something else too. And as far as Angel goes - whiny is a little bit of an understatement. I kept hoping she would die just so she would finally shut up. Unfortunately that little bit of relief never did come along. Save your money.",Halloween II
506,wttstrange,This movie was a disgrace....,2,28 August 2009,"I am a huge Halloween fan, so I am not foreign to the series. I understand that Rob Zombie tried to create a whole different movie and not follow the original movies but really? ghosts? seriously...So right when the movie started I loved how it continued right on from the end of Rob Zombies first Holloween where laurie is walking down the street covered in blood with the 357 still in her hands, but what i loved about Rob Zombies first holloween is that there is a lot of criteria covered showing Myers life at the beginning, but this goes straight into killing with no motive.Even though it is a new movie not a remake I do believe that Dr. Loomis shouldn't have sold out, Loomis has always been the badass trying to hunt Myers down, now he is a sell out who dies in the end... there is no where to go with a sequel on this because it wont be Holloween without Loomis.But the number one thing that ruined this movie is the ghosts... seriously what the hell, Ghosts? this is a slasher film not a ghost film, keep casper out of this, throughout the whole movie his mom's ghost, and him as a kid ghost(by the way the kid taking Daeg Faerch was terrible, he was a terrible Micheal he no longer had the creepy kid ambiance) just keeps popping in and saying these terrible lines like ""were ready Micheal"", seriously rob zombie what were you thinking...So if you are as big of a Halloween fan as me don't see this movie.",Halloween II
507,tonychums,my god.... that is all i can say,1,29 August 2009,"This movie was complete trash. Michael Myers is suppose to be about a killer that stalks you.

508,xomari24,The Movie Was Crazy & I Loved It,8,29 August 2009,I don't know how you could have hated this movie. It was a lot better than the original sequel ! Its not a baby horror film -- Rob Zombie knows how to do it right.. it only made me jump about 4 times but man Michael is a beast and definitely the baddest killer (Freddy & Jason hold nothing to him) It was so gory and Michael Myers was scarier this time around.. probably because Rob Zombie made him huge in his remake and you can see that when people try to take him on. It was so gory and it all seemed so real (not that fake ketchup bullshit) The plot line could have been better since it was very basic.. i loved it and definitely will be buying it when it comes out on DVD,Halloween II
509,gwomble1,HorrorPorn has peaked!,1,29 August 2009,"Sometime back I craved new horror films. I grew up on them. I remember as a child fearing the old black and whites, Hammer Films, and then came Jason, Micheal, and Freddy. When Pinhead arrived I swore horror couldn't get any better (worse) than that. I was wrong.Everything is exponential. What can we do to 'lower' the bar a little further? Donahue to Morton Downey to Springer. Sex and gore until sex no more...and still pass the limits of decency, just grazing the end of an R rating. Sequels, Final Destinations, Hostels, then REDO's. Where we can no longer come up with original ideas we grasp the old ones and pervert them like the distant cousin that shames the family name. That was done to one of the classic Horror franchises and I will never think the same of it again.I was excited to see this movie. I was impressed with Zombies 'restraint' in the first REDO. I thought he had grown as a director. What I forgot is that he really isn't one...at heart. Not an artist, nor much else. He is a sensationalist who (like his band) has to push the limits with no creativity to get attention. I expect John Carpenter would not applaud this 'adaptation' either.Just as with other cult classics redone, we see the care to entertain taken out and the ability to exploit (in the name of artistic vision) added in its place. Halloween II lacked the vision, as did most others RESET to disgust me have lacked. When the gun to the baby while stealing from the teat in ""The Hills Have Eyes"" REDO made my thumb hit stop...I found my bounds. Now, forty-five minutes of visual and inaudible feces left me walking out of Halloween II. I wasn't shaking my head in confusion, that would have taken a noticeable plot. I was disgusted with what we've come to in this culture to try and get a thrill. When did everyone become normalized into so much reality-styled fodder that we can't be sure if this is a snuff film or entertainment? Is this what I have to look forward to? Is it going too far that this stuff seems to be normal in our culture in our media by way of news, TV, and Movies? They all report the same thing...the facts just get sorted through later.Last. Why does every franchise have a new pre-story that tried to explain why the killer wasn't so bad? ""Oh, he had an affliction so let's take it easy on him"". ""He had a tough childhood, so that explains it. Let's take pity on the poor little fella. I relate to him"". Maybe we'll do our part and finally mesh all media together where we have reality TV shows about the birth and life of serial killers. That would spell commercial success wouldn't it? I'll stick with the oldies at this point. I have never walked out of a movie before this.",Halloween II
510,burnstimothym,The bar has been raised with Halloween II,9,30 August 2009,"Rob Zombie has raised the bar for modern day horror movies with his most recent installment of Halloween II.The acting is surprisingly good throughout the film. Sheri Moon Zombie delivers possibly her best performance to date as the ghost of Deborah Myers. She is in a word, creepy, and is integrated into the film in a way that is not overpowering. Meanwhile cast members such as Scout Taylor-Compton and Brad Dourif, who are over the top at times, seemed natural on the screen and brought a fresh aspect to slasher film acting; good performances.Aside from the acting which was exceptionally well for the genre, Zombie takes a completely different approach with Michael Myers as a character. Zombie shows Michael as a grizzled mountain man, beard and all, and manages to make up for plot shortcomings in previous films; for example, where Myers is between Halloweens. Michael is brutal in this film; yet the film is not overtly gory. This was by far the most interesting portrayal of Michael Myers in the Halloween series.Possibly one of the most unique aspects of the latest Halloween movie is the cinematography that Zombie has brought to the film. For instance, one of the most breathtaking scenes in the movie is when Myers is moving through the woods. At one point a radiant white light appears to be shining through hundreds of trees which creates possibly the most beautiful scene in the film, at one of the tensest times in the film. Also, Zombie is able to utilize flashbacks and intense sounds to add to the tension in the tradition of classic thriller movies.If a fault could be found with Halloween II it would be that the interaction between Michael and Laurie could have been more drawn out towards the ending. That said, the spin put on the ending by Zombie was true to his form. As with his previous films, he has demonstrated his ability to paint broken, demented characters. This ability shines through in the finale of this movie, which again, provides a unique ending that makes this installment of the Halloween series one of the most entertaining.It should be noted that if you watch this film with the idea that you are about to see a tit for tat faithful remake, you will be disappointed. This film is a remake in name only. Rather, this film is all Rob Zombies. The characters, the settings, the dialogue and the outcome are all his. If you watch with an open mind, and take certain parts with a grain of salt (this is a horror film after all), you will not be disappointed.",Halloween II
511,d-rodriguez-2,Could Not Believe it,3,30 August 2009,"Could not believe that Rob Zombie made this movie! I was so appalled with what he did. First let me say that I am a HUGE Halloween fan! I have loved these movies since I was a kid. When I heard Rob Zombie was remaking the Halloween movies I was EXCITED the first was remarkable to me I loved everything he did with the firs one. So I was excited to go see the second one. First off he used another child to play the young Michael Myers, that first shocked me that he went and did something like that. He knew he was going to make the second one why didn't he just use Dane? Then he turned his mother into some kind of freak of the after life that seemed like she was always controlling Michael's moves. Then with the flash back scene's and the psychedelic Tripp flash's maybe, maybe once or twice would have been fine but to use them through out the movie was just insane. Then Michael's attacks were more brutal, which I'm not saying that's a bad thing but he was actually grunting when he was hitting people Michael never did that. Then he has Lori turned into some kind of rebellious whore who doesn't care about anything? I can see where she would be a little messed up but they make Annie out to be the angelic one when she was the bad one in the last movie. I actually wanted Lori to get whacked so I didn't have to keep hearing her yell and cry. What was it, was she being Michael? or what? Just all around weird, will I buy it to put into my Halloween collection? Yes, but I also bought part 4 to put in there as well. This movie may not see much light once it comes into my collection but I will have it. Maybe I have to watch it more than once to appreciate it or maybe I'll have to drop some mushrooms? Rob what did you do? say it ain't so!",Halloween II
512,MistAh_Horror,Rob Zombie's Halloween II...,8,31 August 2009,"So Rob Zombie completes his vision. While successfully doing so, it's easy to see his vision is far from perfect. He brought something new and different to the series while combining some of the key points from the franchise's past. A part of me wants to applaud him in having the balls to take what he was given and completely run with it, while another part of me wants to know what the hell he was thinking? The movie starts off with a new kid taking on the 'Myers at young' role as he shares a terribly acted scene with none other then yup, you guessed it, Rob's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie. And that right there is one of my many problems with this movie. Sheri Moon is highly unneeded as she adds nothing but atrocious dialog and horrendous wardrobe. Along with this terrible opening scene, we're treated with the definition of a white horse. Thank God for that. Don't know where I would have been without it.It actually picks up from there though, as we focus in on the aftermath from the remake. Scout Taylor Compton reprises her role as Laurie Strode and I was fairly impressed with how she handled this character after the events of the first movie. We get some nice shock scenes as we see her wheeled in to the hospital and get stitched up. The gruesome closeups and screams being yelped prepare the viewer for what they are about to endure for the next hour and a half. Now's your one chance to get out.So once we find out that pretty bad ass opening with Michael stalking the halls of the hospital and pulverizing nurses is just a dream, I gotta admit, I already seen it coming but it was a tad disappointing. Now we're back in real time, one year later, putting the focus on Laurie's 'new family' the Brackett's, both Sheriff (played by Brad Dourif) and daughter (played by the beautiful, sweet and talented Danielle Harris). This new combo of characters was actually one of the brighter points of the movie. They all fit well together and actually seemed quite realistic in their portrayals.As previously mentioned, everybody's character has changed since the events of the first. Some of these changes work extremely well, some of these changes fall flat on their face. One drastic change is the character of Dr. Loomis (Malcom McDowell returns) who seems to be almost useless throughout. What was the point in showing him in the way that Zombie did, just to add him to the body count. The way it happens is kind of ridiculous also, he just so happens to catch the final showdown on TV, so he drives down to the center of it and just walks right in during a hostel situation? Next we have the changes of Laurie and Annie. You can tell there were a lot of scenes cut as it's obvious something's brooding between them, but it's left more implied then brought out. Laurie is now the dysfunctional trauma victim and new favorite 'daughter' of the Sheriff's while Annie is forced in to the mother role of the family where she's left to take care of the other's and make sure the ship runs smoothly. Laurie's change is understandable yet sometimes overdone, Scout slips with her performance is the last portion of the film while Danielle seems to catch steam and only get stronger until her final demise, this time sadly, for good. Danielle Harris you will be missed, and your final moments on screen were some of the best in the series.The most impressive performance, in my opinion, aside from Danielle's, comes from Brad Dourif. He plays the father figure throughout while at the same time having the duty to watch over the town as complete chaos is spread throughout it. His reaction to Annie's death pretty much forces the hero role on him as you can't help but root for the guy. And after Annie's demise, he officially becomes the most likable character in the entire movie. I guess Zombie wasn't lying when he mentioned an unlikely hero a few months back. Nicely done.Finally we're given the showdown we want to see yet somewhat unexpected. Sheriff Brackett versus Michael Myers and unhostaged hostage Laurie Stride now also known as Angel Myers also known as Boo. It all happens kind of quick and is ultimately a bit of a let down. Loomis arrives, gets cut up and killed, Sheriff Brackett shoots Michael twice and Laurie stabs him, oh yeah, I forgot to mention, this all takes place in the shack that Michael has been occupying for the last year.Eventually Laurie comes walking out of this shack as the sole survivor while wearing Michael's mask?!?! Was she behind the madness all along or was she just a victim of it? Is she destined to carry on with the ruthlessness of her brother? Not sure. But what we do know is that with our final scene, she's locked up in what looks like some sort of institution while sharing the visions as Michael. After a quick smirk by Scout, we're left unsure where we go from here...only a matter of time before we find out.7.5/10 Danielle Harris, you've done this franchise along with the Horror genre proud. You Are Legend.",Halloween II
513,toroxpert,decent movie,3,1 September 2009,"it has been hyped up a lot more than it is! i watched it ONLINE at * halloween2.tk * It was one of the most brutally violent movies I've ever seen, and I enjoy horror movies. I enjoy the original Halloween so much because it was more psychological, and cerebral. It didn't need a ton of gore to be scary, but Rob Zombie's fetish for violence as well as blondes in all of his movies has taken it's toll on me. The amount of gore and brutality in this last movie I think was more than his first three films combined. Excessive is an understatement especially considering that this movie could've been just as scary if not scarier had he muted the blood a little, and not put that crap in with his wife, because the cinematography was fantastic and very creepy in my opinion. I haven't decidedyet if this was more scary or just flat out disgusting.",Halloween II
514,LittleOne0916,REALLY Disappointed,3,30 August 2009,"I totally agree with everyone so far...I loved Rob Zombies remake of the first one, it was the best remake of a horror classic I have seen so far and actually liked it better than the original, so I was really hyped up for this one...holy crap literally...it started off good and there were parts of it that captured the essence of his first one but the whole thing with having visions of his mother throughout the whole thing really took away from it I thought...a vision here and there fine but not through the whole thing it made it seem like he was coming back for Laurie because his mother was telling him to not because he was the terrifying psycho that he is, and it took away from her initial character I thought because his mother was the only one who loved him and treated him decently...as stated above there were a few scenes that did pay tribute to the first...almost like someone had a few great ideas, wrote them down and then filled huge gaps without putting a lot of thought into it...I expected a big showdown at the end like the first and did not get it, and exactly right the ending was stupid and I did have a WTF look on my face...def not worth paying 10 bucks to go see in the theater wait for it to come out on DVD if you really want to see it, VERY disappointed after the awesome job on the first...was expecting a lot more since this was the last one of these he was going to do...just sad and a letdown since his remake of the first was so good.",Halloween II

Also to the comments about having too much indecent exposure of women was just nonsense cause there was barely any and again this goes too, maybe stay away from rated R movies. I thought the move was definitely worth a watch and a must see if you are a fan of horror or Rob Zombie.

There isn't one thing i liked about this film. Looking at the rating so far hurts me. Only a 5.8? This need to be at least a 2 or lower. Come on! This film takes a crushing blow at the classic Halloween franchise. If you love the Halloween films and are looking for something more, then don't look any further.

I don't know if everyone in Hollywood has forgotten but Michael Myers did not die in Halloween 8 and the movie ended as if there was going to be a continuation, did Michaels eyes not open wide at the very end while in the morgue? What happened? A little food for thought. I love the entire Halloween franchise, with the exception of Halloween 3.

520,macf1,I appreciate the psychological aspect Rob Zombie put into this movie,5,2 September 2009,"So there seems to be things in this movie that leave you confused? True. There seems to be endless bloodshed and cursing? True. What is ironic about the whole concept of this movie? Its possible to create a serial killer in our bleak reality that we call life. We are surrounded by bloodshed in the news on a much larger scale, but we seem to be too busy with our ipods and video games and all the other bullshit that distracts us from getting to where it is our heart and mind are truly guiding us. But what if society created a real life ""Michael Myers"" that ran around America as a mass murderer? Yes, I know it all sounds ridiculous, but there's always that what if. What if someone was filled with a dark hate like no other. The hate that only comes from all the nurture that is instilled into a child at an early age. The crave for violence, the crave for bloodshed. Hell, you can even call them American soldiers if you like, but sometimes there's something more. Sometimes there's that sense of being pushed around and taking it as its dealt to you. (true, there are people that will mock this statement with ridicule and rebuttal, but whose to say that someone isn't already looking for them?) We live in a world where people can be pushed past their limits and still sustain a sense of well being as they continue to suppress their anger, and then guess what? SURPRISE!... and no ones laughing anymore. Rob Zombie took a handful of films based on on character and combined them into 2 nicely crafted films that broke down the psyche of what some mathematicians might call ""a variable"". The what if, if you will. Should we sympathize with the boy character who murdered his sister and countless others? not necessarily. Should we question why he did it or what drove him to repress such incredible amounts of anger? Maybe. What If it was your child? What if your child were experiencing the type of neglect and abuse you inflict on them, and you don't even realize it? What if we are creating this future breed of serial killers that only seek bloodshed and revenge? ....Chew on that. Schizophrenia is a hell of a thing. A brain disorder extrordinaire. If angel myers was that f***** up in her mind to resurrect the persona of her brother, whats to say that your average American human being couldn't do the same? Why is that so many people create these alternate worlds that they cant control after being pushed over the edge? we can not live in fear, and we can not live in hate, and the anger that we suppress only becomes darker. Did the first and second movie touch on areas that conservative/traditional Americans would find offensive and repulsive? sure, why not. People fear what they don't understand. The funny/scary thing is that there are many levels of schizophrenia. the question you already know the answer to is ""do you know someone who is schizophrenic or shows signs of schizophrenia?""",Halloween II
521,Daniel_Stine,"The Loss of ""The Shape""",3,4 September 2009,"Michael Myers is one of the most legendary killers in film history. John Carpenter gave him this status from the very first film, and each chapter following (all with ranging quality) added to his mythology. While ""Halloween: Season of the Witch"" ignores Michael all together, and ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" throws him into bizarre cult territory, one constant has always remained the same: The idea and the power behind ""The Shape."" Why was he credited as this in the first film? And have these new ""remakes"" forgotten what this character is all about? Rob Zombie speaks quite a bit about the mythology of Michael Myers, but seems to ignore what made this character so haunting and memorable in the first place.Michael Myers is a human, but more so he is the very representation of death. The Grim Reaper, so to speak. The blank expression of the mask is the faceless evil that everyone fears. Seeing him at the end of the street, in between the laundry blowing in the wind... this is the presence of evil, and not an evil that is always completely tangible (as he often vanishes without the characters taking their eyes off of him). His slow pursuit after his running victims is the patience of death. It's coming no matter what. Michael is a walking mystery. He is something that cannot be rationalized. You can almost put your finger on it, but you can't just say, ""Michael had a bad redneck childhood, hence the anger and motives... And now he's just really tall and thick, hence him being an unstoppable force of death."" This isn't what made him scary before, and it's not making him scary now. Doing this is not adding to or delving into this ""mythology"" that Rob Zombie refers to. Doing this is deleting the mythology completely, and putting him on the same level as your average (well, not quite...) serial killer. The reasoning in these new films behind Michael's madness destroys the idea of ""The Shape."" It gives him the all too human reasoning and psychopathic mindset that the original Halloween's knew better to leave alone. They hinted at it, they showed signs of it, but they never flat out broke down the character of Michael Myers as if he was in a shrink's office because they knew it would be a mistake. They knew that killing the mystery behind this character would kill the very character itself.I know Rob Zombie said he wanted to reinvent Halloween. I get it. This could be anyone's argument to why the new films are leaving behind the most important traces of the original character. But why? Why reinvent one of the most classic monsters in horror history? Because it was a dying franchise and it needed a reboot? Casino Royale still has James Bond. Batman Begins still had Batman. Texas Chainsaw Massacre still had Leatherface (again, quality varies). Rob Zombie's Halloweens, however, have just as much Michael Myers in them as Halloween III: Season of the Witch.I enjoy watching Michael in the new movies roam around in the mask with the creepy music and the kitchen knife and doing the occasional head tilt and blah blah blah. These little actions suggest to fans that they are watching the Michael they remember, but they are hollow inclusions upon closer examination. This is not an anti Rob Zombie review. There is much to be applauded about the films aesthetics and so on. There were some strong moments and genuine scares. Brad Dourif did a great job. I just hate seeing such an important film icon stripped down and left behind. Why not just make a new serial killer franchise with a giant, angrily grunting redneck who hangs out with phantom horses? Just don't call it Halloween anymore. But who am I kidding? I'll be there for the third one. Maybe I'm a masochist. 3/10",Halloween II

It was a complete waste of $9.The story does not flow what so ever. A lot of the scenes don't make sense together. Strip club, random field. What the heck? The F word is repeated tons of times in the film. It got to be quite irritating.My advice to you: see something else.",Halloween II
523,lynx-52,it was chewed up and crapped out by a white horse,1,4 September 2009,"Just saw this movie last night and I'm sorry to say that I dropped a dime and a moment on this p.o.s. film. NO SUSPENSE WHATSOEVER. HORRIBLY predictable. And produced by the weinsteins, who are just as guilty of making this poo,The character of Laurie 'Angel' is unlikable, no thanks to zombie and his horrible writing; the techniques are worse than a 1st year film student, and worse of all the only scary thing about this film is that zombie is allowed to continue writing and directing. So cliché after cliché: film opens with a 'grudge like' definition supposedly explaining Michael's 'drive.' And to keep enforcing this 'drive' we're treated to shots of the moody blues singing 'knights in white satin' while zombie's lame wife walks around like Gandalf the great, leading her stupid white horse. Backlit shots are SO horribly overdone in horror movies and it feels like Zombie has NEVER made a movie in his life, considering how unoriginal his shots are. The lighting and set decorations are disgustingly boring, as though it's making up for the lack of 'shock' that this movie has. Why would anyone living through something so brutal have a picture of charles manson, above her bed; as well as a pentagram with 666 in the bathroom? Oh, foreshadowing...hmm but nobody in her family seems to think it strange? This is Zombie's signature. Naked breasts, no suspense whatsoever, 60's hair and makeup, and the glorification of murder. Myers grunts and stabs with sickening pounding sound because the foley artist had to do something to makeup for this bile. What really makes this movie SUCK so bad is that Zombie tries to give Michael motivation for his evilness. What happened to the unspeakable unknown? Oh yah it was chewed up and crapped out by a white horse.",Halloween II

It just felt like I was being played. there were so many modern electronics, if this was supposed to happen in 1979, the year after the first attack in 1978. Loomis watching a Plasma flat screen in the hotel, the modern vehicles, and cell phones, just to name a few. Its like no one took the time to make it authentic. I know they have the money to hire someone to check this stuff out. Rob, we ain't that dumb!

Surely he should cut down the ""F"" word but other than that, if you watch closely on the main characters, you would understand what his purpose was. He focused more on Laurie's character as if she might be following the same path as Michael's. Maybe Laurie can be quite whiny and annoying but in the same sense, she's still a kid! If you have this kind of trauma when your at that age in real life, how would you react? HELLO! I know it's just a movie but I believe that Zombie is trying to make characters more realistic. I hope he makes a 3rd Halloween.",Halloween II

I was looking forward to seeing it since I have sen every Halloween movie made. I very disappointed with the movie though. I was expecting the Micael Myers that walks slow but somehow catches up to his victims, I was expecting him to murder by using his knife, to wear his mask...instead he walks at a normal pace, kills many different ways, and he doesn't always wear his mask. The movie was mainly blood and guts, it was a gore movie not a horror movie!! Although, I found the ending quite funny when Lori walks out of the shack with the mask on(my friend and I were cracking up, I was crying I was laughing so hard!!) This movie is not for people who like the original Michael Myers and who do not like blood and guts. I am mad that I wasted my money to see this movie!!",Halloween II

He needs to stop making movies and let ""real"" people who know what horror is do them.. I have never made a movie in my life, and I know I could've done it better than this piece of crap. They should use this in film schools as what NOT to do when making a horror film... The man has no talent, and he has ruined this legendary franchise for the younger audience that haven't seen the REAL Halloweens. A message to you Rob, STOP please. It's not bad enough you subject us to your less than mediocre music, and you've brought the same to your movies. You do not know what horror is, but I will say your not the only one. If you want to see this movie, do yourself a favor and rent the originals. If your a Zombie fan, well then I just feel sorry for you all together.

I believe that this was a great movie in the theatre and i was hoping that they wouldn't mess with the ending like they did. Things are different Micheal kills loomis, and when he unmasks he kills loomis and tells loomis to (die), they shoot Micheal down, Laurie walks out of the shed she walks toward the cops surrounding the place, and she sees loomis lying on the ground with a machete stabbed in him, she then picks it up, and it seems like she was walking towards the cops with the machete in her hand and they shoot her down, with perfect alignment all three: loomis, Micheal, and Laurie are all lying on the ground ""dead"".

I love horror movies even the stupid ones I will watch over and over again...I also love Rob Zombie and the 1st Halloween he did, but this is one of the worse films I have ever seen, literally. i have nothing good to say about this movie. First of all i thought Dr Loomis died in the first one, he got his eyes poked at by Meyers but I guess not? The acting was bad, the storyline was bad, the writing was bad. MM stabbed his victims for at least a minute...its like 'alright thats enough go kill the next person.' I know everyone has their own opinions but if you thought this movie was the least bit good then you don't know what a good movie is or a good horror movie at that... you failed me Rob Zombie, you failed me! and i want my 10 dollars back...I'm serious! ha-ha",Halloween II

''My opinion seeing is to know'' I however enjoyed Mr. Rob Zombie's H2, It different, plus i like what he did with the Characters and the way he directs each scene. The Actors/ Actresses all did a great job for the Movie. of course the remaining Cast from Halloween (2007) returns. Rob Zombie is definitely up there with Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth, Wes Craven, Robert Rodriguez. I hope when H2 hits DVD shelves they'll be some bloopers and extras, deleted scenes / alternate endings.The Local Theaters / Cinemas really need to Keep H2 out on the Big Screen Longer and show it at all towns / City instead of Just Selected theaters.",Halloween II
532,Michaelantern,A new low point for the franchise...move over Resurrection!,1,5 December 2009,"I WANTED to like this movie, I REALLY did.Many people (in particular long time fans of the franchise) didn't like RZ's Halloween 2007. Even though I too am a long time fan of the series I found the first Rob Zombie effort to be good. Albeit not as good as the original and with an obvious overuse of ""trailer-trash-isms"", Halloween 2007 wasn't half bad.I definitely liked liked it better than Resurrection (which featured Michael going kung-fu with a rapper) and found it superior to the poor entry which was Halloween 5. It also gave Halloween 6 a run for the money so all in all Halloween 2007 gave me new hope for the series! Therefore I was more than willing to give Halloween II a chance.Then I started seeing the rumors pop up. Leaked info about the movie started appearing everywhere; Michael seeing a ""ghost-horse"", hallucinations of his ghost mommy and visions of himself as a child, Myers dressed up as a hobo with half his face exposed.Tell me it isn't so!!! It CAN'T be! No one could write something this stupid...right? Wrong! It was so and someone COULD write something this stupid...that someone was Rob Zombie.In the first effort, Zombie was only allowed to add a slight backstory to the original Halloween and to make some minor changes here and there. That's why the first movie was decent, Rob Zomibe had LITTLE creative control.In Halloween II Zombie was allowed to do what he wanted to with the story, he was allowed to make it his own. What a mistake.Instead of a decent follow up to the 2007 movie we instead got what could be described as an acid-trip trying to mimic a good story.This didn't even feel like a Halloween movie. Had you not seen a somewhat recognizeable white mask and a few Halloween franchise names thrown in then you would never have guessed this was Halloween.Dr Loomis becomes a total jerk, Laurie is a psychopath and Michael looks like a homeless suffering from drug induced hallucinations.This is not only the lowest point of the franchise but easily one of the poorest horror movies I have EVER seen...and there have been plenty of them over the years!The only redeeming thing I can say about Halloween II is that the next installment will be sans Zombie!",Halloween II

This movie is truly horrible. I am sorry to say that Rob Zombie is a horrible screen play writer and director. The one thing he is good at, if he is actually selecting the cast, is casting. The actors in all of his films to date are fantastic and should be sought after for future roles in horror, however, Rob Zombie's involvement after cast selection should be nothing. I really have nothing to say about this film that the viewers do not already realize (given the 5/10 rating). I truly hope that he does not write/direct any more horror films but instead, is consulting on the casting. His first Halloween remake was OK and the sequel could have been great, but it was a horrible follow up. I believe that Eli Roth directing and writing and Zombie selecting the cast would be a GREAT recipe for a horror movie.",Halloween II
534,lljmac4,You Call This a Remake?!,6,15 December 2009,"Rob Zombie, known as the King of Slasher Films, has released his latest film Halloween II to mixed reviews. Halloween II is a remake of the original 1981 Halloween II which is the story of Michael Myers, an escaped lunatic who wants to ""bring his sister home"". In other words, he wants to kill her and everyone who stands in his way. The movie starts out with Laurie Strode in the hospital from being attacked by Michael Myers which continues Rob Zombie's Halloween I plot. This is not exactly a remake of Halloween II because the only thing it has in common with that film are a couple of the same characters, but the overall plot is very different and it is more of a horror movie and the original was a more suspenseful slasher film. Halloween II is definitely not as good as Halloween II (1981) or a more recent movie of the same genre, Saw VI.You might as well call this HOLLOW-EEN. This movie had nothing compared to Halloween II (1981). These two movies really didn't have much in common but they did have two similar characters: Dr. Sam Loomis and Sheriff Leigh Bracket. These characters played different roles in how the movie moved along. In the newest Halloween II, Dr. Sam Loomis is a famous author after he wrote about what happened in the first Halloween. Sheriff Leigh Brackett kept Laurie Strode as her guardian in the movie. In the old Halloween Dr. Sam Loomis was trying to find Michael to stop from getting Laurie Strode who knew Michael was out there but he had to wait till Halloween to even catch a glimpse at Michael. Sheriff Leigh Brackett really didn't play a big role in the original Halloween II. He was always trying to keep Dr. Sam Loomis from scaring people in town when he said Michael was back. He did not believe Michael was back. He thought the man was just crazy and you shouldn't listen to him. Now when they would change now characters it would change the whole movie. Brackett character really reduces the suspense. Because when you're somebody like me you like suspense slash horror movies. Another change that decreases the suspense in the new Halloween is that Laurie Strode knows nothing of Michael she just thinks he a psycho maniac act. You want the person to always be on the lookout because they know someone is after them but they have enough protection and nothing is ever going to happen to them. I don't want to see a movie where the person doesn't know that any body is looking for them until somebody tells them in a book... So irrelevant like them to know why there friends are being killed because someone is coming for them. You should know and be careful have someone to help, not just be about town getting attacked and you don't know why. The killings! The method of the killings or the orders of the killings are always the same. The predictable order of the killings also contributes to low level of suspense First you have the wild one, the one who doesn't care about them then by surprise when she is with somebody and they both die and your friends don't even think twice why you're not leaving with them. Then you have your innocent friends who get slashed trying to help you get away. You try to help but you can't and they die and you go on and try to get away so after your friends die some kind protect person of law steps into the mix to help you and now they die. So then you've got the whole cavalry to help you now. When they have should been there too begin with. Then Michael would have picked them off one by one until he got what he wanted. In doing so you would hear the sound of Michaels' blow every time he stabbed someone leaving a puddle of blood behind, but that didn't happen. The technology in these new movies is so good. The sounds that you hear are wonderful. You can hear the bone crushing, skull breaking and blood squirting out as Michael kills his victims with every blow to the body. In the movie making ruckus outside and a man from the gentleman's club was outside. Then walked up to Michael and was like what do you want Michael didn't answer so the man punched Michael in the face nothing happen to Michael with the blow to head besides the man hurting himself. Michael retaliated by punching him to the ground with blood gushing from his mouth and nose. Then Michael started to stomp his face in gravel in doing so you heard the cracking of his skull, when Michael was finished the man lying on the ground with his face dismantled with huge craters from where Michael stomp his brains out. Now that's a wonderful seen it shows you a little of everything from sound effects and graphics.The Halloween franchise will always keep you interested. You will always want to see the sequel even though the movie didn't live up to its potential and especially because of the way they ended the movie with Laurie Strode killing Michael and walking out with his mask and putting here in a insane asylum. In all means saw has a better movie know because of the cat and mouse games they play when jigsaw is testing them. Until the Halloween creators add more suspense and well thought out plots and maybe they can reclaim their throne as the best film in there genre.",Halloween II

Also, where the hell is Daeg Faerch (the boy who played young Michael Myers in the 2007 version)????? I expected this movie to be even better than Rob Zombie's first Halloween!!! Such a HUGE disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!! Scout Taylor-Compton (the girl who plays Laurie) is a horrible, loud, high pitched, squeaky actress!!! She just irritates the hell out of me!!! Same with Sherri Moon!!! She just wanted a bigger part this time!!! OOOOPS!!! Bad idea!!!It all makes me want to watch all the original Halloween movies, more than I already do!!! Rob Zombie should just stick to his music career and stop his fruitless attempts at becoming a ""director""!!!!No offense to Chase Wright Vanek, but he is NOT who I wanted to see playing young Michael Myers,( I HATE it when a sequel to a movie is made, and there are different actors for the same characters!!!)And What is up with the ghosts??? This movie turned more into a horrible wanna be Sci-fi flick and less of a sequel to the well done remake of the first Halloween HORROR movie!!! My guess is that anyone else who has witnessed this disaster, they call a movie, would like a refund!!!! I Don't blame you, I agree!!! My excitement to see this movie quickly turned into disgust as I came to realize that it is all just one big ugly storm of horrible acting, swearing, murder, and poor lighting!!

536,mmariano477,Hallowwen 2...Rob Zombie's Long Strange Disappointing Trip,1,12 January 2010,"I really don't know where to begin...I liked how the story picked up where it left off from Rob's first Halloween remake. We see the bewildered and blood-covered heroine still holding onto the gun that she shot Michael with. Then the next scenes of Michael stalking Laurie through the hospital had promise. The characters and plot began to take shape. It was tension was mounting...then the whole movie unraveled and became a bloody mess...First off the acting was bad. Scout Taylor Compton as the grungy, foul-mouthed, I'm full-of-angst but you should 'pity-me' Strode was sooooooooo annoying that I wanted Meyers to find her and put her out of her misery (and mine.) The lure of Jamie Lee Curtis's Strode in the original films was that a horrible thing was happening to a sweet, slightly socially awkward, average teen girl.Then there was Meyers himself. A large, grungy, dirty, bearded guy in a hooded cloak who only wears the mask now and then. Horrifying-I know. Where was the Michael who was ""pure evil"" with the ""darkest eyes"" as Donald Pleasence once stated in the original? The point of the mask in the original films was that it was so simple-it was creepy. The way John Carpenter's masked Meyers cocked his head to the side slightly and they way moved was eerily calculated.Zombie's Meyer's character, however, played a back seat to the unnecessary images of his dead mother (played by Sherri Moon) and her white horse. While I understand where Rob was trying to go with this storyline, it just didn't gel and appeared only to highlight his wife's bad acting.Then there was Dr. Loomis-who completely sold out in this film and was even more unlikeable then Scout Taylor Compton.The only redeeming character was brad Dourif as Sheriff Lee Brackett. He was the only likable and believable character in this film-besides the white horse.The pacing of this film was completely off and the plot was so spotty that at times I wasn't sure if I was watching a really poorly-made horror film or one of Rob Zombie's music videos.We get it Rob-horror films should obviously be full of massacre cliché's taken from other films/directors, naked chicks, dirty looking old-men, teen angst, rock concerts with blurry camera shots to make us feel as if we're drugged, Weird Al, and ""f"" bombs said by all.What a disappointment. Luckily I was able to burn this film online for free. The DVD now makes for a great coaster on my coffee table.",Halloween II

His remake of the 1st one I thought was brilliant, but this remake of the 2nd one ""BLOWS CHUNKS""! The only good thing about the remake of Halloween 2 was the acting of Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett and Danielle Harris as Annie Brackett which in the original Annie Brackett was dead in the first movie, (I did however think it was brilliant that he used her in both of these remakes as she did such a great job in Halloween 4 and 5 as a young girl)! I also HATE what Rob Zombie did to the character of Dr. Loomis! Donald Pleasence would be severely P.O.'ed as I am if he were still alive I bet....

The first one was OK cause it was a little like the first i thought it just had a lot more detail thats what i thought this one was going to be about a longer and more detailed version of the original second one but it was not.

539,dec-666,Loved Every Secend Of It,6,9 February 2010,"I know this film has had a lot of bad reviews but I loved it. The music for a start I thought was great. It reminded me of the original Friday The 13th. It thought it was gory and some scenes did make me cringe. Most of all it ain't' much of a horror if it doesn't scare you the slightest bit but in this case it did. There were a few scenes that shocked me and me jump but I thought it was great. The part when Michael eats the dog shows how he has been living over the years. It does show his face but thats just because he isn't' going to keep a mask on for 2 years. One of the things I love most about this film is the realism, of course Laurie is going to go a little bit mental after all she's been through. The size of Michael Myers in this film as well, if he was 6 feet tall someone could knock him down quite easily, but it makes it more real that people cant knock him down because he is that size. The grunt of Michael is another thing, it now shows that he is angry. I did find the white horse thing a little strange but horrors can be strange and its supposed to be inside Michael's mind. I am a huge fan of Rob Zombie's work and look forward to seeing his stuff in the future.",Halloween II
540,burka-charles,Haloween II - 2009?,1,13 February 2010,I recommend everyone avoid this movie at all costs. This movie barely follows the story line set out in the original Haloween movies. It's a shame the writers could not find any other words that don't start with f and end in k. That word was 1/2 the dialog throughout the entire film. This should not be one of the Haloween movies. It was a disgrace. I would not recommend this movie. I regret paying the cost of renting it and I will watch for anything else that these writers come out with and avoid them at all costs. I did not even bother to sit through the entire movie. One hour of the disgraceful language was way more than I even should have listened to.,Halloween II
541,piet-baird,Undecided,4,14 February 2010,"It would be easy to write a review just slating this adaptation (this is no remake of the original) of Halloween 2. To enjoy this film you need to forget what you know of the John Carpenter originals, this is a unique rehash loosely based on the storyline in the original Halloween 2 and, further more has lost most if not all of the suspense and essence of the John Carpenter films. In Carpenters films, Michael Myers is a silent predator lurking, hidden in the shadows, there is no such finesse about the new Michael Myers who has also taken to grunting as he brutally thumps his kitchen knife into his victims. Dr Loomis in the old world was a dark, tortured character, an unlikely hero. In these remakes he has become a comical, bumbling, PG Tips supping, English buffoon who stumbles from one disaster to the next, nobodies hero. Laurie Strode has been developed from the likable girl next door portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis to an irritating, squeaky, ""geekoid"" that, quite frankly, I'd be quite happy to see Myers knock off. The Rob Zombie adaptations have split my household in terms of opinion. My fiancée hates them, I think they are okay films in their own right, but you do need to set aside what you know of the story and the characters from the originals and just accept these films on their own merit. I am also very biased as I have a great affinity for the Halloween franchise and their films I had read some really awful reviews before I saw the film, but I really enjoyed the first 15 minutes of this film as Michael pursues Laurie in the Hospital but I think the film loses it way after this point. It also appears that Sheri Moons Zombies' auditions for Cruella De Ville in a 101 Dalmations remake have accidentally made their way into the final edit. On far too many occasions she appears tugging a disgruntled, white horse behind her. Why .... no I know why, but it doesn't work too well in the film for my money. In my opinion, a Horror Classic has been readapted into a bog standard Teen Slasher Movie. Borrow a copy and make your own mind up, if you watch it with no expectations you may be pleasantly surprised, if you hang the expectation of it living up to the original versions I think you may be disappointed.",Halloween II
542,ace-509,Possibly best ever!,10,14 February 2010,"Ibanez has absolutely no idea of what he has seen, this is one of the best horror/slasher films you will see.Forget the original template, this is totally up to date with the uncaring, vicious, nasty zeitgeist of the 21st century. Forget the piano music, this shows the pure, totally single minded, completely insane evil that Michael Myers has become, sitting in a remote barn eating dogs and roadkill, waiting for his diseased mind to trigger him once again. I love the way Rob Zombie fills his movies with character actors such as Brad Douriff, even if it's just a brief appearance. Michael is not walking around in freshly laundered overalls, you can smell his corrupt soul just looking at him on the screen. The fact that Laurie is in a living nightmare from the monstrous trauma she has been through and not just occasionally waking up in a mild sweat. Zombie has took one of the best horror films ever and brought it completely up to date, the sheer brutality of the murders can be seen everyday on Nothing Toxic, etc. so anything less would be unacceptable, the clue is in the genre, 'Horror' Who gives a damn if there were only 15 or 16 people in the theatre, hopefully they enjoyed the film for what it was!",Halloween II

But this, this was awful. I never thought a scary movie would put me to sleep but this one literally did. There was no suspense whatsoever, just unnecessary gore. This was the worst remake I've EVER SEEN. There were about three f-words in one sentence... And ummm hello?! The average person does not talk like that, so why put it in a movie? It was annoying and horrible. Sex scenes do not change the movie, they don't make them any better, so why were there 2 or 3?! It was completely uncalled for. In the others, I wanted Lorie to live, but in this, I wanted her to die. She seemed like just some crack-head that wanted to live. whoop, she's not worth anything. I wasn't scared even once. I have no idea why the ""white horse"" was there. I was left confused and angry about how much of a let down it was. i never want to see a Rob Zombie movie ever again.

For years I have been an avid fan of the original Carpenter film and was very excited to see his vision on what the series should be, but after sitting through this epic, blood-soaked, F bomb dropping failure, I must say I was sorely unsatisfied. I would rather sit through an hour and a half of Jackie Earle Haley's horrid performance of Freddy Kruger than have to watch this again. Please mama, don't make me. I promise I will be a good little boy.Although I must admit, that I enjoyed the first 20 or so minutes of the film. At least up until Laurie wakes up from her dream. Every secondafterward was pure torture to the highest degree.

546,lucaskern8,Creepy as hell,7,9 January 2011,"Okay, first lemme say that this movie creep-ed me right the heck out. It is extremely disturbing to watch and even had me looking away at some points, which I never do. The best part about this is definitely the atmosphere it creates, the lighting is perfect and the sets are outstanding for a Halloween movie, whenever I watch it it really really reminds me of Halloween night. As far As acting and dialog goes it's not awesome it it's not something that will take you away from the experience. The storyline is one of the lows of the movie because halfway through it gets sic-fie and Michael myers suddenly has transportation and ninja powers. Now, I know the filmmakers were just trying to make it seem like he was so really fast and sneaky but it just comes out silly. Another thing that I did not like is the scenes with myers mom and him as a kid, they are a sad attempt at something a movie like this could never pull off. The gore is very realistic and in your face, the part where I had to look away was when Lorie came home and found Annie in the bathroom, even though it wasn't gore it was hard to watch because blood was everywhere and she was lying naked on the floor, I could not stop thinking about what the he'll he did to her. Props to the filmmakers for making it so believable. Tons of nudity but isn't bad. Mostly out of focus boobs and in the background shots. Out of ten I would probably give this a 7.5 manly because of how well they capture Halloween as a scary holiday with lighting and good song/ costume/ set choices. *** side note I am watching the movie while writing this***and also no one is going to read this probably. Whatever, night. W",Halloween II
547,IrishMcIrish,The Only Thing Scary About This Movie is How BAD It Was!,3,28 June 2010,"The only thing tougher than writing this review was sitting through the movie. The theater I saw it in will probably have to fumigate to relieve the stench from this movie! I'll start with the good since this won't take that long. Rob Zombie wastes no time getting things going. The movie has enough blood and guts to make most horror movie fanatics tingle with delight. The grainy feel gives it that old cult-classic horror movie feel. The death scenes are beyond brutal and truly fits in with the feel of the movie.Now the bad. Rob Zombie although very gifted at delivering gut wrenching grotesque scenes of horror can't create a full story. The characters as usual are under-developed and transparent, the acting was down right atrocious. His wife could be the worst and most annoying actress of her time and should be banned from any further movies FOREVER! The dialogue is beyond forced and written just for shock value. More than half the time it's laughable what's being said in conversations.I understand that Rob Zombie said that he was going to make this into his own story and tell it his way but is it at all possible for him to do one script where everyone isn't some form of dirty bumbling lower class hillbilly? The audience is left not being able to relate to any of the characters and thus making the movie 100% ineffective. Rob Zombie seems to just do away with any scenes that add depth and build the characters and just replaced them with cheap graphic scenes filled with horrible dialogue. In a way I envied the characters knowing inevitably they would luckily be brutally murdered while I was left to miserably sit through the remainder of the abomination that was this film. The story line is choppy and badly told, Rob Zombie makes Dr. Seuss look like the Cohen Brothers. I don't for the life of me know why studios continue to dish out millions of dollars to hack directors in these hard economic times.I can honestly say the only bigger waste of time than watching this film was probably the making of it. Please give up Mr. Zombie or at least reimburse me the 2 hours of my life I wasted on this film.It's safe to say I've painfully learned my lesson and any script or movie that has passed through Rob Zombie hands won't be watched by this viewed ever again.",Halloween II
548,vandalwolf,Not a rehash,10,10 July 2013,"These movies are not a rehash of the same old Halloween formula used for 30 years, which is a good thing, and further more their not remakes per say for they use a lot of completely different plot devices. People get pissy when you step on hollowed ground, but what makes a movie homage(not a remake) great is taking the original idea and making it your own. Same can be said for cover songs, why remake the original if you want that go listen to it specifically, no it should be something totally out there and different - in the realm of you either hate it or love it. In no way would I go into this movie thinking hospital night revisited - if I wanted that I'd watch the original, which is great movie but...so is this totally different reuse of some original characters. Absolutely love Scout in this movie, and the whole mess that became her life; movies reflect the time in place they are made H2 was at a time when a very strong heroine was needed, this movie comes at a time when we all feel like our sanity is tittering on the edge of a knife.",Halloween II
549,Zosio,"Blood, Guts & Boobs.",4,9 September 2010,"The movie goes back and forth, more times than necessary or even wanted; going from highly entertaining blood-gushing fun, to a pointless, shallow attempt at an actual plot.Rob Zombie's vision was to 'recreate' the image of Michael Myers, and while he has somewhat of a grasp of how to go about it; his execution was nothing but lacking. Far too repetitious and in-your-face for an actual in-depth & smart backdrop. These parts of the movies will probably make you want to cry with it's pointless, BORING drama.The bottom line, you get what you'd expect from a Halloween movie, and that's killing, killing, and more killing (with a dash of nude women). As long as you're willing to sit through the choppy attempts at any acclaim outside horror enthusiasts, and a dissatisfying ending, you will be satisfied. All in all, it's recommended to horror fans, though casualties will find it a bit cliché and distasteful.",Halloween II
550,hsororityproof,My Favorite Horror Film,10,2 December 2011,"Rob Zombie's Halloween II is no doubt, the best horror film I've ever seen. I've been in love with it, since August 31st, 2009. I've seen the film, three other times at the cinema and it was incredible. I was a huge fan of the first film and I loved House of 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects is one of my favorites.I know, many people bash this film and honestly, this film deserves more credit and recognition. For being a big fan of the franchise (It is my favorite horror franchise), I say Rob Zombie's version surpassed the franchise. It's my opinion, and I know the haters will gut me for it, but I don't care. H2 is a masterpiece.The theatrical cut is amazing and the director's cut is even better. I love the scenes Zombie originally wanted for the film and his commentary is engaging and great. Yes, both cuts of the film are very different. I prefer the director's cut, because it's Rob's complete finish to his first film.The story is awesome. I love the White Horse concept and that we get inside the mind of Michael and Angel Myers. It was great to see Sheri again and I didn't mind the replacement of Daeg for young Michael.The performances are fantastic, as always in every Zombie film. The cast is fabulous and you feel sympathy for some of the characters and some, you don't. Scout Taylor-Compton was amazing as well as Danielle Harris, along with Tyler Mane and Brad Dourif. I loved the cameos, too.Rob Zombie's direction and style is gorgeous. I love the dream sequences, the intensity in the brutal violence, the photography is fabulous and overall, he hit it hard with passion.The visuals, of course, are incredible. As well as the score from Tyler Bates, which was AMAZING. One of my top favorite score soundtracks, period.All in all, the haters can disagree with me all they want, but I say what I want to say and I say, this is the best damn horror movie I've seen. Thank you, Rob Zombie for creating this sequel to your first film, which is my favorite horror re-imagining to my favorite horror franchise to my favorite horror icon. 10/10!",Halloween II
551,deadpoolismylover,Absolutely Terrible!,3,21 September 2012,"This movie is a roller coaster ride. While some people love roller coasters, I personally hate them. This movie is god awful! Almost everything about this movie is just... awful. The acting is terrible, the story is convoluted, and it is just down right disturbing to watch (but not for the right reasons).First off, the acting in this movie is god awful! There is not a single good performance in this movie! Malcolm McDowell is good in almost everything, but in this movie he is horrible. He's a jerk to everybody, which could have been done well, but it wasn't. Everything he says is over the top, and Rob Zombie (the director) tries to make us feel for this guy! Sorry Mr. Zombie, but with a performance like this, that's not gonna' happen. Scout Taylor Compton is pretty awful as well. She just keeps saying ""f*ck"". They say ""f*ck"" so many times in this movie you'll never want to hear the word again. All she does is whine and whine and whine. While I guess this sort of situation calls for whining (her parents were murdered by her brother, Michael Myers), but she never shuts up! Everyone else in the movie is sub-par. Generic horror movie acting. Oh, I forgot one person, Tyler Mane. Oh my God, this is the single worst representation of Michael Myers I've ever seen. While this isn't his fault, it still doesn't mean that it wasn't a bad performance. Michael Myers makes grunting noises when he is running (that's right, running) after his victims. When he is stabbing his victims he makes grunting noises as well. The acting in this movie is terrible.The story in this movie is just confusing. It tries to make a simple plot complicated by adding extremely stupid dream sequences. Since his mom is dead, Michael keeps seeing his mother come back from the dead in really stupid dream sequences. Sheri Moon Zombie, who plays Michael's mom, is wearing a long white dress with a white dress by her side. Who the f*ck came up with that? Oh yeah, that's right, Rob Zombie. Why did he think dream sequences were a good idea? Is he twelve or something? There are also all of these really boring characters that they try to make ""spunky"" and ""hip"" for modern audiences.The whole story is Laurie is now crazy and she finds out that Michael is her brother. That's the only story to this whole movie. Everything else is just filler and people for Michael to kill. Oh, and Dr. Loomis is rich now.The absolute worst part of this move, worse than the acting, worse than the story/writing, is the fact of how disturbing this movie is. For me, I love cringe worthy films, that's why I love Rob Zombie. But this movie is disturbing for all the wrong reasons. This movie is disturbing because of how far it strays from all of the other Halloween movies. It just disturbs me how someone so smart would let something like this happen. It's disturbing because of how different it is.This movie is a cake. It has different layers of awful. There is icing on the cake. The icing is all of the pointless dialogue and characters that nobody cares about. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that some of the kills are cool, but since Michael grunts it takes away from the kills. This is not only the worst Rob Zombie movie, it is also the worst Halloween movie. Worse Halloween 3, worse than Halloween 6, and yes, it's even worse than Halloween Resurrection. This movie sucks.",Halloween II

553,listentothemonkey,"True horror people, don't believe these reviews",9,3 September 2009,"I have no idea why people hate this movie so much. I'm not even the biggest Rob Zombie or Halloween fan, I enjoy both for what they are. I was not expecting this insane homage to the Italian slasher movie on crack. Barely ten minutes go by where someone isn't horribly mutilated and, well, that's how it should be. This movie references Bava, Argento, even lesser known movies of the Italian genre like ""Pieces"" and ""Don't Look in the Basement."" It's dirty, it's grimy, the camera is able to show you the most disgusting cringe worthy images imaginable and then just when you do really want to see more, shadows and darkness keep your eyes from it. Zombie truly wants to give America a true slasher movie. I think his true aim is to say, ""I'm sorry America, if you thought Halloween was a slasher movie, here's what a real slasher movie is!"" And a lot of people can't handle that. Sorry that America gets a watered down diluted thriller movie and calls it a slasher movie like Starbucks does to coffee. This is not to say that the first Halloween was bad but it was a suspense movie holding to the typical American structure. Intro, plot, huge climax. It's good, but it's misleading and safe. This Halloween is a horror movie, more specifically a slasher movie. And thank God it's here, it's time for America to join in on what Japan, Korea, and Italy have enjoyed for so long. Violence with a point! During the killings, there is such a rage of anger, Myers brutally beats and pummels his victims. It's just such frustration at such a disgusting society. The stripclub scene perfectly reflects this, these are the people that have been using and mocking Michael and his mother their whole lives. This town, as disgusting as it is in its hidden socially accepted ways, have made Michael and his mother feel like the freaks. Now their rage is unleashed. As for the dialogue that all of these wonderful writers have been criticizing: it's wonderful!!! It's witty, smart and referential. It'd be even dumber if these characters started waxing philosophically and analyzing their lives. Yeah, the whole movie is about how disgusting society is, a lot of their dialogue is going to represent that. Anyone catch onto the vegetarian discussion right before the dog eating scene, or the great starvin marvin question and how it's placed? Not to even mention how Zombie brilliantly contrasts the Loomis scenes with the violence and the gore and how the media uses it and de-humanizes it. Zombie is only commenting on what society does every day. This isn't great art, he is taking a genre (Italian 70's horror slashers) and making a comment with them... much like another director we all know that also has a movie in the top 3 this week. If Quentin Tarantino had done something like this people would be eating it up! Zombie is doing something very similar that Tarantino is doing with ""Inglorious Basterds"" but in my opinion (apparently not a popular one), Zombie is much more restrained and focused.Zombie's vision of ""Halloween"" is more on par with the ""Kill Bill"" movies. He knows what he wants. It may not be what you want, but, oh well, guess you can go make your own movie.",Halloween II
554,mliverpoolfc,Awful,1,30 October 2019,"Before I watched this I thought Halloween 3 was the worst Halloween film, this film is now officially the worst Halloween film of the franchise in my opinion. Film was not scary, death scenes were predictable.",Halloween II
555,artiman,Nothing like John Carpenter's Halloween II,3,19 September 2010,"I understand that every director wants to give some sort of personal stigma to their movies but if you are to remake a classic horror film you have to show some respect to the original installment and to the audience you are referring to. Even though the remake of the first movie seemed to be a little interesting this one shits all over the Halloween ""saga"".The movie starts off letting you think that it's gonna follow the path of John Carpenter's Halloween II, it summarizes the events of the original film for about 20 minutes and then it turns out to be a bad dream of Laurie. So after Rob Zombie is done with his ""homage"" to the original film he starts taking a very twisted path which I suppose appeals exclusively to his hardcore fans.The characters of the movie are completely altered, everyone lives in their very own little Rob Zombieland, Laurie Strode is into hardcore heavy-punk-Satan-metal or whatever Rob Zombie is about and at the same time she's become this obnoxious problematic teenager with a post traumatic behavior that never fails to annoy. Michael Myers is wandering around escorted by the spirit of Rob Zombie's wife, his child version and a white horse, killing everything in his way so that there can be aplenty of gory moments.There is nothing to remind us of the ""Halloween"" atmosphere that we love. The score is very weak and absent for most of the part, the writing and the direction is Rob Zombie bad, there are no scary moments and the movie is long and boring. Chances are you are gonna hate this movie but if you are anything like me and you like to see bad movies despite the warnings then go ahead and find out yourselves.",Halloween II

When I was watching it (home alone in the dark), I really got the sense that maybe, just maybe, Michael was standing behind me with a big knife. True, after a while the killings got somewhat predictable, but I thought it was fun to try to guess who was going to die next. The characters were great, and seemed extremely realistic, though I have absolutely no idea whether they're at all accurate of how it would really be. I also enjoyed the flashbacks, which created an interesting vibe for the movie, though it did occasionally get confusing as to what was real and what was a dream. Another thing that I didn't like was the thing about Michael's mother and him as a child. I understand the purpose for it, and think it was important, but that whole concept seemed somewhat forced and overused. Aside from those things though, this was a fantastic movie.",Halloween II
557,Colubris,So much potential wasted,1,1 August 2012,"I'm a major Halloween fan and write this review with a smile, the series of films all have an incredible sense of atmosphere.The role of Michael Myers to me was pure legend, he seemed very distant ""subtle"" and mysterious with his own reasons for doing what he did in all the films. I mean, even the fact that we could never see his eyes behind the mask; made him a force to be reckoned with, it made the antagonist a horror to look at.Now we take this trash, this movie to me makes Michael look like he is a little confused, more conscious of showing off by exaggerating each kill to a point where it just seems like a killer having a bad day, there is no mystery here, he eats?! ... Oh MY GOODNESS! Why is he even hungry he isn't even human anymore, we don't want this guy personified as ""humanlike"", there is no authenticity, no suspense. Michael seems almost like he is ""trying"" to look the part instead of just being what he was. This film doesn't quite make you want to appreciate the role of anyone in the series of films.I get a sense of Goth, Rock and Roll, Skulls, upside-down crosses on someones head HAHAHA?, it's just all to commercial to me. Come on, Michael Myers cutting someones head off and then carrying it, what's the point, all of that is where the first time; I shut the movie off. In closing...

558,rockislandredd,Not for the faint hearted,8,1 September 2009,"Let me start of by saying that I loved this film. Rob Zombie has taken the tired old Halloween formula and breathed new life into it and I say it's about bloody time. Absolutely brilliant!!The kills are numerous, brutal, and graphic. The action is non stop from start to finish and really isn't that what we expect from a horror film anyway? Killing and more killing on top of more killing...with a little suspense here and there for added measure? That's how I would describe H2.While watching, I couldn't help but notice that this movie reminded me of a Lucio Fulci film. Maybe Rob is a fan? The film has a real gritty grind house look chocked full of brutal murders, ghostly symbolism / hallucinations / dreams, etc. Maybe it's just me, but if Fulci had ever done a Halloween film, I think it would have looked a lot like this. And that is a good thing in my book.By far, the best horror film of the year!",Halloween II

What a crap fest. I mean, Halloween 1 was equally butchered and ruined by America's worst, but it still was entertaining. But this - no. I don't know what you want to see, but stay far away from this. I've enjoyed a lot of bad films for their entertainment value, but this has bored me too much - starting once again with Zombie's untalented, boring and dull wife and ending in a pointless storyline. I can't say the ending was disappointing as this was one of the few movies I have actually turned off before it finished. I'd suggest to leave filming completely, but I guess the wife needs a job so I'll say why not stay with and produce more playground horror like ""Devil's Rejects"", you will find enough clueless derps who think these movies are ""extreme"".

Not a remake of the original 1981 but a NEW addition to the already great story. I've seen all the original movies and was thrilled that one of my favorite musicians was tackling this great franchise. I wasn't let down. Modern versions of my favorite horror films. This movie sure didn't let down. I avoided most of the previews since I prefer to see the movie without having seen trailers. I made the mistake of reading reviews on here before going to the theater Saturday to see this movie. People just hate because they feel they have too much of a vested interest in this franchise. Its just a movie. Get a grip... If you like blood, gore and a new take on Michael Myers then please go see this movie. Yes there is a lot of the F word but come on. This isn't a kids movie.

561,vinvegas2000,Not as bad as most reviewers are saying,6,5 September 2009,"It is really unbelievable to see the way people over-react to certain movies. When you have a well-known story line, most people have expectations, so they aren't able to review the movie simply for what it is. I read tons of horrible reviews before going to see this movie, so much so that I almost didn't even want to go. But I'm a fan of horror movies in general and for me, the Halloween series as a whole is by far the best in the genre. Having said that, this particular version is by no means the best in the series, but it isn't even close to the worst either. There are some things that are stylistically different, even from Rob Zombie's first version, which didn't make sense to me. The biggest difference is the way he incorporates Michael's dreams of his mother. These scenes are overused and don't fit the tone of the movie. You can see what RZ was trying to get at, but they could have been more effective if used a bit differently. Another noticeable difference is the lack of the theme music. Not sure why this was. He used it in the first movie so it makes little sense to take it out now. Both these changes did make the movie feel less like a typical Halloween flick, but didn't necessarily make the movie bad. Most of the rest of the movie was pretty well done. RZ changes the storyline a lot, but it makes the movie feel fresh. The story about what happens with Laurie and Annie was interesting and seemed real enough. The Dr. Loomis part of the story was unexpected, but worked sufficiently for the movie. Everything else kept me entertained. The kills are far more brutal. I think this bothers some people, but it is effective. Rob Zombie treats Michael like more of a demented mental patient than a supernatural, ghostly killer. Michael is even more of an angry, violent maniac this time around. The setting is a bit more rural than suburban, which works well for the mood and feel of the movie. Overall, not as good as Zombie's first version, but still a decent Halloween. Definitely better than most of the horror flicks currently offered. If you love Halloween/Michael Myers and can overlook a few changes, you will enjoy this one.",Halloween II
562,franklinstein28,Massive disappointment VS. First Zombie Halloween,2,2 November 2014,"Everything that Rob Zombie did great in his first reboot of Halloween was equally terrible in his second installment. First, the first almost half hour of the movie (the hospital scene was a waste of time seeing how it was nothing but a dream. This dream motif continues throughout the movie in a very disjointed way. It takes on a very Nightmare on Elm Street-esque feel. It puts doubt in the viewers mind as to what is real or not, and this doubt and confusion culminates at the very end with Laurie possibly at a sanitarium but possibly not.In this movie Zombie portrays Michael as a drifter in search of his sister; which was a good representation of what a true delusional, cut-off serial killer would look like. The problem I had was the absence of the mask for much of his drifting. The problem wasn't so much with Michael not wearing his mask, but that his face was too visible. An empty black hood would have easily added to Michaels mysterious spectre feel, and help terrify the audience in a different way. Zombie almost had a good twist in that Michael should have dawned the mask when he was in killer mode; sort of a ""putting on your war face"". Zombie let this extra layer slip right through his fingers. The end was the worst for Michael showing his entire face and then talking, albeit one word. That's not the Michael we're all terrified of.Rob Zombie was given too much freedom with his second installment, and for that has let down his audience in an irrehensible way.",Halloween II

Now, if this had been remotely MENTIONED in the first movie, I would've bought it but to me this was the hook Zombie needed to get Sherry into the film. I loved the idea of the first film; a psychopathic killer killing his way to his sister, who he just wants to say what's up to. This movie steered it completely off course giving Michael a Psycho- Esq reason to kill. Did Zombie ever stop to think that maybe he wouldn't have had to recast the kid if he'd just done a continuation of the first or just simply stop without a sequel? Throughout my movie collection I have the whole series just to make it look pretty. I will gladly suffer having only one of these movies on the shelf. And note to Mr. Zombie, your wife was awesome in the 3 other movies of yours I've seen but she was the biggest waste of paper I've ever encountered in this one.",Halloween II
564,texas4322013,great flick,8,12 December 2013,"Let me start off by saying im the biggest fan of michael myers in my mind. since i was a kid i thought he was the best villain out of all the villains chucky jason etc. I never really found him SCARY though from watching the old movies.....you know what i mean? ""oh he's by a tree now he's not""..that doesn't do it for me...sorry...im 28 years old and i prefer violence and special effects to get the point across. NOW TO THE MOVIE, i love the fact that rob zombie makes things so realistic. i watch the old halloween and i see a fake watered down version of teenagers. this movie is down to earth in so many ways. Believe it or not this movie is full of emotional adrenaline. I feel like i know the character on the screen, not like im watching some out of this world ridiculous watered down stereotypical teenage horror film....because lets not forget what this movie really is...a TEENAGE HORROR FLICK. i like the overall direction of the movie i think it was very well directed and i think the acting is great to go along with it. yeah it has a lot of blood and things like that. but that's what WOULD REALLY HAPPEN right? a lot of blood and a lot of gruesome things going on....NOT MICHAEL MYERS HIDING BEHIND A TREE AND HIDING BEHIND BUSHES AND all the other ridiculous things in the original films that are not scary at all. After watching rob zombies take on MICHAEL MYERS i have a whole new respect for MYERS character and ZOMBIE as a director. MICHAEL MYERS IS TERRYIFYING throughout this whole movie and obviously its kind of predictive but so what? everyone watching the movie obviously knows who the killer is and from watching the first movie should know WHO michael myers REALLY is and have an idea about what kind of villain he is. We don't need to see him sneaking around and dissapearing behind buildings and lol like i said just all the ridiculous non scary things the original movies offered. So the fact that Zombie made the movie so gruesome and violent and straight forward and the actors made it believable. THANK YOU ROB ZOMBIE i appreciate you looking out for horror fans like myself who don't LIVE ON THE PAST when obviously the newer version is 10 TIMES BETTER then the original. take that to the bank",Halloween II
565,phillykidd72,Zombie Please Stop Making Movies!!,1,3 October 2010,"OK I admit I somewhat liked the first Rob Zombie Halloween movie because watching Michael Myers' back story when he was just a kid, was pretty dark and darkness is part of what makes a good horror movie sometimes. It wasn't a good movie per Se, but it had it's moments that make it passable. Fast forward a couple of years later and we now have Halloween 2 from Rob Zombie. The only reason I decided to watch this movie after reading so many bad reviews on it, was merely out of curiosity and not interest. Zombie, yet again gives us his ""vision"" of a very popular early 80's movie with a large cult following and yet again, disappoints us. I don't know what Zombie was smoking, as well as the people who backed up this crap. The only thing we are subjected to is more back story, unlikeable and cold characters, terrible direction, weird music and some of the most unnecessary and brutal killings that was not needed in the first two original Halloween movies,(stabbing a woman 15 times was just so sick, depraved, and unnecessary that I just knew it was gonna get worst as I watched on). Its apparent that Rob Zombie has a very strange and bizarre way of telling a story and its unfair that we waste money watching a movie that only he appreciates.Who ever owns the rights to the original movies, don't worry, trash like this is what keeps us attached to historic films like yours.",Halloween II
566,I_AM_the_Egg_Man,An absolute horror (and not in a good way),3,7 November 2010,"Rob Zombie's Halloween II, is a jumbled mess of a film that is bound to be even more polarizing than his remake of John Carpenter's 1978 classic, two years ago.The film picks up right where we left off in the previous installment. Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) wanders aimlessly through the streets of Haddonfield, bloody, near catatonic, and packing heat. She is picked up by Sheriff Brackett (The wonderful Brad Dourif) and whisked away to the relative safety of the hospital. Michael Myers has meanwhile managed to escape from a coroner's van after the EMT's, while engaging in a perverted discussion about sexual relations with a corpse, run full on into a cow. Laurie wakes up in her hospital bed, and Michael starts killing people. There is a spectacular chase scene that culminates with Michael axing his way through the walls of a guard shack. This was a great sequence until POOF... Laurie wakes up in her own bed at home. It was all a dream! This beginning just goes to show you that the film that you are watching, will leave you both tense, and frustrated.Rob Zombie is a talented filmmaker, but his over-reliance on his signature hellbilly style, proves to be his undoing in this, his first truly disappointing film. It seems that he is even more enslaved by his influences than Quentin Tarantino is. There's nothing wrong with a little homage, but when the film is wall to wall with it, and the only thing holding it up is a rickety plot, the film collapses under the weight of it's own pretensions.Stylistically, Halloween II is both beautiful, and monstrously grimy. The shots are composed beautifully, but what's in the frame is usually so dirty that it makes you yearn for the gloss of the Zombie's first Halloween.The returning characters are all different this time out, but not in an organic way. Laurie Strode is now a skanky, loudmouth, tortured soul, that cries and screams one minute, and then hoots and hollers the next; sometimes within the same scene. Dr. Loomis is now a completely fame-ensnared media whore, more interested in selling books and mugging for reporters than he is giving any coherent insight into the tragic murders that took place one year before. Michael Myers has apparently been holing up for the past year in a shack, biding his time for the holiday to come back around so he can return to his murderous ways. Gone, is the unstoppable killer that wasted no time dispatching his victims in a single night. Now, he seems to be waiting for the go-ahead from Mommy to do what he loves to do. Debra Myers is now a ghost that haunts both Michael and Laurie. It would seem that she is not just in his head, thus making this the first time that the Halloween franchise has stepped firmly and proudly into the supernatural realm (I do not count the Thorn Curse from part six because that could have just been hypnosis conducted by a cult).The only saving grace, as far as characters go, are Sheriff Brackett, and his daughter Annie. I could have done without the rest of them, including THIS Michael Myers, and enjoyed a nice drama about this relationship. Brad Dourif does his best to save the film, and Danielle Harris proves that she has the talent to carry a film on her own. Once again, she is given a harrowing scene to play, and once again, she more than rises to the occasion and delivers a haunting performance. GIVE THIS GIRL MORE WORK Hollywood!!!! Dourif proves that he's one of the best character actors around, and imbues his performance with pathos not usually seen in a slasher flick.I wish I had something positive to say about Taylor-Compton. When I first saw her in Halloween, I thought that it might just be the character that was written to be annoying, but having sat through her second interpretation of Laurie, I can firmly say that if there is a more annoying young actress in film today, I have not yet had the misfortune of seeing her. The girl just simply cannot act. She is so shrill, that at several points in the film, I was hoping that Michael would just spring up kill her already.Tyler Mane does a good job at playing Myers as written. Myers is more violent this time out, and Mane really goes for it. Malcolm McDowell is simply wasted here. He's gives as good as he can, but the material is just not there.There are a few script contrivances that make no sense either. Just where the hell is Haddonfield? I know it's supposed to be a small town in Illinois, so why is there a major late night talk show in this little town, and what the hell is Weird Al Yankovic doing there? Also, Just how the hell did Loomis not only figure out where the abandoned shack where Michael takes Laurie is, but how did he get there so fast? One could go absolutely crazy trying to figure these things out. I would say just quit trying to do so, and chalk it up to a case of abysmal writing. Somewhere between the prolific profanity, and murky aesthetic, I got lost and wondered just how bad it could get. Answer: VERY.",Halloween II
567,marvelcrossgaming,The f*** did I just watch?,3,1 December 2014,"The first Zombie Halloween remake was actually pretty good in my opinion, the greater focus on Michales' childhood was nice. But then Zombie said ""Cocaine!"" ""Meth!"" ""Acid trips!"" and the we got Halloween II. Basically Deborah Myers becomes an angel of death sorta thing and she and young Michael in a clown outfit follow grown up Michael all over the place. Laurie becomes a real b*tch to annie (who survived the 1st film) and Dr. Loomis becomes a self indulgent a**hole. Oh yeah and Michael and laurie get really f***ed up visions of murder and colors and white horses. New title for the movie: Halloween 2high4u: the cheech and chong edition.",Halloween II
568,PCloud76,"I like Rob Zombie, and I like Halloween, but.....",2,30 August 2009,"This movie was not very good at all. Now I'm not the type of guy to bash a movie, I feel if I have something negative to say, I won't really say it all, but I have to speak up.*SPOILERS* The movie starts off with a definition. A definition no one gets. In this movie Rob tries to explain Michael Myers, why he does this? What he sees? What is behind the rage? The thing is, Halloween works because the viewer does not know what is behind this madness. They've tried to explain it before in sequels, it just doesn't work. Michael is a killer with no emotion that wants to kill his family, and that's it. He kills anyone who gets in his way, and that's the story.In this film we have are protagonist, Laurie, our setting is a year after it all went down, and Laurie has now become a rocker chick that hangs out with scene girls at the local book shop. She has pulled a total 180. A change in her personality, nothing new there, every surviving victim of a massacre seems to do this. She's haunted by nightmares, and she lives with the Sheriff the great Brad Douriff (who quite possibly almost saved the movie with him alone) and her friend that survived in the first one.Okay from the beginning to the end the film wasn't really that good at all. It starts off with a pointless flashback, and then continues to the reason why Micheal's body hasn't been found, and then a nightmare scene. Now the nightmare scene which basically is the original part 2 summarized in ten minutes, was the best part. Michael stalking Laurie in the hospital to ""Nights in White Satin"" was amazing. It gets to the point where Laurie takes refuge in the security house, Michael is outside, it's raining, and Michael begins to pace up and down while looking through the window trying to find her. The image of Michael outside the window as the rain pours down his mask is amazing. It was such a great image, and gave me hope for the movie, but after that it all went down hill.I could go on and try to explain this to you, but if I were to try and explain the plot it wouldn't make any sense. Rob Zombie tries so hard to give an actual explanation for Michael. This ""White Horse"" so to speak. A symbol that drives him to be with his family again. Now I'm all about trying something different, but this was just an epic fail. The ""White Horse"" seemed like something Rob searched on Google, the dialog sounded like it was written by a fifteen year old with a hard on, and the acting wasn't all that great either. I'm not even gonna get into the way Michael looked, which was just plain awkward.It seems like Rob Zombie wants to be Quentin Tarantino, there's even a scene where Brad Douriff's character talks about Lee Marvin. I don't know, just doesn't fit.There's no suspense, and if you were to take a shot every time Michael sticks his knife into flesh, you'd be dead after the first kill.It sucks to write all of this because I am a fan of Zombie's work. I loved House of a Thousand Corpses, and adored Devil's Rejects, the first Halloween remake was watchable, but this was horrible. I wish Rob would do something original again, and get out of this remake hell, he is creative, but if he is going to continue to write his own scripts he needs to keep writing characters that work with his dialog, because saying the work f*ck over and over just doesn't cut it anymore.I'm gonna end this with the main reason why I disliked this film, and that was Dr. Loomis's character. I don't care if you're trying to re work the series, Dr. Loomis role in this movie was pointless. An uncaring self centered asshole that could care less about the victims, who has a moment of clarity at the end? Screw that. Dr. Loomis would have known the moment Micheal's body went missing that he was still out there, and he would have went after him, he wouldn't have denied it, and he wouldn't have went and wrote a book about it. That was the best part about the Halloween series. This feud between Loomis and Michael, the only man that can oppose him, and was shattered into to pieces. Nothing is great about this movie, it had potential, but fell apart, I hate to say it, but it was crap.I would recommend this movie only to Weird Al Yankonvich fans.And one more thing, the coolest character in the movie (besides Brad) lasted like two minutes, I'd watch a whole movie about the kid in the werewolf suit.",Halloween II

This is the biggest piece of bull and should not be allowed to be in the H-series.. seriously.. Even Resurrection was more entertaining than this! The plot is bad, overacting/bad acting and Michael Myers is not Michael, but a mountain hippie.. I'm actually watching the ending while writing this, and the fact that it's more fun to write this than watch the movie should mean something.. So for the Halloween fans.. go watch Halloween 3 again, or Jason x for that matter, cause nothing can ruin a good series like this movie... Disappointment..",Halloween II
570,theonetheycalldonknotts,"Not great, but not bad....if you're willing to overlook some flaws.",6,28 August 2009,"Let me start by saying that at first I hated Rob Zombie's Halloween. I voted it a 4 out of 10 on here and even though I've come to like parts of it I would still say that I wouldn't rate it any higher. Halloween 2 is a big time improvement in many areas, but fails in many as well. Michael Myers, while being more like Jason Voorhees in this movie, is a total bad ass. He's hell bent on murder this time around and literally crushes and beats the life out of people (or just stabs them 20 times in a row) and it works well. There are a few scenes of him maskless and he does see visions of his mom and visions of himself as a child. This, to me, wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it'd be. If you don't expect much from this part of the movie then it shouldn't bother you too much. The best thing about this movie is Scout Taylor-Compton. I've read lots of reviews saying that all Scout does is stumble, scream, and cry. This is true to a certain extent, but Scout's Laurie does have some meat to her. She's about 100% more interesting this time around. She carries a few scenes all on her own. At one point she talks to a stuffed bear. On paper this may sound laughable, but it comes off as cute and I did start to root for her. There are quiet a few dramatic/character building scenes that involve Laurie (and Annie) and I liked this stuff more than just about anything else in the movie. The negative side is the pacing. The story unfolds from the ""night"" Laurie shoots Michael and then to a couple days leading up to October 31st, a year later. Once it hits ""Halloween"" again it's like everything happens at once. Laurie finds out she's related to Michael. They go to a Halloween party, and it's seriously too fast. They just threw whatever they could into the edit to move the story along. They could of added ten minutes of ""filler"" time to draw these things out and build them up, but for whatever reason, they didn't. The pacing, up until October 31st, was workable. There is a pointless segment of Michael killing two people outside of the Halloween party. Pointless because the Halloween party happens so fast, and other than these random kills, you don't see Michael at the party. If you're expecting Michael to stalk his victims at all, don't. You won't be happy. Michael shows up and kills people. It's fun though, and at this point I'm not expecting a Carpenter like slow burn full of suspense. Dr. Loomis isn't as pointless as everyone makes him out to be. I actually enjoyed most of his story line and was surprised that his dialogue wasn't as horrible as some of the trailers/soundtrack clips would lead you to believe. Loomis, Annie, Laurie, Brackett are all in different places in their lives and I thought it was a good call to include each different story line. I will say some of the Loomis stuff could of been trimmed to make way for more build up to the Laurie story line. Laurie and Michel are having the same visions(which doesn't work but isn't as God awful as it could've been), and the ending feels rushed just like most of the stuff that happens on Halloween does, but there are a few great Brad Dourif (Sheriff Brackett) scenes and one scene I really enjoyed where Brackett punches Loomis in the face. I'm rambling on so I'll end this now. All in all, the directors cut should be a more polished and structured version of the theatrical. I give the theatrical version a 6/10.",Halloween II

The weird visions/dreams that Laurie Strode receives are very reminiscent of HO1C, it has the gritty look and feel of Devil's Rejects, and it takes the characters from the previous Halloween and instead of retreading the same story again, Zombie puts them into something entirely new and uncharted that was never attempted in the John Carpenter originals. Yes, it's extremely brutal and violent, but, it IS a horror movie, and a Rob Zombie one to boot, so what did you really expect out of it? Zombie said from the get-go that he set out to take the Halloween story and make it his own vision, which is exactly what he's accomplished with his two entries into this franchise. It's not high art, nor does it set out to be. It's a pure escapist, pop-corn genre flick, much in the vein of the exploitation movies that Mr. Zombie was weened on, and I applaud him for making it in such a fashion. Kudos.",Halloween II

The script sounds like it was written by a middle schooler (honestly, who uses THAT many F bombs in regular conversation?). And the violence, while somewhat expected, went WAY over the top as far as simply telling the story. On the plus side, whoever did the makeup effects for this movie has one heck of a demo reel to show off now.I'll agree that casting Maclolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis was a good move...it would have been even better if they had made him even remotely likable. Same goes for virtually any of the characters in H2.Oh, memo to those who griped about Michael grunting....he grunted in Carpenter's original as well...just check out the scene where he strangles Lynda, or when he's breaking into the closet, or choking Laurie.And of course they had to go the whole ""oh-my-God-she's-his-SISTER!"" route, which was stupid in the first HALLOWEEN 2 and is even more so this time around. John Carpenter came up with the idea in 1981 and even he admits it was a dumb one. Michael Myers is far more terrifying as simply the ""boogeyman"".....anybody could be his victim, nobody is safe. With this lame subplot, as long as you aren't related to him or between him and a relative, you're safe! Maybe it's nostalgia for the ""good old days"", but I think I'll avoid any of Mr. Zombie's future HALLOWEEN efforts and simply stick with Carpenter's classic....the unequaled original.....",Halloween II

I probably saw approximately the last 5 minutes or so. Let me assure you that was all I needed to see to confirm my suspicions about this film.Quite frankly, this film is the lamest, most insipid piece of ""horror"" trash ever to disgrace the stage. If the previous 96 minutes were anything like the big ""dramatic"" conclusion of this film, then it has to be in the running for worst horror movie of the decade.Mr. Zombie, please stop making trash like this and ripping off the general public who does not know any better. You fixate way too long on certain scenes that don't need much attention. Your story here was utterly cliché and boring. Where is the inventiveness? Why should we care? We shouldn't and we do not. You were simply out to make a quick buck at our expense. There is nothing in this film that has not been done before and done much better. You are a hack director, sir. Either learn what makes a great movie or simply don't make them anymore. After this clunker, I think you will be hard pressed to get a nickel from any studio.I just don't understand how this film could go through all its stages of production without anyone ever stopping and stating the obvious: ""Wow, this is a mammoth piece of doo-doo!"" I would feel like I had robbed my audience if I produced such a film and charged others to see it.Do you get my gist, Mr. Zombie? At your core, you are nothing more than a thief and a no-talent hack. Whatever talent and creativity you've shown in the past (which has been very minimal) is now completely out the window.My suggestion? Find another profession or go back to making your awful, loud, angry, violent, screaming ""music"". Hey, that sums up just about all your films: awful, loud, angry, violent, and garbled. Interesting how those two are so similar. Well, I hope you think about this flawed piece of garbage and work a little harder next time.

That the ultimate goal is not to service itself but to try to make a genuine positive impact on the world. I think H2 fulfills this premise very well. It asks us to sympathize with and understand a person who would usually be considered 'unlikable and bratty'. Many films have done this, but what makes h2 so special is how it not only sympathizes with Laurie but goes the distance with her. It doesn't soften the edges for the viewers comfort but rather envelops us in laurie's traumatic existence. The way the film tries to make its viewers better people is by presenting this generally unlikable person and asks us to understand and empathize with why she is like that. It asks us to accept those who generally are not seen as 'good' people. Many films do this, but h2 delves so far into the territory of unlikableness that, if you are able to make the leap of sympathy, it will ultimately have given you an easier way of making that leap for real people.",Halloween II

When arguing that point then you would have to logically concede the fact that the this re-make had more substantial character depth than the original Halloween. In Zombie's remake we're actually dumped in the cesspool that was Michael's childhood. We are able to witness the deplorable environment in which he was subjected to. In the original Halloween THERE WAS NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. AT ALL.Now then, to use such an anemic point like this movie not having any Halloween Theme music is just juvenile. Do you want watch a movie or listen to music? Also, critiquing Michael's wardrobe? WHAT?

All the audience does is sit and watch people get butchered for no real purpose.Laurie's character was a complete waste. All we do is watch her party and cry with no resolution. Laurie, to me, was one layered. Rob tried to make her deep, he tried so hard that we watch her go through things, but we are never given the pieces to understand why. I'm not going to give it away, but Laurie's conclusion is an absolutely absurd attempt at shocking audiences, all it does is confuse you even more.Dr. Loomis has been transformed into a complete jerk, and it's overbearing. In Rob's first Halloween he made Loomis subtly egotistical, and it was done well. In H2, Loomis' ego and selfishness crosses the line, and my friend and I got tired of it. His character also never comes to a real resolution for his part in the story.Michael's part in this is useless. He is clearly there not to solve inner conflict, or complete a story. He is there simply to butcher teenagers. He bears no importance to anything in this movie, and his so called 'story' doesn't make sense and just confuses.*Small spoilers, no story ruined* The 2 things that really bugged me as a Halloween fan rather than as a critic were first, that the audiences see's Michaels face, clearly, more then a few times. The point of Michael, to me, is that he should not have a face, a face makes him seem to human. Michael is supposed to be pure evil, giving him a face makes him significantly less intimidating.Second, Michael, for the first time in any Halloween that I can remember, grunts and yells as he kills. Again, this makes him to human and less scary.On the plus side, Robs directing is always nice to see, I just wish he could write as well as he directs, and there's very little of Rob's usual white trash dialogue, which was a nice change.In short, Zombie took Halloween(2007), took a few of the character and completely changed them to the point of exaggeration, and made the audience dislike them. Then, he took any story that he could of had and threw it out the window.2 out of 10",Halloween II
586,derekevans-64974,What in the....,1,23 August 2021,Not much to say about this movie. One of the worst Halloween movies ever made. I'd rather watch Halloween Resurrection over this movie any day and that's saying a lot.,Halloween II
587,hrosec,What a horror of a movie!!!,1,30 October 2018,"Truly, truly awful in every way, shape and form! What on earth was Rob Zombie doing with these movies other than absolutely royally destroying them! I mean what does Michael Myers look like, the mask is truly awful, takes everything away from the original, the girl playing Laurie Strode is a whiny, awful character, feel no sympathy for her whatsoever! Just an absolute mess of a film, disturbing and just disgusting and there is no need for it at all, I had to turn it off 40 mins into it, I actually couldn't take anymore with Lauries weird dreams and being possessed I mean what the hell was that all about?!? Having to watch the originals just to take my mind off this horrible god awful mess of a film!!! If only I could give it 0 stars, seriously anyone wanting to watch this movie I really would not waste your time! No wonder they have had to do a remake of a next chapter to carry on from the original 1st Halloween, sometimes things are better left alone and untouched.",Halloween II

589,vertigoago,Wth did I just watch?,1,24 February 2019,"If you are a Sheri Moon Zombie fan, this is the movie for you. After watching that disaster, I'm convinced Zombie only made it to showcase his wife. I don't know what I hate more, the way he turned Loomis into a total pos or the way he turned Michael Myers into a poor man's Jason Vorhees with that stupid mother storyline. Nothing about the film is scary, only graphic violence and gore. Lots of nice up close shots of Myers throughout the movie often times without mask where he just looks like a truck driver, removing any mystic or suspense to the character. Oh, and that stupid white horse. The funny thing is, I actually enjoyed Zombie's first Halloween, which was not without it's flaws. But this? This sucks.",Halloween II
