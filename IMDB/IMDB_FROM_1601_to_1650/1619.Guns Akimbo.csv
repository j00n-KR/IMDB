0,Leofwine_draca,"Brash, slick entertainment",5,20 July 2021,"A typical modern action comedy: brash, noisy, crude, seemingly directed by a hyperactive child. This makes the frequent action difficult to enjoy although there's something to be said for the slickness of it all and the pop culture references which count for something. Daniel Radcliffe plays the lead as a kind of geeky character while Samara Weaving gets a lot more interesting femme fatale role. The plot and characters are paper thin while the rest is hyper stylised and completely over the top. I rather liked the colour scheme and comic book feel which reminded me of POLAR for instance, but the rest isn't really my cup of tea.",Guns Akimbo
1,SnoopyStyle,fun for awhile,6,22 May 2020,"Slacker coder Miles Lee Harris (Daniel Radcliffe) is trying to get back with his ex Nova. He likes to troll other online trolls. He makes the wrong enemy in Skizm, an underground killing-for-entertainment society. They follow their leader Riktor in breaking into his apartment and knocking him out. He wakes up with two guns bolted to his hands. He receives texts telling him that he has 24 hours to kill expert player Nix (Samara Weaving).The premise is fun but it can get repetitive and tiresome. It reminds me a lot of Crank which is a bit better than this. Radcliffe has this adorable personality which keeps the movie going for the first half. At some point, the concept wears thin and the movie loses the thread. I'm not sure if it's Nix's convoluted story or the unrelenting action grind. It stops mattering. So it's fun for a good while and then it's not.",Guns Akimbo
2,nogodnomasters,Never bring a spork to a gunfight,8,15 March 2020,"For fans who loved the grindhouse action-comedy style of ""Smokin' Aces,"" we have ""Guns Akimbo."" Miles (Daniel Radcliffe ) is a mild-mannered pacifist who trolls the trolls. He gets flagged by a web page called ""Skizm."" ""Skizm"" operates an illegal operation of having criminals and psychos kill each other. The top killer is a psycho named Nix (Samara Weaving) who has a Harley Quinn quality to her, without the silly garb. Her last kill is to be Miles who recently has undergone a body enhancement by having guns nailed to his hands. He is not happy about the situation but is coerced into the competition run by ""The Starbucks of Murder.""Miles's use of an inhaler added a little something to his character. The action is inane by design. It uses cover songs of older music.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",Guns Akimbo
3,kosmasp,Glued in,8,18 July 2020,"The poster is quite great and I still didn't notice the thing about the hands and the guns. I reckon those who watched closely and/or watched the trailer know or knew beforehand what was going to happen. Nice thing to do, if you can call this a nice thing.What isn't a nice thing, is what the German distribution company did to this. For some reason they believed they should release this in a cut form (around a minute of footage is gone for a 16 rating in cinemas). At least those who were lucky enough to watch it in Sneak Previews or special screenings. Anyone else who watched this without knowing: I feel for you. I almost would have been trapped too ... not a good thing at all.And speaking of not good things, this is not all fun and games. Well it mostly is, but it has a darker side to it, that you may or may not like. ""Keeping it real"" sort of thing. It does not always appeal or appease and please the audience the way some might have wanted. Good or bad? Up to you - but overall very well done",Guns Akimbo
4,Tweekums,Great brain-in-neutral over the top action,8,17 July 2021,"Miles Lee Harris is a computer programmer... a drone working for a company he hates. His life is not great but it is about to get worse; much worse. After trolling those who watch 'Skizm', a live streamed death match, he has a visit from those who run the game. They drug him and when he wakes up he literally has a gun bolted to each hand. He is told that he has twenty four hours to kill Nix, a crazed gunslinger girl who is the games top killer. Surviving won't be easy... he can't even put on his own trousers anymore! What follows is almost non-stop action as our unlikely protagonist struggles to survive and turn the tables on those who put him in this predicament.If you want realism or something deep and meaningful you will hate this; however if you just want to relax with some mindless action it is a delight. From start to finish the action barely lets up. There are chases; shootouts and general mayhem! In the few moments when people aren't trying to kill Miles we get laughs as he struggles to cope, unable to hold anything, and gets help from a homeless crack addict. It must be said the action is very violent and the language is robust, which may put off some viewers and means it is definitely unsuitable for younger viewers. Daniel Radcliffe impresses as Miles and Samara Weaving is a lot of fun as Nix; the rest of the cast are decent enough; clearly having fun hamming it up with the deliberately over the top story. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of films like 'John Wick' and 'Shoot 'em Up'... it delivers crazy, over-the-top violent action while never taking itself too seriously.",Guns Akimbo
5,BA_Harrison,Painfully bad.,1,17 March 2020,"I didn't realise that it was Samara Weaving playing gun-toting kick-ass chick Nix in Guns Akimbo until she screamed... that horrible, grating, warbling sound that has ground my gears in several of her previous movies. Of course, Weaving's scream alone isn't enough to warrant a 1/10 rating, so what else about this film made my blood boil?The basic premise is sound enough, and Daniel Radcliffe isn't quite as unbearable as I figured he might be (based on what little I have seen of him in those Potter movies), but Jason Lei Howden's script is utterly diabolical and his direction even worse. Imagine that films can procreate: if Neveldine and Taylor's Crank got freaky with Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the result would be a lot like Guns Akimbo, which features the worst aspects of the aforementioned movies (both of which I found fairly intolerable). There's ADHD editing, naff camera trickery, and irritating graphics that routinely pop up on the screen-a noisy profusion of horrible modern movie-making gimmickry masquerading as style.The acting is terrible: the cast are clearly going for excess, but nothing can excuse the godawful over-the-top performance from Ned Dennehy as tattooed bad-guy Riktor, who is more comical than comic-book. Weaving aims for badassery, but is just bad. The less said about the guy playing the bum in the alleyway the better. Still, working from Howden's script can't have been easy: the dialogue the actors are forced to spout is truly awful and not nearly as cool or as quotable or as funny as intended (""Never bring a spork to a gunfight."" - oh how I laughed!). The pathetic pop culture references just add to the annoyance.Howden actually impressed me with his previous film, the tongue-in-cheek heavy metal horror Deathgasm: it wasn't perfect, but it was enjoyable. Guns Akimbo is about as much fun as stepping on a three pin plug barefoot.1.5/10, rounded down to 1/10 for the trite 'bullet-proof vest' plan explained to us at length in a rewound flashback, as though we're too dumb to figure it out for ourselves.",Guns Akimbo
6,zardoz-13,A Blast From Fade-In to Fadeout,10,3 May 2020,"Daniel Radcliffe has been struggling since the ""Harry Potter"" franchise ended with ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" (2011) to distance himself from J.K. Rowling's adolescent warlock and prove his chops as an actor. Just about every movie he has appeared in since ""Harry Potter"" bears little resemblance to ""Harry Potter,"" with the unforgettable ""Swiss Army Man"" (2016) topping the list. Indeed, Radcliffe has taken roles not only like ""Swiss Army Man"" where he played a corpse, but also other bizarre co-starring roles like Igor in ""Victor Frankenstein"" (2015) with James McAvoy as Mary Shelley's mad scientist. In the biographical ""Kill Your Darlings"" (2013), Radcliffe played Allen Ginsburg, one of the germinal poets of the Beat Generation. Ginsburg and fellow writers William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac rose to prominence during this post-World War II literary movement. Flatly rejecting status quo social values, these writers fooled around non-Christian religions and fiddled with psychedelic drugs, sexual freedom, while shunning materialism. Radcliffe followed ""Kill Your Darlings"" with the supernatural saga ""Horns"" (2013) where a pair of satanic horns erupted from his forehead after his girlfriend died under mysterious circumstances. In ""Imperium,"" he portrayed a clean-cut FBI agent who infiltrated a terrorist group and thwarted their goal to build a dirty bomb. Before he starred in the 'anything goes' histrionics of ""Guns Akimbo,"" he played real-life, anti-apartheid protester Tim Jenkin who broke out of a South African slammer in ""Escape from Pretoria."" Mind you, for the moviegoers weaned on the runaway success of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, Radcliffe will always be the perennially youthful magician apprentice.Imagine Daniel Radcliffe replacing Keanu Reeves as sharp-shooting assassin John Wick, and you'll have a clue what occurs in this driven, punk-rock rehash of ""The Tenth Victim"" (1965) meets ""Hard Target"" (1993). ""Deathgasm"" writer & director Jason Lei Howden's second film ""Guns Akimbo"" qualifies as a slam-bang, high-octane, adrenaline-laced, action-comedy that neither squanders a second nor wears out its welcome. Not only will Howden's film hypnotize you with its giddy, gymnastic, action choreography, but it will also horrify you with its gratuitous gunplay and exploding, splatter-gore headshots. Our inconspicuous hero, Miles Lee Harris (Daniel Radcliffe of ""Jungle""), lives and works in Shrapnel City as a computer game code monkey. An adolescent hero worshipper in mind and heart, he clutters the shelves of his man cave with action-figures galore and papers his walls with movie posters like ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2"" and ""Commando."" Of course, he shares nothing in common with John Wick, but he will find himself dodging almost as many bullets from a relentless opponent.Somehow, Miles has managed to maintain the curiosity of his ex-girlfriend, Nova (Natasha Liu Bordizzo of ""Hotel Mumbai""), despite their break-up. If two can tango, you wonder what Nova still sees in Miles. Perhaps, Harry Potter! Radcliffe takes full advantage of his little, lost, puppy dog looks. Naturally, as the lowest man on the totem pole Miles must suck up to his abusive boss, Zander (Richard Knowles of ""Out of the Blue"") who stops at nothing to bully him at work. Happily, Howden introduces these colorful characters and their complications in the first ten minutes and then devotes the remaining 87 minutes earning the MPAA's R-rating ""for strong bloody violence throughout, pervasive language, drug use, sexual references and brief graphic nudity"" as they collide with each other in a hail of gunfire.
Our harmless hero gets himself in trouble when he slights the wrong message board trolls. Bursting into his apartment, they rough him up and smash his laptop. When he doesn't succumb to a poke in the face, they shoot a tranquilizer dart into his neck. In a grimy surgical suite, automatic pistols are bolted into each of his hands, with traction pins sunk into his fingers, so his hands are wrapped around the handles of the two pistols. Each of the ammo magazines that feed his guns bristles with fifty rounds. A digit counter on each automatic tallies the ammo remaining. No, Miles cannot physically remove the firearms from his hands. Opening doors, using his cell phone, gobbling the occasional snack, and even urinating pose supreme challenges. One of the funniest scenes finds Miles sharing an alley with a crackhead, Glenjamin (Rhys Darby of ""Pirate Radio) who convinces him suicide is never a viable option.The man behind the maniacs who abducted Miles is a wicked-looking, skin-head with a heavily tattooed face who doesn't suffer fools gladly. Richter (Ned Dennehy of ""Child 44"") presides over a no-holds-barred, underground, on-line, murder game called SKISM. Richter broadcasts real-world death grudge matches, with no rules except the winner survives while the loser dies. This scaled-down version of the venerable ""Battle Royale"" (2000) finds our vegetarian protagonist ill-prepared for the gauntlet that awaits him. Before this manhunt ends, Miles has to add the police to his list of adversaries. When the cop stuns him with a Taser, our hero accidentally shoots the cop as a reaction to the Tasing. Meantime, this death-defying showdown is nothing compared to the bloodthirsty foe that Richter dispatches to blast Miles into mincemeat. Earlier, Nix (Samara Weaving of ""Mayhem"") escaped from prison, and she is described as ""armed and extremely dangerous."" She has no qualms against killing, and she packs some pretty heavy artillery to each firefight. Nix destroys an illegal cocaine factory and wipes all 26 hoodlums inside without running out of bullets. Nothing Miles pleads with Nix to call a truce. According to Nix, SKISM has promised to wipe her criminal record clean once she ices Miles.
Daniel Radcliffe never misses a chance to make a laughingstock of himself. He cuts quite a woebegone figure scrambling desperately around town in his bathrobe, shorts, and striped tiger slippers with SKISM drones hovering on his heels. Every character here displays more depth than you would imagine, especially Miles' trigger-happy foe Nix who still suffers from some bizarre family memories. Whether you enjoy it or not, you won't forget ""Guns Akimbo.""",Guns Akimbo
7,neil-476,Violent and funny,8,24 July 2021,"Miles is an ineffectual computer drone, picked on at work, and recently dumped by his surprisingly hot (ex-)girlfriend. He relieves some of his pent-up frustration by trolling his (honest) negative opinions on streaming site Skysm, on which drones and CCTV follow combatants as they try to kill each other, current reigning champion being the murderous young woman Nix. Riktor, the man behind Skism, doesn't take kindly to this and, after a period of unconsciousness, Miles wakes up to find a pair of pistols surgically attached to his hands and Nix on his trail.This bears more than a little similarity to the Crank movies, both in terms of plot and directorial stylistic devices (see also Scott Pilgrim). This doesn't mean it's not entertaining, because it is, albeit a lot of the action is John Wick-style blowing away faceless minions in a videogame (which, after all, is why people tune in to Skysm).The reason for watching this is that it is often very funny and Daniel Radliffe, playing a character similar to Ig in Horns, turns out to be pretty good at physical comedy - it's tricky using a mobile phone when your hands are bolted to guns! (also carrying out certain other fairly personal tasks).I enjoyed this.",Guns Akimbo
8,deloudelouvain,"Good action scenes in a not flawless story, certainly worth watching.",8,16 March 2020,"I was going to rate this movie with seven stars but after thinking about it Guns Akimbo deserves an eight, especially in this genre of movie. The excellent cinematography makes this movie stand out from the rest. Jason Lei Howden did a good job directing and writing this movie. There are some flaws in the story but if you can just pass that then you should have a pleasant time watching this movie full of action scenes. Visually it's all quality shooting, the different angles, the fast pace and slow motions shots are all perfect, it's an unique and interesting style of filmmaking. Daniel Radcliffe isn't the little boy Harry Potter anymore, he's done plenty of good movies by now, he doesn't stick to one kind of character, on the contrary he played several of different characters since the Harry Potter saga and once again he showed us all that he's a good actor. I wouldn't be surprised if we had a sequel for this one, I would for sure watch it.",Guns Akimbo
9,Edvis-1997,4,4,13 June 2020,"Sorry but why this movie is so overrated? Like come on... Acting was pretty bad from everyone in the cast. Plot was one huge misunderstanding... So many plot jumps and mistakes it was really very hard to watch because it's so cringe and annoying. Half of audience from cinema didn't even watch whole film they left in the middle. I can't even say anything good about it, it was too blank for me.",Guns Akimbo
10,westsideschl,Kill or Be Killed,6,10 April 2021,"Fairly high on the all time movie's kill list by one or two characters. From what the viewer sees it was ballpark Nix 73; Miles 34. Some cheap graphics used for some storyline explanations. Shootouts not at all realistic; most were incredulously humorous. Still another, seen before, script of an ordinary citizen (computer nerd in this case) being forced into a game of survival - kill or be killed.A couple of twisty creative positives raised its score.",Guns Akimbo
11,tabuno,Flaying,7,29 April 2020,"Daniel Radcliffe of lingering Harry Potter fame stars in this action thriller dark comedy. With a lot of guns, blood, and gore, this Kill Bill offshoot transforms killing into a reality television game show. Mostly bad people end up on the dead heap. Yet the movie continues its darker and darker turn until the end becomes one of whether the real ending was the real ending. It seems that Guns Akimbo ends up being a rather scattered ""flung out widely or haphazardly"" swerving movie. Trying to be different, it definitely flies in the face of the typical storyline and it has its creative moments, yet it also can't quite gel into a completely emotionally satisfying resolution in the way for example Keanu Reeves gets to in Constantine (2005). Comparable to Sucker Punch (2011).",Guns Akimbo

13,Thanos_Alfie,Funny...,5,28 June 2020,"""Guns Akimbo"" is a Comedy - Action movie in which we watch a young man getting into a crazy game and he has to save his ex-girlfriend from some kidnappers.I found this movie interesting and funny in some moments. It also reminded me of the movies ""Crank"" of 2006 and ""Crank: High Voltage"" of 2009 regarding its concept and about the plot it reminded me the movie ""Gamer"" of 2009 with which I found many similarities. The interpretations of both Daniel Radcliffe who played as Miles and Samara Weaving who played as Nix were very good and they both did a great job. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend his / her free time laughing and having a good time.",Guns Akimbo
14,eddie_baggins,An ADHD action event that runs out of steam before the final boss fight,4,22 March 2020,"Similar in DNA to fellow Red Bull infused action/thrillers Crank, Hardcore Henry and Gamer, Guns Akimbo is the type of ADHD suffering offering that barely pauses for breath on its quest to mask the fact it's not actually as smart or funny as it thinks it is.Films like Crank and too a far lesser extent Gamer exist as enjoyable pieces of popcorn munching entertainment (or the perfect pizza and a movie double bill) because they're filled with wonderfully over the top characters, fun performances and thrilling direction and while Guns Akimbo does have these elements in some form, they never combine together in a way that makes us totally invested in Harry Potter's quest to survive a deadly underground real life video game.Directed by New Zealand filmmaker Jason Lei Howden, whose virtually killed his career in the space of mere weeks after vile Twitter attacks aimed at film critics and industry writers, Guns Akimbo casts Daniel Radcliffe as bored office worker Miles, whose online trolling gets him in a spot of bother when he awakes one day to find his hands bolted to a pair of loaded pistols and tasked with killing Samara Weaving's Nix, all as a ploy as part of the murderous online game known as Skizm.Clearly throughout, Howden is having a go at our online, gaming and sadistic human habits but you're not going to be coming out of this film feeling like you've learned something, as a majority of its run-time is taken up with Miles shouting expletives as he tries to escape the clutches of Nix's attacks across a crowded city-scape.Howden struggles to land any really solid jokes in what is supposed to be a self-lampooning action/comedy hybrid, with even the usually sure fire bet Rhy's Darby as a creepy crack-smoking hobo failing to ignite proceedings and while Guns Akimbo's action at times is frenetic and neatly filmed, it lacks that real magic mojo that the best of the genre has to offer.It's a shame, as Radcliffe's continual push to do pretty much everything to take him away from the wizarding world remains an intriguing thing to watch and he gives this performance a lot of energy, while Ready or Not break out star Samara Weaving looks the part but doesn't make much of a mark as Nix, as the two solid performers fail to get Guns Akimbo to the next level as it lumbers along its way.Final Say -There's some great ideas in Guns Akimbo but they're not executed well as Howden's film runs out of lives well before the final boss fight.2 cold hot dogs out of 5",Guns Akimbo
15,damianphelps,Kudos Harry Potter!,7,14 March 2021,Well done Harry Potter for making such an OTT movie full of fun and surprises.Guns Akimbo is a bombastic carnival of entertainment that visually keeps smacking you in the head making sure you are paying attention as the story unfolds.Potter is brilliant in this (as he has been in some of his other recent films).If you want to watch a fun movie akin to a fireworks show then this is for you!!!,Guns Akimbo
16,digitalbeachbum,Mindless game,1,27 August 2020,"It's no Scott Pilgrim.If I wanted to play a mindless game shooting up Nazi, Mafia or some other criminals I would load of GTA and play it. This movie is basically a video game merged with a movie.The movie is to say the most, a waste of space and time. It really has no artistic value and is sad to see Daniel Radcliffe sink after his Harry Potter days but I'm sure he doesn't care. He got paid up front and will stay a millionaire provided he doesn't let any one rob him blind or blow it on drugs and hookersThe entire movie is nonsensical. It is a bunch of violent blood soaked scenes clipped together to make sure every one knows that violence and music make a good combination. They don't. The 80's sound track mixed with the violence is off. They took songs that had different meanings and then smashed them in to scenes which were not related.It's like trying to mix Bach with a porno flick. It doesn't work. The script and direction stink. Nothing else about the movie is worthwhile to me.",Guns Akimbo

18,southdavid,Arma-mental.,6,20 July 2021,"Rather lost in the beginning of the Pandemic, ""Guns Akimbo"" another film from Daniel Radcliffe's increasingly varied career choices has finally arrived on Amazon Prime in the UK. Overall, I thought it was good enough, but lacking a bit in terms of wit to make it a real recommend.Miles (Daniel Radcliffe) spends his days in a boring coding job he hates, and his nights online targeting trolls. One of his targets are the viewers of Skizm, an illegal and violent murder game show that has become popular. The gang that run the game decide on revenge, they kidnap and drug Miles, and literally screw a gun into each of his hands. Then he's enters the game, and must go up against the current champion, the psychotic Nix (Samara Weaving).I, again, thought that the film was OK. For what is a modestly budgeted production, the violence is well done, though mostly slapstick style, rather than played for any real consequence. The story is solid enough, though lacking in any real surprises across the runtime. I don't think any of the actors in the film gave a bad performance, though almost all of their characters are a familiar and lacking in invention.The problem is that it's just lacking that last element of true wit, or invention, to make it a truly worthwhile time investment. All the other films people in the reviews have said it's like are fair, ""Birds of Prey"", ""John Wick"", ""Scott Pilgrim"" - but it's not as good as any of the films it's aping, so why watch this when the better versions are out there?I say again, it's alright. I was never bored with it, or considered not finishing - but neither am I ever going to bother watching it again.",Guns Akimbo

Radcliffe (Harry Potter films) plays computer programmer, Miles who spends most of his time on the internet and is a fan of Skism, a live-streaming fight program. Soon, he's forced to participate where he must kill or be killed by the program's deadliest killer, Nix (Weaving). This isn't bad, there are a few cheesy moments, but it's nice to see Radcliffe in a different role and he & Weaving are good in this. The film is sort of a combination of ""Scott Pilgrim,"" ""John Wick"" & ""The Running Man."" If you like or don't mind violence, blood

20,jtindahouse,Annoying,5,4 March 2020,"The concept for 'Guns Akimbo' sounds really fun, right? A man has guns bolted to his hands and is then hunted for his life across the city. That's a film I want to watch. Sadly the reality isn't quite as fun as that. The problem is that the person the guns are bolted to is a snivelling wuss, and every other character in the movie, barring one, is immensely annoying.I actually had no idea going into 'Guns Akimbo' that it was filmed in New Zealand. I immediately recognised Auckland city though and also many New Zealand actors are sprinkled throughout the film. The most note-worthy and best performing of them all was Rhys Darby. The man is stone-cold hilarious. I'm not sure if he was ad-libbing his lines (I suspect so because he actually pauses before one of them to think for a moment) but either way they are hysterical. The movie continues to cut back to him after his scene so they obviously knew they had hit a gold mine.I would summarise this as a very annoying movie. The characters are annoying (the main bad-guy with his drawn-on face tattoos is unbearably over the top and completely lacking in menace), the action is annoying (a woman is shown to be a lethal killer, and then conveniently can't hit a damn thing with a million shots after that), and the plot is annoying. I wanted to like this film, I really did, but it was just too hard. Lucky Darby is there to keep it from being a complete misfire.",Guns Akimbo

25,kluseba,Pushing to the limit,7,6 July 2020,"Guns Akimbo is an over-the-top action satire in the key of the Crank franchise. It tells the story of a geek named Miles who gets intimidated by his boss, recently split up with his girlfriend and spends his time insulting people on the internet and getting drunk. One day, he discovers the website of an underground fight club called Skizm and insults its members and viewers. The leaders of the fight club kidnap Miles and bolt two guns with fifty shots each into his hands. Miles is told that he needs to kill a crazy, experienced and reckless competitor named Nix in the next twenty-four hours who turns out to be the daughter of a police officer who became as violent as she is after witnessing her mother's and her brother's murder. At first, Miles starts to run away from a potential fight by meeting with police officers, a homeless junkie and his ex-girlfriend. When the latter gets kidnapped by Skizm, things get even more personal. Miles now wants to save his ex-girlfriend and take his revenge on the mastermind behind the underground fight club.This movie convinces on quite a few levels. The cinematography is great with sinister locations, excellent light techniques and dynamic camera work that doesn't make you feel dizzy like numerous other genre flicks. The diversified soundtrack blends in perfectly and mostly consists of cover songs of popular rock and pop songs from the eighties and nineties. The numerous allusions to different video games are hilarious if you understand the references. The action scenes are at times breathtaking and particularly brutal. The characters are fairly interesting as well, especially the two ladies being the protagonist's ex-girlfriend with her colourful hair and the reckless competitor with a bleak past. The movie entertains from start to finish with a decent running time of just above one hour and a half. The film has the potential to become a cult midnight movie in the future.However, the film isn't without its flaws. Some humorous scenes are too repetitive, especially as we observe the protagonist trying to get dressed with guns bolted to his hands on numerous occasions. The story is rather superficial and the continuity is at times missing when the protagonist travels to completely different spots within the same big city even though he only has a few minutes left to fight his opponent. The characters could have been a little bit more fleshed out as only Nix has some depth. The story of the protagonist and his ex-girlfriend only scratches the surface and there isn't much information about the origins of the underground fight club either.Despite its goofy flaws, Guns Akimbo is a violent fun ride with quite a few memorable scenes. If you like brutal, fast-paced and over-the-top action films, you should certainly give it a try. The film is best enjoyed with a few drinks and a couple of friends.",Guns Akimbo
26,s3276169,Tragically unfunny......,3,29 February 2020,"Its really a quest these days to find anything worth watching. Trashy, cyber punk, anime mash up mess ""Guns Akimbo"", underlines this point.It tries far, far too hard. Its characterisations are encrusted with unfunny cliches, as is its all too predictable story line. The inclination to lecture whilst offering scraps of entertainment is ever present too. This time its the evils of the internet, which seems to be populated by hordes of trolls, perverts and pyscho killers. ""Yawn"".Seriously uninspiring. 3/10.",Guns Akimbo
27,peterp-450-298716,A brutally entertaining comic-book-like movie.,7,9 March 2020,"I would have shot you in the dick,
if the target wasn't so small.""Guns Akimbo"" is simply too absurd for words. It's absolute nonsense and you shouldn't take it too seriously. It's simply ""over the top"" pulp and looks as if it's based on some Asian comic strip. But believe me. This film is simply top-notch entertainment. A roller coaster that slowly takes a very steep run-up and then crashes into the depth with a breakneck-speed, shaking you back and forth. And this crazy, hyperkinetic ride lasts until the end. The action scenes with Nix (Samara Weaving) are equivalent to those in ""John Wick"". Flashy editing. Blood splattering when bullets rip apart human flesh in slow motion. And all this under the guidance of an energetic soundtrack where you will hear amongst other ""The Ballroom Blitz"" from The Sweet. In short, I greatly enjoyed this film for an hour and a half.I have infinite respect for the actor Daniel Radcliffe. This guy could have benefited all his life from the ""Harry Potter"" stamp that they have tattooed on his forehead. It would have been possible to come up with a few sequels without any problems and without hesitation they could have exploited the success formula of the book series and film versions. He could also have demanded to be part of the ""Fantastic Beasts and where to find them"" franchise. But no. Instead, Radcliffe opted for not so obvious projects such as ""Kill your Darlings"", ""Horns"" and ""Swiss Army Man"". A homosexual-tinted film, full of literary blabbering on the one hand. And on the other hand a film about a friendship between a castaway and a corpse. It's hard to say that these were commercially safe films that suit the fantasy-loving Harry Potter fans. And to avoid any misunderstanding. I was also enchanted by the Potter films (at least the first four anyway).So no magic formulas, mythological creatures and a Radcliffe with a wizard hat showing a boyish, shy smile. Nope, he's a nobody in this flick. A nobody with a futureless job, who empties one beer bottle after the other while playing violent video games at home. And as a notorious online troll hunter, Miles (Daniel Radcliffe) cannot resist posting derogatory comments on the ""Skizm"" website and provoking supporters of this obscure platform. ""Skizm"" is an illegal website that organizes duels in real-live where opponents try to eliminate each other. And this is thrown on the internet and followed by hundreds of thousands of fanatic fans and bettors. Obviously, the first movie that came to mind was ""Death Match"". The organizer of all this is an ugly tattooed guy called Riktor (Ned Dennehy) who's obviously completely nuts and is accompanied by a gang of weirdos whose muscle mass is noticeably heavier than the weight of their brains. And Riktor isn't happy with the muscular language Miles places on his forum. And before the latter realizes it, he lies in bed with two automatic guns bolted to both his hands. And furthermore, he himself is a candidate for a duel between him and Nix.With this film, Daniel Radcliffe leaves his comfort zone for the umpteenth time and tries to show that he's more than just Harry Potter. A bushy beard, constantly covered in blood and using a portion of self-mockery and humor, ensure that. Not to mention his clothing: a checkered dressing gown, boxer shorts, and fluffy giant slippers in the shape of tiger claws. For Samara Weaving, this is a little bit an extension of her role in ""Ready or Not"". The same bloody and over-the-top situations. But here she got more of a Harley Quinn attitude. A disturbed, fearless person who's extremely effective in terms of eliminating opponents. That her insane behavior was caused by an incident in her youth is briefly mentioned, but in fact, has no impact or significance. This mindless action film has only one goal in mind and that's to show chaotic and limitless action. And all this topped with a sauce of humor à la ""Deadpool"". There are quite a few hilarious moments in this film. The hand-mounted guns that cause problems for Miles to accomplish daily routines. Like for instance opening a door. Or making a phone call. And peeing is even a hazardous thing to do. The Australian-sounding hobo (Rhys Darby) was simply hilarious with his advice on suicide techniques and his Cypress Hill imitation. How he got Miles in that coat, however, remains a mystery to me.If you can't stand a chaotic storyline and you get annoyed when it's a movie that's plain predictable and that looks more like an exaggerated comic, then I recommend you avoid this one. Or you don't take a too critical attitude and you simply undergo the film. Perhaps then you can appreciate the vibrant pace, the screamy images, the creative camera techniques and the complete insane undertone of this movie with a limited budget. ""Guns Akimbo"" is certainly not a film for everyone because of the video game-like mood and the raw sense of humor. And for those who want to know what the film title actually means: Akimbo is a combat technique in which two weapons are used, with one in each hand. Well, I had to look it up myself.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Guns Akimbo
28,questl-18592,Fun Akimbo,8,9 July 2020,"Oh Daniel Radcliffe, how I've come to love you. It would have been so easy for him to get trapped in the Harry Potter archetype for the rest of his career but instead he said no and has picked some outrageous and fun roles.Guns Akimbo is no different. It reminds me quite a bit of Clive Owens's romp in Shoot'em Up. A very different movie but stylistically similar to me, over the top action that is ridiculous, energetic and poking fun at the genre all at once.Radcliffe isn't alone here and Samara Weaving is wonderful as the psychotic Nix. She blends into this role so well that it wasn't until about the halfway point that I even realized it was her.This is not going to be for everyone, it's super violent and bloody and goofy in a way that just won't click with everyone. For me, it hit just right and I had a blast with it. Fortunately, as of right now it's streaming on Amazon Prime, making it pretty easy to check out, and if you're a fan of action comedy that doesn't skimp on the blood or the bullets, then I absolutely recommend this.",Guns Akimbo
29,a_chinn,"Exuberant, outrageous, and surprisingly dull",5,12 November 2021,"Harry Potter finds himself with guns bolted to his hands and forced to fight for his life in an underground death match broadcast for an online audience of millions. The action and comedy are over-the-top, stylish, but surprisingly dull after the first few shootouts. All the noise and fury is numbing after a while and felt simply repetitions and boring. The best action flicks pace the action scenes so each subsequent action sequence is bigger and better than the last. That was always the downfall of the first ""Blade"" film, where the opening sequence was by far the best action set piece of the film and everything else that followed paled in comparison. Still, Daniel Radcliff is good in the lead and provides the best moments outside of the noise and fury, such as when he's trying to put on his pants with guns bolted to his hands or simply trying to open a door. More focus on comedy and character development would have helped this film greatly. Overall it's not terrible, but it could have been a whole lot better.",Guns Akimbo

Madder than Harley Quinn, she not only does a superb action sequence work, but she makes it look fun as well.The story is a little complex, but the way it is framed turns it transitions of over the top ridiculous scenarios as things escalate.If you like great action, good reveals, psychotic characters, and/or insane survival situations, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this.",Guns Akimbo

Enough said.,6,9 July 2020,"When this movie came out in the US in late February, it didn't make back its budget and failed to find an audience. Now after watching 40+ minutes of this trippy action flick starring Daniel Radcliffe as well as Samara Weaving in a New Zealand set indie action flick (now on Prime Video), I think it's very good and worth watching on a big screen with surround sound.",Guns Akimbo
33,arungeorge13,Turn your brains off and treat your eyes to some throwaway action! [+43%],4,21 May 2020,"Guns Akimbo is an uninspiring blend of a number of movies - it borrows the concept from Nerve (and partially from Gamer), tries to bring in the cockiness of Deadpool, adopts the rapidity of Crank, and goes guns blazing à la The Boondock Saints. Since the plot is derivative, it needed to fire on all cylinders in the other departments. Unfortunately, it doesn't. I admire Radcliffe's choice of roles even though this one is best forgotten from his filmography. Samara Weaving is the true badass here - heck, Guns Akimbo would have been a lot better if it featured her as the lead instead.The set-pieces are a stoned video-gamer's wet dream. It's brimming with opaque colors, bullets flying past heavily graffitied walls, shaky camerawork, non-stop action, and a sorry excuse for a storyline. Writer-director Jason Lei Howden gets some of the action bits right - fast-paced, gory, shot in brightly lit settings, and most all, very video-game like. However, I wondered why the ""biggest boss level"" (a.k.a the climax set-piece) in Guns Akimbo was not one of the film's major highlights. Rhys Darby (playing a vagrant) offers much-needed comic relief.P.S - Don't run around looking for logic in a film that revolves around the themes of the dark web, an underground criminal syndicate, and 95 minutes of bullet-fest. It's, in almost every way, a disposable flick!",Guns Akimbo

35,rivertam26,"Energetic, creative but sloppy and underdeveloped",6,26 May 2020,"On paper I should absolutely love this movie. My new favorite actress stars in it Samara Weaving of Ready or not along with the oddly charming Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter. The trailer showcases anime style violence, a weird video gamish plot and R RATING for extreme violence and gore. But somehow for the first 2/3 it just doesn't gel together. The setup concerns a loser type young man who does alot of hate blogging and ends up pissing off the creators of an online running man type gameshow. He awakes from being assaulted with two guns fused to his hands and the surviving gamer (Weaving) on the hunt for him. The movie is action packed but for the first half it doesn't connect. When it does it becomes a unique ultra violent, cartoonish cinematic experience. Although it's not great there's definitely enough here to merit a light reccomendation.3.25/5",Guns Akimbo

This is just all show and no substance, and while it's entertaining for what it is (with some funny parts), it's still leave you wanting for what it could have been with a better script. The directing is all over the place, visual effects vary from impressive to film school project, and while Daniel Radcliffe is doing an excellent jobs, others like Samara Weaving are just plain terrible.

40,blott2319-1,A mess that thinks too much of itself,3,8 July 2020,"In a way you have to admire Daniel Radcliffe's dedication to reinventing himself since Harry Potter. He has made a point of taking a number of odd roles and taking a lot of risks. Unfortunately, sometimes when you gamble you crap out, and such was the case when he ended up in Guns Akimbo. This film is one of those annoying movies that is overflowing with machismo and thinks it is so cool. The whole concept of the film is kind of moronic, but I guess it's supposed to be excused for that because it's not meant to be taken seriously. It feels like they were trying to mock the internet's obsession with the awful things in society, but the writer/director doesn't have the skill to deliver that kind of metaphor with any effectiveness. Instead, he actually indulges all those baser instincts, and makes a movie that totally glorifies them. Even the main character who is a self-professed pacifist who wants to be one man who does his best to make the world a better place, turns on a dime when his ex-girlfriend is in danger and becomes a gleeful killing machine. This movie would have made much more sense if the character was an internet troll himself, rather than a self-righteous ""troll-hunter,"" but perhaps someone suggested to Jason Lei Howden that would make the hero too unlikable. Although, there's some irony there in the fact that Howden himself has turned into a bit of a troll since this movie came out.But there's more wrong with this film than just the failed attempt at making a point. For starters, the comedy is almost all atrocious. Just like I said that Guns Akimbo gives off the aura that it thinks it is so cool, it also thinks it is so funny. With its quirky characters that say silly and unexpected things, they are trying hard, but I didn't even chuckle. The villains in particular are odd and each have their own unusual way of talking, but I found them tedious and annoying. Plus the ""joke"" of Radcliffe trying to do mundane things with guns instead of hands got old really fast. Another big problem with Guns Akimbo is that it tries to be clever by adding references to how things are in ""the real world"" despite the fact that the entire film takes place in this insane fantasy land. For example, you can't make a point of saying that gunshots are so loud that they make our hero's ears ring after one shot (and would render Rambo deaf) but then later have a character wielding a gatling gun with zero ear protection. You have to pick a lane and stay in it, but this film bounces around constantly and it takes away from the story. Radcliffe does his best with what he's given, and there's a small cameo from Rhys Darby that is the only time I even smiled while watching. The rest of the time I just found Guns Akimbo dumb or depressing. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but I certainly don't want to see it again.",Guns Akimbo
41,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Ridiculous, violent fun.",6,19 December 2020,"Perhaps you've seen the meme? Daniel Radcliffe is out in public in his boxers and a robe and gesticulating wildly with two pistols in his hands. That meme comes from this movie. Guns Akimbo (2019) is the kind of movie you think it is: ridiculous and gratuitous. Going in, I knew I couldn't take this film seriously, and it certainly didn't disappoint. I was expecting something along the lines of Shoot 'em Up (2006) and got what I wanted out of it.Sure, the premise is flimsy, and the characters are one-dimensional, but I came to have fun, and I certainly laughed quite a few times during this movie's short runtime. I think if this film took itself more seriously, it wouldn't have been the fun popcorn flick it turned out to be. That being said, I can appreciate how it is self-aware enough to recognize some of the challenges of having two guns bolted to your hands, let alone occasionally mentioning how it's probably a serious medical problem that would need immediate hospitalization to solve.What gets me is how Guns Akimbo could actually be something really great if it took a little effort and ditched the comedy. The moments before the credits roll gave a glimpse of a plot that would be interesting as a serious sequel. Even some of the subplots between the minor characters had some heft to them and almost seemed to be included to ground this film in the action genre before it would go off the rails with an insane set-piece moments later. Of course, this premise is so ridiculous that there's no way it could be made without the self-aware comedy that runs throughout.Ridiculous, violent fun, I give Guns Akimbo 3.0 stars out of 5.",Guns Akimbo

The trailer looked like some fun trash and the first 30 mins of the film itself were pretty good. After that, it was just getting more boring and tedious up until the end.My main problem was that everything in the film felt half-baked, unfinished. The main character wasn't likable and he never had an arc. They say that the film is not a love story but in the end, it still was, and a pretty boring one. The action was done well but it never actually felt. CGI muzzles, shots and blood don't really convince me, but maybe it's just my thing. I know that using blanks and all that stuff is probably more expensive and slows down the production but at least it feels real.The film was supposed to be edgy and colorful to attract the younger audiences but it never did anything cool tbh. It's pretty safe and it doesn't try to surprise you or go full ham. The ending was nonsensical and boring.The action just for the sake of it is not enough to ground your movie on (and it has nothing to do with low budget action). Trust Michael Bay on this, he did 6 Underground (2019), an action film with a 150 mil budget and no story at all it still sucked.",Guns Akimbo
45,msbreviews,Guns Akimbo is the craziest film of 2020... and I had a blast!,7,28 April 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As it becomes more and more common nowadays, I have to start this review by stating that no controversy surrounding this film affected my opinion in any way. I'm feeling a bit exhausted about the fact that almost every movie has some sort of external problem entirely unrelated to its story or characters. You can watch whatever you want, no one will make you watch this or that film. As long as you don't purposefully give a negative review based on something that has nothing to do with the movie itself, I'm fine with people skipping them. That said...I really enjoyed Guns Akimbo! I mean, how can someone not feel entertained by Daniel Radcliffe dressed in his robe with guns attached to his hands? Or by Samara Weaving taking a step up in craziness compared to Ready or Not? There's no denying that this film is extremely violent, bloody, and it doesn't shy away from having a clear social commentary. The latter is not only evident, but it undoubtedly demonstrates something everyone knows it's true: Internet trolls are the worst!Actually, I wish Jason Lei Howden would have gone even further. There's a lot of potential in a movie like this, and while it's safely above average, it could have been at the top of the most entertaining films of the last few years. Still, I wholeheartedly love this take on a subject that everyone (online film critics especially) unfortunately has to deal with every day. A part of me wished it was real... Every time a ""troll alert"" was activated, that person would have to leave its comfortable, safe couch, and battle TO THE DEATH other online cowards in real-life... okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get my point.The action is as crazy as the concept itself. It goes by without saying, but obviously, this is one of those flicks which asks the viewer to simply accept and enjoy the unrealistic, far-fetched, no-way-he-could-have-survived-that action. The camera work (cinematography by Stefan Ciupek) suits the videogame-style employed by the action, and even though some sequences are admittedly way too over-the-top, the majority of these scenes are either pure entertainment or truly hilarious. Oh, and Michael Bay, if you're reading this: Guns Akimbo gives a neat demo on how to make explosions look really cool AND advance the narrative.The two leads are fantastic and share great chemistry. Daniel Radcliffe has been doing some overlooked/underrated work post-Harry Potter (definitely check out Swiss Army Man), and he's very funny throughout the whole runtime. On the opposite side, Samara Weaving apparently found his comfort zone in portraying completely lunatic, insane psychopaths. Both deliver incredibly entertaining performances, carrying the whole movie through all of its wild action and comedic bits.Jason Lei Howden isn't able to control the film's pacing very well, but it never becomes overwhelming. However, the tone is spot-on. Guns Akimbo never tries to be something more than what it actually is. It keeps the narrative simple and fun without complex layers or extreme romantic endeavors. It never says to the viewer, ""I know the action is absurdly over-the-top, but here's a really emotional scene that you're supposed to care about"". It's an entertainment-driven story with no real emphasis on character development, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.Guns Akimbo is the craziest movie of 2020, so far. Jason Lei Howden doesn't hold back on the brutal, violent, bloody, extremely over-the-top action, and as long as the viewer is able to accept this purposefully unrealistic depiction of a real-life videogame death-match, it's a blast of pure entertainment. The social message is evident, and it's perfectly suited for today's online trolls, who hide behind their monitor. Daniel Radcliffe and Samara Weaving are amazing together, both delivering hilarious performances. Unfortunately, this film doesn't reach its full potential. It lacks control of its pacing, but I genuinely wish Howden would have gone all-out regarding the social thematic. It's a good, fun movie, but it could have great. Still, it's undoubtedly a recommendation of mine, unless the (dumb) controversy surrounding this film clouds your judgment. In this case, just skip it and let others enjoy it.Rating: B",Guns Akimbo

Voluntarily embracing its immoderate nature in execution. Despite being openly zealous about the identity it upholds; the end result was nowhere close to gratification.
This is one of those asinine productions, that could only be lauded for the entertainment value it brings on the table.
From an artistic point of view; the colorful visuals were carefully conducted.
Those being all wacky & experimental; but irrefutably attainable.
However, when the discussion switches to soundtrack; the outlook shifts to the opposite side of the spectrum!
Song selections have been atrocious, and an erring timing of them makes it even worse!
When moving onto probably the foremost aspect of the film; 'The Action'. Luckily there's an abundance of it; but dirt cheap CGI somewhat mitigates the overall experience.
Performance wise, Both Daniel & Samara played their roles with enough competence. Others were sub-par at best.In the end, it's kind of a guilty pleasure.
A delightful watch for casual viewers who might not even care much about the context.
They just wanna be entertained after a long week. And It undoubtedly prospers in that regard.

I went into this not having a clue what it's about or anything and I'm genuinely surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. The best way to describe this film is if Crank meets Nerve. This over the top violence associated with an app that people watch to see the violence.It's just really fun, the gun scenes (and there's a lot of them) are really well shot and enjoyable to watch. And the plot itself is really simple to understand, characters are likeable and you start to really back them not to die. The small elements of comedy added to the fun aspect also. It's definitely a unique style in the way the story is told and illustrated to us. But in my opinion, it works so well!!Only negative things I have to say is that the ending was kind of predictable, you knew what was coming and how it was going to go down. Even though I enjoyed the comedy elements, I thought a few jokes were a little too forced.But overall it's a fun watch and if genuine recommend giving it a go.

Second, the script and the story are pretty weak and a nonsense. Not sure if this movies was made only for people that were born around the 00's that lives in the love or hate era (Everything is 1 or 10).
Last, the ending could have been far better, you know what I mean. Not original, not fun, nothing new. Same boring story. So, overal a crazy attempt to create something new that fails on abusing on movie's cliches.",Guns Akimbo

This is quite far from Harry Potter, and though it is mainly a chasing and hiding movie, it has some fun elements. Having guns attached to his hands had some comedic scenes, and the action was cartoony but fun. In fact, I'm not sure but this is probably based on some sort of anime that would probably be more fun to watch, but I still enjoyed it for what it was.",Guns Akimbo

60,TwistedContent,Flawed and Nearly Aimless but Fun Eye Candy,7,28 February 2020,"""Guns Akimbo"" or, in other words, Jason Lei Howden's millennial, culturally relevant in 2019 spiritual relative of ""Crank"". Jokes (and Howden's twitter mess) aside, ""Guns Akimbo"" provides some real fun, mostly in terms of action and other visual treats, with Radcliffe and Weaving adding bonus points. Other than that, it's flawed enough.""Guns Akimbo"" introduces us to a world much like ours plus ""Schism"", which we, thankfully, don't have as of yet. The hero, or, in simple terms, a loser (un)intentionally steps on Schism's admin's toes and now has been pitted against the champion Nix with revolvers bolted to his hands. What follows is nearly 90 minutes of action - chases, gunfights, racing, explosions and so on and so forth. It's undeniably entertaining visually and is supported by creative and dynamic camerawork, vivid and explosive color grading and crafty editing that's reaching over the line of overkill at times. Rest assured that violence gets provided in satisfactory amounts. There's so much action that compensates for the lack of some other elements & eventually ""Guns Akimbo"" can turn out mind-numbing for some. Radcliffe and Weaving are definitely having fun, offer up playful performances and some hit&miss one-liners. The comedy in ""Guns Akimbo"" is indeed of the hit&miss nature, perhaps maybe even more on the miss side. Jason Lei Howden has tried to insert social commentary, talk about our generation's thirst for blood and utter necessity to feel better at all times, the awful mess that internet is, but that all finishes its run in like the first 1/3 of the movie. Point being, ""Guns Akimbo"" essence and point is mostly just high entertainment value. And it's good in those terms. Besides our two shining leads, Ned Dennehy also adds some fun, being maybe a little too comicky, but eccentric and pleasantly insane villain.""Guns Akimbo"" is a top tier action flick, top notch indie eye candy & an absolute blast for the hero of the day, Daniel Radcliffe. Past all that, it's just an okay movie. If you need some fast-paced, no-brakes, easy-on-the-brain fun, this goes out as recommendation especially for You. My rating: 7/10.",Guns Akimbo

From the trailer you know what kind of movie it is.. a pseudo-videogame setup and style that is as obvious as it is predictable, and it hurts it a lot. An internet troll is involved in the murder game of Skizm. Will he live or die? Who cares..What can you expect from daniel raddcliffe after ""Swiss Army Man""? To deliver an okay role.. specially noteworthy when he becomes useful out of nowhere. The rest of the cast is equally okay, and no one really stands out. The dialogue is painfully dull as well as the development of the script. The cinematography is good at times, and so is the color usage on most sets!

Leaving aside the poster and the opening title card that are basically a ripoff of Suicide Squad, the quality is extremely low. There are a few creative scenes with a pretty decent editing, but overall the movie feels generic, both technically and narratively speaking. Because this kind of movies does not have an even remotely decent or interesting story, they should have aim everything to the photography and creative shooting. In fact the first half of the movie accomplish that, but on the second one, the movie looks pretty generic, with uninspired camera movements and random action scenes.I am pretty sure that if Daniel Radcliffe was not in the movie, nobody would watch this garbage, because honestly the rest of the cast is formed by semi-unknown actors, that I have never seen on my life. I have to say that I was very disappointed to see such an actor, waste his talent for a film like this one.There are for sure way better action movie out there, with even better stories, photography and editing.

But if you were to watch this movie for what it's intended to do, you could enjoy this movie. Yes, Guns Akimbo has many issues, but its sole purpose was to entertain, and to entertain it did. The action is over the top, and a little disturbing at times, but I think its mediocre action is what gives it its charm. The plot is also quite crazy; I actually think it's more insane than the action. A guy who has guns bolted to his hands, who is forced to fight for his life, all while being watched online by thousands. And there are a lot of issues with its plot, but to say that the plot is stupid, is to say that the Earth is round.What's funny is that I agree with the 1 star reviews, and I also agree with the 10 star reviews.

68,movieman6-413-929510,Starting director tries to show how bad internet scrolling is in a far-fetched way.,6,6 March 2020,"Guns Akimbo is a new action comedy directed and written by Jason Lei Howden, the director of Deathgasm.In the film, Miles (Daniel Radcliffe) works for a video game developers company. He tries to find internet scrolls that falsely ridicule his company's video games. Miles may fight internet scrolls during the day, but every night he also plays an internet scroll to ridicule others. When Miles then ridicules a secret gang called Skizm, he is kidnapped by this gang and two guns are attached to his hands. Miles has to take part in the illegal game of Skizm where he has to compete against other people who have to kill each other, while people can follow the fights online. To stay alive, Miles tries to play the game as unobtrusively as possible. When the people of Skizm force Miles to take more risk in the game or else his ex-girlfriend Nova (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) threatens to do something about it. Miles takes more risk in the game, but will have to compete against Nix (Samara Weaving), the best player in the game.Director Jason Lei Howden is more known in the film world as someone who works on special effects in films. He did this with films such as: War for the Planet of the Apes, The Avengers and The Wolverine. This does work that he does together with an entire team. This is only the second film he has directed, which unfortunately can be seen. He has put the film together in a messy way, because the film often jumps from one scene to another. He also filmed many images a little to be mobile. The film, for example, is full of hurried, rotating images that may bother people who are not so good at it. The story of this film is similar to the story of the 2016 film Nerve in which Emma Roberts and Dave Franco played the lead roles. The exaggerated villains from the film look more like they came from the 1987 Schwarzenegger movie The Running Man.
Jason Lei Howden also made this film to show how bad something like online bullying can be, which is often done by internet scrolling. Nowadays, with everything that is possible online, cyberbullying is something that people quickly use to bother others or make them uncertain. Jason unfortunately did this in a wrong way later by also working as an internet roll, to show how annoying an internet roll can be. For example, he and this film got a bit negative in the news.The effects look good in the action scenes and it seems credible that there are real guns attached to the hands of the main character. So the action scenes seem a bit exaggerated, but amusing about it. It can be seen that the characters are in front of a green screen, because the explosions in the film seem less realistic.Daniel Radcliffe looks good as the main characters and you can see that he had fun making this film. He comes across as someone who does not represent much in real life, but tries to share his opinion about certain things with the world in his anonymous life. It's nice to see someone so insecure change into someone who needs more confidence to save a loved one. Samara Weaving's character seems a bit like a more exaggerated version of the character Hit-Girl from the Kick-Ass films only without a good background story. The actors who play the villains in the film seem a bit too exaggerated, making them difficult to take seriously.",Guns Akimbo
69,ritera1,Moves fast and well made but,8,21 March 2021,"...extremely similar to the style of directors Neveldine/Taylor (of the Crank movies and Gamer).Characters and situation established fast and we're off. Liked Radcliff and had never seen him in anything before (seriously). Weaving sold the action well (with funny cracks at the end). Just also saw her in Mayhem, a similar satirical movie. She's a natural for this genre.Strong look of 80s apocalyptic B-movies. Probably also why all the 80s pop songs.Ned Dennehy as the baddie likely a very good actor but really not a good choice for this. Looked like some old man in odd and bad tattoos. No real menace. But then realized he resembles old character actor creep Michael Berryman from 1977's ""The Hills Have Eyes."" He was very good in ""Mandy.""Decent comedy. Sympathetic with Nik and her past but thought, even for this, her coming to sanity was too easy. I guess you sacrifice reason for comedy but I noticed.Production values and the detail in the shoot-outs are very high, except for some noticeable but brief sloppiness. The ""viewers"" were likely all filmed in one sitting as days go by and they have the same clothes and are in the same locations.Recommended good ""fun.""

Some of the action scenes are well done but overall the violence does gets very cartoonish and unbelievable. The movie is way too unrealistic and tries to offer social commentary about how people are glued to their mobile devices and desensitized to extreme violence.

Some projects are good, some are not but his repertoire is getting bigger every year.This time a trash action that stunned me by its weird trailer. Bolting guns to somebody's hands is not that fun as it looks like. Especially, when you want him to be fully operational for the fight. And oh yeah, he is not a skilled killer, remember? In a nutshell, this movie is about a hunt for a handicapped person, no offence.I remember some good movies about survival games, remember ""Death race""? That was a lot of fun and believe it or not was a bit justified. Here? No explanation. Full carnage without any repercussions. Realism goes down the drain. Good plot goes there too with that slurping sound.The incredible luck and dumb decisions are the real heroes of the movie. Why would anyone spend time and money on training to shoot, if you can become an incredible ninja firing left and right in mid air, giving head-shots in a spectacular fashion?Sure, you will say: this is a trash action movie, chill! Okay, but the shootout scenes were so woozy that most of the time you couldn't understand a thing. Tons of CGI blood were not helping.Overall, I have spent a mighty half of the movie on making why ""what's wrong with them"" face and other trying to recover my eyesight of random blinking of explosions and gunshots.

Are you expecting Shakespearean grade storytelling from a movie whose main character has guns bolted to his hands? This is meant to be pure entertainment and it delivers balls to the wall action mixed with over the top humour. I was genuinely entertained while watching this and I'm glad I decided to ignore the negativity surrounding it. It's best to just suspend belief and enjoy this film for what it is.,Guns Akimbo

101,alexscott-35299,Bats**t crazy!,7,17 July 2021,"This movie is crazy violent, crazy stupid and crazy fun! I watched this not expecting much and ended up having a great time. It's stupid how ridiculous this movie is, it's violent as all hell and the story is so stupid it's enjoyable. I love how unrealistic and over the top the story is, Daniel Radcliffe is actually really good in this and plays the role really well with his over the top stupid acting and the fact he over plays every scene just adds to the stupidness. The editing is what makes this movie flow so well, it's almost like an Edgar Wright movie with all the quick cut editing and fast past story telling, I really enjoyed that part of it and I think it's what made the movie really interesting. I was so surprised by how much I laughed at this film, it's genuinely hilarious because of the insane scenarios the characters end up in. I cannot recommend this movie enough especially for someone just looking for a good laugh whilst watching a movie. It's a definite must watch and I will continue to defend this movie as I genuinely think there is some good things in here. Go watch it!",Guns Akimbo
102,GavWaskett,Guns Akimbo - snigger!,7,13 September 2020,"Well this is an incredibly screwed up film. Daniel Radcliffe continues to try and shed the HP image and does so by picking some really crazy roles along the way - Igor (Victor Frankenstein), A dead body (Swiss Army Man) and showing his wand to all and sundry on stage in Equus.
In the near future, people enjoy seeing online combatants roaming the cities fighting each other computer game style, blood, gore and bystander casualties abound!
Radcliffe is keyboard warrior Miles whose typing skills end up getting him two guns screwed to his hands and from then on he is screwed. Up against Samar Weaving's Nix, with the world watching, the police hunting, the criminals kidnapping and Nix being completely psychopathic, it all gets a bit daft!
Samara Weaving is fast turning into one of my favourite actresses after this and the excellent Ready or Not and you will be right in thinking that Nigel from Jumanji (Rhys Darby) pops up as well - he is utterly nuts and a great characters.
This is a hard one to call, the first half annoyed me as he was just wet, but the second half was just bonkers and very computer gameesque. I loved it.
It's not one for the faint-hearted, I mean his hand have guns nailed into them (weirdly though it doesn't seem to hurt him - it must be his Potter genes!).
A 14/20 from me for its pure silliness and action. If the first half was better, it could've been great. And it gets bonus points as he kept his wand its his holster! And also for use of the word Akimbo in its title.",Guns Akimbo

But I just found the aesthetics of this movie too ugly, just unremitting unsightliness - the tattoo'd people, the locations, the costumes, all so so ugly.
The storyline was nothing special, not too bad, not too original -- but absolutely not enough to justify what my eyes had to go through.There's always been a market for this sort of nihilistic look, since at least the 70's. But it's not for me!",Guns Akimbo

And he did not disappoint, giving his all in a badass yet endearing performance. Despite the violence, the story is gripping enough to keep one interested. Samara Weaving provides good support as a rival who becomes his sidekick. The pace is tight, and there are enough humorous lines to provide much-needed comic relief. Still, i don't think i would have liked this movie as much if Daniel Radcliffe wasn't the lead. For me, the movie scores because of him.",Guns Akimbo
106,greggman,Mean spirited bad movie,3,6 March 2021,"You'd think I'd be into this movie. I liked Shoot'Em Up and I've enjoyed lots of b-action movies. One of my favorites of all time is Planet Terror.What didn't work for me is just how rotten the entire world is in Guns Akimbo. Pretty much every person in it is portrayed as rotten to the core. All the fans. All the people watching Skizm. The person the main character runs into at the game center. Even the main character starts off trolling and watching Skizm.I can't say why that didn't work for me. To give another example I like Death Race the 2008 film but it works (for me) because I care that Jensen, the main character, gets his revenge. I can't say why I didn't care that Miles, the main character here, gets the same. Both movies there's a bad guy. Both movies the main character gets forced into action. But something about this movie just rubbed me wrong and I was gritting my teeth in a bad way the entire time.I didn't want Miles to win, I didn't care what happened to Nix or Riktor. I also didn't care about Nova. Maybe it's that Jensen's wife's death, his false conviction for her murder, and his living daughter were just more sympathetic than Miles affection for his x-girlfriend.I don't think that's it though. I think rather this movie has no heart. It's just mean to the core. I didn't laugh at the fun they were making of society. It just didn't work for me even though based on the description I'd have expected to be totally into it.",Guns Akimbo

The action and shootout scenes are very well done, with some sharp direction and editing. The story is a little too absurd and not based in reality whatsoever, but that's the point.

110,criscal,"Over the top, but enjoyable",7,30 March 2021,The movie has the premise of putting the main character into a role that he would only have in some action computer games like say Doom. The main character is a nerd working in some sort of software sweat shop for a game he doesn't like. So he is absolutely not suited for the gun crazy action he is about to go through.The action is over the top and follow choreography as in computer games at times.

GUNS AKIMBO is his second feature, a gun violence heavy action movie with tons of low grade humour that hits the mark more often than not.GUNS AKIMBO is not to be taken seriously, the visuals are over the top, nasty but never quite realistic. All the car chases and the shootouts are designed to amuse rather than inspire awe. Yes with all its visual effects heaviness GUNS AKIMBO is a very small film, rather a satire on modern social media and a tribute to such classics as RUNNING MAN.For what it is GUNS AKIMBO works pretty well.

127,thomasmitilis1995,"BEHIND THE KEYBOARD, I'M THE ULTIMATE TROLLHUNTER...",5,30 April 2020,PROS:Guns Akimbo is a mindless entertaining popcorn flick. It's a social commentary about the world of internet and how dangerous can be. Daniel Radcliffe proves again how underated he is and Samara Weaving (almost unrecognisable) nails her role as the lunatic Nix. Their chemistry is strong and they seem to have fun with each other. The music choices are interesting and the visual effects reinforce the video-game aesthetic.CONS:The film tries to be cool but it never reaches the level of movies like Scott Pillgrim or Crank. The villains are very cartoonish and not indimitating enough. Weaving's character has been presented as the most badass player but she repeatedly misses to shoot her opponent. The editing of the action scenes is irritating and the dialogue is stuffed with cheesy one-liners.,Guns Akimbo

Of course his opponent is the baddest fighter of them all and to prove it they have an opening sequence where, car spinning at the same time, she takes out a series of opponents with perfectly placed shots. Amazing skills that apparently go right down the toilet as she fires several hundred shots at our hero, all of which miss. Yes, it's that kind of movie.
Daniel Radcliffe did very well for himself in the Harry Potter series but now it looks like he feels he is typecast and will do anything to break the mold.

I enjoyed the wacky tone of the movie. Several scenes were beautifully done and included some ridiculously cool action scenes. The main character, miles, had a great character arc. Miles started off as the mild mannered guy and had his world turned upside down and thought the film he is slowly turned into the mass murderer guns akimbo. I enjoyed the story itself. The pacing was good and I was never bored throughout the movie. Now that I'm finished with the good as always there is the badd.
Unfortunately this film suffers from bad dialog. Sometimes the jokes were pretty forced and there were a lot of snappy one liners but nothing of substance. Also, they should have used the story of nix enter father a little more in the story. It would have made some great dramatic moments.And I wasn't a big fan of many of the supporting cast members. None of the characters had charisma or even a good back story. They kind of filled the stereotypical henchmen roll. Finally they really screwed up with the moral of the film. The moral is that we love violence and we need that violence to be entertained. Unfortunately in the dialog they just plain say it, you're supposed to allude to it. But what do I know.

In Guns Akimbo, it was engaging to watch how he would do normal things with these guns screwed into his hands like using a phone, opening doors, and even urinating!

If you enjoyed Crank 2 or the more recent Hardcore Henry this will be right up your alley.The Premise is a little overdone at this point, in what feels like the 5th or 6th major movie in only a couple of years to use what I will call... 'Internet Colosseum', whereby, faceless users log in to a website/app to witness terrible acts of violence and stupidity for their dystopian entertainment.The action and performances are fine, there is little point trying to pick out CGI problems as it all looks pretty convincing nowdays, even on the low budget end.There are more than enough nods (or easter eggs) to fill out the background and add another level of interest for geeks who like that sort of thing.Guns Akimbo looses some points however, for falling straight into the culture war pit during the opening sequence.
And I will start this off by clarifying... Samara Weaving is excellent, stands head and shoulders above her peers with non-conforming choices on and off screen.
That being said, why does making her a badass have to be so off the charts cringe when compared to the rest of the 'unlikely' comic book tounge-in-cheek style sequences?A little subtlety goes much further than blatant invincible whamen slow-mo.
Other than that, well worth a watch, even if it doesn't blow your mind being unpredictable.",Guns Akimbo

Samara Weaving does have a knack for horror-comedy films but she did really well in this thriller-comedy.The Good - I like the concept of the film. It has this futuristic, techno punk vibe to it. The movie basically reminded me of Scott Pilgrim meets Kick-Ass. Even the animations and gore are inspired from the mentioned movies. What I couldn't miss from the movie was Ned Dennehy. He has set up a bar for me. You know what, he can actually play Rick if Rick & Morty ever come for live-action :)The Bad - Ah the story falls short in the end. But I had no intentions of watching this movie with logic. Some movies are enjoyed when you go with the flow!Well I would recommend this movie as a one-time watch. It is colorful, trippy, grotesque and won't let you down in comedy. You can watch this movie if you have time to kill and also when you have no logic to spare.",Guns Akimbo

I could have sworn it was as it tries to hard to look and feel like one but there is one problem with it.. and that's Samara Weaving..I was expecting more out of Samara but she either looks bored or she's completely wrong for this casting. Not sure which one. Daniel Radcliffe on the other hand puts up a decent effort but her performance it's a bit of a downer for me.I did like the premise in general and thought that the execution could have been better.

Yes, it is funny, but the humor is pretty NZ. (I actually laughed at one liners!!! Those that know me, know this is not my M.O.)This movie is smart and silly and cliche in all the right ways. The camera work is crazy fast and a little nauseating at times, but you have to admire the creativity and sheer manic dedication. We all particularly loved the video game flourishes.In fact, visually the movie is excellent, and we all agreed that the production value is off the chain. (Good work, everyone!) Acting is also excellent.My personal favorite: the script is pretty tight- especially for a shoot 'em up, action film like this. It is fast and you have to pay attention. The writing doesn't spoon feed you anything, you have to keep up.
Is the story ridiculous? YES! Does it follow some sort of logic? Yes again!
I wasn't going to review this film until I saw all of the negative reviews which are frankly unmerited. I think a lot of people are put off by the female bad ass who shows no tit, does not fall in love, and remains a bad ass to the end. Yay sexism!",Guns Akimbo

Lead actor is handling his role quite well even though the script is a bit off and dialogues are sometimes unrelated. Why I give 5 stars is lead female character cannot act and it is a fact plus I believe the script is pushed so much to get these two characters together . Bad characters are so unreasonably weak and somehow too much talkative leaves you feeling empty towards them. Ending is plain stupid , if they could have put some more thought and more funnier way to end the story it would have been much easier for them to shoot another one .

As it so happens the gladiatorial show runner decides to throw our unwilling hero into the carnage to teach him a lesson. The movie relies heavily on violence and cheesy comedy. There are some interesting moments such as when the protagonist relays misconceptions about guns and injuries through his funny monologue as he discovers them himself. The problem however is that comedy was pushed too far in some situations. Nix's showdown with another key psychopath was too wacky. The main villain's lines again were too much. But overall it was a lighthearted fun ride.The review that popped up first was complaining that the movie was unpleasantly preachy about how bad the internet is. I guess the trolls' favourite slur, showed in the movie, ""triggered"" got some friendly fire. Afterwards he or she continued to just pin absurd things on this movie when it really doesn't take itself too serious. It doesn't pretend to know the real truth about violence in society or mock millennials. When a clearly unpleasant character makes an unsavoury remark about millennials it's not an actual criticism intended by the movie. If you believe otherwise then I question your intelligence.

The action was ok but the gags seemed to be laboured. In the midst of machine gun carnage, Schwarzenegger was able to deliver ridiculous one liners that worked better (Commando/Red heat). Even films like Crank or Kill Bill had better insane comedic moment. The story and the gags aren't the problem in this movie: it's Daniel Radcliffe. He simply cannot lead a movie.When Radcliffe is in a supporting role he excels (Frankenstein/Kill your Darlings). Equally, when his role has to be understated to allow the story to develop (Woman in Black/Jungle), He can play these well enough. However, as a leading man he almost struggles to be convincing. In Now You See Me 2 (which, admittedly didn't do anyone any favours) he was excruciatingly bad.Radcliffe is not a bad actor but he appears to be choosing roles that do not play to his strengths.

They over-did the comedy for the second half. At any second, someone might jump up and shoot them, gun shot sounds are everywhere, and what the main character does? He talks with the girl without looking around as if he's in the picnic. The scenes were ridiculous, unrealistic, boring.",Guns Akimbo

230,LumosX,"A brilliant, satirical examination of modern-day losers and the real world",10,21 July 2021,"What can I say, this film is fantastic. A truly deranged, politically incorrect tale of a man pushed to the brink, broken, and then pushed further, combined with stylish action scenes, gratuitous violence, and no filters.Daniel Radcliffe, whom I believe I've only seen in Harry Potter and My Boy Jack, is fantastic as the useless protagonist: the ultimate brainless virtue-signalling soyboy cuck, a miserable loser and nobody who turns into a ""keyboard warrior"" at home, and whose greatest skill is reporting ""offensive"" and ""triggering"" comments whilst believing he's in the right for doing so. In other words, the epitome of the left-leaning Reddit poster NPC. His name is Miles, Latin for ""soldier"", ironic and aptly chosen, as he is the exact opposite of a soldier: a limp-wristed idiot who despises himself and his worthless life. Fantastic performance by Radcliffe, who even pulls off an emasculated American accent; I can't help but think he was perfectly selected for the role, given some of his real political stances.After pissing off the wrong crowd with his big words in online comments, Miles wakes up with two extended-mags handguns literally bolted into his hands, and is forced to abandon the artificial, empty trappings of his virtual existence and plunge into the real world, going through a brutal and savage rite of passage that will see him either turn into a man, or die a coward.The premise is ridiculous and over the top, as is the overall plot and the gunfights; the execution, however, keeps the viewer amused, entertained, and excited throughout. Whilst the story beats are somewhat predictable, there are a few interesting twists thrown in here and there; humorous moments are present as well, and some hit the mark exactly.The film is notable for depicting things correctly: Miles, the useless urbanite soyboy, is thoroughly mocked; the denizens of the Internet are depicted truthfully, raw and harsh when stripped of political correctness and hugbox content filters; the 50-kilo woman gets her ass handed to her in a hand-to-hand fight with a burly man that's twice her weight. No sugar coating or content filtering. No preaching or veiled political messaging. Just things as they are. The writer and director Jason Lei Howden, apparently a controversial figure, has won my respect.Some viewers may find the violence-and again, it is gratuitous-off-putting; but it is that stark contrast between the violent nature of ""the real world"" and Miles's cozy, useless, and artificial existence that hammers home the main point: once the pretence of orderliness is thrown away, and you're forced to come head-on with a challenge you've never prepared for, your spinelessness and complacency will either kill you or be violently and brutally forced out of you by the real world, which is very much unlike an online subreddit hugbox. The real world is the same as it's always been, and no amount of codes of conduct or online virtue signalling will change that.I look forward to Howden's future work. If this is anything to go by, it'll be something worth watching.",Guns Akimbo

To prove that he is a real actor and not a creature of one character, Radcliffe has continued to risk it all in a wide variety of his artistic experiments. He is ready to appear naked on stage in a potentially perilous performance, he then went with a movie crew to film in an actual jungle and he now plays in a movie where the plot goes non-stop and there can be no respite from action at all.The main character of the movie is an unfortunate reclusive video game developer who never parts with a cup of coffee and tends to spend his weekends at home wearing a dirty robe. However, one day, everything changes when Miles is pulled out and forced to become a member of a dangerous game called ""SKIZM"". The purpose of the event seems simple, but that is a dangerous misconception. Homicidal lunatics are running the streets and firing at each other. Viewers pay money to watch this event, its sadistic organizers are pleased by its chaos. It is only the participants who can never feel safe.This is really crazy but a totally enthralling experience. The movie is really interesting and holds viewers in complete suspense. You just sit and keep an eye on Radcliffe, who had transformed for this role and does not even look like himself. His hero, Miles, is a typical nonstarter, but at the same time he has the kind of luck most people can only dream of in real life.

I just couldn't get in to this movie. I like action films. And I like Radcliff. But at best, I was amused by this movie; just not in a positive way. More often than not, I found myself laughing at how obtuse the plausibility, the acting, and predictability of the entire plot line.
This movie does bring an uncommon concept to the table, so I cannot say it entirely ""missed the mark"". As far as concepts go, it was well done.
However my biggest complaint is the end....
There is no gradual flip to main characters morality switch. Through the greater part of the movie the main character maintains his objections to being forced to participate. He fumbles through every encounter and when he does shoot his guns...it's generally by accident.

266,metaCity,Would you watch this show?,7,22 July 2020,"This is a splatterpunk tale, updated for the streaming era. It stars Daniel Radcliffe and Samara Weaving as combatants in the latest online tv sensation - Skism. Guns Akimbo has just enough story, characterisation, especially for Daniel Radcliffe, and depth to lift it above its action scenes of gun fights, car chases, and combat delivered in a mix of high intensity and slow motion with whirling cinematography, to deliver a film that has something to say about cultural production today.
Radcliffe plays Miles, a small-time programmer who falls foul of the makers of Skism, an underground show streamed live where contestants fight to the death and the winner gets to live and play again, and again, and again. Looking for a new angle to freshen up the format, the producers decide to throw mild-mannered geek Miles into the game, nailing two giant guns to his hands and pitting him against one of their most feared killers, Nix, Samara Weaving. We follow this odd couple through the film as Miles struggles to stay alive long enough to figure out how to use his phone without hands and Nix chases him with a variety of high-powered weapons, believing one more kill will finally free her from the game.
Weaving and Radcliffe are both strong leads and much of Guns Akimbo's attraction comes from watching them duelling their way across the city. Samara Weaving is in full suicide blonde mode, playing a game she can never win, until she decides to blow the game up from the inside. She has just a sliver of a backstory but that's all she needs. Her character is all about chaotic energy, and weapons, lots of weapons. Radcliffe is excellent as millennial everyman Miles, a sad man who sits at home, under his Rambo and Schwarzenegger posters hurling insults at the world from his keyboard.
The film has a stop-start pace, allowing secondary characters space to come through and this gives the film a solid extra layer. The most notable are Rhys Darby, playing a homeless tramp with wit and charm, and Ned Dennehy, playing Skism supremo Riktor as a psychopathic entrepreneur.
It is Riktor who reveals the film's attitude to Skism and the wider culture. He is turning Skism into a global franchise, a brand name as recognisable as Starbucks or McDonalds, aiming for an audience who find watching people fight to the death as light and disposable an experience as buying a coffee or a burger. The postmodern claim that all cultural production is ultimately capitalist in origin and that modern consumption itself is a desire produced by capitalism makes it perfectly natural that Riktor should want Skism to become the ""Starbucks of murder"". Violence and murder as mass entertainment, consumption and desire all existed long before capitalism but in an era of mass markets, mass technology, and mass boredom capital has fused them all together to produce a new consumer: us.",Guns Akimbo

And there's at least one character that needed more depth I feel, which is of Nix.
Story isn't really that great and that's not why we would watch this, three direction and action and character are the things that keep us glued but I feel that a lot of plot holes could've easily been avoided and made it a much better movie to watch. The story is really in taters in some cases for example anyone in role of the protagonist would've made the obvious choice of surrendering to the police and there were plenty of chances to save himself from further complications., And given how he is portrayed to the intelligent kind here he should've easily gotten out of the situation unless there were other compelling reasons not to, which could have been easily implemented. Three other example is the injection of backstory elements to the charater of Nix and her entire portrayal which seriously could've been much more enhanced or removed completely.
But these imperfections can easily be forgotten and watch Radcliffe preform.",Guns Akimbo

Some seriously terrible lines, clunky exposition, thin characters. The villain is completely non threatening. It's a bummer it could've been so much better if they refined it more. There is some really funny stuff here and again, Radcliffe is on fire, (when he isn't forced to deliver horribly unfunny voiceover lines)

281,PellyTelly,It was a real mess,8,21 February 2020,"If you just walked past Miles on the street, most likely you would not pay much attention to him. He is an ordinary guy, who could be categorized as a typical loser who has no chance of reaching special heights in life. Yes, he is involved in the development of video games, but unlike his more successful colleagues, he does seemingly mediocre work and it is almost impossible for him to move up the career ladder.If things continued on this path, Miles would remain a nobody. It wasn't until the guys from SKIZM came over to him and everything began to change. Waking up with a headache from a heavy blow, Miles discovers guns in his hands. How could anyone react to such a development? Miles realizes that he has gotten into a real mess and now he has to drive around the city to save his life. But when he finds out that his girlfriend fell into the hands of the organizers, then the stakes grow to gigantic proportions and he certainly cannot fail.I liked the film; it was fun and very energetic. We have not seen such a crazy action movie in the cinema for a very long time and here we have Daniel Radcliffe in the leading role, on top of that! Of course, you cannot miss such a show. Especially if you can watch the movie on big screen and in the company of your best friends. Radcliffe is pushing himself to his creative limits and I like it! Also deserving of our attention is his colleague Samara Weaving, who lit it up last year with ""Ready or Not"", an excellent adventure thriller that got on my list of the coolest movies of the year 2019.Together with Radcliffe, Weaving smashes the city to smithereens! She should star in action films more often because she shines in this thrilling role! Of course this movie needs to be watched, but only if you are not very sensitive and can enjoy hard and tough scenes. You will see lots of blood, breaking bones and chases.

Despite the fact that there was really nothing new here and a pretty basic plot, I still enjoyed it for the most part. Decent date night movie for action fans.",Guns Akimbo
288,AlihasanAgha,A Trip,7,9 July 2020,"Guns Akimbo was a morbidly comical R rated, coked up and blood soaked hour and a half. Starring Samara Weaving (Nix) and Daniel Radcliffe (Miles) who were in my opinion great casting choices.
Following an internet troll obsessed with his ex, who picks the wrong fight and ends up with guns bolted into his hands and also in a death match against basically a female Terminator.
As far as the plot goes, Guns Akimbo was good, with a storyline integrating more depth into the individual characters. It wasn't a serious watch from anywhere but it got the audience invested. Swift and brutal plot twists and character deaths kept us on our toes. The pace remained fast through the whole movie also.
The movie held a consistently dark yet energetic and comical feel to it throughout. The light side of gritty, to be accurate. The theme of drug abuse was a focal point throughout the movie and certainly combined with the snappy editing and design made viewers feel like they themselves were tripping.
The humor was undoubtedly crass but not overtly so, to a point where it was still funny.
The casting choices done were exceptional for the main roles. Samara Weaving as Nix was a very fitting decision and perhaps her character may be my personal favorite feature of the movie. A great balance between hardcore and human.
Daniel Radcliffe was a surprise, Guns Akimbo did not seem the sot of movie that would attract the attention of an A grade star but I'm very glad it did. Building as a character from dislikable and obnoxious to so much more. Most of the side characters however were pretty forgettable sadly except for the homeless man.
The dialogue was mediocre for most of the cast but again Samara Weaving and Daniel Radcliffe were still far better than the rest.
Direction and writing is done by Jason Lei Howden who does a commendable job in making a B rated, lower budget movie seem like an A grade movie at various places. Certain shots are filmed very well, not to mention the little details, like Doom (2016) was playing on a screen. Also the movie did not shy away from gore and some other gleefully sickening content.
The score was above decent as well, which fit very well with some good electronic tracks and the dead or alive track thrown in was also a very good fit.
The cinematography is not bad at all using well timed slow motion and focused shots and some great action shots.
Production and special effects was also well done for a lower budgeted movie, explosives and gore were abundant, mini-guns were set up and the sets were made with decent attention to detail.
The design and editing were one of the strongest points of the movie, with a modern design focusing on technology and the exiting was what gave the movie its trippy feel to the point where it was dizzying in places.",Guns Akimbo
289,Orki72,Wasted,3,5 July 2020,"Okay, I turned off my brain to enjoy this..prepared to be heavily entertained, but was heavily bored and had no fun. All the actors/actresses play well, Daniel Radcliffe is great but there was not one funny moment in this. People compare this to Crank..which was over-the-top too, true, but it was aware of its own ridiculousness.First of all, the whole actions of Miles after his ""awakening with guns"" are stupid. I mean how did this guy survive a day in real life? So usually you should be feeling pity or compassion or something with him, but instead you wish Nix should have killed him already.

308,strategghost,"So good, so bad",9,27 April 2020,"Guns Akimbo is one of my favorite movies. I'd like to rate it worse, but sometimes a picture *just* fits, this is that picture. It's funny in many ways, has fun characters, it's got decent action, it's got tempo, and both Radcliff and Weaving deliver on all levels.Saying it's a movie you can turn your brain off to might be true, but if so, then I haven't seen an action movie in a while where that wasn't true (or where I should have turned my brain off). It's a more coherent story than many of the blockbuster superhero movies, though that says very little. I can count several billion dollar grossing movies that are dumber, so lets do just that: Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Furious 7, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, The Fate of the Furious, Captain Marvel, Skyfall, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Aladdin (2019) and I'm feeling generous not listing more.Unfortunately it's very noticable in the editing that this is a movie with far less resources than movies it should be competing with. However with creative filming it manages to make the action sequences on par with, or better than that of the biggest action movies of the 2010 decade.And oh so many problems, though I don't see people talking about that in movies they like, so why should I? Because you want to know what it does poorly. The fighting scenes aren't well choreographed, atleast not if compared with John Wick, but it lends good elements from that and other solid action movies. The dialogue can get a bit cringe. The humor is very hit and miss. Finger off trigger... You don't go deaf from one pistol shot: Chekhov's gun, the hearing should probably have come up later in the movie as a joke, same with pain Miles experiences when firing the guns. The music might have needed some slightly better placement in scenes, but it's music that fits. While camera work is a great part of this movie, it could have been better. Action scenes are too messy. ""The"" message is a bit convoluted.Though I'm excited for a sequel, I'd prefer if the movie ended more like a tragedy.",Guns Akimbo
309,sfarrelardan,Stupid Fun!,6,11 March 2020,"Guns Akimbo is a movie where you could just sit back and enjoy some stupid fun. At first I thought this movie would just be another cringe fest; just another movie trying to be edgy and appeal to the internet people. But to be fair, it was not as cringe inducing as I thought it would be. There are definitely some spots that are quite a bit corny, but I suppose that is intentional. But apart from that, I was completely delighted with what I saw. The editing and cinematography in this movie is definitely spot on! They completely complement the hyper-action very well and I especially like the aesthetics that they showcase. The gun fight scenes were also a treat! Especially in the first half of the movie. These scenes really remind me about the Hotline Miami games and I wonder how cool it would be if a movie was made based on them.Unfortunately though, as creative as the gun scenes were, I feel like the movie played its cards way too early. All the interesting fight scenes happen in the first half of the movie. And for the rest of the movie, they seem to have ran out of ideas on how to go about choreographing the remaining gun fights. The movie ends with a rooftop fight that really pales in comparison to the other shootouts. By the end, I felt that the pacing had turned out to be slow and it really killed the momentum for me. Luckily the director knows when to stop, so I believe that this should not be too much of an issue, considering its 1h 35m run time. Overall, decent movie!",Guns Akimbo

(I like Daniel's movies so I'm admittedly biased)I think it has the potential to become a franchise worth following, but I think it would need to improve the depth of its characters.The world is a bit over simplified, but the concept behind Skizm (live action death matches) makes that justified.It's quite refreshing that the main character doesn't have such a deep back story. He was ordinary and I think that was excellently portrayed.The scenes are well-put together, easy to follow, amusing to watching. Though, the technique used with the flashback, I've seen in so many other films. That reduced its punch for me.I didn't like Nix. She felt a bit off from my perspective and I wish I was able to see a side of her I could care for before she... you know.I loved how some scenes had a video game-like effect, brought me back to my gaming days.I find the relationship between the audience of Skizm and the players interesting. I think there's potential there and I'd like to watch a film that explores the minds of people that watch them, besides the over simplification that they're terrible people.

334,kashyapraina,An entertaining wacky action comedy destined to be a cult classic,8,8 May 2021,"Guns Akimbo is a wacky action comedy about a video game developer named Miles who becomes part of an underground internet game caller Skism where people hunt each other when two guns are bolted to his hands . This one is a future cult classic it has all the ingredients a wacky plot about an internet game where people kill each other an unlikely hero , a trigger happy psychopathic character and loads of fun entertaining violence , but that's not all it has great character moments like miles trying to pee with guns bolted to his hands and asking people to help him with stuff . Daniel Radcliffe shines as Miles a nerd whose favorite pass time I trolling trolls and that gets him into trouble he is a pacifist vegan who is afraid of violence seeing him deal with this world is inherently funny and Daniel Radcliffe again is great at small awkward character moments . The star of the movie is Samara Weaving as Nix an insane over the top psychopath who is the top player of Skism , her character is definitely modelled after Harley Quinn she has greattt comic timing and her interactions with miles are fantastic . The film has a great techno inspired score that keeps you on the edge and the violence is shot in an over the top youtube video-esque manner which benefits the film a lot in fact everything is over the top , villains are gun toting over the top baddies with tattoos and signature weapons . The film heavily lampoons video games and online culture of liking violent content and that people might pay to watch people kill other people .

It is well-shot in a perfectly fitting style, with some very skillfully choreographed fight sequences. The dialogue has a strong comedic vein and there are some side characters who sprinkle lots of personality and humor in, even without much screen time. Some of the funniest scenes are watching the main character attempt 'normal' life activities with guns bolted to his hands.It was a fairly predictable plot but that didn't cause me to enjoy the ride any less. The action doesn't stop, so you are given plenty of good ol' explosions and shoot outs. That's what you sign up for with a movie like this, so that shouldn't surprise anyone.

Examples that first come to my mind: Nerve, because of the evil game that makes many people watch and some to suffer; Deadpool mostly for the action aesthetic and some in-between talks and jokes during the action scenes; Upgrade, probably just because the Harry Shooter gets an upgrade at the start of the movie and the city's cyberpunk looks also makes me think of Upgrade; Scott Pilgrim because of the protagonist's personality and the main premise of ""getting the girl"". Other than that it has the aesthetic of Edgar Wright's action comedy and Guy Ritchie's actiom style (though not that successful). Camera movements and effects (especially slow-mo) is a bit overused but nothing other than that bothers. It also has the x-ray effect from Mortal Kombat.

What it is, is fun, well executed (excuse the phrase) with Edgar Wright/Scott Pilgrim vibes all the way through. You can see where EW has sprinkled his signature visuals and references all through it from pop culture references to action in time with the (excellent) soundtrack.Yes, there are moments that you can see where the special effects haven't quite hit the nail on the head but it's forgivable. Howden has directed this with all the intensity and crazy manic energy that is demanded to satiate the desires of the instantaneous internet devourers.Yes, it's a fun and action packed dive into gore and violence but it mirrors society as it is now. The entitlement to 24/7 access to everything and everyone, the fact that a rabbit hole into the darkest parts of society is a literal click away and I, for one, quite enjoy that blood soaked mirror being thrown back in our faces.Samara Weaving is excellent.

When I saw the trailer I was expecting a self aware comedy starring Daniel Radcliffe, but that is not what I got. The movie was every predictable and all the twists were pretty obvious. But I would be lying if I said that I didn't laugh a couple times during the movie. Not because the jokes were good or anything, but because it was so bad it was funny. The spinning camera shots they kept doing in the first half of the movie was hilarious and I can tell that they weren't going for that when shooting there fight scenes like that.Contrast to everything that I just said, this movie will be a good time. Daniel Radcliffe is easily the bet part of this movie. Nix's character is really one dimensional and dull. And Natasha Liu Bordizzo's character was not that good either. The film makers tried to make us feel something in Nix's death scene. But I couldn't care less about that character.In conclusion I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for stupid comedy and wants a good time.6/10",Guns Akimbo

The Co-Director of Crank said regarding a potential third film:
""The one thing that I won't do is sort of like a cheap, boring, tame version of the Crank movie,"" Taylor proclaimed.Which is exactly what this is,
this film is so poorly writen,
It proposes a world somewhat like ours and a protagonist thrown into a situation he is way out of his depth in, but unfortunately he's an idiot.I love films like Crank and Upgrade which have this crazy premise and you just have to sit back and enjoy without taking anything to seriously, however they are written so damn well they define the genre
which thrives on the unexpected and how you never know whats coming next,With this film the main character makes such mind numbingly stupid decisions at the start of the film and those decisions later obviously make rather predictable consequences its just hard to find him worth giving a damn about,characters talk forever or stand stupidly until they get shot regardless of having numbers or the upper hand.It's predictable, god is it predictable. the special effects and indoor gunfights never quite feel like anythings real, it just seems off, its a great fun idea but only if done well, unfortunately watching this feet like a chore. other films have done similar things but far better.",Guns Akimbo

Riktor was definitely meant to play the off-the-jinge bad guy, but even he didn't seem to believe half what he was saying. Everyone appeared very much to be acting. And really, do we need more guns in our popular media? Isn't there enough fighting in the streets.I know I sound like a grouch twice my age, but what did you think of Nymphomaniac (Von Trier)?",Guns Akimbo

This film is carried on the back by his tour-de-force performance and engaging, high octane cinematography. Stylistically, this film also has a lot to offer, choosing a nice neon pallet for a majority of the film.

The film is non-stop action. Main advantage is post production work. VFX and specially Color correction are on the highest level ( maybe because the film was shot on RED cameras).The main disadvantage of the film is the plot. It's too weak. Viewer doesn't know much about Miles, so he can't empathise to character at the proper level. In the film it should be more details about him.

This is the kind of film you watch with friends to have a good laugh or just by yourself to zone out for an hour and a half.Does this movie have flaws? Yes.

His success as the boy who lived has given him the freedom to chose the roles he wants and to actually have fun making movies. Something that is very refreshing to see. Samara Weaving is brilliant and it's a joy to see her as the character Nix. She's gonna be huge in the next few years.If you enjoy action movies, with outrageous violence, well choreographed fight scenes and over the top characters then you'll enjoy this film. It moves fast and doesn't take itself too serious. It's an easy watch, and slightly predictable. Although that's what you sign up for, and the movie makes you well aware of that.",Guns Akimbo

It is a spectacular and action-packed movie but a shoddy. I do know it is a cynic message to the internet generation but i do not think there is a so big problem how it is thought. Yes there are people like in the movie but they will never understand that point.For me it was a waste of time and not because of crew or cast.

Guns Akimbo 'does what it says on the tin'. Guns, mindless action, some well performed and directed fight scenes - many of which come close to ridiculous (the good side). There are also some very well shot scenes amongst what are mostly well done pieces.The negative reviews (imo) are from people who must prefer the kind of more 'realistic' action films such as say Taken or those that would view the original Korean Oldboy as subpar to its remake (you'd have to be out of lf your mind to think that - no offence Josh). The rest saying its a 2/10 crank are a bit harsh. Crank (1 more-so than 2) are great, switch-ya-brain-off mindless action and Guns Akimbo delivers just that (just with a more Internet age/gamer style).It also seems fully aware of what it is and doesn't seem like it's pandering to anyone other than its intended audience: bloke gets guns bolted to hands, must save gf, has 200 shots to do so (100 each gunhand iirc) - bang bang!Only main gripe is the last fightscene/events feels a little bit overstretched but it's not like ya watching a John Woo film, Con Air, MI:2 etc (lol)",Guns Akimbo

Some of the fight scenes cut super fast, and its not fun for the eyes. Also, there are a lot of odd zoom ins. I also did not like the 'internet bad' thing. It gets annoying. I really enjoyed Daniel Radcliffe, but his character was a little weird as all he did was troll on the internet. I think it would have been better to make him more likable. I really liked the humor, and the pacing. It was always interesting. The effects were pretty fun, telling you how much ammo he had left. I also kind of liked the idea of the skizm.

466,jorgen_jansen,"Great concept, terrible execution",4,15 August 2021,"Guns Akimbo is a lackluster comedy, deceivingly disguised as an OK action movie, with an obnoxious and mocking tone to the viewers intellect and understanding
of the real world, until you see through the veil of bad comedy.Despite all the detail, design and focus on the guns elaborately bolted to his hands, and the issue they create, they don't portray a realistic depiction of dealing with them, both physically and mentally, at all.Scenes established to move the plot and not for comedic purpose fall completely flat for depicting an unrealistic real world in a sense that only harms the validity of the rest of the movie and the comedy.The only almost realistic part of this is Miles' rate of morality-loss. To be clear, Daniel Radcliffe's performance is fine, its the writing and directing that are terrible. Samara Weaving does an amazing job as well, with what she was dealt.If this had been a documentary of life with guns for hands, I would have enjoyed it substantially more.The mocking of the viewer's intellect reaches a peak when right after a misadventurous exchange of words about the opponents weapons, as an interjected comedy piece - seemingly to the director advanced enough to dazzle the proletariat - loses all credibility when dual AA-12 automatic shotguns opens fire to the tune of the sound and firerate of an M60 belt-fed machine gun.The best writing in the movie (which isn't saying much) appears when the female protagonist screams that the ""friday nights just got really lonely"" after losing her middle and ring finger in a knife attack.Had they mixed the action of John Wick and the deadpan humor of Kung Fury with the realism and grittiness of Se7en, you'd have an amazing movie.But this isn't it.Homeless guy was the highlight of the movie.",Guns Akimbo

The movie also had great pacing their was no messing around trying to set up a hole story line they gave some back round and then it went right into the violence and action. If I where to try and explain this movie it's like if Nerve and Suicide Squad made a love child and gave it a lot of drugs.
