0,SnoopyStyle,Greek tragedy,6,10 July 2021,"Former lawman George Blackledge (Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret (Diane Lane) suffer a great loss when their son die in an accident. Their daughter-in-law Lorna, with their grandson Jimmy, remarries to Donnie Weboy. The couple leaves town without telling the Blackledges. Margaret is desperate to find them. The Blackledges track them back to the Weboy family home run by commanding matriarch Blanche.The first half works like a horror movie. It's building up to an epic meeting. It could have stayed in the horror lane. It may be the better move. Instead, I have to question some of what the Blackledges are doing. They are escalating the situation. I don't mind turning it into a family feud. I would not try to force rooting interest into this fight. If it's kept a horror, this would be a lot simpler. As a Greek tragedy, it works better if both sides are more equal in responsibility. It would make Blanche's final question more poignant. I would also question what the police would do after the movie ends. They are dragging poor Peter into this mess. I'm sure the police would be coming after him even if they don't mess with the white women.",Let Him Go

3,zardoz-13,"An Unforgettable, Modern Day, Gothic Western",9,28 November 2020,"Kevin Costner and Diane Lane reunite as husband and wife in writer & director Thomas Bezucha's grim but absorbing, modern-day, Gothic western ""Let Him Go,"" about uneasy grandparents who embark on an ill-fated odyssey to find their grandson who had been taken from their midst without warning. Earlier, Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" (2013) coupled Costner and Lane as Jonathan and Martha Kent, the stepparents who took in the orphaned Kal-El, aka Superman and raised him as their own son. In ""Let Him Go,"" Costner plays retired county sheriff George Blackledge. Quietly living with his wife Margaret Blackledge (Diane Lane of ""Streets of Fire"") and his son's family, he operates a modest little horse ranch. When their only son dies in a freak riding accident, their daughter-in-law Lorna (Kayli Carter of ""Bad Education"") remarries. Unfortunately, she makes the ghastly mistake of selecting an abusive spouse. Never are we told why Lorna exercised such appallingly bad judgment. Not only does this contemptible varmint treat her grandson like a punching bag in public, but he also smacks Lorna around without a qualm.Initially, Margaret had planned to embark on this road trip alone with every intention of returning with their grandson. George refuses to let Margaret go by herself. Imagine George's surprise when he discovers Margaret has cached his trusty old service revolver beneath the front seat! This unforgettable film chronicles their search and the adversaries with whom they clash after they track down their grandson. Too late the Blackledges realize they have underestimated their opponents. At first, melancholy hovers like a flock of vultures over ""Let Him Go"" as the Blackledges cruise along the lonely highways in their vintage station wagon to reunite with their grandson. After they locate the child in North Dakota, George and Margaret must contend with their stepson-in-law's mother and her opposition to their presence. British actress Lesley Manville dominates this epic with her psychotic performance as murderous matriarch Blanche Weboy. Riding roughshod over her own sons as well as the Blackledges, Blanche paves the way for a finale as startling as it is tragic.""Let Him Go"" ladles out irony galore as we watch the Blackledge family at breakfast. James Blackledge (Ryan Bruce of ""Sinsters"") dances around Lorna in the kitchen like a live wire, while she cooks breakfast with one hand and cradles their son with the other. Everybody appears jubilant that fine morning until later when James' horse, which he had groomed earlier before he rode off on it, returns home with an empty saddle. Margaret is playing grandma with her grandson when she spots the empty saddle and rushes out to her husband. Catching up James' horse, George swings astride and rides off. Eventually, he finds James sprawled lifelessly on his back near a stream with his sightless eyes staring into eternity. No sooner has James died than George and Margaret are seen dressing up in their finest to witness Lorna's marriage to a lackluster looking fellow, Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain of ""Kong: Skull Island""), in a stark marriage ceremony. Naturally, Lorna moves out of the Blackledge house, and Donnie and she rent a bare bones apartment in town.In the grocery store parking lot, Margaret witnesses a heartwarming spectacle. Donnie, Lorna, and Lorna's son Jimmy (newcomer Bram Hornung) are enjoying vanilla ice cream cones, until Jimmy drops his ice cream and Donnie smacks him. Lorna tries to intervene, and Donnie lashes out at her, too. Margaret ignores the car pulling up behind her as she watches with riveting eyes as this scene occurs. Later, when she tries to visit Lorna and Jimmy, their apartment house landlord informs her the family has packed up and left. Margaret is crushed when she learns they have cleared out without saying goodbye. She fears for both James and Lorna and then resolves to bring Jimmy back, despite whatever the consequences. Naturally, when George learns about his wife's audacious plans, he ponders what part he must play. Stubbornly, he insists on doing the driving. They load up their Chevy station wagon with enough provisions so they can camp out in the wilderness rather than lodge in a hotel.Along the way, a sympathetic lawman, Sheriff Nevelson (Bradley Stryker of ""Bruce Almighty""), befriends them and puts them up for the night in his immaculate jail cells. Later, Nevelson suggests where they should launch their inquiries. When the Blackledges notify one of Donnie's distant relatives that they're searching for Donnie Weboy, the relative smiles and tells them the Weboys will find them before they find the Weboys. The Blackledges drive into North Dakota and meet Donnie's closest relative, Bill Weboy (Jeffrey Donovan of ""Honest Thief""), and the atmosphere turns ugly. Revealing anything else about what lies in wait for the unsuspecting Blackledges would spoil the slam-bang, combustible ending.Margaret is prepared to break the law to retrieve little Jimmy. Moreover, she is perfectly content to sacrifice the life of her own husband to accomplish her goal. Eventually, the Blackledges persuade an apprehensive Lorna, who is being held against her will, to flee from the Weboys. Screen veterans that they are, Costner and Lane are believable as a seasoned married couple who accept each other's shortcomings. Diane acts with her heart rather than her head, and this places George in jeopardy. Writer & director Thomas Bezucha milks the suspense for maximum effect when the Blackledges find themselves at the mercy of Blanche and her brawny boys. Clocking in just shy of two hours, ""Let Him Go"" qualifies as a brooding melodrama that takes some darkly sinister turns during its second half. Comic relief is conspicuously absent as the pressure cooker tension boils over and all Hades erupts in the final quarter hour. Lenser Guy Godfree's long shots of the mountainous Montana and North Dakota terrain are as spectacular as the gloomy Rembrandt lighting in the Weboy mansion when the two families clash. Not for a moment will ""Let Him Go"" let you go.",Let Him Go
4,george.schmidt,Costner & Lane prove stalwart grandparents no matter the odds,9,4 December 2020,"LET HIM GO (2020) ***1/2 Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Lesley Manville, Kayli Carter, Booboo Stewart, Jeffrey Donovan. Still waters run deep while family matters is the crux of this lean and mean low-key slow burn drama cum Western vengeance with Costner and Lane as grandparents to a boy now with a 2nd yet shady rural family led by malevolent matriarch Manville (with her Cruella DeVille do to boot).

5,evanston_dad,Like If Liz Cheney Made a Movie,7,12 May 2021,"""Let Him Go"" is like if Liz Cheney made a movie.Kevin Costner and Diane Lane act the hell out of this preposterous thriller that somehow manages to be nail bitingly exciting. They play good conservative Americans, the kind that own guns but use them responsibly to do things like shoot sick horses, and are really good at baking pies. Their son dies tragically and their daughter-in-law marries a bad conservative American who whisks her off to live with his nightmare of a family, their grandson in tow. They have reason to believe the grandson and daughter-in-law are in danger, so they take off to retrieve them, partnering up with an indigenous man no less, just to remind us that, once again, there is such a thing as a good conservative American. This brings them in contact with this film's version of Trump America, a total goon show if ever there was one. I'm not sure our divided culture really needs a movie right now that reinforces the stereotype that people who live out in the middle of nowhere are hillbilly psychopaths, but if that's your bag, this movie is for you. The hillbilly clan is led by matriarch Lesley Manville, who looks like she eats cigarette sandwiches for breakfast and orders her sons to go around chopping people's hands off. The final showdown is something out of a southern Gothic horror story, like if William Faulkner and Stephen King had a literary love child.I'd rather not think too much about this movie, because there is absolutely no way it could possibly stand up to too much scrutiny. I usually hate movies like this, because they make me want to see really bad things happen to vile people, and they usually -- like this movie -- make the vile people REALLY vile so that you don't have to feel bad when you're happy to see them murdered. But I still usually just feel bad, and I don't like that feeling. This movie, however, just worked for me. I'm not sure why, but I think it's because of how good Costner and Lane are, and how careful the movie is to make these two feel like decent ordinary people trying to do the right thing rather than closet superheroes in flannel shirts and cowboy boots. Nothing they do is remarkable, unless you count standing up against grotesque hatred and bullying as remarkable, which I guess I do since it seems to be so needed in our country right now and seems to be in short supply.And I'm on board with any movie that lets Lesley Manville devour as much scenery as she does here. I'm surprised there was any set left.Grade: A-",Let Him Go
6,ferguson-6,a stellar first two-thirds,6,5 November 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner reunite on screen, only this time it's not as the earthy and earthly parents to Superman (MAN OF STEEL, 2013). Instead, this film from writer-director Thomas Bezucha (THE FAMILY STONE, 2005), based on Larry Watson's 2013 novel, features the two stars as long-time married couple, Margaret and George Blackledge, living a peaceful existence on their Montana ranch. Well, it's peaceful now, as George is retired from his career as a lawman.Their son James (Ryan Bruce), his wife Lorna (Kayli Carter, ""Godless""), and young son Jimmy live on the ranch with Margaret and George. Grandma Margaret's devotion to her grandson and judgmental nature sometimes crosses the line, creating quiet tension with his mother Lorna. George's trained eye sees it all, but he mostly keeps his thoughts private, although the communication he shares with Margaret is often through a simple gesture or nod. Their chemistry is one that's only built through time (and fine acting).
When a freak accident leaves James dead, we flash forward three years as Margaret and George attend Lorna's wedding to Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain, who was excellent in this year's BLOW THE MAN DOWN). George senses that Donnie does not possess the highest moral character, but Margaret is hit hardest by the newlyweds moving off the ranch and taking her beloved grandson with them. Concern escalates quickly when Margaret witnesses Donnie being physically abusive to Lorna and Jimmy, and then he relocates them to North Dakota to be near his family ... without so much as a warning or goodbye to Margaret and George.Crossing Grandma Margaret is like kicking the hornet's nest. Poor George arrives home one day to find the car packed and Margaret on a mission to bring Jimmy home. George's feeble attempt to reason with her fails (as he knew it would) and the two are soon on the road through some gorgeous countryside captured by cinematographer Guy Godfree. Along the way, they cross paths and befriend Peter (Booboo Stewart), a Native American who deserted ""Indian School"" for a life of solitude on the plains. It's also on this road trip where Margaret and George are inundated with every possible warning about the notorious Weboy clan of North Dakota. No specifics are provided, but the message is clear ... no one messes with the Weboys.A tip leads the grandparents to Bill Weboy (Jeffrey Donovan, ""Burn Notice""), and he provides living proof that the Weboy clan is rotten to the core. Behind an evil grin, Bill invites Margaret and George to the family ranch for dinner and a visit with their grandson. At the ranch, we are introduced to the twisted matriarch, Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville, PHANTOM THREAD, 2017). This meeting of the families is about as tense as any we've seen on screen. A clash of good versus evil is always welcome, which makes it so disappointing that a film so stellar to this point, abruptly shifts from an intriguing psychological thriller into a ludicrous circus of violence, poor decisions, and absurdity.There is a lot to like here, before it spins off the axis. Diane Lane is ferocious in the role, and Costner is very effective as her 'still waters' husband. It's a hoot to see Ms. Manville lose her British accent and go over-the-top as nasty Blanche, and the early 1960's setting looks great, including the vehicles. As mentioned before, the scenery is breath-taking, with Alberta (Canada) standing in beautifully for Montana and North Dakota. Composer Michael Giacchino is more accustomed to working on superhero and animated movies, and the score is often distracting in the first half, but fits better in the final act. Brace yourself for a couple of tough to watch scenes and a jarring tonal shift.",Let Him Go
7,deloudelouvain,Slow burner but entertaining.,7,28 February 2021,"A movie with Kevin Costner is almost a guarantee it's going to be decent to good, I don't kow about any bad movies with Kevin Costner, or at least none of them come up in my mind. Let Him Go is a slow burner, a western drama in North Dakota. It's quite a long wait before there's some action but it doesn't really matter as the acting of Diane Lane and Kevin Costner is entertaining and enjoyable to watch. There's not really anything bad to write about this movie, it's well shot (nice landscapes also), the whole cast did a good job, and the plot is pleasant to follow. Certainly worth a watch.",Let Him Go
8,FeastMode,a 30 minute story extended to 2 hours,2,16 June 2021,"My ratings are not objective. This movie is objectively fine. My ratings are subjective opinions. My opinion is this is one of the most boring movies ever.There is about 30 minutes worth of story in this 2 hour movie. Say another 30 minutes for character development. The rest is nothingness. I almost quit a bunch of times. I watched it on fast speed, at most 2x during scenes with talking. But other times i had it at 5x speed and didn't miss a thing. That's how nothing this movie is.

9,Cineanalyst,What If the Kents Had an Ordinary Child?,6,6 July 2021,"You'd get an ordinary movie seems to be the answer. It's certainly an odd reference to Superman--perhaps the strangest since DC's most beloved family farmers unexpectedly seemed to turn up in the Marvel movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009). Seems weirder to me than even ""Brightburn"" (2019). That what appears to be the most remarkable thing about a production is that it casts the same duo, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, who played Superman's adoptive parents in the latest DC cinematic incarnations, ""Man of Steel"" (2013) and so on, is an indication that not much interesting is going on here. It also seems perhaps inadvertently in poor taste that the son this time dies from falling off a horse, as I couldn't help but recall the similar tragedy that paralyzed the late Christopher Reeve, who of course also played Superman at one time.Supermans aside, though, ""Let Him Go"" is a simple neo-Western revenge tale where the Kents--I mean, Blackledges set out to rescue their grandson after his abusive stepfather scuttles him and his mother off to North Dakota. Well acted, well plotted, scenic, and that's about it. There just isn't much going on in this superficial ""The Searchers"" (1956) retread--even if it is a period piece that covers issues of domestic abuse and mistreatment of Native Americans. Leslie Manville evidently relishing her role as the baddie is the highlight.",Let Him Go
10,A_Different_Drummer,Ultimately a movie you would never want to see or recommend,6,30 November 2020,"Let's be crystal clear. Costner and Lane are so professional and interesting by themselves you could watch them build a garage and still be entertained. But movies have to more than the sum of their parts. Here Thomas Bezucha has written an abomination of a script where the real ""mystery"" -- why the girl married poorly in the first place -- takes place outside the narrative and off-camera almost before the opening titles. In these kinds of melodramas, there are usually story beats developed early on so, that when the climax comes, the audience is tuned in and feels satisfied. Bezucha doesn't care about his audience at all. He tells the story, it seems, to suit only himself. Just like the main villain that he created.",Let Him Go
11,851222,Good old fashioned movie,8,4 August 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Let Him Go"" (2020) is a type of movie were all scenes are make with care, then they filmed slowly were everything is visible and unrushed. Its the type of movie making i whish there would be more. Also performances by both lead were uniformly good and just to see these two lovely actors is always a joy.Overall, ""Let Him Go"" is a western as well a movie about family and things one will do to protect it. Although its rated R it wasn't a blood fest, except for few superbly made scenes with a burst of violence. The intensity of this movie comes not in form of action, but rather in dialogs, acting, directing and editing as well great cinematography. For example there is dinner scene pulsing with tension, and i will leave it at that. All in all this was a really good movie.",Let Him Go
12,westsideschl,Make It Montana,6,9 March 2021,"Suppose to be a Montana story as told in the source book, but instead of filming in that beautiful landscape they filmed in Calgary, Alberta. Overall though a good production especially the mansion set they built for filming.",Let Him Go
13,Thanos_Alfie,Simple but good...,6,10 December 2020,"""Let Him Go"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a retired sheriff and his wife trying to find their grandson and their daughter in law after the sudden death of their son. They want to find them both because they have a feeling that something is wrong.I did not have high expectations from this movie but I have to admit that I was surprised by it. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very interesting despite its simple plot, it also had plenty of action and much of suspense. The direction which was made by Thomas Bezucha was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job because they made us feel what his main characters being through. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention both the interpretations of Diane Lane who played as Margaret Blackledge and Kevin Costner who played as George Blackledge because they were simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned too, were Kayli Carter's who played as Lorna Blackledge and Lesley Manville's who played as Blanche Weboy. Finally, I have to say that ""Let Him Go"" is a nice movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because it combines very well true family love with some dramatic moments.",Let Him Go
14,cruise01,Slow burn drama thriller with a good cast leads.,6,2 February 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Let Him Go is a fair western thriller film about two grandparents played by Kevin Costner and Diane Keaton who travel across the states to find and rescue there grandson. Which his widow mother remarried into an abusive family.The plot is decent. Does create some thrills and tension. The direction is a slow moving pace that takes its time to get to a point.

17,jtindahouse,Great characters everywhere you look and the rest flows from there,9,13 December 2020,"There was a point about a quarter of the way through 'Let Him Go' where I was questioning the protagonist's motives and whether they were entitled to be doing what they appeared to be trying to do. As if the film recognised this may be an issue with audiences, they then do an excellent job from that point onwards of justifying their actions. The characters created in this film on both sides of the ledger are excellent. The heroes are people we can genuinely root for and care about their fate, and the villains are truly horrendous people who we want to meet the worst fate.I really enjoyed the chemistry between Diane Lane and Kevin Costner in this film. It was quite a unique relationship they had, one that isn't often seen in film, yet it felt much more realistic than what we usually get - and that's why I think it worked. I know elder couples who are exactly like these two were. I have to say the whole cast were great, but I also have to give special mention to Jeffrey Donovan. He's so good, especially in these types of roles. He has the perfect balance between being pure evil and being a potentially genuinely nice guy who could trick you into falling for his charms.'Let Him Go' deals with an awful situation that I imagine happens more often than we realise. It obviously ramps it up another level to make it more theatrical, but at the heart of the story remains a genuinely heart-breaking situation. This film works as both a drama and an action/thriller equally. Both genres are handled extremely well. I had a great time with this movie and would highly recommend people check it out.",Let Him Go

I strongly recommend this film.",9,1 June 2021,"Let Him Go (2020) is a movie we recently watched on a Delta flight on the way to a wedding. The storyline focuses on recent grandparents who lose their son in an unfortunate accident and their widowed daughter in-law marries an abusive man and then mysteriously moves away. When they believe their former daughter in-law and grandson are being abused they set out on a mission to rescue them. This movie is directed by Thomas Bezucha (Monte Carlo) and stars Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves), Diane Lane (The Outsiders), Kayli Carter (Bad Education) and Greg Lawson (Heartland). The storyline for this is delivered in an outstanding and methodical manner. The cinematography of the landscape, each characters tragic past, how the grandparents fit together and appreciate each other, and how they work together (or don't) to accomplish their ultimate goals for the benefit of the family was wonderful. This movie was very well written, acted and put together. I strongly recommend this film and would score it a solid 9/10.",Let Him Go
19,stevendbeard,Slow Starter/Nice Finisher,6,7 November 2020,"I saw ""Let Him Go"", starring Diane Lane-Man of Steel, The Perfect Storm; Kevin Costner-Man of Steel, Waterworld; Jeffrey Donovan-Burn Notice_tv, Hitch and Lesley Manville-Maleficent, Romeo and Juliet_2013.
This is a slow starter but nice-if unexpected-finisher. It's based on a novel by Larry Watson. The original novel was set in 1951 but the movie setting is a little more contemporary-It's set in 1963. Retired Sheriff Kevin and his wife Diane live on a ranch in Montana with their son, his wife and their new baby. After their son dies in an accident, his widow remarries-she waited 3 years-an abusive man and I'm guessing that she didn't know he was abusive when she agreed to marry him. All of a sudden, they move to North Dakota. Diane-after witnessing some of the physical abuse herself-and Kevin are upset because they were not informed of the move so they decide to go check on their grandson and they soon discover that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Lesley is the son_in_law's mother and Jeffrey is his uncle and the whole family has quite the reputation for being difficult to get along with, with a little bit of abuse thrown in for good measure. Diane and Kevin decide to try and persuade Lesley & family into giving them their only grandson. That's when the party begins.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-I did mention that it was a little slow for my tastes-but it would be a good rental.",Let Him Go

22,yusufpiskin,Costner's Rules,8,26 November 2020,"Defiantly Kevin Costner's best movie of the last 20 years. Very Clint Eastwoodian. Hopefully this is a career revival for him because he was amazing. Diane Lane was also marvelous in this movie.Also;One of the best films of 2020. Stunningly heartbreaking performances by Lane and Costner. The film effuses an honesty that guides the pair through the inquietude of the North Dakota terrain.While the film is classified as a thriller, the undying love between George and Margaret serves as the impetus that guides them. The pacing is masterfully deliberated, as we are granted moments to absorb the significance of the events that ensue.The screenplay is sincere and profound at times, as the meditative quality of the characters serves as a very fitting parallel to the breathtaking Montana skies.",Let Him Go
23,kirbylee70-599-526179,NEO-WESTERN DELIVERS,8,19 April 2021,"Westerns have been a long standing genre in film since the first movies were made. But for some reason few of them are being made these days. Another genre has risen to take its place though, the neo-western. These are stories that follow the long standing traditions and messages from those classic westerns but place them in more current settings. LET HIM GO is the latest in that genre.Kevin Costner plays George Blackledge and Diane Lane his wife Margaret. They're living with their son James (Ryan Bruce) his wife Lorna (Kayli Carter) and their newborn son Jimmy on their ranch. Tragedy strikes when Jimmy is thrown off his horse while riding the fences and is killed.Three years pass and Lorna remarries a young man named Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain). One day while shopping Margaret sees them across the street and watches in horror as Donnie hits Jimmy in the head and then almost knocks Lorna over. Not knowing what to do she returns home and begins baking a cake. George thinks it's for him but her intent is to stop by Donnie and Lorna's to make sure everything is all right.Instead she discovers that they've left town without telling anyone and taken Jimmy with them. She returns home to let George know what's been going on and to set out to find them and bring Jimmy back for them to raise. An ex-lawman with tracking experience George knows there is no stopping her when she sets her mind to it and joins her.The trail leads them from Montana to North Dakota where Donnie's family lives. Stopping along the road they meet Peter (Booboo Stewart), a young Indian living on his own in a small shack. Talking to him they get an idea of where to go next and head that direction.The Blackledge's finally find the Weboy family meeting Bill (Jeffrey Donovan), Donnie's uncle in Gladstone. The meeting doesn't start well but he ends up inviting them to dinner with the family. He meets them and has one ride in his car while the other follows. They get to the homestead and find that Donnie's family isn't quite all that.Mother Blanche (Lesley Manville) is a bit off and rules with an iron fist. It was her idea for Donnie to return home to the fold. As dinner progresses and Lorna and Jimmy finally arrive things reach a breaking point. Blanche sends Jimmy up to bed within minutes of arriving home denying Margaret a chance to spend time with him. The situation ends with them leaving. But will that be the end of it?If you've seen any western worth its salt you know that this will not be the end and that something terrible is bound to happen. Guns will be drawn, weapons will be wielded and blood will be spilled. The good guys will face off against the bad guys and when it's all said and done no everyone will walk away from this situation.The traditional theme of right and wrong are at play here as well as the clan mentality seen in so many westerns. Think the Clanton's at the OK Corral. And in the character of George we have the man willing to stand for what's right in spite of the fact that he is far beyond his prime. Someone willing to go it alone if he must much like in HIGH NOON. And all of these traditional themes work effectively in this film, brought up to the modern day and still hitting all the right notes.Costner is an actor who can still hold his own. At age 66 he's not playing the roles he once did but taking on those in his age bracket and doing it well. He plays George here with a grizzled voice and quiet demeanor that don't display what he's capable of. Lane has also shown that she's an actress of note and can turn in an equally amazing performance. Her strong will character here is one you won't forget.The movie offers entertainment coupled with a solid story. The subject matter of spousal abuse, child abuse and a strange family is probably not something younger kids should be watching. But adults will sit on the edge of their seats waiting until the final moments when they learn the fate of this family. It's a movie worth watching.",Let Him Go

Taking place during the 1960's, we have a retired deputy, Costner, living domestic bliss w/his wife, Lane, as they share their home w/their son, his wife & their child. Tragedy strikes when the son dies when he falls off his horse & after an interim period, the wife remarries to a new beau that Lane doesn't take to (he's hitting her & now has moved on to her grandson) so when the family ups & moves out one day, Lane gets worried & pressures Costner (even though she's more than willing to go on her own) to visit the wayward daughter-in-law & hopefully convince her to return w/their grandson. What they don't know is the new husband's family are a rough bunch, run by a matriarch, played by Oscar nominee Lesley Manville, w/an iron hand so when they make it to the family manse, taken there by Burn Notice's Jeffrey Donovan, they're grilled over the fact they weren't invited to the wedding & regretting letting her son leave the nest. Trying to wedge themselves between Manville's brood, Lane & Costner approach their daughter-in-law to broker an escape which backfires when the clan hears about it & confronts the couple in their motel room which leads to a grisly recrimination setting up the finale where the grandparents try to extricate their grandson from the evil backwards tribe. Not bad for what it was going for but the realization at the end that logically, the ending would still prompt the law to intervene is something the narrative never addresses but will in reality be a motivating factor an audience wouldn't be able to ignore.

Watching Let Him Ho you can see the man is still a very good actor but in this , he is outshone by two women.Costner plays a retired sheriff and Diane Lane plays his wife, who ate grieving over the death of their son, they then set out to find their only grandson.The biggest compliment I can give this film is that it reminds me a lot of Straw Dogs .The couple have the almost impossible task of dealing with the hillbilly Weboy family who is lead by Blanche who is played brilliantly by Lesley Manville . In fact so brilliantly, she steals the show from Lane and Costner.I enjoyed this much more than I expect.For the most part it's a slow burner but there are plenty of tense action scenes in it to not make it dull.Not bad at all .",Let Him Go
30,jadepietro,Far Fetched Revenge Thriller,6,17 February 2021,"IN BRIEF: A Western drama that gets lost in the dust.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED)Let Him Go is a Western drama about an elderly couple who decide to rescue their grandson from an abusive environment. Set in rural America during the 60's, George and Martha Blackledge are a decent and loving couple and they are living their lives with grace and dignity. He is a retired sheriff and she is a mighty good housewife and baker par none. But ranch life has its share of hardships and tragedy befalls them. A freak accident kills their son and his wife and child grow up under their roof until their daughter-in-law takes another husband who physically abuses them. One night, they secretly move away which sends the Blackledges on their rescue mission. This leads them to a crazy family called the Weboys who give the term ""deplorables"" a bad name.The film starts off with an intriguing premise and director/writer Thomas Bezucha creates a tense and engaging drama in the first half of his movie. As a director, he uses his visual eye to intermix images of the country vistas and slowly builds the relationship between the leads most astutely. That he has Kevin Costner and Diane Lane centerstage is his wisest decision. Their performances are totally convincing and their chemistry is in sync. One hopes that this story will build on their dilemma and become a courtroom battle over custody of Little Jimmy. Alas, that is not the case.Instead, as the screenwriter, Mr. Bezucha makes a terribly wrong detour into a bloody revenge thriller genre and the film lets go of any logic. It's a ""them against us"" mentality and the movie quickly loses its focus. Leaps of Logic appear outta nowhere. The dinner confrontation scene between the two families with straight-laced British actress Leslie Mann playing a deranged matriarch, Blanche Weboy, remains powerful, even though her menacing brood of good ole boys are so one-note evil, without any character development, that they become walking clichés of wickedness. From that point, the plot becomes more far-fetched and brutal to watch. Of course, the dastardly sheriff sides with the locals and has the obligatory ""git outta town "" scene, so is it any wonder that it's The Hatefuls versus The Blackledges as George and Margaret are forced to take matters into their own hands!It's a shame because the actors deserve better material. Mr. Costner brings his measured and stoic persona to his role and Ms. Lane radiates confidence and determination. They are very good. Ms. Manville is also fun to watch in a part that is far away from her stiff upper crust roles and she munches on the scenery with relish. One begins to question if Leatherface is not a distant cousin.After a promising start, Let Him Go lets go of all reason and falls flat on its face on its journey to Crazytown. (GRADE: C+)",Let Him Go
31,arungeorge13,The emotionally-resonating lead performances see it through! [+63%],6,23 January 2021,"With a save-the-grandson plot that's quite basic, what makes Let Him Go worth viewing is the reassuring performances from veterans Diane Lane and Kevin Costner. The film, which is based on Larry Watson's 2013 neo-Western drama novel, is written and directed by Thomas Bezucha. Let Him Go starts off in no hurried pace, taking time to establish characters and their bonds, but it's just past the 40-minute mark that it gets tremendously interesting. When the Blackledges arrive at the Weboy ranch (after a few meaningful stops along the way), you can sense that things are going to get ugly, especially with Jeffrey Donovan and Lesley Manville showing up.Lane showcases the intensity required to play Margaret while Costner, who plays George, is content being the more restrained (but practically concerned) of the two. While Costner and Lane slip into their old-timer roles comfortably (giving off pleasant warmth and genuine kindness), Manville and Donovan require special mentions for the sour, menacing performances they bring to the table. The '60s setting does a whole lot of good to the film, in fact: the only way of knowing someone's whereabouts was to actually go out there; the pace of life was a lot slower than it is now; and back then, conversations between people (at home) were drawn out.With all that said, Let Him Go doesn't feel wholesome as a screenplay. There's some level of logic that always remains questionable - why, as a former cop, didn't George seek out help from the department to retrieve his grandson? Also, the way in which a cop fleetingly explains how some acts were done in self-defence confounded me. Even the whole 'service revolver' angle has little pay-off in the script. Kayli Carter, who plays the abused daughter-in-law visibly struggles in her role. Instead of painting the Weboys in black and the Blackledges in white by default, the screenplay could have added subtle touches as to why the antagonists behave the way they do.Even with all the aforementioned issues, Let Him Go is worth a watch. It shows why there need to be more films centered around characters in the latter half of their lives.",Let Him Go
32,Foutainoflife,Great Acting,7,25 November 2020,"After losing their son and watching his widow marry, a couple learn that their grandson and former daughter-in-law have found themselves in an abusive situation.

With a bully matriarch heading the family, they soon learn that they are at odds with people who don't take kindly to others questioning their authority.This has an awesome cast and with an awesome cast, you get some great acting. The story is slow but engaging enough to help viewers develop a relationship with the characters. The whole atmosphere of the film is richly
noir set in the 50's with a subtle western theme. The plot is emotional and full of tension but for me, the end fell a bit flat. I don't know what I was expecting other than to say that I was expecting more than what I got. Maybe it's because I am a ""Mama Bear"" type and well, let's just say I would've handled things a bit differently than Lane's character. It may be a bit slow for some folks but with the actors giving such great performances, the pace didn't bother me too much.I'd suggest it as a decent, yet captivating film that wins you over by way of the actors performances.

33,martimusross,Pedestrian Modern Western Thriller,6,23 January 2021,"Let Him Go!The idea was good, but the dialogue was so stilted and forced. Of course the plot was shot full of holes, everyone has a mobile phone, mail is directed to forwarding addresses.The shock of seeing the great English actress Lesley Manville in a western with a southern drawl was beyond strange, but this brought the movie up to a new level. She was certainly sinister in her jollyness.Why Lorna would marry a man out of ""necessity"" is bizarre, why the Weboys would want an unwanted child I have no clue, so much was overly contrived without any apparent motivation. Either way we were, the viewer, made to believe the best outcome was to steal the child, when we all know this would be both illegal and ridiculous, and the violent response was entirely predictable.The movie on an emotional level and with great acting kinda pulled it off, and the exciting ending was great!I can't say I enjoyed this movie but it held my attention. 6/10",Let Him Go

And this is 1951; how many fathers would have survived if everyone of them who'd ever slapped one of his children received the death penalty?It's good Montana folk against North Dakota trash, except in the book it was the other way around. All I know is either North Dakota people are trash or they aren't. The other people are just filth.I really hate movies that have a big portion of the scenes shot at night so you can't really see much of anything. It's so dark is some parts of this that you may as well be listening to the radio.She treats her daughter-in-law like she isn't fit to be a mother because the water is too hot for the kid's bath? With family like that, who needs family? The next problem is the movie is too long at 1h53m. At least 23 minutes too long, but this might have been OK as a 30m TV episode, maybe.The son dies how? Was it auto-erotica asphyxiation? How was the horse involved? And, no, that isn't funny, my brother died that way. Mama sees the horse return without a rider, and she immediately assumes something terrible happened? Am I missing something? We learn latter that he died of a broken heart, or was it a broken neck? Either way, riding horses is dangerous. I just think that it's a waste of film and screen time to even introduce someone if you're just going to kill him two minutes later. They could have begun when the daughter-in-law gets married again. The book begins with the grandparents packing to go after the kid.It doesn't matter, trimming that bit of fat isn't going to leave you with anything approaching a decent feature film.And can someone tell me how the fire started? I missed that part even though I went back and looked again. It isn't explained in the book either. I don't see what point is being made by not explaining the fire.

35,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,"Okay drama, expected better",6,17 December 2020,"The film has a great cast of actors with good performances. But the story itself felt like a film that I would have expected in the late 1970s or early 80s. Domestic violence: Battered female & child abuse were very common topics in the 1970 and 80s. But we don't get a good sense of why the Weboys are the way they are, especially the matriarch of the Weboy clan.Also felt there wasn't a good bond with Kayli Carter character. So I didn't really care for her character. She just wasn't convincing playing the battered wife. I didn't like how the story ends for George BlackledgeThe last issue I had was the pacing of the film was slower than what I would have expected too. It felt like I wanted the movie to move along at a faster pace than it was going. I think the Indian boy story was filler material to stretch out the story because nothing much results from that relationship.I still can't give a Kevin Costner film less than a 6 because he and his co-star, Diane Lane work very well together. I just don't think this film will be memorable. Probably should end up on the Lifetime or Oxygen network",Let Him Go
36,bob-the-movie-man,Feud for Thought.,7,23 December 2020,"After a family tragedy for the Blackledge family, grandparents George (Kevin Costner) and Margaret (Diane Lane) are left to bring up baby Jimmy (Bram and Otto Hornung) with mother/daughter-in-law Lorna (Kayli Carter). But a few years later, Lorna marries bad-un Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain) and disappears back to Donnie's hillbilly extended family in the wilds of North Dakota, led by the fearsome Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville). Fearing for the child's wellbeing, Margaret drags retired Sheriff George on a dangerous journey to rescue the child.There are strong similarities in this story with a sub-plot of the excellent ""Ozark"", where the psychopathic Darlene Snell (Lisa Emery) is intent on having a child to grow up with on her remote ranch. The sense of tension there is recreated here, exacerbated by the movie's extremely slow (read ""glacial"") pace in its early stages. It's the same sort of rising dread that I felt with ""Nocturnal Animals"". This reaches its peak at a tense standoff over lamb chops at the Weboy ranch, but we are probably half-way into the film by then.The slow pace however is broken by a couple of extremely violent scenes that earn the movie its UK-15 certificate. One (no spoilers here!) harks back to another Kevin Costner blockbuster where he was a bit luckier! And the finale turns a slightly sleepy tale of ""two old folks"" into an 'all guns blazing' action western that's highly unexpected. Although you could argue that this is tonally extremely uneven, it works and makes the movie a lot more memorable than it otherwise would be.The standout leading performance here is the one from Diane Lane as the mentally tortured Granny pursuing her convictions across the country. Here writer/director Thomas Bezucha gives the character full rein. It's a memorable 'strong female' part, that would have been dominated by the male lead in the writing of films a few years back. Lane delivers a dramatic and rock-solid performance that has Oscar nomination written all over it.I'm also a big fan of Kevin Costner, not just because he's a solid and reliable actor over many years. I always remember him gamely appearing as ""The Postman""/'propeller-guy' in Billy Crystal's hilarious montage opening for the 70th Academy Awards. Anyhow, here he has his meatiest dramatic role in many years, and delivers fully on it. Top job, although I suspect this may not be his year for his elusive Best Actor award.Finally, rounding out the Oscar hopefuls is the brilliant Lesley Manville as Blanche Weboy. It's a dream of a role for the Brighton-born star, nominated of course for the Best Supporting Actress two years ago for ""Phantom Thread"". And she is genuinely chilling here, firing on all cylinders like some sort of deranged Bette Davis on speed. She's used sparingly in the movie, but that makes her scenes all the more memorable. Another nomination perhaps? I'd predict so, yes.I found this to be an uncomfortable watch, since I found myself in a moral quandary with the storyline. It's clear that Margaret is genuinely concerned for the safety of Jimmy (and less so, Lorna). Yet, what she is ultimately prepared to do is consider child abduction, when the law if probably on the side of the other party. Sure, the lifestyle and attitudes of the Weboys are alien to this more traditional ""Granny"". But although Blanche rules with a Victorian-level of grit, isn't she - at least before any of her more vicious tendencies emerge - entitled to do that? The film firmly roots itself behind the Blackledge's as ""the good guys"", but the script cleverly has you questioning that at various points,Two technical categories in ""Let Him Go"" are also worthy of note. The cinematography is by Guy Godfree, and the sweeping vistas of Montana and North Dakota (actually Alberta in Canada!) are gloriously delivered. And the music by Michael Giacchino - one of my favourite composers - is cello-heavy and fitting for the sombre storyline. I always assess the quality of a score by whether I annoy the cinema cleaners by sitting until the last of the end credits have rolled, and this is one I did that to.As the last movie I see before Christmas, ""Let Him Go"" is not exactly a feelgood festive offering. It's a well-crafted and thoughtful story, but not one to make you feel good inside, for the reasons outlined above. If you are a movie-lover though, then it's an interesting watch, if only for the fine acting performances on offer.(For the full graphical review, please check out ""Bob the Movie Man"" on the web.

It was great to see Kevin Costner and Diane Lane teaming up once again as they have an undenyingly great chemistry and you perfectly believe them being an happily in love ""old"" couple. Kevin Costner gives a very warm and fatherly performance. He shares a certain calmness with his character which is quite comforting and needed considering the circumstances the characters find themselves in. A beautiful and quiet performance. Diane Lane shows off more emotions and she follows her characer during different stages of character development making her unpredictable in many ways, although at first you thought its a very predictable character. She really lived it and created it way above of what was written ont he paper. A great performance.
Lesley Manville gets to play a rather loud and kind of cartoonish character but she still manages to perfectly balance it between overacting and giving it depths. She is really good - scary at times and gives yet another memorable performance in a role that could have been easily over the top. The cincematography is impressive, especially in the first half of the film and the score constantly beautiful. Its a well crafted modern Western that takes its time to introduce and develope its leading protagonists before giving the audience the right amout of tension. Very worth to see.",Let Him Go
40,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,3 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...What makes ""Let Him Go"" a film worth watching, is the solid cast and acting, despite the rather generic and cookie-cutter story. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane team up again as husband and wife (after their turn as the Kents in ""Man Of Steel"") and provide another fine performance with a believable chemistry in what were difficult roles to play.Costner plays the part of George Blackledge, a retired sheriff, and Lane as his wife, Margaret. When their son dies, their daughter-in-law remarries and leaves the area, taking their grandson with them. However, before they leave town, Margaret witnesses a scene on the street where the new husband displays an abusive nature, leaving no doubt in her mind that their grandson is the victim of physical abuse. Margaret and George pack up some things and hit the road to find the location of their grandson, so they can take him out of harm's way. Despite his own reluctance, George agrees to go all the way leading up to the inevitable final confrontation.The thing that really struck me about this film, is that in some situations in life, we are forced to choose the lesser of two evils. Not so here. George, a former lawman, knows what is ""right"". Yet, he is faced with the dilemma of choosing the greater of two rights - no matter what it may cost in the long run. I found this to be refreshing in a way. Diane Lane was perfect in demonstrating such emotion, that her husband knew what decision he had to make. For his wife. For his family.Even so, despite the wonderful acting by all involved, this really isn't anything noteworthy or remarkable. By film's end, I was left feeling a little flat and uninspired. It wasn't a bad film, in fact, I would recommend it. It wasn't great either. It was just okay. Would I watch it again? Perhaps. But, I'm not in a rush to do so.

There are many scenes with dialogue that feels forced and it just make for an entertaining movie.For all the hype that the reviewers have been giving on here for Oscars and 10stars I can only assume that since the virus stuff has the theaters mostly empty, the studios are putting out their bare bones stuff.

The trailer kept coming up and it always caught my attention of looking pretty good, but I just figured it would turn out basic. Thomas Bezucha hasn't had the best track record for his movies. Let Him Go must've been a passion project for him because you can see the work put in. He, the cast, and crew put in enough effort to make this an actual good movie. The opening scene felt strange to me because of how well directed it is. The cinematography is beautiful, the score is one of the best of the year, the acting is great, and the direction is good. What got me even more was that it continues on throughout the entire movie. Like I said earlier, this must have been a passion project and you can see it right from the beginning.I came in most excited for the acting and I must say I'm not disappointed in the slightest. We have two leads we've seen together before, those being Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, and then taking the supporting role is Leslie Manville, who I just think is one of the best actresses out there. Kevin Costner has been sort of quiet these past couple years. It's nice seeing him again. I will admit I felt his performance was sort of dry in the first act, but as the movie continues he showed us that he is anything but mediocre. Diane Lane stoke the show for me. I expected Leslie Manville to but Lane has so much to offer. From the very start she puts herself into this role completely and you really feel for her. As for Manville, she's great as always. With this and Ordinary Love, she's had two great roles this year. The moment you first see her on screen, it's a given that this is going to be a great performance.Thomas Bezucha has a certain style of directing with this. It's good but doesn't work all the time. He's going for a quiet, slow burn. That is to be taken literally. The movie is really quiet. The sound design is great, but sometimes it doesn't feel right. It's great for building the suspense, but when not much is happening it feels like you're watching nothing. Slow paced movies are hard to master. In the first act, the pacing feels very slow. Until the main conflict happens, the pacing doesn't work. Even sometimes after the main conflict has happened, it still feels a little slow. It's not awful but when I think about the movie there's only three main events that happen. Those scenes are handled well, especially one with shock value. But by the end it does feel like not a whole lot happened. And one problem I had is with our antagonists: the Weboy family. There's not much of an explanation for them. We just have to except that they're evil. Other than that, this does have a lot to offer. The acting is great, good cinematography, good sound design, I'm going to mention Michael Giacchino's score once again because I've been listening to it ever since. Maybe another watch will help. And that watch won't have me going in thinking I'll be watching a mediocre movie. I'd still recommend Let Him Go as a good thriller and something to go see right now.",Let Him Go
49,donaldricco,Very good adaptation of the book!,8,21 April 2021,"A darn good adaptation of the book, which I liked so much! Diane Lane is perfect as Margaret Blackledge, the grandmother hell bent on getting her grandson back! When I read the book, I pictured Sam Elliot as George Blackledge, but Kevin Costner did a good job as George. And I think the little boy did a good job acting too! My only negative comment of the film, is that I liked the ending of the book much more. But this is a good film to enjoy!",Let Him Go
50,gsygsy,Kind of old-fashioned,7,1 December 2020,"There's a way in which this film could have been made in the 1940s. Substitute Bette Davis for Diane Lane, George Brent for Kevin Costner, and Mary Astor for Lesley Manville, and the structure would have been pretty much the same. Because the key conflict was, and is here, between female characters, such films were labelled ""women's pictures,"" which was meant as a derogatory term. But history's whirligig has brought about a welcome reassessment, by way of outstanding revisionist works such as THE HOURS and CAROL, as well as reimaginings such as THELMA AND LOUISE, in which the rivalry is replaced by partnership and cooperation in the face of common goals.In LET HIM GO, there are two strong-willed mothers who fight, by fair means or foul, for possession of a child. There's a nice moral ambiguity: it's not at all clear that Lane's character is any less ruthless than her nemisis, played by Manville. However, on the acting front it isn't ambiguous at all. Lane is very good. Very good indeed. But she's up against Manville, who is great. Very great, and in a mere handful of scenes. It might seem an unfair comparison when Lane's character carries the movie on her shoulders, but that's the way it is. The acting all round is high standard, but from the moment Manville appears she's the one you're interested in.All in all, it's a nicely-paced, old-fashioned movie, raised to a higher level by a knockout performance.",Let Him Go

53,Mike_Devine,A dark love letter to the American west,8,21 August 2021,"Western-set dramas usually have an advantage over others given the fact that the vast expanse of land often plays an important role in the film. In Thomas Bezucha's 'Let Him Go,' we're treated to a drak family drama set against the backdrop of the great northern plains.The duo of Kevin Costner and Diane Lane works really well in 'Go,' with the two veteran A-listers reaching deep to bring authenticity to their concerned grandparent characters. The chemistry between Costner and Lane is undeniable as they traverse Montana and North Dakota in search of their young grandson. But it's not just these two actors that make 'Go' a great film. Lesley Manville's portrayal of antagonist Weboy matriarch Blanche is enough to send shivers down your spine, and Native American runaway Peter (Booboo Stewart) plays an important role in the story.Aside from the amazing cinematography and acting, 'Go' benefits from scenes that tug on your heartstrings, from fear and disgust to love and respect. The majority of the film seems evenly paced, but the energy really turns up in the final third of the film, gripping you to your seat in an unexpected way.'Let Him Go' is quiet and understated, but it's really a masterclass in acting and directing that shouldn't be brushed off as just another western drama.",Let Him Go

It could've been a little shorter and I think that would've worked better. Aside from that, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are incredible. They both deliver intense performances, some of their best in years. Lesley Manville is twisted and delivers a commanding role.

57,Med-Jasta,Very good,9,5 July 2021,"First thing to point is that this isn't a spin off of Man of Steel. I'm just joking. But first thing is that the acting from the two leads is phenomenal. Not only their individual performances but the way that they interact with each other. Subtle looks they give each other and things like that. They really reminded me of married couples that have been together for a very long time. Oh course much of this was written but their acting really did what only good actors could do.The story is very good and subtle. Not every little thing is explained. The movie moves at a slow/steady pace with no moment wasted or extraneous. When they set up cutting off Costner's finger's I was like, ""He's either gonna pull away or the guy isn't going to do it or hit the table."" I didn't think in a million years think that he was actually going to cut his fingers off. And keeping it out of focus was a nice touch. It prevented it from being gratuitous and made it so you could actually see it. Without cutting around and leaving you to guess.The only problem I had was that I wish the bad family was explained a little more. Maybe there wasn't more to explain. But they seemed to have some serious connections across the Midwest for some reason. Including having the cops on their side. We never know if they have money (which it didn't look like) or if they have and kidnapping ring or something. And it's kind of alluded to that they killed their son but not really. I wasn't sure what to think.And the scenes with the evil mom were weird but I guess they were supposed to be. They could have been a little shorter. And the ending was a little strange. The staging of it or something was weird. I don't think Costner's character would have thought that he could do anything in his state. I was disappointed that Diane Lane didn't come and save the day. I really thought they were setting that up.But other than that very good and effective.",Let Him Go

The film drags at times and you think get on with it by the time the film does get good it gets good. The acting from Diane Lane is amazing it shows how great and underrated she is as an actress.

61,flicklover,A solid film in a horrible time to go into a theater.,8,8 November 2020,"Covid 19 has been of course a horrible pandemic and we've been living clodef away for the modt part since March. Going to the movies has been my favorite thing to do since i was a kid. I love film, and even though I have a nice home theater at home there us nothing like going to a theater and view a film the way it was meant to be. Of course the studios pulled every big release until next year and when the movie theaters opened they were forced to play older films and pretty much unknow left overs thst the studios had no confidence in. I actually enjoyed watching movies that i already oened on the big screen, but the new releases were mostly average. Utterly forgettable.The trailer for Let Him Go looked very promising. It stars Diane Lane and Kevin Costner Margaret and George. An aging ranch couple that loses their married son in a freak horseriding accident. His wife Lorna who had a son with remarries a guy named Donnie. They move out of her parent in-laws house and move into town. In going to visit them, Margaret witnesses Donnie treating her grandson Jim and Lorna badly. She is horrified but says nothing. The next time Margaret goes to visit, they are gone. Worried, she asks around and decides to look for her grandson. She tells George what she saw and they decide to search together. They find out where Donnie's family lives and go to the Dakotas to look. They find out that Donnie's family us dangerous and are warned to be careful. They are taken to the family house by Billy Weboy slimily played by Jeffery Donavan. They meet the matriarch of the Weboys Blanche played by Leslie Manville. Shevreally is good as Blanche but you know where the movie is going because she is really hamming it up as a crazy, as a crazy domineering mother. The Blackledges see the dangerous situation that Jimmy and Lorna are in so they try to convince her to come back with them. The Weboys find out and tge film turns pretty violent. The weboys attack George and Blanche and warn them to leave them alone or they will hurt their grandchild. The last act is basically a revenge, rescue story.The film is not incredibly original but the performances are very good. Diane Lane is great. Kevin Costner is a good also. They have a good chemistry as an older couple that have gone through alot of pain but still love each other. The focus on that is very good because you care about their situation. All of the cast us very good. They Weboys are not given much to do but be evil but we definitely hate them!!!A solid new film in a very scarce time to go to a movie theater.Grade: B+",Let Him Go
62,movieman6-413-929510,"Old-fashioned, slow, but intense western.",6,3 December 2020,"Let Him Go is a new western crime drama directed, partly written and produced by Thomas Bezucha. He has also directed Big Eden, The Family Stone and Monte Carlo.In the movie, retired Sheriff George (Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret (Diane Lane) have lost their son. The two decide to travel to North Dakota to visit their ex-daughter-in-law and grandson after learning that she has remarried. The Weboy family their ex-daughter-in-law is married to appears to be a dark criminal family. George and Margaret are unsure whether it is a suitable family for their grandson and try to save him from this family.This film comes across as an old-fashioned Western with a slow but intense pace where two different families try to keep the grandson in their family. For example, the film sometimes comes across as a long Game of Thrones episode where the characters argue with each other, but if someone says something wrong, it can cause more restless tension.The acting is also done well by the film cast. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane have great chemistry together in this movie and come across as believable as an elderly couple. Lesley Manville, along with Jeffrey Donovan, creates some uncomfortable tension in the film as the Weboy family.",Let Him Go

Then after a few years, Lorna marries Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain) and they move to an apartment in town. On a trip downtown Margaret sees Donnie and Lorna and her grandchild Jimmy and then Donnie smacks Jimmy and also smacks Lorna. One can see both are afraid of Donnie. Of course, Margaret is shocked. Later when Margaret bakes a cake for them and goes to visit, she learns that Donnie, Lorna and little Jimmy have gone. Margaret is determined to find them and make sure little Jimmy is okay. George is reluctant, but goes along.This is slow going, but this is a serious matter both George and Margaret are undertaking. George tries to be the voice of reason, but Margaret is determined to go alone if she has to. They do find out where the WeBoy family are and head that way. This is where the story really begins.Notables: Jeffery Donovan as Bill Weboy, who takes George and Margaret to the family house; Booboo Stewart as Peter, who lives alone in the desert and later helps Margaret; Lesley Manville as Blanche Weboy, the mother, who rules the roost and all are afraid of her.Good, but heartfelt story and very good performances by both Kevin Costner and Diane Lane and they share good chemistry with each other.

70,peeedeee-94281,"Deliverance Meets Wind River's Finale, Done In A Western Style",5,16 November 2020,"Some problems I felt with the first half of this movie (before they went on their quest). There were problems with the flow of time. It just seemed like the movie kept jumping around, it was hard to get a sense of when things were unravelling. I mean, I guess that whole wedding thing was meant to be a surprise, since it looked like they were getting dressed for a funeral, but it was just too big of a jump without a good transition. Secondly, some of the dialogue felt like it was being stretched out with either long sections of silence, or for whatever reason, a character would take forever to finally bring up a point or issue, rather than saying it immediately (like a normal person would). The last thing is they never really say what happened to the son. At certain points throughout the movie, it almost felt like it was supposed to be a murder, with an unknown motive (to get the wife to marry a new person? To take over the horse business?). It just felt like they were dancing around it without really saying what happened, or how it really affected the family. The title 'Let Him Go' - was that meant for the Diane Lane's mother to let go? Is that final scene in the burning house supposed to be the 'letting go' moment?
Then the movie changes gears into a Deliverance meets Wind River (the finale), done in a Western style movie. They introduce the native american character, but after finishing the movie, it's almost like he wasn't really necessary. Other than providing the horse near the end. It felt like his character was shoehorned into the film to touch on another issue for the sake of raising it.
At the end in the final confrontation, it was a bit sloppy. I'm assuming the second son running up the stairs was shot dead, because mama had originally told him to go out and get the daughter-in-law. I guess Donnie Weboy died in the fire, even though he was cold-cocked by Costner's character with the barrel of the shotgun. And for a household that was supposedly hard to find from the main road, they had no issues leaving it, and going into it again, in the dark.
Lastly, it seems like they reference Costner's characters history as a lawman many times, but there doesn't appear any payoff, other than the scene at the police station where he asks the other officer to look up Donnie Weboy's family. But he could have done that if he was a well-respected friend of the sheriff or some other known person in town. The cop angle, with the service revolver, seemed unnecessary, and felt like it was done as a setup for something bigger that never pays off.
I got to see this in the theater, so that was a plus. But you may find yourself fast forwarding through many parts, especially in the first half. An okay effort, but it doesn't feel like it was developed really well. More padding just to get it close to the 2 hour mark, and sadly hints of ideas or directions that never materialize.",Let Him Go

77,bastille-852-731547,"Taut, generally satisfying Western drama-thriller",7,5 November 2020,"This new Western blends elements of noir, drama, and suspense to create a generally searing character study. Set in the 1960s, it tells the story of a retired sheriff (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Diane Lane.) Their young grandson has been spending time with his stepfather, whom they view as suspicious and is married to their son's widow. The leading couple leaves from Montana to the Dakotas to visit their step-family and try to get their grandson back, but things go south very quickly. The performances are generally powerful all around. Costner and Lane give clear emotional depth as well as a real sense of genuineness and urgency while in character. They feel haunted with grief from the death of their son, yet also proactively driven by a strong desire to ensure their grandson is properly treated. The film's cinematography of the Great Plains is gorgeous (although it was actually filmed in Alberta, Canada,) and the score is also quietly powerful.In the second half of the film, the dramatic tension is gradually increased both through the slow-burn tone as well as the dialogue. The film's gritty and slow-burn style may remind viewers of thrillers written and/or directed by Taylor Sheridan. Without going into any detail, suffice it to say that characters' instincts may be brought to a boiling point. However, the sudden and occasionally uneven increases in dramatic tension as well as violence do not always feel conducive to the film's tone. As a result, the film doesn't quite comment as starkly on its characters' behaviors or the nature of violence as thoughtfully as it intends to. The motivations of the characters are also rather predictable, and outside of Costner and Lane's characters, I did not find the rest of them to be especially engaging. Even though the characters are well-developed, the roles they play in creating some of the story's suspense are not inherently unique. That said, this is still a well-acted and well-shot thriller that should please patient viewers that know what they're in for. 7/10",Let Him Go

Made me feel uncomfortable at times. Heartbreaking at times. Really funny at times. A great watch.It's really food for thought the relationship between in laws and their sons widow, it's obviously an unusual and complicated situation, especially once she remarried and joins another family.The scene where jimmy drops ice cream and Donnie shows his abusive side really pulls on the audiences heartstrings and gets them onside.There are some great conversations between George and Margaret and it really shows the great relationship they have - 'Happy? Happy not to get a lecture' 'Didn't wanna find out I needed it and didn't have it (gun)'The Hotel scene is harrowing and real and shows how a situation could easily escalate with George getting his hand chopped off.The Sheriff is a coward and shows the pull the weboys have.In the end I'm made up Blanche and the rest of the clan get their heads blown off. Only downside is George doesn't make it, however the way Margaret whispers all the good memories to him as he is dying like she did with strawberry was fantastically emotional.

I thought, ""Wow, Kevin Costner is really typecasting himself these days."" Yes, there are still elements of that, but for the most part, this has a different plot and much better character development for the two leads. It's a slow burn that allows you pretty good insight on the MO of these two characters, their history, and motivations. Unfortunately, the character development is mostly spent on them, as the ""villains"" are quickly presented as caricatures without offering any substantial information why they are the way they are.

The plot has at its center the 'kidnap by marriage' of aged Margaret and George's grandson, goaded on by another interestingly psychotic family of near in-laws, resembling to no small degree the Snell Family of Netflix's 'Ozark', though this time featuring North Dakota as that bastion of redneck eccentricity.

The film is authentic feeling enough to really drag you into it, whether you like where it's going or not. I think for most mature audiences, it will affect them in this way for the most part. Thankfully this is not just another predictable Hollywood film. It certainly isn't unfamiliar territory, not at all, but it's certainly far more uncompromising and the characters are more realistic than most modern Hollywood films; And therefore the film is a breath of fresh air on this basis alone, even though the movies atmosphere is somewhat stifling. It seemed to me that this role was absolutely perfect for Diane Lane at this stage in her career/life. Or is it that she just totally embodied the character and nailed it? Definitely both! In my view anyway. And the Oscar goes to...if I was handing them out. She was amazing in this. I would even venture to say one of the better female performances I've seen out of Hollywood in the last many years. She was that good, and the part was also a pretty interesting one. Subtle and intense I think describe her performance the most accurately. Costner was definitely very understated and subtle himself in another very strong performance. My advice to those with mature viewing eyes, don't miss this film!8/10.",Let Him Go

90,Critical Eye UK,"Nasty, ugly film-making at its worst",1,25 September 2021,"Desperately hyped as a 'neo-Western' by the film's publicists (unsurprisingly, the meaningless phrase has been regurgitated by many a brain-dead critic and commentator) 'Let Him Go' is to the Western what 'Planet of The Apes' is to Busby Berkeley musicals.Angst ridden, cliche-drenched, it's a pointless rendering on the big screen of a novel which, if the film is true to its literary roots, must have avoided its publisher's slush pile only by the narrowest of margins.As a movie, it has no purpose other than to depress the viewer and inculcate within it an unhealthy hatred of the ludicrous pantomime villains (the Welboy family, unoriginal homicidal retards borrowed with no hint of acknowledgment from one of Wes Craven's repellent familial excesses.)Popular with many critics so bereft of critical faculty that they'd worship the clothes of a naked Emperor, the biggest mystery about 'Let him Go' is how two reasonably intelligent artists like Costner and Lake came to associate themselves with it.Not that Costner does much by way of that association; required to do no more than occasionally grunt, he obligingly complies, whilst Lake does the heavy lifting in a script so ridiculously lazy that it can't be bothered to even attempt a sketch of pivotal character Lorna (played, if that's not too strong a word, by Kayli Carter) daughter-in-law of Lake's assertive Margaret and Costner's mummified George.Without Kayli and her unexplained conduct, there'd be no book and no film, (sighs of relief all round) and yet in the film version she's almost out of it anyway; we are given no insight into her character nor the slightest reason as to why in the wake of her husband's accidental death she should've wanted to marry loathsome bully Donnie Weboy (another character barely played, this time by Will Brittain.)So contrived is this blatant daftness that Lake has the unenviable task of being repeatedly required to regale everyone with the film's back story: 'we're looking for our daughter-in-law and her son -- our grandson'. Which indeed they are, Costner dour, almost mute, Lake animated, forceful, articulate, she seemingly more concerned than he about the way Weboy, Lorna and three-year-old grandson Jimmy have suddenly vanished from the locality to God knows where.It's actually at this point, early on in the movie, that you realize what you're watching is sheer drivel.Margaret, portrayed here as an intelligent resourceful woman, knows (or should know) exactly what to do. Having witnessed Weboy bullying the little child and assaulting Lorna, she resolves to set off in pursuit of them, taking the mutely compliant ex-Sheriff husband George with her.Well er, um, yes, that's exactly what would happen in real life. . . Not. Never mind Margaret ringing child protection services; never mind George reporting a criminal assault and prompting a police investigation; never mind anything remotely reasoned, civilized, or credible.Watch 'Let Him Go' and from this point on you know, with fast-sinking heart, that you're in Amateurville -- as distinct from the kind of Auteurville director/ writer (or co-writer) Thomas Bezucha must most sincerely have wished to appear to be the case.Instead, 'Let Him Go' is a cheap-jack contrivance from start to sleazily appalling finish, a truncated odyssey -- truncated because its anything-but-ambitious narrative arc goes no further from A than B -- made all the more tedious due to the fact that as presented here on screen, both Margaret and George are semi-senile idiots and that the movie (and for all I know) the original book should've thankfully ended with a single call to the child protection agency. And then we'd all have been spared.But Bezucha clearly has no idea what is, in cinematic terms, credible and what is fatuous. Determined to showcase his own self perceived directorial talent he has George and Margaret halting in their odyssey at various old Kodak Photo-points so we can admire Bezucha's North Dakota landscape panoramics of wide blue sky and overhead fluffy whites etc.It's during one such witless Kodak Moment when the couple, so intent on tracking down their missing grandchild that they've decided to act like tourists and take time out to go sightseeing from a cliff edge, that Bezucha introduces us to yet another pivotal character about whom we are told little and care even less.This is Peter Dragswolf (Booboo Stewart) a Native American who without cause or explanation decides to involve himself in Margaret and George's affairs. That he's merely a plot device is pretty obvious from the get-go; serving no purpose on first appearance, he exists as a character only so that Margaret can have some help at the movie's nauseatingly hilarious climax.It's impossible not to wish that Lorna and Peter had met earlier, two cyphers with nothing to say and not much to do, and thus spare us from the rest of the dross cooked up by Bezucha as a pretend-recipe for serious film-making.It's after meeting up with Peter that the couple eventually confront a donkey-faced mouth-full-of-teeth Central Casting grinning moron (Donnie Weboy's uncle Bill), who George, had he been any kind of semi-intelligent Lawman at any time during his Sheriff's career, would've instantly recognized as a potentially dangerous psycho.But no. Ex Sheriff George discerns no such threat -- rarely has the usually bright Costner played so dumb a character -- and instead allows Margaret to ride along with the lunatic in Bill's truck as he leads the way to his insane sister's home.At which point, 'Let Him Go', already creaking at the seams with its lack of originality and credible narrative support, really does fall apart. Suddenly, camera and script are so focused in on Blanche, Donnie's mother and mad matriarch of the off-the-grid out-of-their-minds Weboy clan that it's as if some raving lunacy from a Wes Craven blood-fest has been grafted on: an entirely different film on the end of this one, stuck there by a writer/director who has given up trying to cope.Saddled with so literally unbelievable a role as Blanche, Lesley Manville strives frantically to distract viewers' attention from the unfolding gibberish with a scenery-chewing performance so far over the top that one fears for Bezucha's directorial future -- unable to control the movie's ridiculous plot it now seems he can't even control his over wrought actors.Ultimately -- but of course! -- it all ends in graphic, gratuitous violence, a series of otherwise unwarranted blood-splattered scenes of sadistic brutality that are nevertheless so badly written and directed that the all-powerful Blanche manages to inadvertently shoot and kill, one after the other, not one but three (!) of her deranged sons until she finally kills Costner's stupefyingly dumb George and, predictably, is shot-gunned to death by Margaret.Amidst the violence, the screaming and the gore, the three year old grandson looks on, forever to be traumatized by what he's seeing (a discomforting reality way beyond the movie's scope or its writers' non-existent empathy).And thus 'Let It Go' ends, an unsavory exercise in ineptitude that diminishes its audience by insulting their intelligence and soiling them with its repellent excesses.VERDICT: Rarely has a movie been as devoid as this of taste and talent. An ugly, nasty little piece of film-making, 'Let Him Go' marks a new low in dispiriting cinematic trash.",Let Him Go

Selfish to the bone yet you can see she has a heart, she just doesn't know how to give and take with people.... which takes skill as an actor. The chemistry between Lane and Costner is gentle yet stiff, but was probably crafted like that to create that old married couple tension yet acceptance of two people who are probably still in love with each other but have over time reluctantly learned to accept and live with each other's deficiencies.... definitely more-so with Costner's character.Lane plays the stubborn strong headed women who simply can't let others get something without her agreeing to it perfectly and as a result she has no friends. Costner accepting life's lot as a retired Sheriff who's probably seen enough over 30 years to just be resigned to the fact some people are simply bad, others difficult and most everyone else is between good and grey, so he's just tired and worn out and doesn't care anymore.Their relationship is the crux of the story, beyond that the rest is more or less standard western fare, inbred hillbilly family with domineering mother kidnap child and absolutely long overdue deserve everything they get, good versus bad mixed in with a bit swipe of indifferent, crooked local cop backing hillbillies, thin daughter in law relationship with Lane character, etc, and a sad unfulfilling ending, confirming there's no justice in life only the justice you decide to accept, or can scratch out of a bad situation.Was a good enough film but could have been better, endings where the good guy doesn't get what he truly deserves are never satisfactory even they probably reflect real life more realistically.",Let Him Go

Lorna soon remarries an abusive man named Donnie Weboy, well-played by Will Brittain, who is viewed by George and Margaret as suspicious, he, Lorna and Jimmy move into town away from George's farm. Concern presents itself when one day Margaret witnesses Lorna and Jimmy being physically abused by Donnie, and then without any word he relocates them to North Dakota to live with his twisted mother Blanche, chillingly played by Lesley Manville in a brilliant scene-stealing performance, and her psychotic family. Margaret persuades George to go after them for the sake of their young grandson Jimmy, but when they get to North Dakota it will soon turn into a very disturbing and dangerous encounter with the Weboy clan that will have some tragic consequences.

The oddly standoffish relationship between Costner and Lane is tinged with romantic elements. The landscapes of the West in the 1960's is romantic. The 1950's itself is romanticized. Costner gives a brooding, powerful performance as a deeply thoughtful and powerful man. This might be one of his best performances to date. He plays it close to the vest. Lane is the driving force of the mission that sets the wheels in motion for this western drama with a chilling tone that is also a Hithcockian suspense thriller. The acting is superior.

122,zacdawac,"Compelling, unexpected thriller but how real were the Deboys?",8,3 September 2021,"I hadn't heard of this film and I knew little about it when I found it on the HBOMax menu. I decided it deserved a chance, primarily because of the two leading players. The assumption was it would be an intelligent, well crafted film, though I wasn't sure whether to expect a western, a slice of life somber drama or a tragedy. While it incorporated all of the above, if I had to categorize it, I would call it a rare edge of your seat thriller about real people in credible situations. Or was it?Yes, the Deboys were intriguing, especially for a Brooklyn bred lifelong New Yorker who hasn't spent a lot of time with creatures like that. However, I have to question how authentic they were. Yes, there are many extremes in our country and our world. This allows writers and filmmakers to stretch characters to their credibility limits. Maybe if the Darling clan, from the hills outside Mayberry, had cross bred with Ma Barkers gang, they would have ended up with the Family Deboy. But why are these unkempt backwoods mountain people so well known across state lines? And why does the local sheriff favor them and seem to automatically side with them, as if they were big time gangsters or affluent leading local citizens and he was on their payroll? But then, we're never told what any of the Deboys do for a living. Maybe they own the local lumber mill or control the drug trade and gambling and prostitution businesses. But then, why do are they all crammed on top of each other in an old run down house? They don't come across as people who would have the local police in their pockets. More likely, the two lawmen in the small town would be afraid to tangle with them.After the past few years, I'm ready to believe the worst of the deep south and middle America. Lets assume that somewhere in the back mountain hills of Dakota (to borrow from the great Paul McCartney) there lives a family like the Deboys.

It's a slow burn drama that builds up with emotions and intensity, so if you're expecting non stop action, you probably won't like it. The stars play a couple whose son dies from an accident. The widow of their son remarries into an abusive relationship. The stepfather takes away her and her son to live with his crazy family. The kind of people who would probably kill you if you looked at them the wrong way. Costner and Lane, the grandparents of their sons only son, want to get him and the mother back, and get them away from the abusive stepfather. But they have to go through hell with the stepfather and his crazy family to do so.
A meeting of the crazy in laws at a dinner table is so tense, you can cut it with a knife. A confrontation in a hotel room and the suspenseful, emotional ending had me on the edge of my seat.

When she remarries and soon after up and leaves town, the stage is set for the grieving lane to go after them. Costner, a retired lawman, and her head off together. Thru multiple flashback scenes you get a real sense of there lives together, as they shared happy times and heartbreak. So far, so good. This all changes as the story turns into an inane, violent theatre of the absurd. You see, it seems this new husband of hers comes from a family of backwoods nut jobs. There cartoon character of a mother leading the way. Fingers are cut off, bodies start piling up, and eventually the majority of the cast, including Costner go up in flames, literally.

Don't go in expecting to be spoon fed by characters having long expositions telling us all how they feel about everything. This is the kind of 'move a spoon on the table to convey deep trauma' kind of film. In one scene, the grandmother is dressing for what we assume is her son's funeral. But no, it's three years later and she's dressing to attend her daughter-in-law's new marriage, knowing she's thus going to lose her grandson to the new stepfather. None of this is explained, you are just asked along on this painful journey, as lost as these people themselves. It's so rare to have a film about the grandparent experience, without it being cute or attempting to be funny, and this did it extremely well. Costner was basically made for this role: the silent yet extremely deep man who always seems a little lost in the modern world.Slow, builds, stays with you.

The last half of this movie will have you hooked cause it is brutal and intense and the last 30 minutes will have you jolting. Costner and Lane are back in the game, so if anybody wants to marry their widow and take their kid from them, don't expect them not to come find you, cause they will.

Good recreation of the 60s like No Country For Old Men did the 70s. Acting was them usual solid stuff for Lane and Costner, they had chemistry which was nice, the story line was just ok and maybe could have used some development in some of the other characters other than the young Indian fellow, they could have just made him a footnote and developed the others a bit more. i felt for the grandparents but that was about it. Maybe more could have been done but it was a fair shot at Death Wish, Unforgiven, Silverado type films. It wasn't as long as some people say it is, under 2 hrs was just enough and though the ending was not happy it was fitting. My verdict?

Diane Lane's character was one of the most unlikable supposed ""heroes"" I've ever seen in a movie. In the end she got what she wanted and it only cost her husband his fingers and eventually his life, and the lives of an entire other family of five. But hey, I guess it was worth it because she whispered in his ear after he took a bullet meant for her. Hard to believe she's supposed to be the ""good guy"" in this movie.

Too slow if you ask me. The first third I thought it is about grief and how the couple will cope with it. I thought it might show how difficult a loss is for a relationship. But then it sloooowly came to light that this is more about - yes what? Abduction? Custoday battle? How things were back in the days? Brutal families?

Chemistry between the two as an aging married couple is impressive and very believable. Also a shout out to main female protagonist/matriach Blanche Weboy played with evil aplomb by Lesley Manville (Maleficent).To its credit, accurate representation of the era (60s), great cinematography of the stunning Badlands vistas and an atmospheric score add to the proceedings, but alas, the pacing is a bit slow over its linear two hour run time while the outcome becomes pretty apparent once we meet the movie's surrogate family from Hell.The storyline is well documented already so I won't bother going into min-ute detail, but if i do have a major gripe it's that Lane's relentless obsession with waltzing into a perfectly legal if dubious situation focused only on her own selfish motives was rather obviously short-sighted and foolhardy, as you will no doubt see for yourself.All in all not a classic by any stretch, but still a competent slice of old-school Americana with a couple of decent twists and turns by journey's inevitably lonely end.",Let Him Go

Set work is literally out of this world.HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a good western thriller and period piece.

They made Diane Lane out to be some sort of 70 year old sex symbol - totally weird and completely unrealistic. Diane's acting was bad. The story is about taking back a grandson that is possibly abused by his step-father. Costner and Lane go on a road trip and literally show up with a chip on their shoulder and make a bad situation so much worse. The entire story is unrealistic and stupid.

188,jazzyedwards,Great Oscar Worthy Dark Western Thriller!! Don't listen to bad reviews!!,8,4 February 2021,"Not sure why this film got so many bad reviews. Is it a little slower at times? Yes. It is not meant to be a full on action packed movie. The film keeps your attention all throughout. Diana Lane and Kevin Costners on screen chemistry is DYNAMITE! The film is very emotional at times but still stays suspenseful. The real award should also go to Leslie Manville. She does an amazing job playing the sinister, deeply disturbed, unhinged, flagitious villain. Leslie Manville's performance was oscar worthy in my opinion. SHe kept the movie very suspenseful. Jeffery Donovan is also very good. The one issue I had with the film was the ending. The ending was pretty abrupt. It was very quick. It's like we watched the whole film, which it is a little slower, but then the ending just came so fast and then it was over. I definitely wished that the director would have made other parts of the movie shorter or cut some of the slower parts out and drug out the ending, which also had the most action, a little bit more. We needed a longer, more built up, and action packed ending. Other than that it was a great film!!",Let Him Go

If you see the way he simply uses his hand to soft the temperamental argument, just perfectly done.

Also, for retired policeman Costner's character(don't even remember his name) should know how to use a gun in a situation that requires the use of a gun. He seems to figure it out at the end though. When you pull a gun on somebody and they still come at you trying to get your gun , you shoot them. He deserved to have his fingers chopped off. And why did they put the fingers on ice and take them to the hospital with them to be reattached. That is something that is fairly easily done nowadays. Things like that is what made this movie so frustratingly difficult to watch. There's no surprises if you think it's gonna happen, it Happens.

His introduction was awful and awkward too.I enjoy Costner and Lane but these performances were not good at all and they knew it. I'm not blaming them though as they had horrible material to work with.I could go on for way too long about all the things wrong with this movie but it's not worth my time.For those that said the bad reviews are from young people who don't have a good attention span - I doubt any young person would willingly watch this considering the premise and that Costner and Lane are older actors.

The pace is painfully slow, and I did not feel much for the grandparents, or the grandchild being abused by the father-in-law.
If you want a good version of a movie like this, try Changeling (2008) starring Angelina Jolie. You can prob get it for free on some movie channel or something.It's funny because we saw this movie in a huge AMC theater where there were literally only 4 attendants watching including myself.

I enjoyed seeing Kevin Costner and Diane Lane on screen together and it was a good, although very dark and tragic story with little light. The love exuded by the 'good' characters made this film have enough heart and light to not be completely depressing. And I wouldn't mark a film down for being sad or depressing anyway because if that is its aim and done well, then in my mind, it's worked.However, I felt this became quite pantomimy (not a word I know?!) In the later 3rd and some of the lesser part characters felt a bit like caricatures. This was by no means a subtle film and I think it would have stood out a lot in the 90s.

The story is simple and almost poor, but I cannot say that this is a problem itself, the problem is it's difficult to tell a story that simple in a two-hour film without leaving the viewer feeling bored, and this is the main defect of the film.
It's Very slow in events and taking more time than necessary To go from chapter to chapter, and that killed the tension that it created very well many times.The weakness of the story along with the slow events affected the level of excitement, but it was rich at the level of drama, it was excellent especially in the relationship between the husband and the wife, and it wasn't traditional and distinguished. It grasps The viewer attention and makes him thinking in order to understand it, and this was impossible without the wonderful performance of the two leading actors (Kevin Costner) and (Diana Lane), especially Diana and I personally consider her to be one of the best actresses of her generation, but the sad thing is no one talks about how good she is. Diana in recent years has presented many roles, all of which are dramatic, supportive but important roles that have a noticeable presence, this time she takes the leading role which is amazing and she was so great
About Kevin Costner, we can say that he acted in the movie with experience. His performance was simple and calm without any exaggerations or moments of explosion, and this easy, reluctant, was appropriate for the character and expected of an actor like himThe directing of the film was simple and straightforward, but it had no problems, and the cinematography was very good with comfortable shots.
The music was also very nice and suitable for the calm events, and I really liked the absence of music completely in the scenes in which the tension was reaching the maximum, because this increased Stress.The film has another important problem, which is the ending, which was very hasty and not at all brilliant, and its flaws were the defects of the script and directing at the same time, so the scenes were illogical and poorly executed.",Let Him Go

It managed to satisfy my insatiable ardor for suspense while adding the endearing and intimate elements of a family movie and the depth and emotion of a drama. So many genres intertwined and merged into one made for a stellar presentation. The fact that my boyfriend who usually falls asleep during movies remained awake the whole way through this movie and actively commentating is another proof in the pudding this was a great. Getting past my love for the movie, I fell in love with the characters.

Diana ends up getting her husband killed after playing mind games with him saying shes gona link up with some indian on a horse, extend the house lol this is straight after her actions result in him losing fingers to an axe.... The worst part is alot of people die and I dont think they were bad people maybe just had poor upbringings and hard lives. Its really hard to say who is the villan..

She didn't leave the Indian behind, I wondered why she didn't ask him to go along too but if you think about it, he already said he didn't belong anywhere - he's not comfortable around other people (and if you knew Indian history, you'd know why!). I didn't like that Costner's character died but more because Lane already stated she ""lost both of them"" - when she meant her son and her grandson, but now she lost her son and her husband. This is not the only reason I was disappointed but the main reason.I understand feeling the need to save your grandson when you think he is being abused and look what he would have grown up with ? Mommy didn't have the courage but grandma did! I purchased this as opposed to renting and I do regret that choice but just like a lot of movies out there, it had its good and it had its bad. I would want Costner to survive, but I'm no where near a writer so I don't know what they were going for or gaining by having his character die. His support of his wife (and grandchild) got him nothing but torture (fingers and death).Think about it, this was caused by all one bad choice from Lorna - women never know if a man is going to be like Donnie was but you could tell she knew by the wedding day, but she was probably scared already by then.I hate giving anything with Costner in it a 6 but I was sort-of disappointed in some of this movie - but it did keep me interested.",Let Him Go

I mean, I get that they were an old couple, but gee, they had no help in the whole movie? No family or friends down to help George out so that he wouldn't have died in the end? They were just so helpless. It could have went many other ways. I didn't see this to be the only way for it to end. Didn't they go through enough in their life to where Margaret didn't have to lose her husband? And they had 1 gun? Come on, they were rancher for god sake. I dunno, I just didn't like that. Great movie, but then end pissed me off. It would have been even better to see some family or friends going ag it with the weboys. Like some old shoot outs or something.

But Gramps losing his hand and that selfish granny still wanting life her way??? So cramps has to die for her...what am I missing here.
Both women are scorched earth control freaks.",Let Him Go
335,maw-887-477582,Poor Man's Rambo,2,20 December 2020,Slow burner that turns into a poor man's Rambo for the last 15 minutes to bring a rapid end to a disappointing movie. Completely unbelievable self indulgent Costner garbage. A waste of 2 hours in 2020.,Let Him Go
336,jmh-39622,Heart Wrenching Family Story Gone Wild,8,9 November 2020,This was like watching Father Knows Best (salty version) meets MA Barker and her boys! It was a good story that moved along well with the beautiful backdrop of the mountains of the west. There was pathos and you connected with the characters. I like watching a movie geared towards 50+ year olds! Make more.,Let Him Go
337,moviefan-00289,Wasted 2 hours of my life!!!,2,4 April 2021,I cannot begin to describe this pathetic movie. The (only) beautiful thing was the scenery and mountains. If he was a Lawman for 30 years. How in the hell couldn't he defend himself or his wife? Not only once but twice for heavens sake!!!Margaret should have offered Peter the Native American boy to come live with her. She should have offered him a home.,Let Him Go

340,ericdanielsed,Powerful,10,12 January 2021,The Most Powerful storytelling in today's films. The storytelling of Kevin Costner and Diane Lane you can feel their love and pain in this one. This film deserves all of the Oscars in my opinion. I highly recommend this for everyone to watch. Again Kevin Costner and Diane Lane you hit a grand slam with your performances in this one. Hope to see more films with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane teaming up in the future.,Let Him Go
341,bahadirkocer,Leaves a bad taste,4,7 December 2020,"The movie leaves a bad feeling because of the irrealistic scenes. Kevin is a former sherif but acts like an amateur.
Their son dies falling from a horse. Their daughter in law then marries a narsist, who himself also has been abused by his mother. The narsist abuses his wife and son and the new family move to the remote house of the narsists family. The grandmother and grandfather try to kidnap their grandson from the maniac family. The first attempt the grandfather his four fingers gets chopped of by the family. The second attempt the grandfather is forced to kill four or five people from the maniac family and he gets also killed. Finally the grandson gets rescued living with the grandmother.",Let Him Go

343,tkarajanisllc,"Wanted to like, but horrible ending choice!",4,18 July 2021,"I recall watching the trailer for this film when it was first released, and I so looked forward to seeing the movie. I was excited to see Kevin Costner and Diane Lane re-paired on film.The premise of the film is good: Western feel; the black hat/white hat ""ideology""; and the family pain/trauma abounds.However! The ending (without giving anything away) was just a HORRIBLE choice! I just don't understand why they went the direction they did. It made no sense and certainly didn't enhance the storyl. So many other options on how to end that storyline...instead I was left scratching my head in frustration and aggravation.",Let Him Go
344,softball-36814,Just watch it!,10,17 August 2021,"This is one of those movies that sticks with you. I was still thinking about this movie a few days after watching it. The acting is superior. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are perfect for their roles. Yeah the beginning is a little slow, but that's only because they are trying to build up the story line. There is nothing I would of changed about this movie!",Let Him Go
345,hanaharu,Multi-Layered,10,15 March 2021,"Deals with complex life situations; not at all simplistic. Thoughtfully written. Excellent actors. Beautifully and carefully directed. Outstanding photography. Pleasant, sometimes haunting, musical score.",Let Him Go
346,shermanvoeh,Good to watch once......,3,7 July 2021,"If Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are personal favorites, this is a good movie to watch at least once. It's based on a well received novel of the same title. While the actors do their best, the script is disjointed, characters not believable, plot holes irritating, characters that could use some fleshing out. The movie is a hatchet job of the book.Grieving mom/grandmother Margaret Blackledge (Diane) goes all out to save her young grandson Jimmy from a horrible life with abusive thugs instead of being supportive to her former daughter-in-law, widow Lorna. Lorna marries thug Donnie Weboy after living with her in-laws several years. Margaret witnesses Donnie physical abusing Lorna and Jimmy in public. Margaret was not seen, nor reports the behavior, yet the little Weboy family immediately skips town without goodbyes or forwarding address. Grandfather George (Kevin) does not seem to employ enough skills learned in as a retired sheriff to keep his family out of harm's way after locating the extended family of Weboys. Both of them sit there like idiots while the psycho step-family becomes increasingly aggressive towards them over matriarch grandma Blanche's porkchop dinner. Run! Get outside reinforcements if the local sheriff is as looney as the step-family! Don't take matters into your own hand(s)! While the entire Weboy family obviously has mental issues, it did not seem like they planned to harm grandson Jimmy or Lorna on pork chop night.The Blackledge's interactions with reclusive, native Indian Peter Dragswolf are strange and unnerving. Dragswolf is alone by choice after years of abuse by non-Indians. They intrude on his little camp with very little invitation. Leave him alone instead of jerking him into the story to risk his life just to fill in some gaps.Events surrounding their son James's sudden death at the beginning of the film are unclear - Did he have an aneurism? Was thug Donnie involved? By the time you find out near the end, who cares? Who was the ""Him"" that was let go? Who cares?Quote by George Blackledge: ""Sometimes that's all life is, Margaret. The list of what we've lost."" Add 1h 53min of movie time to the list.",Let Him Go
347,stevevalle-44593,Great movie....,9,6 December 2020,"Excellent acting and amazing scenery. The story is heart-wrenching and intense at times. Some reviews say the story is not believeable, but remember it is a movie. For what it's worth and believable is that many of us would got to the ends of the earth for the ones we love, and this movie captures that. Highly recommend it.",Let Him Go
348,cheninnewson,Watchable and compelling,6,2 April 2021,If you're a parent or grandparent this movie will touch a few nerves. The character development of our main characters are well written with an outstanding performance by Costner and Lane. However I feel like I needed to know more about our antagonists which were poorly written for the movie. It was difficult to understand the motives behind their actions and their drive to push back against our protagonists (without saying too much). Lots of questions left behind at the end but otherwise an enjoyable movie.,Let Him Go
349,dsp-12271,Congratulations to Mitch and Team,10,27 August 2021,"This is a great film, superb script based on an excellent novel, finely directed, and magnificently acted by Costner and Lane and other cast members. Mitch Kaplan is to be congratulated for this production success!Best wishes,
