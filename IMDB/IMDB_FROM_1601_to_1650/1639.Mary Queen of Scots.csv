0,TheLittleSongbird,A real lack of fight or power,4,15 February 2019,"Admittedly the trailer didn't really impress me, giving the impression of a visually attractive film with two good lead performances but one that had a weak to put it lightly script and a dull story. Still saw 'Mary Queen of Scots', as someone who really likes period/historical dramas, finds Mary Queen of Scots and Queen Elizabeth I fascinating historical figures and considers the cast talented, on top of wanting to see as many newly released films as possible.Even when judging it as a film on its own merits, 'Mary Queen of Scots' really failed to deliver. Much has been said about the historical inaccuracy and it is not hard to see why, am really trying to separate film and history in order to be fair but the inaccuracies felt more like bizarre distortions with no point that came over as rather insulting. It fails just as badly, perhaps actually even more so, in making interesting people that were actually really fascinating and have for good reason sparked much debate. Didn't think it was that awful as there were a few good things, but it really underwhelmed severely and it is completely understandable as to why it has left many disgusted. Said just above about the trailer not impressing me, did not change my mind at all seeing the film eventually and it was exactly what the trailer made it look like.Lets get the good things out of the way. Mostly 'Mary Queen of Scots' looks great. It is beautifully photographed with a lot of sumptuous atmosphere and the scenery and locations are rich in colour and opulence. Most of the costumes likewise, with some glaring exceptions of course. The music is both stirring and elegant, not feeling discordant or repetitive.Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie both heavily commit to their roles, making noble efforts in making them interesting, and doing so more than credibly. Actually though both of them were good, all things considered. Found a truly beguiling and really quite fearless Ronan to be the better of the two. One expects Elizabeth to be a full on pantomime character judging from her appearance here, but Robbie actually takes the role very seriously and gives Elizabeth much more dignity and subtlety than she deserved.The supporting cast didn't leave much of an impression, struggling to do anything serious or interesting with a sea of key historical figure character assasinations. David Tennant comes off the most memorably, but this unfortunately didn't come over in a good way as it felt over-the-top and didn't gel. Excepting Mary, none of the character felt real with vague motivations and flimsy at best development, rendering them as cartoonish caricatures that are either grossly exaggerated or under-characterised to blandness. There were exceptions when it came to the visuals. The look for Elizabeth was more pantomime dame than regal queen, with the worst offender being one of filmdom's worst ever prosthetic noses. Also found the Nostradamus look for John Knox just bizarre and like it was lifted out from somewhere else entirely. Nothing came over as authentic and one doesn't feel like they are being transported back in time and feeling they are there, when there is so much going on that distracts and pulls one away constantly. Inexperience really does show in the direction, good job with the visuals but the drama and story clarity are executed poorly.It was the pace, script and story that most disappointed in 'Mary Queen of Scots'. The pace never comes to life, with a severe lack of sparks or energy the film constantly felt very dull and the fictional meeting lacked tension and intrigue. The script (bad enough to warrant more than one sentence) manages to be even weaker and even more tonally muddled than it sounded in the trailer, the worst of it is quite cringe-worthy and frequently takes one out of the setting. Indicating that it was written in a rush with very little time to proof-read, because so much could have been taken out and re-written and it already would have been much better. Saying that the script has the nuances and subtleties of the bluntest of axes is being kind, those qualities can be found nowhere here. The story, again so flawed that one sentence isn't enough to sum up why, limps along badly to the extent one feels like they're trudging through mud and some of it even manages to be confused and vague, it wasn't even clear what it was trying to be. Some interesting ideas here, done nothing with, while the court, political and social intrigues neither intrigue or illuminate and instead induces head-scratching. The attempts at contrasting the plights of Mary and Elizabeth, done in a way that is as overused and tasteless as the other elements the film tosses in with no regard as to whether they were necessary or fitted, got repetitive and tired very quickly and increasingly became difficult to take seriously, the post-birth scene particularly belonged in a parody.Overall, very underwhelming film with fleeting moments of quality in the production values and two lead performances. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Mary Queen of Scots
1,bkoganbing,What she did for love again.,7,30 December 2018,"I guess it was time to tell the tale of Mary Stuart of Scotland once again so Saorise Ronan steps into the shoes that Vanessa Redgrave and Katherine Hepburn trod in before. And in her counterpoint rival Elizabeth I of England Australian
actress Margot Robbie who got nominated for an Oscar last year for the radically
different role of Tonya Harding in I Tonya trods where Glenda Jackson and before
her Florence Eldridge went before.The difference here I think and especially in contrast to Mary Of Scotland which Katharine Hepburn starred in is that Mary is a wilful creature who is
determined to have her cake and eat it too. After returning from France as
the widow of Francis II she is determined to rule and do it her way. She's
getting good advice from her nobles especially from her half brother the
Earl Of Moray played by James McArdle who was acting as regent. She
marries first Jack Lowden who has his own claim to the throne and wants it
recognized as such as Lord Darnley. After Darnley is disposed of in a grisly
manner, she marries Martin Compston as the Earl of Bothwell. He was
thought of as her husband's murderer. So when the revolt comes she flees
to England abandoning her throne she gets the protection and genteel house
arrest from her cousin Elizabeth whom she is next line for that throne.Part of Mary's problem and part of why Scotland ceased being an independent
country is that they had for a few hundred a succession of child monarchs with
regencies doing the governing. That mean power struggles and intrigue
perpetually among the nobles. These guys were used to having their way and
no widow from France was going to come over and rule them absolutely.Secondly she was in a country that the reformation like England had taken
place. Leading the reformation there is John Knox and he's played with fanatical intensity by David Tennant. He's outstanding among the supporting
cast. Not only was Mary a Catholic but while her father was James V of
Scotland her mother was Mary of Guise, daughter of the Duke of Guise of
France. The Guises led the ultra-Catholic faction in France, to use the old
expression they were more Catholic than the Pope. No way was Knox going
to accept her.As is normal though in fact they never met, drama dictates a meeting of
Elizabeth and Mary. Both Ronan and Robbie are at the top of their game
dramatically. I will say that the meeting unlike the previous two films I've
cited takes place under radically different circumstances.This Mary, Queen Of Scots takes its place along side its worthy predecessors.
Some good drama in this story and well played here.",Mary Queen of Scots
2,Leofwine_draca,More fantasy than real life,4,31 March 2020,"MARY, QUEEN OF THE SCOTS is the latest Hollywood movie to explore Tudor history. This one's a largely laughable enterprise that feels more like a fantasy film than anything remotely approaching real life. Margot Robbie's Elizabeth I is nothing like the 'real' version, and of course Glenda Jackson is still the ultimate portrayal of this character. As for Saoirse Ronan and her ridiculous hair, I don't have many comments other than she feels like a teenager pretending to be a royal. The murky political shenanigans feel tired and ill thought-out, and scenes where Mary dons a suit of armour to lead her troops fighting in the woods just had me shaking my head in shame.",Mary Queen of Scots
3,SnoopyStyle,are we sure?,6,25 February 2019,"Mary (Saoirse Ronan) was raised in the French court. After the death of her first husband King Francis II of France, the 19 year old Scot monarch returns to her homeland to take back the throne from her Protestant half-brother. She faces opposition from her Protestant subjects under constant attack by cleric John Knox and a rival in her cousin Queen Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). Her lineage gives her a better claim to both crowns. Elizabeth is in love with Robert Dudley but she is blocked from marrying the commoner. Mary marries Henry Stuart, an English Catholic lord, and faces rebellion from her many foes including her own husband.I'm no history expert and even I noticed some questionable takes by the movie. This is definitely trying to paint Mary as reasonable as possible. She's almost modern with a good helping of sisterhood. It's betrayed by a couple of incidents where she keeps pushing for the English crown. It's as if the settled history keeps interfering with the script's needs. It's also questionable to have Saoirse play Scottish when Mary is probably more French than anything. Margot Robbie could do better to show Mary's disconnection with her own country. I guess Saoirse at least looks more like Mary. The political intrigue is interesting but it does get jumbled with all the characters. Some get lost in the shuffle. I also don't know if England has a black ambassador at that time. It'd be great if true. There is the ethereal meeting in the cabin. I remember hearing that the two Queens never met face to face in real life. I can accept a bit of artistic license but this movie takes a lot more than a bit. At least, the cabin finally gets to the truth of Mary's character as far as I'm concern in her final outburst. As for the actors, Saoirse and Margot do exceptional work for what is asked of them. This is a movie of many battles and intrigue but the most defining victory may be a birth. I am uncertain about the accuracy of this movie and that taints any enjoyment.",Mary Queen of Scots
4,Horst_In_Translation,Period piece blockbuster,6,22 January 2019,"""Mary Queen of Scots"" is a British, mostly English-language full feature film from 2018 that runs for slightly over 2 hours and features 2 of the most talked about and successful actresses from the next generation: Saoirse Ronan playing the title character and Margot Robbie playing the legendary Queen Elizabeth I. The latter has received some awards recognition already with supporting nominations at the BAFTAs and SAG Awards, but nobody really considered her to get in at the Oscars, so maybe it is not too surprising she did not manage to score another nomination. However, the film did get 2 nominations in other categories which should not be ignored either. Apart from these two, the rest of the cast does not include any big names. One actress I was surprised to see in here, however, was Maria Dragus as I am from Germany and have seen her already in a lot. She plays one of the girls next to Mary Stuart here and the focus is clearly on the latter and not on Elizabeth, namely on the years when she returns as a widow to Britain and poses a threat to Elizabeth's throne. There is also major focus on the men in Mary's life, probably more than anything else. First of all, there is her man in France who died very early, then there is the man who she falls in love with in Britain, who eventually seems to be more interested in men, then there is a man who somewhat takes the role of being a close female friend. Then there is another very violent suitor. And then there is eventually also her brother and the company he keeps. Mary sure struggles a lot with all these and the impact they have on her life and you probably would not really expect who's the one responsible for her biggest downfall in the end. At least not right away. Well-acted from everybody. Still I must say I struggled with keeping my interest in this film despite me not being against period pieces, even if they are not my favorite genre. It says basically everything that the scene I remembered the most apart from the eventual meeting is the sequence in which Mary receives oral pleasure that I cannot deny as a straight male was really hot to watch.Now back to the story, a lot happens in this film, but the flow is not too steady in my opinion. It feels more like jumping from one (sometimes memorable) scene to the next than really watching and witnessing a coherent story line. So the script could have been slightly better I think, even if it for sure was not bad or anything. Oscar nominee Beau Willimon was in charge here and he adapted the book by John Guy. The director is Josie Rourke and while she has been prolific in other fields in recent years, this is her very first filmmaking effort as the (wo)man in charge. Not a bad job for that I think. Many renowned filmmakers have started worse. But yeah the most memorable production values are maybe makeup, art direction and costumes, even if especially Robbie's looks channeling HBC's Red Queen make her more memorable than her performance warrants and it may be fine that she did not manage the Oscar nomination. So all in all, this is a good film, maybe slightly too long for its own good and it could have done with 10-15 minutes less. But there are moments and scenes the film is worth seeing for, even if the character writing is not always spot-on, especially when it comes to Elizabeth's character. I still give it a thumbs-up and recommmend checking it out. But nonetheless, if you don't like Ronan as much as I do, then only see it if you love period pieces. Otherwise, you could end up disappointed here for the most part. It's not a triumph or anything.",Mary Queen of Scots
5,nogodnomasters,Wise men servicing the whims of women,6,24 February 2019,"The film opens in 1587 with Mary (Saoirse Ronan) about to be beheaded and then goes into a flashback. Mary was ahead of her time and her ability to outmaneuver Queen Elizabeth (Margot Robbie) was admirable but she lost in the end.I tend to love histories, but this an attempt to create a drama and chick flick that failed short. Queen Elizabeth was made to look like Helena Bonham Carter in ""Alice in Wonderland."" Seems to me, Mary could have had the crown had she just converted to Protestantism since she believed we all go to the same heaven.Guide: Sex. Partial nudity.",Mary Queen of Scots
6,kosmasp,"Sensible, yet harrowing",7,16 October 2020,"It is tough to make a real life movie about event that happened just a few years or decades ago. How is it to get it right with something that happened even longer ago? It is tough to say the least, especially if you try to be sensible about certain issues. That doesn't mean it holds back punches (or stabs for that matter). When it gets dark, it gets dark. But it tries and shows us an inevitability ... even when you mean well ... things can go south.The acting of our two main ladies is impeccable. Everyone else does a great job too. It is tough and especially public deception is high. While the two women are the main focus, it is not always what they do and say that matters. It is how it is perceived and even more so, how some try to help by promoting certain things. But once something is set in motion ..... there is almost nothing anyone can do to stop it. A movie that dares to be ugly and beautiful at the same time - and is a period piece for sure.",Mary Queen of Scots
7,Sleepin_Dragon,"You can't mess with history, if you do, you get junk like this.",3,23 September 2020,"Right...I will never simply trash a film, I even tried to find some good in Carry on Emanuelle, but this....It's trash, the trouble is I know this period of history, I studied it at A Level, I cannot recognise anything, characters, motivations, morals, politics.It's a sixteenth century story, given a twenty first century slant, so expect zero accuracy. I'm sorry, but this time was governed by religion, not gender, it's shocking to even hint that Mary or Elizabeth would have had such a degree of tolerance, or had such a liberal look on the world. I'd class myself as someone pretty liberal, but please don't mess with history, it's there to teach us. There is a visible agenda.It's not an entire write off, David Tennant as always is exquisite, it's hard to even recognise him initially, such is his performance. I didn't particularly care for any of the others, Queenie in Blackadder was perhaps a more accurate representation of Elizabeth, who had an iron will, you wouldn't know that from seeing this.It's visually decadent, it looks amazing, great costumes, terrific sets, I'm not quite so sure that all men would have dressed in black, I don't think that's accurate. Relationships are forced, not explained nor developed.There are snippets of accuracy, but they are fleeting, and lost in its desperation to be politically correct.Do yourself a favour watch Glenda Jackson and Vanessa Redgrave, you'll see a superior adaptation, one amusingly that's almost fifty years older than this one.You can put a mannequin in a designer dress, it's a lovely visual, but underneath it's still a mannequin, blank, without a heart or soul, that's how I feel about this film, it's a mannequin.3/10.",Mary Queen of Scots
8,jboothmillard,Mary Queen of Scots,6,12 February 2019,"I had watched the original 1971 film of the same, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson, whilst I was in college, I only just remembered doing so when trailers kept popping up for this new version of the story, and it looked like it had potential during Awards Season. Basically in 1561, following the death of her husband, Francis II of France, nineteen-year-old Mary, Catholic Queen of Scotland (Saoirse Ronan), is returning to her home country from France, her throne has been guarded by her half-brother, James, Earl of Moray (James McArdle). Mary's cousin, twenty-eight-year-old Queen Elizabeth of England (BAFTA nominated Margot Robbie) is unmarried, childless, and threatened by Mary's potential claim to her throne. Mary clashes with the cleric John Knox (David Tennant) and dismisses him from her court, he is a protestant and leader of the Scottish Reformation and perceives Mary to be a danger to the kingdom. In an attempt to weaken Mary's threat to her sovereignty, Elizabeth arranges for her to meet and be married to an Englishman, she chooses Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn), whom she secretly loves, to propose to Mary. When Elizabeth becomes ill with smallpox, Mary is convinced to accept the offer, provided that she is named Elizabeth's heir apparent, but Elizabeth is reluctant to let go of Dudley. So, she also secretly sends Henry Darnley (Jack Lowden) under a pretence, Mary suspects an ulterior motive to his arrival, but she grows very fond of him. Eventually Mary falls for Darnley's charms and accepts his marriage proposal, causing a constitutional crisis within both realms, with the impending wedding. In England, Elizabeth is advised by her court to oppose the marriage for fear that Mary's marriage to a nobleman will elevate her claim to the Crown. In Scotland, Mary's council is suspicious of Darnley as they fear an English takeover. Both kingdoms demand Darnley's return to England, but Mary refuses, Moray is enraged and furiously leaves her court to mount a rebellion against her. Darnley marries Mary, only for her to discover him in bed with her friend David Rizzio (Ismael Cruz Cordova) the following day, she forgives Rizzio and initially spares her husband. But Mary is faced with insurgency and infidelity, she decides to quash the rebel forces, and demands Darnley give her a child, a child is conceived, and Mary declares in court it will be the ""heir to Scotland and England"", deeply offending the English. Moray plots with Darnley's father Matthew (Brendan Coyle), to undermine Mary, spreading rumours about Mary's adultery and that her child was actually fathered by Rizzio, the rumours spread, and Knox vehemently preaches that Mary is an adulteress. Fearing the accusations against Mary and the possible discovery of his homosexuality, Darnley is coerced into executing Rizzio by the under-miners, he is forced to deliver the final blow. Mary discovers the plot, she agrees to pardon the men, provided that evidence is presented that Darnley was involved, she ultimately forgives Moray and asks Elizabeth to be her child's godmother. Mary banishes Darnley but refuses to divorce him despite the appeals of her council, her adviser and protector, the Earl of Bothwell (Martin Compston), arranged to have him killed. Following Darnley's death, Mary is forced to flee and leave her child behind, and she hesitantly agrees with Bothwell to marry a Scotsman immediately. This induces Knox to zealously preach to the Scots that Mary is a ""harlot"" who had her husband killed, leading Moray and the rest of her court to demand her abdication. Despite furiously objecting to it, she abdicates her throne and flees to England. Learning of Mary's arrival in England, Elizabeth arranges for a secret meeting with her. Mary asks for Elizabeth's help to take back her throne, Elizabeth is reluctant to go to war, instead promising her a safe exile as long as Mary does not aid her enemies. Mary says to Elizabeth that if she should have her murdered, she should remember that she ""murdered her own sister and queen"". Elizabeth orders that Mary is imprisoned in England and eventually receives compelling evidence that Mary had conspired with her enemies to have her assassinated in the Babington Plot. Pressured, and with no other choice, Elizabeth ultimately orders Mary's execution, a remorseful Elizabeth cries for Mary as she is brought out to be beheaded. In her final thoughts, Mary wishes her son James well and hopes for peace upon his reign. The end text reveals that after Elizabeth's death in 1603, James became the first monarch to rule both Scotland and England. Also starring Guy Pearce as William Cecil, Gemma Chan as Bess of Hardwick, Adrian Lester as Lord Randolph and Ian Hart as Lord Maitland. I will admit I did not understand all the political chat, the opposition between the queens and the conflict between their nations was simple enough to follow, but to be honest, it is much more about the performances. Ronan and Robbie are both terrific as the monarchs at loggerheads, it is fact that Mary Stuart and Queen Elizabeth did not meet in real life, but the scene created for them to do so is memorable, and the performances of supporting cast members Tennant, Pearce and others are also well done, what I did understand worked well, it is written well, and the period detail is splendid, all together it is a worthwhile historical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up/Hair and Best Costume Design. Good!",Mary Queen of Scots

From a technical standpoint it's top draw, design, costuming and lead acting performances are quality - though Mary herself ends up being more cartoonish than anything resembling a tragic historical figure. Sadly, though, the narrative goes round and round in circles and ends up in a politically correct fog.The pace is laborious, which makes the two hour run time something of a chore to get through. There's little dangles of spice, with attempts at gay acceptance and oral pleasure etc etc, and things hit an upward curve in the latter stages, there's even some smarts in the narrative where obsession with rites and rules of succession threaten to turn the pic into exciting politico/religio waters. Alas, it's a false dawn, to the point where the costume design becoming the best thing in a production speaks volumes about a badly - on the page - historical drama. 3/10",Mary Queen of Scots
11,CinemaSerf,This House of Cards just blew down...,5,30 November 2019,"Unfortunately there are just too many flaws in this depiction of the life of Mary Stuart to itemise. The writing rather clumsily imposes a 21st century slant on 16th century Scottish history and seems more bent on imposing the morals and opinions of the former on the times and scenarios of the latter. Neither principal performance is particularly engaging; and Jack Lowden and Joe Alwyn are frankly hopeless as the sexually ambiguous ""Darnley"" and ""Leicester"" respectively. The Oscar nominations for Make-up and Costume are certainly well deserved, but really do epitomise the style-over-substance emphasis of this weak adaptation of one of history's greatest rivalries.",Mary Queen of Scots
12,AlsExGal,"Interesting yarn, it's a shame it's largely untrue.",5,8 September 2019,"Somebody else already called this film the ""woke"" version, and I would have to agree. A black counselor for Mary? An Asian noble woman in the English court? Wherever would they come from? It's not like you could jump on a plane and be anywhere in no time in 1565 And if you could, that you would be accepted when you got there.. Rizzio, Mary's secretary, and Darnley, Mary's second husband, gay? I have actually heard rumors and seen productions about Darnley maybe being bisexual as far back as the 1970s, but at the time, to be homosexual was a crime punishable by death. I doubt that Mary the Catholic queen was so ""with it"" that she would consider Rizzio, here portrayed as openly gay, just one of her gang of ladies in waiting.I'm just surprised there wasn't a Hispanic in the cast. I'm sure that they wanted to include one, but the new world had hardly been explored at all by the 1560s so, nope, not even these producers would go that far. Oh, and Elizabeth and Mary never met, and Elizabeth was basically tricked into signing Mary's death warrant.Is it an interesting tale well told? I thought so. If this was an extension of Game of Thrones, or some other such fantasy drama that was only loosely tethered to the Middle Ages as it existed in Europe, it would have worked. But not as a historical drama. I will say the art design and cinematography were beautiful.",Mary Queen of Scots
13,ferguson-6,strong women from the wrong era,7,7 December 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. The history of monarchs goes back more than a thousand years. These days we view British royalty as little more than telegenic subjects for gossip sites, though for hundreds of years, the crown carried real power. Of course, the system never made any logical sense. Why should a baby born to the ""right"" family be pre-ordained to rule the country? These birthrights even caused much confusion and debate ... and wars ... when there was uncertainty about which kid was the most important. And yes, kids is the proper term. Mary Stuart (Mary Queen of Scots), was six days old when her father King James V died, and she ascended to the throne (though the actual ruling was done by regents until she was older).Saoirse Ronan stars as Mary and Margot Robbie is Queen Elizabeth I (daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn). The two were cousins (not sisters), and the film examines many aspects of this era: the struggle for the throne between the two, the unusual circumstances that found two women in power, the behind-the-scenes maneuvering by men in an effort to wrestle power from the women, the importance of marriage and heirs, the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, and the bizarre arrangement that caused Mary to spend nearly half her life in custody.Director Josie Rourke is best known for her stage productions, some of which have been broadcast live in cinemas. This is her debut feature film, and her talent is quite obvious. She gets ""big"" with stunning sweeping vistas, and intimate with dark chamber meetings. The castles look and feel like castles, and not the sound stage sets we often see in costume productions. The film is a thing of beauty and the two lead actresses are sublime ... and with much more screen time, Ms. Ronan delivers a ferocious performance.The screenplay from Beau Willimon (creator, producer and head writer of ""House of Cards"") is based on the John Guy book ""Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart"". This matters because Mr. Guy theorizes that the two sovereigns actually met in real life, something very much doubted by historians. Either way, it makes for an interesting (if not a bit hokey) segment in the film, as Elizabeth and Mary wander through billowing curtains in a clandestine spot.Beginning at the end, we get an early look at Mary's ""martyrdom"" march to her execution on 1587 at age 44. If you've ever read about the actual execution, you'll be relieved to know it's not shown on screen. Supporting work comes courtesy of Jack Lowden, Guy Pearce, Joe Alwyn, Gemma Chan, and an explosive David Tennant as a fire-breathing priest. This version plays up the inner-turmoil and challenges in power faced by the women - more so than the 1974 version starring Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson (the film received 5 Oscar nominations). Ms. Ronan and Ms. Robbie really help us understand the challenges these women faced - challenges that men on the throne wouldn't have faced.",Mary Queen of Scots
14,phd_travel,Saoirse looks the part but the story is a bit hard to follow,6,18 February 2019,Saoirse Ronan looks and acts well as the tragic queen. Lovely and looks like she stepped out of a period painting. She is beautiful and feisty. Margot is suitably uglied up with prosthetic nose and pancake makeup and fright wig. Margot is portrayed as a rather laid back manipulated Queen.Some of the dialog is fanciful. Like the meeting between the two. It helps to brush up on the events and characters or it can be a bit hard to follow with all the bearded guys who look the same and some events glossed over quickly. The conspiracy elements are confusing. The intimate scenes are a bit horrific. Some of the events are given an interpretation that the viewer should know are specific to this movie only.Worth a watch but not a great movie.,Mary Queen of Scots
15,deloudelouvain,Historical biographies need to be accurate and this one isn't.,5,25 July 2019,I only watched this movie because my wife likes historical costume drama's. The history of Mary Stuart was the subject I thought that would be interesting but the more I watched it the more I had the feeling this wasn't an accurate telling of facts. For example I really doubt there would be a Black lord or an Asian countess at that time in England. Add on that the rather boring repetitive story telling and you get just a mediocre movie. The main actresses Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie didn't do a bad job but the inaccuracy of the story just made Mary Queen Of Scots a movie I will forget everything about it in a week.,Mary Queen of Scots
16,JamesHitchcock,Monstrous Regiment of Women,7,8 February 2019,"Imagine that the current Queen of England is a young woman of 25. Imagine that her teenage cousin is not only Queen of a still-independent Scotland but also Queen Consort of a still-Royalist France, The two royal ladies bear a certain resemblance to one another, being tall, fair-skinned, blue-eyed, red-haired and beautiful. In this scenario the two women would doubtless also be the best of friends, their only rivalry revolving around who could notch up the greatest number of appearances on the front pages of the world's newspapers. Elizabeth would regularly be voted ""World's most eligible single lady"" in magazine polls and Mary and her husband King Francois ""World's most glamorous couple"".Four and a half centuries ago, however, rather more was expected of a reigning monarch than turning up to the State Opening of Parliament and appearing on the cover of ""Hello!"" was a demanding one than it is today. Being a Queen Regnant was a particularly difficult task, as this was a period when many believed that women, even those of royal blood, should not exercise any form of political power. (Mary's arch-enemy John Knox published a pamphlet with the splendidly bilious title ""First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women""). If the Queen remained single as Elizabeth did, she would be accused of failing to provide the realm with an heir. If she married one of her subjects, as Mary did, she would instantly make him hated by a jealous nobility. If she married a foreign prince, as Elizabeth's sister Mary Tudor did, she would raise fears of her country falling under foreign domination. This was the era of the Reformation, so neither the Catholic Mary nor the Protestant Elizabeth could automatically count on the loyalty of those of their subjects who were of the other faith. An extra complicating factor was that Mary was Elizabeth's closest surviving relative and therefore a possible heir to the English throne, although Elizabeth never acknowledged her as such.Mary has long been a controversial historical figure. Indeed, she was a controversial figure even in her lifetime, being forced to flee Scotland with accusations of being a ""harlot"" and ""murderer"" ringing in her ears. These accusations referred to the belief that she was guilty of adultery with her Italian secretary David Rizzio and of conniving at the murder of her estranged husband Lord Darnley, but the film, which wants to establish Mary as an innocent victim, takes the line (which is generally the one taken by modern historians) that there is no evidence to substantiate either charge. The script, on the other hand, tends to downplay Mary's well-established involvement with the Babington Plot, the crime which was to lead to her execution.The film has been criticised for political correctness; I never knew that there were so many black people in 16th century Scotland or that Elizabeth's confidante Bess of Hardwick was Chinese. Or, for that matter, that Darnley and Rizzio were gay lovers. (I have, in fact, seen a suggestion made to that effect, but in a lurid historical novel, not a work of serious scholarship). It has also been criticised for alleged historical inaccuracy, although where it departs from historical fact it generally does so for good dramatic reasons. I know that in reality Mary and Elizabeth never met, but what scriptwriter could resist the dramatic possibilities of a confrontation between them?The film, however, has also received critical praise, generally for the characterisation of the two Queens and for the performances of the two actresses who play them, and in this respect I would go along with the critics. Saoirse Ronan's Mary is an intense, hot-blooded, passionate young woman. Her intentions are good, but her impulsive nature and her inexperience- she was only 18 when she returned to Scotland from France- prove her downfall. The sex scene between her and Jack Lowden's Darnley has received some criticism, but for me it indicated the way in which Mary allowed herself to be ruled by her passions, a key part of her character, and explained why she should have taken an otherwise useless young man as her husband. Margot Robbie's Elizabeth, by contrast, is much more restrained and self-controlled. Where Mary allows herself to be ruled by her heart, Elizabeth is always ruled by her head, giving up Robert Dudley, the one man she really loves, when she realises that the English nobility would never accept him as King Consort, and retreating behind her icy façade of the Virgin Queen. (By coincidence, I saw ""Mary Queen of Scots"" in the same week that I caught the Charlton Heston version of Shakespeare's ""Antony and Cleopatra""; the contrast between Mary and Elizabeth which we see here is very similar to the one Shakespeare draws between the earthy, sensual Anthony and his precise, cold-blooded rival Octavius).This is not the first filmed biography of Mary, but I will not be making any comparisons as I have never seen the Katharine Hepburn version and it is many years since I last saw the Vanessa Redgrave/Glenda Jackson one. It is one of two biopics of female British monarchs to have appeared recently, the other being ""The Favourite"" about Mary's great-great-granddaughter Queen Anne. Although it bears Mary's name, it can be seen as a double biography, focusing upon both Elizabeth and Mary and on the different ways they played the hands which fate had dealt them. Its verdict seems to be that, whereas Elizabeth played a difficult hand with great skill, Mary had been dealt a hand so impossible that she was doomed no matter how she played it. 7/10A goof. Ronan plays Mary with a strong Scottish accent; in fact, she spoke English with a French accent.",Mary Queen of Scots
17,blanbrn,"A film of power, and a family rival of wanting to be queen.",7,25 December 2018,"""Mary Queen of Scots"" is one film as you watch you feel the themes and drama of the need for power as rivals seek the throne all which involve religion, marriage, and betrayal and rebellion. Mary(Saoirse Ronan) returns to her homeland of Scotland after being away in France only to find it under the rule of her cousin the older and aging Elizabeth I(Margot Robbie). Clearly a power struggle develops as Mary wants to ascend to the throne, as after marriage and being widowed young her desire and need to secure the throne and become queen is more and more. Only greed and loyalty play a part in Elizabeth wanting to keep the throne as she is to punish young Mary for her bad moral judgements. Overall good period piece if you like these type of movies from the era of century old England as it shows how power, greed, and hierarchy all ruled the day and the sets and costumes looked nice and the performances from the two female leads Margot and Saoirse were in top form making it a watch.",Mary Queen of Scots
18,paul2001sw-1,Entitled but not stupid,8,21 January 2019,"Mary, Queen of Scots, plays a cameo role in most versions of English history, a naïve figure not completely unlike Emma Bovary, who fell in love with the wrong people while foolishly thinking she could outplay England's masterful Queen Elizabeth in the great ""game of thrones"". I don't know how the Scots tell the tale - maybe, as they threw her out, they judge her with no more sympathy. The nice thing about Josie Rourke's film is that it offers us an alternative and imaginative telling, one in which Mary is a strong character in a weak position, but certainly not stupid, while Elizabeth is weakened inside by the personal sacrifices she has to make to hold onto power. Mary does display an outrageous sense of regal entitlement - one, however, that would probably have passed unquestioned had she been born a man. It's not strictly concordant with every known fact, and those familiar with Scottish geography will note, that as in many other Scottish films, the road to everywhere appears to pass through Glencoe, but the story does keep to the broad outline of the historical record. In places, it's a little repetitive, and its portrayal of Knox is dull and obvious, but I enjoyed it for its original and thought-provoking interpretation.",Mary Queen of Scots
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Has the cinematography, direction and performances of an accomplished historical drama, but doesn't seem to have the heart.",4,21 January 2019,"Frankly, 'Mary Queen Of Scots (2018)' is just boring. I mean, it's got the cinematography, direction and performances of an accomplished historical drama, but it doesn't seem to have the heart. Unfortunately, the genre often suffers from this issue, getting too caught up with 'history lesson' facts and forgetting to evoke the emotion associated with fiction (which most of them, ostensibly, are and should function primarily as). Here, the beat-by-beat plot simply comes across as 'and then this happened', even though there are some relatively resonant themes regarding the period's sexism and general lack of tolerance. It's not like the picture is totally accurate, either - indeed, its most marketed set-piece (a meeting of monarchs) never actually occurred (and, if it somehow did, the writer certainly couldn't know about it). You can boil the narrative down to a series of stabs in the back, as opposed to a conflict of two Queens as advertised, but most of these don't really resonate on an emotional level. There is one instance that involves a character death which is gruelling, frustrating and generally affecting, though. You also get a general sense of annoyance when the movie's many malicious men conspire against their Queen simply because she's a woman. Still, in general, the feature isn't all that compelling. You just sort of watch it, kind of detached from what's happening. It's not bad, just a bit dull. It believably recreates its sixteenth century setting and feels constantly competent, if somewhat uninspired. The performances are all good and the screenplay is solid, too. It's just not that gripping, however. That's really its main issue. Despite all its political intrigue, bloody backstabbing and timely thematic resonance, I just didn't care. I didn't come for a history lesson, I came for a narrative experience. In the end, I didn't really get either. 4/10",Mary Queen of Scots
20,ThomasDrufke,"A Beauty to Watch, Sometimes Tough to Get Through",7,31 December 2018,"Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie are two of my favorite actresses working today and I will see just about anything either of them put out, no matter the subject matter. The relationship (and sometimes lack thereof) between Elizabeth I of England and Mary, Queen of Scots is fascinating, and a story meant to be seen theatrically or through a mini-series with a bigger budget. This iteration of their story, mostly told through the lens of Mary, is a gorgeous period piece with fantastic performances from its leads. It takes about 35-40 minutes to really get interesting, but when it gets going, it's a beauty to watch. Of course, being that these stories deal with double crosses, many noble names to keep track of, time jumps, and locations sometimes not fully explained, the film doesn't always feel as smooth as it would like us to believe.

22,eddie_baggins,A royal letdown,4,10 July 2019,"This based on a true story tale has a great cast, fine production values and lavish sets and costumes but what Josie Rourke's film importantly lacks is a heart and soul, making Mary Queen of Scots a dull, lifeless and sadly rather boring historical epic.At one stage touted as a potential key awards contender, that featured the appealing double act of leading Hollywood actresses Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie going head to head as warring royal cousins Mary Stuart and Queen Elizabeth 1 in Scotland and England in the late 1500's, Rourke's film is but a collection of scenes scattered together with very little emotional tie in or flow as Ronan and Robbie face an uphill battle to instill the film with any energy or charisma as its loaded plot-line moves from point to point.There's a lot for the film to cover off, the tale of Stuart and Queen Elizabeth is one filled with political intrigue, backstabbing's, murmurings and power plays but Beau Willimon's screenplay commits the mortal sin of assuming viewers have deep knowledge of all the characters and occurrences that were prevalent in this time frame with Scots suffering badly from a feeling that many characters and key moments are being ticked off rather than explored in any meaningful or insightful way.What we do know is that this was an important time in the monarchs history, a time where Mary was unafraid to mess with conventions in a time and place where woman were still seen as not much more than a baby-maker, if not that then some type of scheming harlot and in this sense Ronan delivers another noteworthy turn in a career that has been nothing short of impressive ever since she first appeared on our screens in the epic Atonement from 2007.Ronan often showcases in her performance what the film lacks, heart, soul and energy and she walks away with many of the films best moments, with Robbie not given great material to work with, even though her turn as the outwardly and inwardly vile Queen is another example of the Hollywood beauty showing to all that she is after more than an everyday career, pushing herself as a performer and unafraid to get physically committed to a role.It's a mighty shame that Rourke couldn't of utilized these two actresses to a greater level to bring this real life Game of Thrones (minus magic, dragons and hearty cussing) to life as you do feel as though both performers deserved a film that was more befitting of their turns, as as it stands as an end product, Scots is nothing more than a film for fans of lavish production designs and English history rather than a film to be enjoyed by movie-goers seeking out an emotionally charged political period drama.Final Say -A film that could've been special, especially with such committed lead turns, Mary Queen of Scots is but a dry, dull and forgettable examination of two fascinating woman that fails to ever capture the mind, heart or imagination needed to bring this loaded tale to life.2 foals out of 5",Mary Queen of Scots
23,TheMovieDiorama,Mary Queen of Scots delivers uneven historical thrills but with regal performances.,6,24 January 2019,"Artistic licence, the distortion of facts and alteration of events, should only be used to change small details for dramatic purposes. When the whole film builds up to an event that never actually took place, well you immediately start to doubt the legitimacy of what preceded it. Such is the case with this period drama. History becomes far too twisted and what was a biographical depiction of an empowering woman has now become a fictional tale of courtly politics. Despite its inaccuracies and disjointed narrative structure, there are many elements that do work and give life to the Scottish highlands that surrounds Mary. Chronicling the ""Rising of the North"", this drama depicts the life of Mary Stuart as she struggles to maintain control of Scotland whilst also deposing Queen Elizabeth so that she can be succeeded by Mary.A rivalry between cousins, a battle between Christian denominations and the most epic slow-motion birthing scene to ever grace the big screen. It contains all the ingredients of a traditional regal drama. Two incredibly powerful central performances. Ronan goes full 'Braveheart' and twists her Irish native tongue to a consistently good Scottish accent. However it is her commanding presence that truly captivates. She never needed to shout or rage to warrant power, her sharp quiet voice was enough to pierce her enemies. She gave life to Mary and at times made her an empowering figure within a court dominated by men. Robbie, who played Elizabeth, definitely went through more of a physical transformation. Occasionally she did overact, yet she managed to replicate the envious mannerisms that Elizabeth had for Mary. Pearce and Tennant, regardless of their small roles, gave very good performances. Unfortunately, their talents were underused. I have no faults with the central character development. It does take time to connect with them, mostly due to the clinical approach that director Rourke took, but considering it's her directorial debut she does eventually get there. Mathieson's cinematography was beautiful and fully embraced the 16th century Scottish environment, Rourke produces some gorgeous landscape shots. Richter's score was nuanced for the most part, but a few tracks certainly accentuated the courtly politics that accompanied it. Byrne's costume design was sumptuous and Shircore's extensive range of hair designs were also noteworthy. Everything looked to be set in place for a masterful historical drama. Protestants versus Catholicism, political conspiracies and acts of sodomy. A variety of intriguing, if inaccurate, sub-plots that unfortunately just made the whole ordeal rather underwhelming.This is a combination of a poor screenplay and unfocused editing. There are a plethora of noblemen, councilmen and confidants that are all one-dimensional. Aside from Rizzio (although unsure about that hyperbolic dressing up scene...), all other characters were underdeveloped and were seemingly difficult to distinguish their motives. Who is who? They all look the same, act the same and feel the same. It's not until the second half when the conspiracies are put into action that these supporting characters receive a small splash of flavour. Yet it's too late. Another complaint is with Elizabeth and honestly, she did not need to be present at all. She simply existed for a climactic scene that never historically took place. The story had no purpose for her and, after all, it is entitled Mary Queen of Scots. The constant abrupt edits to shift the narrative onto her perspective made the story disjointed and created inconsistent pacing. Remove Robbie and just let Mary read letters from Elizabeth instead. Get rid of the fictional meeting. Dispose of the undercooked romance with Dudley. Let her be this ominous figure and use the runtime more wisely to strictly be about Mary and develop that side of the story even further. Sometimes less is more, and in this case I do believe it would've benefited from anonymity. I also found the portrayal of Darnley's promiscuity to be excessive and unexpectedly lacklustre. Again, he had little development so any shocking reveals were diminished almost immediately.It's a shame, because with the right script this could've been something special. However Willimon distorted the facts with no restraints, and unfortunately made me question the entire storyline. Solid drama with excellent performances and garments, but felt damper than a rainy day in Carlisle.",Mary Queen of Scots

25,southdavid,Quite Contrary.,5,22 January 2019,"Strong performances work hard to cover budgetary restrictions in an engaging but dry historical drama.Arriving back in her native Scotland, Mary (Saoirse Ronan) sets her sights on claiming the English throne held by her cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). Though their initial communications are, on the surface, friendly enough - Mary's Catholicism and tolerant outlook cause tensions to flare in a fiercely Protestant Scotland. Whereas Elizabeth sacrifices everything for the good of the crown, Mary's youthful and loving nature leads to manipulation, betrayal and a date on the gallows.Accents aside, performances in ""Mary: Queen Of Scots"" are excellent, particularly from the two leads. Unfortunately, that's about it for the positives.It's very theatrical, by which I mean, it feels a lot like a filmed play, rather than an actual film. Conceits that might have worked on the stage, such as the meeting between the two queens, are less successful here. The distance between them is demonstrated by separating them with hanging sheets which, whilst visually interesting - is rendered ridiculous because we've seen the venue from outside and know its dimensions don't equate with the interior. The lack of vision, or perhaps budget is more accurate also played into my criticism at certain points, particularly as Mary's court ride up and down the same hill, near the coast, as it was a nice view, rather than moving the production to a different location. This is also evident during the films single, frankly dismal battle scene, which was well below par for television these days let alone the big screen.Ultimately though, I felt like the film was hard work and a bit of a slog to get through due to its repetitive ""tell rather than show"" plot.",Mary Queen of Scots
26,paul-allaer,"""Mary Queen of Scots"" vs. ""The Favourite"": and the winner is...",6,26 December 2018,"""Mary Queen of Scots"" (2018 release from the UK; 125 min.) brings the story of Mary Stuart's reign over Scotland. As the movie opes, it is ""England, 1587"" and it appears Mary is getting ready for execution. We then go back in time to ""Scotland, 1561"", as Mary makes her way to Edinburgh's Holyrood Palace, where at age 19 she starts her rule as Queen of Scotland. But she also lays claim to the throne of England if her cousin Queen Elizabeth doesn't produce an heir... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the first feature film for longtime British theater director Josie Rourke. The film is a well-intended historical drama that nevertheless falls short of expectations for a couple of reasons: first and foremost, what should be palace drama that raises the hairs on your arms, plays out meekly for much of the movie. Second, the movie's pacing is too slow, dare I say too theatrical, and hence the movie feels overly long at 2 hrs. and 5 min. Lastly, while the film is titles ""Mary Queen of Scots"", the movie tries to set it up as ""Marty vs. Elizabeth"", yet then forgets to provide an in-depth charter for Elizabeth. This is not to say that there aren't good elements to the movie. Saoirse Ronan's striking figure is perfect for Mary. Margot Robbie does the best she can with the smaller role of Elizabeth. The costumes are fabulous, as as the outdoor shots in Scotland. I can't help but also feel a bit disappointed when I compare this to that other recent historical drama (set 150 years later), ""The Favourite"", which frankly is the better movie of the two. As a complete aside, there also has been quite a bit of noise on social media about a number of historical inaccuracies in ""Mary Queen of Scots"", but I'm not a historian or expert myself and hence am not going to comment on that.""Mary Queen of Scots"" opened last weekend, and we decided to make it our annual Christmas Day movie. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out down to the very last set, which didn't really surprise me, given that Christmas Day is the busiest movie theater day of the year.

27,Turfseer,Modern day take on a 16th century regal rivalry proves to be an acceptable enough history lesson despite convoluted plot and anachronistic conceits,6,4 January 2019,"Director Josie Rourke's take on the historical story of Mary Queens of Scots is decidedly a modern-day one. Rourke begins with Mary's execution in London in 1587 and then immediately flashes back to her arrival in Scotland from France in 1561, the recently widowed bride of French King Henry II, who was only 16 years old when he passed away.
Rourke reminds us that Scotland was actually allied with France at that time and Mary, along with many fellow Scotsmen, were Catholics. The English with Queen Elizabeth I at the helm, were of course Protestant Anglicans and feared an invasion by Scotland, backed by France.
The first third of the movie is a bit slow-moving as the diplomatic moves between England and Scotland are highlighted (Elizabeth orders her lover Robert Dudley to meet Mary and propose marriage). Instead, Mary marries her cousin Lord Darnley, an English Catholic, which causes a revolt among Scottish Protestants led by the firebrand John Knox and Mary's half-brother, James, the Earl of Moray.
Rourke doesn't have Elizabeth and Mary meet until the end (in a fictional meetup) but suggests they are bonded by being mutual victims of male perfidy. Mary, in particular, must fend off numerous challenges to her authority and also endure shabby treatment at the hands of her husband who is not exactly what you would call sensitive to the opposite sex (the rough sex scene in which Darnley impregnates a very disappointed Mary clearly illustrates the lack of respect and ill treatment women of the time experienced at the hands of men).
The story picks up in the second Act despite being not completely believable. The murder of the Queen's private secretary, David Rizzio, at a dinner party, with Mary as a witness, actually happened. However, the film's scenarists insinuate that he was murdered because he was gay and that her husband had been having an affair with him.
Mary here is depicted as not only a modern-day feminist but sympathetic to gay rights (before this death, she makes it clear to Rizzio that she won't reject him due to his sexuality). Nonetheless Rourke rather conveniently plays down Mary's ruthlessness, ignoring another true story from 1563, when Mary ordered her brother to kill a French poet at the Court who had become obsessed with her and sneaked into her chambers right before she was about to disrobe.
Things become more gripping when Lord Darnley is murdered. By now, it was a little difficult in following all the machinations but history tells us that Darnley's suspected murderer, Lord Bothwell, ended up marrying Mary, which led to her abdication and downfall. Bothwell only divorced shortly before marrying Mary who was deemed an adulteress and imprisoned. After escaping, Mary sought protection in England where she lived for another 15 years or so but was basically under ""house arrest.""
Rourke serves up a fanciful scene where Elizabeth and Mary meet. The critics appear to be divided as to the scene's effectiveness. To me it was believable as it showed Mary's stubbornness in her insistence that her claim to the throne be legitimized. This of course was not the only factor in her ultimate demise. Undoubtedly she could never escape the suspicions that she was allied with the French and conspired with them along with other Catholic allies.
Rourke does a fine job in casting her principals. Saoirse Ronan is believable as the spunky Mary Stuart whose good looks might have led to jealousy on the part of Queen Elizabeth. Margot Robbie, so miscast as Tonya Harding in ""I, Tonya,"" acquits herself very well here as the queen who never married. And kudos to the makeup department in transforming Robbie into a woman ravaged by smallpox and forced now to appear in public with a powdered face.
Rourke's saga is a decent enough history lesson with good performances all around. Nonetheless, the plot is often convoluted and not all of the modern-day allusions work. Particularly problematic is the denouement, where the events leading to Mary's beheading are glanced over with title cards. Mary, Queen of Scots might be worth a look a second time just to follow everything that's going on. On second thought, shouldn't that have been accomplished during one's first screening?",Mary Queen of Scots

Likewise, the art direction-costumes are all top notch and in any case make for a splendid atmosphere. The direction brigs a lot of the script by being moody and really inventive in a few places.

The film deals bluntly with matters of sexuality and it was wonderful to see a period film not straightwash the material. The script's treatment of Elizabeth and Mary has friends turned rivals works dramatically but it is absurd historically. There script also has some hilariously awful lines.I am glad I saw this.",Mary Queen of Scots
34,henry8-3,"Mary, Queen of Scots",6,25 December 2019,"Mary returns to Scotland and claims to be the true Queen of Scotland must to the chagrin of England's Queen Elizabeth and her court. The film follows Mary through to her death focussing as much on her relationship with her court and her husband Darnley as well as Elizabeth.Fine performances from Ronan and Robbie, with the former the live wire with ambition, questionable political wisdom and relatively little power whilst Robbie is the sad, lonely but wise, real Queen who keeps putting off the inevitable. Ronan is the star as the sometimes childish pretender with Robbie's in some respect the trickier role as the fuller more introspective character.Good supporting cast particularly Lowden as Darnley, but I'm not sure Pearce hits the right note as Burleigh, Elizabeth's chief adviser and confidante.",Mary Queen of Scots
35,MissSimonetta,About as accurate as an episode of Reign,4,21 December 2018,"Definitely don't come to this movie for history: it takes two of the sixteenth century's most interesting political figures and renders their tense relationship into soap opera terms. Even the costumes are all wrong-- outside of periods of mourning, no one would be wearing that much black in a royal court.I could almost forgive it if the movie worked as art, but every character with the exception of Mary is so two-dimensional that it's hard to get involved with them.I could forgive the movie if it was entertaining, but it is quite a slog, feeling far longer than its two-hour runtime. Excessive sex scenes and pretty shots of the Scottish countryside do not entertainment make. The music is pretty standard ""epic"" fare. The cinematography is good but nothing exceptionally original or interesting.By the end, I was rather bored and ready to be out of the theater.",Mary Queen of Scots
36,Pairic,Convincing Narrative,9,26 January 2019,"Mary Queen Of Scots: Two Queens, many men wishing to marry them, to usurp their thrones and rule in their stead. Elizabeth (Margot Robbie) squares the circle by remaining unmarried, even referring to her sidekick, Lord Cecil (Guy Pearce), as her wife. Mary (Saoirse Ronan) has a harder task holding on to her throne, her half-brother (James McArdle) had ruled as Regent until she returned to Scotland (from France) and many want a King to rule. John Knox (David Tennant) the leader of the Church of Scotland portrays her as a a scarlet lady who wants to impose Rome Rule on Scotland. A truly storming performance by Tennant and his time on screen is too short.Mary's suitors are legion, even including Dudley (Joe Alwyn) Elizabeth's counsellor and ""secret"" lover. She goes for Darnley (Jack Lowden) but that settles little. Scotland is torn by Civil War and Mary's champion Bothwell (Martin Compston) has his own agenda. Mary's Court was indeed a gay place with her confidant, court jester and friend, the gender-bending Rizzio (Ismael Cruz Cordova), at the centre of many a caper. Mary herself enjoyed pranks, dressing identically as her Ladies In Waiting so Darnley has to guess which is her at their first meeting.A film which opens and closes with Marys execution but concentrates mainly on the five years after she arrived in Scotland. Elizabeth consolidates her power, Mary fails to do so and must seek protection (which turns out to be imprisonment) from Elizabeth. The Scottish countryside is also a star of this film as is Holyrood Castle with rooms literally carved out the living rock. A convincing ensemble cast with outstanding performances by Ronan, Robbie and Tennant. Director Josie Rourke( working from a screenplay by Beau Williamson) is at the helm of a vast crew of costumers, set designers and artisans (as there are few special effects in this film) delivers a new and involving narrative of Mary's struggles. 8.5/10",Mary Queen of Scots
37,ulicknormanowen,Mary met Elizabeth.,6,9 July 2021,"Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson were great in Charles °Jarrot's ""Mary queen of Scots"" (1971) ; to match them was a hard task;both Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie rise to the occasion ,the cinematography is impeccable, settings and costumes lavish.Based on a book called ""the true life of Mary Stuart "" the screenplay is full of historical mistakes though :
First of all ,Mary and Elizabeth never met (Charles Jarrot included a meeting too) ;Bothwell intervenes as soon as Mary comes back from France,as an attentive escort ,which is false ;besides he was a crude brute and historians do not know exactly what happened between them (the queen was pregnant by him,but she had a miscarriage in the castle of Loch Leven where she abdicated ) ; the portrait of Jacques de Moray is false : he was calculating, and wanted Mary's power , not the sweet (half) brother of the movie .On the other hand , all that concerns Dudley ,a puppet in the hands of Elizabeth is truer;he became arrogant when Mary gave birth to Jacques ;ditto for Knox who played a prominent part in discrediting that heathen queen in the eyes of the people.(an impressive David Tennant);Guy Pierce is convincing as Cecil.Watch it but read a biography of Mary too.",Mary Queen of Scots
38,dierregi,Re-writing history,1,4 July 2021,"As already mentioned by many reviewers this ""version"" of Mary Stuart's story is so inaccurate as to be a sci-fi story taking place in a parallel, politically correct universe.Contrary to the movie tagline, the plot bows to everybody: let's have a black foreign minister (sure, that so happened at the time) plus several mixed-race noblewomen, a bunch of black highlanders and an Hispanic, gay minstrel (eyes roll).Not only that, but the Catholic Mary is unruffled by homosexuality, in fact she almost encourages it.... Because, as everybody knows, the Catholic church was totally OK with that... as long as the people followed their heart...The tragic part is that many - among the least educated - will actually believe that this is a ""true"" story, or if it isn't, it should have been. But it could not possibly have been because the social and historical circumstances dictated that people lived in a different way - not necessarily because they were evil, but because that was what they considered right...PS and Mary presented as a better woman than Elizabeth and a martyr, when she didn't achieve anything as a queen, apart from producing an heir and she was executed for her active participation in several plots to kill Elizabeth (this part conveniently skipped over)",Mary Queen of Scots

41,robertemerald,Beautifully photographed historical piece,7,1 September 2019,"I've read all the criticism of this film, which tends to ignore its strengths. It's beautifully filmed, good cameras, good framing and edits, wonderfully expansive wilderness locations, great sets and plenty of them. Really good cinematography in other words. As such it's a very easy movie to enjoy. The script is inspired and should please even history buffs. And the history is pretty accurate. I didn't see the piece as in any way about women in power, just two really capable leads giving strong performances. Sure, there are many darker faces in the crowd, even the English Ambassador, and even an Asian looking waiting lady. That could be a good thing if it generates better interest in history and helps Hollywood to make more of these important works. OK, I've read my history and I know that Africans were a curiosity in Elizabethan times, and I'm quite sure if one had become a member of government it would surely have been mentioned. But the liberty isn't so farfetched. They were not unknown at the time and, importantly, and there doesn't seem to have been any prejudice against them, rather the opposite. On the other hand I'll admit that it is odd that, in the interests of not generating controversy, the filmmakers opted this way. Come on guys! Its art. So be it. Mary Queen of Scots still remains a powerful story and this is a powerful film, with plenty of action (if not a lot of tension) and some rarely brilliant characterisations played really well by all concerned. It's a big production and obviously didn't stint on the expenses and is well worth a look.",Mary Queen of Scots

44,richard-1787,Remarkable in several ways,9,5 January 2019,"I found this movie to be remarkable in several ways, but frustrating in others.To begin with, the cinematography and lighting were never less than very good, and often remarkable. Not just the lovely Scottish landscapes, but the interior lighting of many of the scenes. I can't remember the last time I was so impressed with lighting and camera work.Second, the acting of the two female leads, Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie, both of whom definitely deserve Academy Award nominations. They are always good, but in the final confrontation it is truly a joy to watch them play off each other. These are two very fine actresses!BTW: No, Elisabeth and Mary never met in real life. Who cares? This isn't a BBC historical documentary meant for school children. Those can be well and good, but that's not at all what this movie is. It's a feature film that presents the director's interpretation of how two young women in this situation might have functioned in a world that was very difficult for women of any age. And that director, Josie Rourke - it's not surprising that it's a woman - does a remarkable job.The costumes and makeup were also good, though that it's particularly important to me.There were also downsides for me, however.First was the sound. It was sometimes very difficult to catch the dialogue. That compounded the second problem for me, which was thatThe movie, especially in the first half, doesn't make any effort to explain the political situation and relationship of the characters to those who didn't read up on it before coming to the theater. The politics are complicated, so between the lack of explanation and the sometimes unclear dialogue, I wasn't always sure why X was angry with Y, and how A was related to B. (When I watch it at home, I'll turn on the English subtitles, I guess.) I can only guess that the low overall rating for this movie here on IMDB is a result of American viewers not being able to follow all the elements of the plot.Still, this is a beautifully made movie with two outstanding performances. Read up on the story of Mary Queen of Scots before you watch it, and write down all the names so you know who is who, and you'll have a grand old time.",Mary Queen of Scots
45,elliotjeory,Excellent acting,6,29 December 2019,"I really couldn't fault the acting from the two main actresses, it was excellent. Unfortunately the story isn't that great and some of the supporting cast is terrible.

46,nancyldraper,Disappointing storytelling,4,28 December 2018,"An emotional portrayal rather than an historically faithful account of Mary's relationship with Elizabeth of England. This was based on a book MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS: THE TRUE LIFE OF MARY STUART which was touted as ""the first full-scale biography of Mary Stuart in more than 30 years...uncovering a trove of new sources for the first time"". While John Guy may have wished to establish Mary as the ""intellectual and political equal of Elizabeth I"" the screenwriter of the movie portrays Elizabeth as weak and distant from her own political processes and there is no credible explanation why Elizabeth made the decisions she did. If Mary was a true and worthy queen whereas Elizabeth was weak and an emotional mess, how did Mary end up on the executioner's block and Elizabeth manage to successfully hold her throne for 44 years? Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie give emotionally deep performances, as expected. But the screenplay writer muddles up any political, religious or ideological (or even personal) logic for the climate of the day which inevitably set the course for Mary's life path. There is no clarity in why one was either Protestant or Roman would be such an insurmountable issue, partly because John Knox was so poorly written (despite having hidden the very talented and capable David Tennant behind all the hair). Disappointing story telling. Waste of good actors. I rate this film a 4 (poor) out of 10. I know I may be expressing a minority opinion, because, by and large, the people I spoke to as we exited the theatre, seemed to like the movie, but more troubling, they accepted the historical portrayal while confessing to never having known anything before about Mary, Queen of Scotland. {Historical?

I don't believe Cosmopolitan was around during the Tudor age.We were treated to scenes of oral sex on the queen, the queen sexually assaulting her husband whilst drunk, two rape scenes, cross-dressing, two scenes of homosexual antics, several black members of court and an Asian lady in waiting (examples of gross racial appropriation).

49,schappe1,A powerful story about powerful women,8,28 December 2018,"I'm shocked at all the negative reviews I see here. they seem to focus on the ahistorical meeting of the two queens and the use of black and Asian actors in some of the roles. The first is about dramatic license, something frequently used in historical movies, including the 1971 version of this story. Any competent dramatist is going to want his two antagonists to confront each other and I think it's forgivable. As to the second, I recall Kenneth Branagh did the same thing when he cast Denzel Washington in ""Much Ado About Nothing"" a generation ago, saying that black actors should be able to play Shakespearean roles besides just Othello. Josie Rourke, the director of this film, must have had the same idea.Like several of the reviewers here, I decided to see this and ""The Favourite"", a different story but also a story of women running Great Britain, abit a century and a half later. That film is highly praised and also has good performances, but i enjoyed this one better. It was more serious, less saucy and had, (easily) a better and clearer ending, (you can't top a beheading for that).The production values, as many have mentioned are good but it's the two lead performances that count. Saoirse Ronan, when her hair is wept back, looks something like Meryl Streep and seems to be on that kind of career path. She is regal and fiery, yet fun-loving and fearful and dominates every scene she is in. The roles I've seen Margot Robbie in are either as a sex-pot or a cartoon character but she gives us a memorably neurotic but sympathetic Elizabeth. they are the reasons to see this movie and they are very good reasons, indeed.",Mary Queen of Scots

There is one great scene between Margot and Saoirse which shows what could have been. I have to say I never felt bored and I was entertained throughout. However there was to many times this film ventured into ludicrous absurdity that took away from any of the groundwork put in leading up to this. Such a shame as the film has 2 great leads and I honestly believe if it had been executed correctly could have been one of the films of the year.

52,drjgardner,Almost awful,2,21 December 2018,"Apart from some good acting by the Margot Robby as Queen Elizabeth, this film lacks almost everything else. Stodgy direction, ridiculous makeup and costumes, a script taken from who knows where, poor acting, and far too many long shots do not a good film make.Lovers of Queen Elizabeth are best referred to ""Elizabeth and Essex"" with Bette Davis or her portrayal 20 years later in ""The Virgin Queen"". Other portrayals of the great queen include Cate Blanchett in 1998 (""Elizabeth"") and again in 2007 (""Elizabeth"" The Golden Age""), Helen Mirren in 2005 (""Elizabeth I"" on HBO), Glenda Jackson in 1971 (""Elizabeth R""), Judith Anderson in 1968 (""Elizabeth I"" for Hallmark Hall of Fame), and Jean Simmons in 1953 (""Young Bess"").

53,educallejero,"Entertaining yes, but questionable...",6,12 December 2019,"This movie tries to tell too long a period (Since Mary comes back to reclaim the Scottish Throne in 1960, to the moment she dies 25 years later). And besides Mary's story, we get also the Queen Elizabeth of England).To the task of contextualizing the periods politically of both kingdoms (Scottish and English), including the social, religious and military tensions, there is the need to show the personalities of both queens, both of their Councils, and chose the most relevant facts for the story they wanted to tell.I don't think they nailed this. Besides some liberties or imprecision (for what I read, more than acceptable) and a somewhat modernized language (cleaner for this times), the movie never feels that cohesive. Every scene is essential for the plot, which makes a lot of the dialogue just exposition, which can overwhelm. Everything is more or less entertaining and interesting, but I think a voice over (from Mary's perspective, more than anything) with a concrete exposition in less screentime, could've given time and space for more elaborated scenes, more nuance for every character, or more emotional scenes for us to connect.Instead of the that practical choice, the artistic one was chosen, which made every scenes feel rushed, abruptly starting and ending, like they were desperate to show the next so they could keep explaining the story, without any room for the movie to breath and us to feel what was happening, or even more time for the complex political game.Having said that, Saoirse was awesome and, to me, elevated the whole movie above mediocrity.",Mary Queen of Scots
54,rockman182,Mary Queen of Scots (2018),7,9 December 2018,"Oh man, on paper this seemed like a prospect. Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie in a film together? Especially after award nominated films that they were in last year. Based on sheer star power alone this was something that I had to see. Also, add in the history attached of Queen Elizabeth and her Cousin Mary and their rather tumultuous relationship marred in jealousy and a craving of power. The film looks nice and the costumes are beautiful but the script lets down these two leading ladies.The film takes place during the reign of Mary in Scotland and her cousin Elizabeth in England and Ireland. Both have to deal with the difficulties of ruling their kingdoms, family, power, producing an heir and being at odds with each other despite being family. Things come to a head when both confront each other, which decides the fate of Mary, Queen of Scots. The film is directed by Josie Rourke, who has a history in theater production but decided to come to the silver screen with this film.The costume design and locations on display in the film look magnificent. Both leading performances by Ronan and Robbie are also fantastic. its always the case with Ronan because she's bee formidable from a young age but Robbie continues to perform extremely well after I, Tonya and shows off some versatility in Mary Queen of Scots. Unfortunately, the film does not hold its weight outside of those features as the script is too dull to excite. There are moments that grasp you only to let you go soon after.I think the writing lets down a film that had the potential to be a real Oscar contender otherwise. Its a historically interesting story for sure, it just needed better direction to get to a finished product that gives the viewers what they seek. Its decently enjoyable overall but I wanted to really be blown away by this because there seemed to be so much going for it. P.S.

However, Queen Elizabeth I(Margot Robbie) is already ruling England. This is when a feud begins between Mary & Elizabeth.Mary Queen of Scots is a great movie. Director Josie Rourke has completely transported us to the 1500s, the time period of this film. The locales are exquisite & have been captured beautifully by cinematographer, John Mathieson. Saoirse Ronan is spectacular as Mary Stuart. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Queen Elizabeth I. Ronan & Robbie's powerhouse performances, are the highlight of the movie.

The Favorite is based on events surrounding Queen Anne and is widely seen as being better than Mary Queen of Scots by the critics.Personally I enjoyed Mary Queen of Scots more. That might be because it is a period of history that I better understand. Although there are a few liberties taken with history in Mary Queen of Scots the underlying plot is based on history. Both of the leads Saoirse Ronan (Mary) and Margot Robbie (Elizabeth) are excellent. You can't help but notice how similar the events that are unfolding in the 16th century are to today's politics.

58,bob-the-movie-man,Battle Royal.,7,26 January 2019,"It's an unbelievably turbulent story, but as it's a true story the late 1500's were clearly turbulent times. I mean, there weren't even any Starbucks. After a brief Fotheringay flash-forward (#spoilers!) it's 1561 and the widowed catholic Mary Stuart (Saoirse Ronan), ex-queen consort of France, arrives on Leith beach to assert her right as queen of Scotland. Indeed, she feels she has succession rights to the English throne too after her protestant first cousin, once removed, Elizabeth (Margot Robbie) passes. She's not exactly welcomed back to Scotland since she is muscling in on the rule of her half brother (James McArdle).But Mary is playing a dangerous game on multiple fronts, and her life - as I'm sure you're aware - is not going to be a smooth one.What was life like in the court of Mary? As painted here, it was a fairly louche affair, with casual - but never penetrative - sexual encounters that (as portrayed) had a significant impact on Scottish history. This might have been accurate... who knows. What seems to almost certainly be a fabrication is Mary and Elizabeth's dramatic meeting (in what appears to be a laundry!). The film attempts to smooth over the cracks with dialogue about 'This meeting must never be documented'. Nice try!Was this necessary? It certainly adds an opportunity for Ronan and Robbie to bounce off each other directly, but there is a certain attraction in a film where the drama is purely played out in communication through letters. (There is an interesting discussion of the topic on the historyextra.com web site).What's also mooted in the film - ""I'm more man than woman"" - is that Elizabeth's reason for not marrying and not bearing children was that she was a lesbian. I'm not sure of the historical provenance of this either.This is clearly the Ronan and Robbie show. Both deliver star turns that impress. From the trailers you would think that the screentime of the pair would be about 50:50. Actually, it's more like 80:20 in Ronan's favour.As if last year's Oscar nomination wasn't enough to stamp her place in the list of the acting greats, Saoirse Ronan here IS Mary Queen of Scots, with a fierce and determined stare that would put the fear of God into most men. Margot Robbie, under ugly make-up reminiscent of Charlize Theron in ""Monster"", is impressive in a much quieter and more mannered way. Both must feel a little aggrieved at being overlooked for Oscar nominations.Elsewhere there is a plethora of acting talent, most of it hidden behind big bushy growths. The biggest and bushiest of these belongs to David Tennant as the hellfire preacher and rabble-rouser John Knox. (He's so well-endowed in the facial hair-area that the lady next to me exclaimed to her friend at the end-titles ""David Tennant? Who was he??"").Other familiar faces are Downton's Brendan Coyle as the Earl of Lennox; Jack Lowden as his son and Mary's second husband Henry Darnley; Adrian Lester as Lord Randolph; Guy Pearce as William Cecil, Elizabeth's right hand man; and rising star Joe Alwyn as Robert Dudley... the nearest Elizabeth ever got to a husband. Another actor I spent ages trying to recognise was Mary's third husband (she sure got through them) Lord Bothwell; he is Martin Compston, star of TV's excellent ""Line of Duty"" series.Big, broad historical epics at the cinema are few and far between, so in the vein of ""a change is as good as a rest"" it's a welcome release. The cinematography (by John Mathieson) is glorious: the external shots (great drone work!) makes me immediately want to go hill-walking again in Scotland. And some of the internal shots are beautifully lit: a scene of the Scottish lords ganging up on Robert Dudley for a signature is like a Vermeer painting.As you might expect from a historical epic, the costumes (by Alexandra Byrne) are great and the hair and makeup team (Jenny Shircore, Marc Pilcher and Jessica Brooks) did a great job. They are all in fact Oscar nominated.And of course from a great British ensemble cast the acting is great.But the story chugs along rather turgidly, and even the moments that you think herald a monumental action sequence - like an attack down a wooded hillside at a bridge, reminiscent of ""Gladiator"" - end in a curious damp squib. There is nothing here of the great battle sequences of ""Braveheart"".More tellingly, when the axe finally fell I felt curiously unmoved: nothing like the stirring I felt with the disembowelment of Mel Gibson in that Scottish classic I just mentioned. So something in the movie just didn't connect with me at an emotional level. It feels like it's falling between two stools of a retelling of history and a deeply involving drama. The direction was by first timer Josie Rourke and the screenplay as a second time outing by Beau Willimon (""Ides of March"").In summary, my view would be that it's worth seeing for its epic spectacle, but it's not a film I will be rushing to see again.(For the full graphical review please visit One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

60,tm-sheehan,"Underwhelming but SaoriseRohan,excellent",6,17 January 2019,"My Review-
I found this latest version of Mary Queen of Scots pretty underwhelming it left me with two questions why would the Producers choose .Josie Rourke,who has never directed a feature film before? Josie Rourke has directed many fine productions for the London stage but this hasn't transferred to film as far as I'm concerned.
Second question if you're going to remake Mary Queen of Scots,which was filmed in 1971 with a superb cast Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth 1st and Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Mary what are you hoping to add to a new version? ( certainly not to add authenticity its here missing in spades)
Of course like the 1971 version this one is full of fantasy and inaccuracies at times I wondered if Walt Disney had produced this current effort but historical accuracy aside the 1971 version at least had great stars ,a great director Charles Jarrett who also did Anne of a Thousand Days and the performance of Glenda Jackson the finest actress in my opinion to portray Queen Elizabeth 1 ever,so what's wrong with this version ?(also a great John Barry score)
It's not Saorise Rohan who is a fine actress and plays Queen Mary excellently ,she made the film worth seeing for me I blame the inexperienced film director Josie Rourke and the script writer Michael Dobbs ,who's watered down portrayal of Queen Elizabeth 1 ,makes it very difficult for Margot Robbie ,another fine actress to add much to the role ,at least Glenda Jackson aged gracefully in her version ,here they just add proxy white makeup,which seems to block out Margot Robbie's portrayal entirely.
I share a birthday with Queen Elizabeth 1st, so perhaps I'm being too critical but in this version there's no sparks flying ,they're all on Mary's side and left me wondering if Elizabeth was really this lack lustre and confused how did she attain the greatness of her reputation for defeating the Spanish Armada and being known as Gloriana of The Golden Age .
If I was directing this film to add accuracy Rather than portray a fictional meeting of the two Queens I would have chosen a dream sequence that had Elizabeth and Mary dreaming of meeting each other and two outcomes seen from each of the monarchs perspective ,no one could then say it never occurred because it was a dream.
In summing up this film looks good, the actors are good ,Saorise is excellent as usual but it's flat as a pancake and I can only rate it a 6 out of 10 ,a shame because the trailer looked promising as sooooo many do but the film disappointed me I can't wait to see the original again.",Mary Queen of Scots

Especially the first half of the film felt a bit like the lifetime TV version of ""Elizabeth"". It was thankfully not as week as ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" tho. Nice to look at and some fine performances. While Saiorse Ronan was decent enough she really didn't steal my breath here as usual. She can do better and for her abilities it was a bit pale. Not bad, but not outstanding at all. During the weaker first half I wasnt too sure about Margot Robbie's performance either, fell she was too pretty for the role.. until she got ""ugly make-up"" but that was also the point when her performance became more and more authentic. Especially her final scenes were brilliant and absolutely outstanding. Jack Lowdon was okay but nothing to write home about. I liked Luke Kidd. Guy Pearce was rather underused here.
You often question the historical accuracy and it often felt like they rather used melodramatic soap opera elements instead of sticking to the truth. I guess this was the weakest part of the film.

72,pfgpowell-1,Something of a good-looking failure,4,24 April 2021,"There's something decidedly off-kilter about Josie Rourke's take on the life, betrayal and death of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, but it is hard to say quite what.The film is sumptuously produced and to an extent engaging, but it's as though crucial scenes have been cut and, missing, they interrupt the flow.Rourke's background is in theatre and although she is not a first-time director, this is the first film she has directed, and 'theatrical' ideas come to the fore.That is not to say they don't and can't work in film, just they don't quite seem to work in this film.An odd, and in some ways unfortunate, symptom of Rourke's off-target attempt is a gratuitous use of black actors in leading parts. I should imagine in 100 years that will not seem strange but it does now. Elizabethan England (and quite possibly Scotland) did have one or two black faces, but not on Elizabeth's council or in Mary's court.Admirable as it is to make the point that black actors are just as good as white actors (and need work just as much), in context it just doesn't work: this film seems the wrong one as a vehicle to make what is essentially a political point. It just gets in the way. I mention that because in an odd way it does typify Rourke's misdirected approach.As for the history, the film never makes clear just why Mary Stuart had to abdicate. It is all just a little too muddy. That is a shame because in other respects Rourke's film is impressive. But she doesn't quite pull off whatever it was she hoped to pull off.",Mary Queen of Scots

75,Magow-Intermean,Mary Queen of Scots Review,8,16 March 2019,"The widowed Mary Queen Of Scots (Saoirse Ronan) returns to her native Scotland to assume her throne. Her brother James Murray (James McArdle) and his lords are wary of having a female ruler, while in England her cousin Elizabeth (Margot Robbie) is threatened by this new, Catholic monarch on the same island.
Three tumultuous marriages, rumoured affairs and a tragic death on the orders of her cousin, Elizabeth I of England, almost make for too much drama. Director Josie Rourke finds a way through by focusing on a relatable story about women struggling to survive a man's world, though she sometimes sacrifices historical believability to do it.
We meet Mary (Ronan) and her ladies-in-waiting as they return from France to assume her throne. Mary is keenly aware of her status: Queen Of Scotland since she was a few months old and heir to England, unless her cousin Elizabeth (Robbie) finally marries and produces an heir. But Mary is Catholic on a Protestant island, and that makes her a threat. Her own lords, even her largely sympathetic half-brother James Murray (McArdle), see her as a possible fifth columnist who might sneak the Pope back into the country. The more puritanical Scots, led by David Tennant's John Knox, see the fact of a female ruler as an additional outrage. And Elizabeth is by no means reconciled to having a younger, beautiful queen eyeing her throne.
While she's conscious of the danger, Ronan's Mary chooses her allies poorly. Her second husband, Jack Lowden's superficially charming but wildly unreliable Lord Darnley, proves a severe disappointment. Her third, Bothwell (Martin Compston), is apparently loyal, right until the point he reveals himself as an abusive rapist. Ronan, naturally, gives Mary some depth. She's sufficiently egotistical to demand respect and brook no compromise with her subjects, often to a self-destructive degree. She's also so naive that she continues partying like she did in France, despite her courtiers' horror. The tragedies of the film are almost entirely her own doing, but knowing her as we do here, it's hard to see how she could have acted otherwise. Equally Robbie's touchy, calculating Elizabeth seems locked on a crash course with her sister monarch, both drawn to the one person who can understand her situation and resentful of a sudden rival.
It is, of course, a quick breeze through the real history. Beau Willimon's script occasionally reduces complex relationships to broadly drawn incidents that feel unrealistic in comparison to the cast's more internal performances. Some of the design choices feel deeply anachronistic too (was Mary's palace really half-hewn from the living rock?), though the costumes are, thankfully, more faithful than the last time we saw Mary on screen in the bonkers Reign. The biggest issue is that one showcase meeting that should be a highlight becomes the film's weakest moment - it's oddly written and strangely stilted. But the conviction of Ronan and Robbie, and a strong supporting cast, nevertheless make this a compelling clash of personalities. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, and it's sad when even an enemy queen is closer to understanding your problems than the people you love.",Mary Queen of Scots
76,W011y4m5,Fantasy more than factual.,6,6 April 2019,"As a lover of historical period pieces, I can accept filmmakers occasionally require some creative license in order to make their movies more watchable throughout... But Mary Queen of Scots is a prime example of people taking this notion way too far & ultimately ruining the suspension of disbelief by tipping it closer to the category of ""fiction"", obviously refusing to acknowledge historical accuracy has any role to play / importance whatsoever in this particular instance.
When the film goes to such great lengths to depict the indoctrination of firm religious beliefs amongst the vast majority of the public within Scotland & the rest of the UK - which is the main source of conflict fuelling the majority of the story's progression - featuring what is essentially an openly gay, effeminate & flamboyant male character within it seemed totally inconceivable - when he's surrounded by staunchly traditional men & women who are intolerant towards other groups of people for something as trivial as simply interpreting the Bible differently upon reading it...
As a gay man myself, I'm endlessly longing for more healthy LGBT representation in Hollywood productions etc. but only when it's appropriate & turning real life historical figures (Mary's husband included) gay (or speculating on their sexual orientations in order to create a mini soap opera drama) for the sake of it seemed forced & unnecessary - not to mention, utterly illogical & ridiculous, considering the time period the events took place in.
Additionally, expecting to convince the audience such characters would be accepted by even one individual is unreasonable & hard to imagine so having Mary & her maids possess the same liberal attitudes you'd find in 21st century Britain is a ""bold move"" at that, if not a little distracting - when it's set in 1561.
The script clearly needed a fair amount of extra work before production progressed into the later stages; dialogue is clunky & has all the subtleties of a mallet being swung towards your head & for the reasons I've noted above - not to mention other failings in maintaining historical accuracy which have gained larger amounts of attention - it just wasn't ready for principal photography...
Granted, that doesn't make this a bad movie - it's thankfully partially saved by some excellent performances from great actors who can make even the worst lines sound outstanding (namely, David Tennant is the surprising stand-out - even with his minor role & limited screen time - & Margot Robbie as Queen Elizabeth) - it just makes it underwhelmingly average instead when it began with such promise.",Mary Queen of Scots

82,themadmovieman,"It has its moments, but Mary Queen Of Scots is ultimately a rather disjointed, confused and even dull historical drama",7,19 January 2019,"The Tudor Period has been long-beloved by film and television for its wealth of political drama and intrigue, and the story of how one of the greatest monarchical families in British history eventually came to fall is an equally fascinating one. However, despite a wealth of historical drama, Mary Queen Of Scots is unfortunately a rather disappointing watch, proving a disjointed and frustrating biopic that fails to deliver the intrigue and tension that the history deserves, and despite some strong performances and brilliant production design, it's a rather dull watch from beginning to end.Let's start on the bright side, however, with the film's strongest suit: the production design. Trying to deliver a Game Of Thrones-esque vibe with its focus on the thirst for power in all realms, Mary Queen Of Scots is a deliberately drab and dark piece, but it gives an earthy and convincing quality to the film that makes the time period feel all the more tactile.Too many period pieces have a tendency to portray medieval settings as dollhouses, with far too much style over substance, but there's a deliberate and concerted effort to give the setting a darker and more grounded look that, in tandem with some lush costume design and stunning make-up work, really brings the period to life in far more interesting fashion than most.Another plus comes in the form of the lead performances, with a strong and convincing turn from Saoirse Ronan in the lead as Mary Stuart, as well as an equally striking - albeit disappointingly sporadic - appearance from Margot Robbie as Elizabeth I. The two actresses do a great job at making their characters as strong and tough as can be, and it plays in well to the ever-growing conflict that begins to burn between their two courts.With that said, this film doesn't quite manage to deliver that story about conflict in particularly interesting or swift fashion. Despite a stunning production and two great lead turns, the movie's screenplay is incredibly muddled, as it fails to double down on key aspects of the history to make for a properly fascinating watch.Now, while it's clear that the future of England and Scotland lays very much in the balance as the two queens become further embroiled in a potential succession crisis, the movie takes a very confusing attitude to showing the battle for power, struggling to clarify who the people that really hold the power are.In effect, there are two stories happening at the same time here, but they don't gel at all well together. On the one hand, you have the strong and increasingly ambitious presence of Mary Stuart, as she threatens the English throne and Elizabeth's heritage, and on the other, you have a story about how both queens were held back by the political machinations of the men in their respective courts, men with ambitions far greater than simply serving their monarchs.Individually, those stories are interesting indeed, but the film jumps back and forth between the two at a frantic rate, to the point where you don't really know what to focus on as the viewer, whether what you're seeing is important with regard to the tension between Mary and Elizabeth, or whether it's all about the political wrangling in the domestic court.What's more is that the focus on Elizabeth I's side of the story is woefully underdeveloped, and leaves the movie feeling a little lop-sided for the story it's trying to tell. Sure, the film is called Mary Queen Of Scots, and Mary Stuart rightly takes the role of the main character, but I felt far more attention needed to be given to Elizabeth's situation to further deepen the intensity and stakes of what's playing out on screen, rather than something that spends a little too much time focusing on Mary's personal life, with little or no wider impact.The movie definitely has its moments, and with an enthralling face-off between the two queens in the final act, it's certainly a story that has immense potential for big screen intrigue, but it unfortunately muddles its way through the majority of its 2 hour runtime, as such making for a frustrating and unfortunately even dull watch for a large proportion of the movie.Overall, I was rather disappointed by Mary Queen Of Scots. As I said, it has its moments, and along with sublime production design and two strong lead performances, it's by no means a bad film, but when it comes to delivering a riveting and thoroughly coherent historical story, the film really falls flat, with a muddled focus that ultimately leaves it feeling disjointed and confusing.",Mary Queen of Scots
83,williampsamuel,A Well Acted But Deeply Flawed Biopic,6,16 March 2019,"Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, was a fascinating woman who lived an equally fascinating life, in one of the most fascinating periods of history. Its only fitting then that her story should be the subject of multiple film adaptations, of which this is the most recent. Whether it's an improvement on its predecessors is up for debate.By far this film's greatest asset is its talented leads. Margot Robbie is excellent as Queen Elizabeth. Ronan is absolutely masterful as Mary. It's the force of their wills (both as actresses and characters) that carries the entire enterprise. As Mary, Ronan is by turns fiery and restrained, sharp tongued and subdued, but always sure of herself, and never content to let anyone or anything stand between her and her goals. Robbie is equally regal, commanding, and strong willed, even stubborn as Elizabeth.Although the two don't meet until the end of the movie, their rivalry and competing designs form the most compelling conflict by far. Their carefully worded letters and calculated offers form a genteel yet fraught cat and mouse game as compelling as any modern investitive drama or cops and robbers movie. Their interplay actually reminds me of Pacino and De Niro in Heat. Each knows the other is plotting against them, and is equally aware of their plots, but can directly challenge the other, for fear of giving themselves away and starting a war between their kingdoms.And when they finally do meet, their confrontation is magnificent. Though it starts cautiously and oh so courteously, so much fear, pride, and bottled up resentments surface at an increasing rate until one is fully undone, with her life firmly in the other's hand. The trailers may have given away much of the scene, but viewed in its complete state it still retains its full impact.That's the good. Now for the bad. There are a number of historical inaccuracies, mainly involving the timing and nature of the various intrigues within the Scottish court, as well as the portrayals of certain supporting characters. Nor can it be said that most of these changes are for the sake of clarity or simplicity, as the plot is quite convoluted, delivering repeated twists faster than many viewers can properly take them in. The schemes of her nobles and the drama of her failing marriage are all quite interesting, but for once I have to criticize this movie for being too tightly paced.More regrettable are the sex scenes. Besides being entirely unnecessary, they're both too explicit for many casual viewers, and yet not explicit enough to titillate. They're also the only real reason for the film's R rating, which likely cost it much of its potential audience. And I have no idea why the writer's felt the need to add a gay subplot with no historical basis.On the other hand, this is a beautiful movie to look at. No expense has been spared on the costumes and make-up, which are gorgeous and largely historically accurate. The set pieces are likewise excellent, befitting the use of actual castles and palaces as locations. And the film's one major battle scene is rather short, but well-staged and quite dramatic. All around the production values are very good.It is regrettable that this production's screenplay didn't stick closer to its source material, and the timing of its release- just before the similar but so far better received The Favorite- is most unfortunate. But, for all its flaws, Mary Queen of Scots is a wonderfully acted character study and richly nuanced relational drama which should mostly satisfy fans of period dramas and strong female leads.",Mary Queen of Scots

In a lot of aspects it reminded me of watching a play which given the director's backstory made sense.So that being said, what did I think? Story wise...it was ok. There are some cool scenes that draw parallels to the 2 queens and I think both actresses (Saoirse and Margot) do a good job of making you feel empathy for them. Despite their stature, they're still living in a man's world. There's also some beautiful cinematography and of course the costumes and hairstyling is top notch too. Despite this...the movie just wasnt that engaging. At least until towards the end when the two queens meet. This is I think, is the strongest scene in the film and a tad too bad that happens so late.Its not a bad first film for this director.

89,scb_coldsteel,A well-acted historical melodrama with far too many structural problems.,7,14 January 2019,"So I saw Mary Queen of Scots at the theater. I'm not going to lie I was immensely excited for this film. I love Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie has been great lately. Plus who doesnt love a historical period epic? Unfortunately this has been my biggest disappointment of 2018. Not because it was a bad film, but because I wanted it to be an amazing film.The plot of the film should be fairly well known at this point. There have been many past films that have delved into the complicated relationship between Mary and Elizabeth. Both are monarchs who rule with absolute authority, but still have to exist in the confines of a male-dominated society. The film explores the conflicts in their relationship as a backdrop, but mostly it delves into the rise and eventual fall of Mary Queen of Scots. At its core the film acts as a textured melodrama that explores the difficulty of being a woman in power.The film has a few incredible strengths as a movie. First the movie explores a complicated and interesting era filled with political intrigue, murder, sex, and betrayal. The setting of the movie really helped to personify the struggles that Mary and Elizabeth had to endure in an era when women were seen as secondary.The film and it's setting also made for some incredible set designs, costumes, and makeup. You really felt like you were transported to that time period through the complete immersion of its setting and characters. The film absolutely deserves recognition for its technical achievements it that regard.The movie was also very well-acted. I cannot say enough how great Saoirse Ronan was in her role. She absolutely deserves praise for personifying the complex character that was Mary Queen of Scots. She managed to emote a wide range of emotions in a completely human manner. She made for a believable and compelling lead in portraying a flawed character struggling with the structural gender imbalances of her time.Margot Robbie also deserves recognition. While it is hard to not think about Cate Blanchett for this role, Margot Robbie still did a hell of a job. She did a good job playing the stern and brutal monarch who would stop at nothing to maintain her power in the face of constant threat. Of course she also added a underlining sensitivity to the role that at times made the character very sympathetic.Unfortunately despite a few strong points, the actual plot of the film was a mess. It seemed like the director didn't quite know what story they wanted to tell. Was this a historical epic filled with intense battles? A courtroom drama with political intrigue and espionage? A complicated love story? A deep introspective look at the Cult of Domesticity and the hierarchical imbalances of the era? It was just too much for the film to keep track of.The film at times felt more like a daytime soap opera than the major motion blockbuster that it was. Besides the two leads all of the other characters were one dimensional caricatures who lacked any real complexity. It didn't help thay the dialogue felt very forced at times and unnatural. Plus the film and it's plot points became incredibly predictable.The film also had a massive pacing problem. There were far too many times in the film where the narrative with its unorganized structure just fell to a snail's pace. I genuinely felt board during parts of a film which should never have happened considering the interesting premise.So Mary Queen of Scots was not a bad movie. The movie certainly had a number of strengths. It was a beautifully decorated period peace with an amazing setting. The film is worth seeing alone for Saoirse Ronan as well. The movie really dropped the ball with its storytelling though. I wanted this to be the most watch movie of 2018, at the end of the day it is a very forgettable film with a number of glaring structural issues. A 6.75 out of 10.",Mary Queen of Scots
90,blrnani,Yet another pathetic historical rewrite in support of a modern agenda,4,13 March 2019,"What a waste of a talented cast! I have mixed feelings about their ethnic diversity, but it certainly did not reflect the reality of the time.
Neither did the plot, which seemed geared to convince a Scottish population fueled on Braveheart that the country has a legitimate claim to the British throne and rather than breaking away from the UK they should seek to take control of the entire country.
Before watching the film I'd imagined Saoirse Ronan as playing Elizabeth, given the closer physical resemblance. Instead she endeared Mary with a simplicity and vulnerability that didn't match the historical figure. I think the Margot Robbie of Suicide Squad would've been more suitable to portray the ambitious manipulative woman who, reared in an English-hating French court committed to absolute monarchy, moved to Scotland in order to scheme her way to the English throne and rule over the entire UK (as a subsidiary of France and the papacy).

With all the talent involved, I expected at least something entertaining...but nope...a stinker it is, and it stinks to high heaven!I mean, I knew going in that this was supposed to be one of those re-imagined historical pics, taking creative licence, a lot of it actually, but not this freaking much?!It tries to be both a live-action play and an historical epic...and ends up being neither.On the meagre plus side, Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie are good, it's the movie surrounding them that sucked. Also the cinematography is beautiful. And that's it.Think of ""Mary, Queen Of Scotts"" as ""King Arthur Legend Of The Sword"" and the recent ""Robin Hood"" without the action set pieces...can we please stop making these damn ""woke"" versions of historical movies and just try to make a good movie instead?!4 out of 10.",Mary Queen of Scots
92,gilleliath,"'My Lord, news! Lord Wessex is / is not dead!'",5,31 December 2019,"You feel stage director Josie Rourke had Shakespearean aspirations for this film, but it's missing the things that can make a Shakespeare History engaging (though hardly fun): quality dialogue and charismatic performances. The two leads are not bad actors but they lack presence, and the story skips from one captioned court scene to another ('Carlisle, 1576'), never feeling like it is happening in any real time or place.It has attracted a lot of comment for the casting of BAME actors. They say there's no such thing as bad publicity, and no doubt this policy helped get the film made; in the event (as is often the case) it's largely window dressing, as few of the actors in question have any lines. But in any case the controversy distracts from the real influence of PC on the film. If we could all lighten up a bit there is probably a great story to be told about the real, headstrong, flighty, selfish MQoS; but a film like this, obsessed with setting examples and providing role models, was never going to be able to tell it. It looks nice, is competently made, but it's tiresome.As a presentation of history not the way it was, but the way it ought to have been, the seal is set by the closing claim that Mary's son James 'brought peace'. His, of course, was the dynasty which caused a century of civil wars leaving permanent scars on Ireland and the Highlands. So no happy ending there, I'm afraid.",Mary Queen of Scots

Although we cannot ignore the good performances of Saoirse and Margot, we have to talk about the British accent that the protagonist sometimes forgets, we can also highlight the good work in the hairstyle and makeup that exists. But the script is confusing, it includes many characters that you do not know who they are, there is no good development of other characters and the description of the geographical space where the story takes place is null. The special effects are very false, the production design remains a duty as well as the costumes and photography.The film tries to put together all the important things that the main character went through in real life, but fails to develop each of them and not to focus on just one, making the poorly written script its biggest problem.",Mary Queen of Scots

For instance, why does margo robbie have a prosthetic nose? Why make her wear such silly makeup when it doesn't add anything to the story. There are so many other aspects of the film that are historically incorrect so why the focus on these little details? This isn't a documentary, so I guess they're entitled to 'artistic license' but then why throughout the movie do they attempt to be period correct in some details but not others?

97,lucasnochez,Film Review: Mary Queen of Scots/www.nightfilmreviews.com,7,26 December 2018,"As the clouds roll onto the waving and knotting hills of Scotland, a haze of insecurities, betrayal and bloodshed awaits two powerful Queens; two women whose blood lines and loyalties are blurred by the manipulative and convoluted men in their lives. Yet although history always tells us that men have been at the forefront of politics and royalty, Mary Queen of Scots is a highly dramatized account of the 16th Century events surrounding Queen Mary (Saoirse Ronan) and Queen Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie), two of the most powerful and influential women, not only of their time, but of all time.As cousins, the two share a very respectful and adorning attitude and relationship, although never meeting according to the pages of history books, Mary Queen of Scots amps us drama for a fateful face-to-face between the two. Young Mary, widowed and eighteen by the time she claims her position as Queen in Scotland, is free-spirited, understanding and audacious. Embracing the many facets of a colourful and diverse world, including homosexuality, Mary's beliefs and perspectives may be a little too liberal in a 16th Century world, yet we are manipulated into believing anything, especially when Ronan is playing the title role. On the other end, Queen Elizabeth I is a reserved, alienated and scorn barren woman whose fate was almost succumbed to smallpox. Embarrassed and hidden underneath the many layers of white make up to hide her smallpox scars, Elizabeth is riddled with sadness and tragedy, who confidence is hidden underneath elaborate and grandiose dresses that retracts men, even the tenderness and love of a man in desperate search of her love, Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn). While both actresses are faces of beauty in Hollywood, Ronan's Mary is the only Queen noticed for her divine and unpaired magnificence. Mary Queen of Scots is just another role to add to Robbie's recent fascination of diving into roles of women lacking much physical, emotional or mental beauty, despite the actress' undoubted charm and elegance. Robbie's interpretation of Elizabeth I is just one more notch under Robbie's belt solidifying her devotion and passion to her craft.While it isn't much of a spoiler to know that Mary's fate is found on the chopping block in 1587, the film begins with her demise, focusing on just how she got their. The film, directed by Josie Rourke and written by Beau Willimon based on a book by John Guy, historians may very well disregard Mary Queen of Scots because it becomes clear that the film is less fascinated with shedding historical and real light on the life of these two reigning women, and play more like a dramatic narrative, very similar to the style and narrative flow of The Other Boleyn Girl a decade prior. While that film features two of Hollywood's most promising young actresses then, Mary Queen of Scots showcases two of the strongest young female actors of today.Both Robbie and Ronan are magnificent in their respective royal roles. Overshadowing all of their male counterparts, even with the likes of David Tennant, Jack Lowden and Guy Pearce gracing the screen, Ronan and Robbie are acting forces, elevating the material of the screen, regardless of how potent it every really becomes. Mary Queen of Scots is a masterclass of acting for two very deserving actresses today.Both actresses, nominated for Academy Awards the year prior, Ronan for Lady Bird and Robbie for I, Tonya, are in a class of their own, Ronan may reign supreme however between the two budding actresses, after all, the film is called Queen of Scots. Ronan carries the brunt of the film's heavy story material, constantly dealing with betrayals, death and obscenities beyond her control, despite her position of Queen. Ronan's delicate portrait of a scourged historical figure is riveting.Sadly, as the film's story unfolds and the ruse of each woman's power is displayed in glorious fashion, the film is still bounded by the approval of men, fertility and virginity. Lines like ""How did it come to this? Wise men servicing the whims of women"", or ""Worse than a plague is a woman with a crown"", the content of the film is wholly vexed by the presence of men. While the royal women have a clear path to attain their goals, the men provide the women and the film with the majority of the narrative's twists, turns and rivalries to unfold. Emotions, notions of privilege and family drama are the driving forcing for Mary Queen of Scots, proving the line in the film ""the matters of the heart dictate the outcomes of countries"" unequivocally.United and strong, Mary Queen of Scots gives audiences a ponder-some conclusion and climax, basically setting up a narrative film for a fictitious meeting between the two Queens. Decorated and flooded with white sheets to separate the two and set in place to avoid any direct face-to-face contact, the film seems to be one big lead up to this grand moment. Yet, while each actress elevates their acting and skills for their respective roles, when this meeting finally arrives, there is a placid and anticlimactic feel that pours water between two fiery performances.Born from blood and separated by their beliefs and religion, Mary Queen of Scots does one thing right through the duration of its runtime, and that is setting an excellent example of just how religion and faith proves to be another void and obstacle between men, women and human beings worldwide.Stylized in high Victorian fashion, and picturesque in its foggy presence, Mary Queen of Scots is a satisfying tale of heirs, thrones and the actions of anyone who is willing and wanting to attain such high order and power. While one may cherish these historical figures and their contributions to the pages of history books and today's way of life, Mary Queen of Scots gives birth to a new, exciting and dramatic take on two unapologetic firecrackers.",Mary Queen of Scots

102,iamtherobotman,An insult to Scottish history,2,20 December 2020,"When i heard we were getting a new 'Mary Queen of Scots' film i was intrigued. I hoped we would get something on a par with 'Outlaw King' as opposed to 'Braveheart'. What we end up with is something even worse than 'Braveheart' if that's possible.
Right from the start this film was onto a loser. We see Mary 'wash up' on a shore, somewhere in Scotland... She sailed into Leith Docks... We then see her and her entourage making their way through 'typically Scottish' scenery to a Castle on a rocky outcrop miles from anywhere and are led to believe this is Holyrood Palace at the foot of the Royal Mile.
Then we get into the 'Blackening' of both the Scottish and English courts. To even suggest there were 'people of colour' taking prominence in Britain in the 1500's is at best embarrassing at worst insulting( can you imagine a White person being an 'advisor' to a Zulu King or a Chinese Emperor???).
The Rizzio and Darley homosexual thing was also pathetic, no evidence exists suggesting either were homosexual or bi sexual, this was wedged in to tick another 'progressive' box for the film.
Mary would've spoken French and certainly wouldn't have had a Scots accent. The two Queens never met and what was with absolutely everything being Black??? Why was everyone wearing Black? Why were the horses Black, the Carriage? People did wear coloured clothing in the 1500's.
The whole film was a complete PC, SJW, Left Wing propaganda machine, it played around with a vital time in Scotland and Britains history, no other Nation would stand for that. This is an embarrassment and an insult to Scotland.",Mary Queen of Scots

But notwithstanding the feminist director and the diversity casting gimmick, this looks like the same old sexist romantic hogwash.Ever since Schiller's Maria Stuart, writers of historical fiction have sympathized with Mary's emotion driven bad choices, while trashing Elizabeth I as a cold, vain, barren shrew who denied her female nature in order to rule. Never mind that old Liz was a far better and more successful politician than any of the Stuarts, two of whom were driven into exile and two of whom got their heads cut off. (That's 3, not 4 -- Mary managed both.) Never mind that Elizabeth completely dominated her male advisors and made sure they never forgot she was Henry VIII's daughter. Never mind that Mary lost her head for conspiring to have Elizabeth murdered so that she could become queen and return England to the true Catholic faith. Never mind, most of all, that Elizabeth's Parliamentary and Protestant state is the ancestor of American institutions, that the Stuarts were absolutists and either outright or crypto-Catholics, and that our Anglo-American ideas of liberty and constitutional government were developed in reaction to what the Stuarts tried and failed to achieve. No, all that matters is that Mary is a tragic figure who acted on her feelings, like a woman is supposed to, instead of using brains, foresight and self-control like Elizabeth did.This movie is more of the same, only with the third wave feminist twist that both women were oppressed because the patriarchy didn't allow them to wield power and be true to their female selves at the same time.",Mary Queen of Scots

Saoirse Ronan, playing Mary, Queen of Scots, and Margot Robbie, playing Queen Elizabeth I. While this historical accuracy of this movie is questionable, as can be found from any analysis of this film like those from the Independent, the Wrap, and Vulture cited on the Wikipedia article for this movie, there is one part of this film that is unlike others. It focuses on how the courts of each of these powerful women are manipulated by men, leading to discord and division.It's hard to remember all the twists and turns in this movie, but it comes down to Mary and Elizabeth being rivals, with Elizabeth in this movie shown as more hardnosed thanks to her anti-Catholic, pro-Protestant advisors while Mary is seen as more open. At one point Elizabeth even says she is a ""man"" because of her time sitting on the English throne, which is interesting to say the least. While Mary gets married to another man, and has a child, which later becomes James I. There is also the dramatic scene of Mary and Elizabeth meeting, at the film's climax, even though it never happened.With this all being said this film is rather compelling and has great period costume design. Additionally the settings, especially the scenes in Scotland, are beautiful. However, like many Hollyweird films on royalty, it ends up whitewashing it as something that was just was and can't be changed. That is a major problem with this film. Of course you can say that filmmakers have the right to dramatic license but this is often used by Hollyweird to distort the reality of history of the past. It would be too much to find an anti-monarchial film from Hollyweird. Instead you will find a film like this which poses as ""feminist.""

The atmosphere, the sets and the filming are great, yet maybe the editing seems a bit rushed in places (or is it because of some rushed scenes in the script?).Despite all this, unfortunately the viewer can't entirely buy in the end its fresh fictional perspective because of a few not so discrete bits of anachronism or blunt propaganda, which are totally gratuitous and would have been so easily avoided (many feminist hints, multiracial aristocracy in 16th century Europe, and a statement of acceptance of a drag queen).These 21st century hints are annoying here not because people of different agenda, ethnicity or sexual orientation were annoying as they were, which would be absurd, but because these anachronistic propagandist bits are useless, distracting and disposable aspects in the context of this film.",Mary Queen of Scots

119,makleen2,More concerned with pushing the filmmaker's social agenda than making us care who gains the English throne,5,13 January 2019,"Historic authenticity is cast to the wind in this revisionist costume drama that feels like it was written by a freshman Women's Studies major. Directed by Josie Rourke with a screenplay by Beau Willimon, Mary Queen of Scots (2018) was based on the book Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart by John Guy. Like many films released this year, it has strong female leads, a diverse cast, and progressive social messaging, but checking all the right boxes on the SJW playlist wasn't enough to save this film from mediocrity.The year is 1560, and the young and beautiful Mary Tudor (Saoirse Ronan) returns home, where she is out of place in a dreary Scottish castle. Her half-brother, James, Earl of Moray (James McArdle), has been ruling as regent, alongside a bevy of colorless and perpetually-angry Protestant men. Her appearance in Scotland alarms her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England (Margot Robbie). Elizabeth, a Protestant, is not seen as a legitimate ruler by her Catholic subjects. She seeks to gain influence over Mary by arranging a marriage with Elizabeth's own lover, Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn).Instead, Mary marries the charming and charismatic Lord Henry Darnley (Jack Lowden), who pulls a Jeckyll-and-Hyde routine and becomes a drunken lecher on their wedding night. Things get complicated for the childless Queen Elizabeth when Mary becomes pregnant, producing an heir for her dynasty and strengthening her claim to the English throne. Can Mary fend off attacks from her domestic critics and convince Elizabeth to acknowledge her as England's rightful ruler?Mary Queen of Scots couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a film about the rivalry between two queens or a revisionist biopic of its titular character, so it does neither particularly well. This ill-conceived and poorly executed film also missed a chance to let its leading ladies shine. As Queen Elizabeth, the talented Margot Robbie goes to waste as a costumed mannequin who practically disappears for the middle third of the film.Historically, Mary Stuart was born in 1542, the only legitimate heir to Scottish King James V. She was briefly married to the King of France. After his untimely death in 1560, Mary returned to Scotland and ruled as Mary I of Scotland until 1567, when she was forced to abdicate after her second husband's murder (which her rivals accused her of orchestrating). She fled to England to seek protection from her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I, but many English Catholics considered Mary the legitimate Queen of England, so Elizabeth had her imprisoned and later executed.There are many anachronisms and inaccuracies throughout Mary Queen of Scots, not the least of which was ""colorblind casting"" that falsely portrays 16th-Century England and Scotland's aristocracy as racially diverse. Mary's Scottish accent was also out of place (she grew up in France), as was her friendship with Italian courtier David Rizzio/Riccio. Most historians acknowledge Mary was probably having an affair with the man, which infuriated her Second Husband. Rizzio might have been bisexual, but he wasn't ""one of the girls,"" as the film portrays.Though ostensibly based on a book, this film can be considered a remake of the 1971 film by the same name. Mary, Queen of Scots (1971) was directed by Charles Jarrott and starred Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson. Like the 2018 film, the 1971 version featured a fictional meeting between the two queens and speculated that Lord Darnley and the musician David Riccio were lovers. The two films part ways, however, when it came to Mary's imprisonment. The 1971 version devotes more screen time to her 19 years in English captivity, while this version fast-forwards through it.Mary Queen of Scots opened to mixed reviews and currently holds a 63% positive rating from critics and 44% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. Its opening weekend took in a painful $194,777 on a $25 million budget. A successful film gets the audience invested in the story. Mary Queen of Scots ultimately failed to connect with audiences because it was more concerned with pushing the filmmaker's social perspective than making us care about who gains the English throne.",Mary Queen of Scots

I am well-versed on this period of history and was very aware there would be ""poetic licence"" used to cover some of the years.

I do love the way the weather in Scotland is portrayed as perpetually sunny and dry - presumably Visit Scotland secretly sponsored the script. The film lacks pace and direction. The saintlike Mary is just not convincing or believable and I cannot understand why award nominations were made. I also fail to understand why is it ok for black actors to play the role of a historical figure who was white but not the other way round. It doesn't matter to me as I simply want good acting and a good script but there has to be more consistency in attitudes and casting. This story has been told far better in other films and TV productions and I wouldn't waste your money renting this one.

To dwell on the myriad historical shortcomings is to look at this film the wrong way
Ronan's commanding, coruscating performance seems an Oscar certainty. The colorblind casting worked out well. I'm so glad Gemma Chan is included.

Mary has a black handmaid, and a gaay hispanic minstrel who becomes a handmaid. Said minstrel then has sex with Mary's husband after their wedding feast. Mary later thanks him for this and being 'his true self'. Husband may or may be gaay (bi?) but does lower himself to pleasure Mary - passing on equal treatment. Other blacks abound in 16th century Scotland. Disappointed a trans Eskimo never showed up.

The arthouse climax of a never-happened meeting of the two in a gauzy laundry is the brown cherry on this excreble pie.It's interesting that the positive reviews can point to little more than costumes and cinematography.

The other issue that bugs me is how people keep assuming that Mary & Elizabeth were sisters.
They were not, they were distant cousins. The confusion is that Queen Mary i of England, who was Elizabeth's sister and the other daughter of Henry Viii is a completely different character.
Even after seeing this film many audiences have still not understood the difference.

137,thinkMovies,Nice try,5,20 February 2019,"Granted, it's hard to build, frame-after-frame, a movie that gets the audience emotionally involved in rooting for the main character when we have known for centuries that the character was executed. It has been done though. I mean... Cameron got us to the point where we weren't sure the ship would sink in the end. It was a disappointment when it did. Yes, it has been done, by great writers and directors. And editors. And casting directors. Where were all these great professionals when Mary was produced? I mean... History had thrown in a great big handicap of a spoiler.The biggest absolute mistake was the casting and portrayal of Elizabeth I. Every frame of Elizabeth must be removed from the movie at once! The portrayal is slanderous and simply laughable (laughing at the filmmakers, not at Elizabeth) and untrue to the last detail. The second mistake was that there was absolutely no justification given for men of color to be appearing in Elizabethan get-up in Royal courts in England and Scotland of the 16th century. The third mistake is that you get a little confused about who is who and who is doing what to whom. Wait... did she marry the guy Elizabeth sent or is that another guy? Their names sound so similar and I think they're wearing the same outfits... (in fact, unfortunately, the two historically true names did sound very similar and the accents in the movie make it very hard to understand who we're talking about at any given moment. They look kinda similar too)I don't want to make it sound like a complete mess. It's kind of potentially a mess but it all sorts itself out the third time you watch it. No, I only watched it once, but I assume it should normally take three screenings to make sure you get who is who.Look. It's history. If you are going to revise it, the audience needs a whole lot of evidence to buy it. Make the evidence-up, I don't care, it's just a movie, but give us something. A couple of introductory white handwritten lines on black background in the beginning and another couple at the end ain't cuttin' it.And what about Mary? She's gorgeous! She's strong, regal, clever, poised and bears a striking resemblance to Saoirse Ronan! How could that Mary in the movie not have prevailed over all the Scottish overlords and Elizabeth herself to become Queen of Everything? How did she lose her head?This movie was a nice try. I mean a good try, to be sure. Everything was there: great scenery and sets, great photography, 21st century depressing cold blueish unsaturated video hues... (except for Saoirse's freckles), the whole 9 yards. But we were not amused. We just learned to speak with the Royal ""we"".

She was formidable and majestic.Margot Robbie's role does not allow her to stretch her legs until the third act, but she delivered extremely well during this.The film's content is a little sparse as it is a large part of history covered. Some moan about historical accuracy, such as MQOS living in France and she shouldn't have the Scottish accent (which she delivered effortlessly). However, it's a story, and should be enjoyed as such imo. I heard a historian saying it was pretty accurate mostly!The style and visuals are stunning, costume and scenery too. It's tense and dramatic with some great supporting cast members. You feel something is about to happen often.I am left with the Saoirse Ronan in my mind, who for me stole the show with a masterclass.

I give the film on its own an 8, but add Saoirse Ronan and Margot robbie (who was ROBBED for 'I, tonya') and you bump up to ten for me. This movie was basically about the 'what if queens Elizabeth and Mary had met?'. I don't know why so many people are offended that someone would explore this subject. Who cares if it's not historically correct? All movies are about 'what if?'. What was inportant about this film is that it showed how people (I know people are blaming men, but people in general) in power don't actually run things, others do it for them. This leads to a lot of confusion and a bit of golden age telephone. This movie is heartbreaking in that if you consider that it did happen, and we all know how history turned out for Mary, it just paints Elizabeth as even crueler than she already was. I won't spoil the film for you but the confrontation you're all waiting for, is filled with emotion and pleading that leads nowhere and almost feels like for nothing. Saoirse Ronan gives a heartbreaking performance. She's an actress I have always thought I would like as a person but her movies are mostly insufferable. ('The host', 'the lovely bones' and this are the only movies I can only think of where I don't want to throttle her) that being said, she is no doubt a frustrating character because of her strength. Because you know her fate, you end up cringing in the theater every time she stands up for herself because she's pushing the nail further into her own coffin and has no idea. You want to scream 'for survival just be quiet woman!!'. I don't know what that says about me. 😂 I can't say much about Margot Robbie Except she was good in the little she was given to do.

As a film standing on its own, watching with no knowledge of other period pieces or any idea of the history surrounding it - it's flat as a pancake.Credit where it is due though, the acting is great but - for me - David Tennant stole it when giving his passionate speeches to his congregation about how poisonous Mary was for the people BUT, he is classically trained and used to Shakespearean roles so, for him, this was probably a breeze. It's also worth noting his screen time is hardly even 5 minutes yet it was him who I remembered.The trailers give the impression it is mainly to do with the relationship between Mary and Elizabeth but don't go in expecting that either because, again, Margot Robbie (although great in it) isn't given much screen time either.Overall, given the hype surrounding this film, it can't be seen as anything but a disappointment which is a shame but - Kudos to the cast.",Mary Queen of Scots

Mary, a devout catholic whose life would have been so much easier if she weren't so devout, tells a protestant soldier that they will all go to the same heaven. Even more unbelievably she forgives Rizzio (Ismael Cruz Cordova) whom she caught in bed with her husband (Jack Lowden) on their wedding night because he ""can't help who he is.""

Hard to follow during long stretches of promise/double cross/dastardly plots a go go/to war or not to war, and when followed intermittently interesting.I left feeling even more admiration for Shakespeare: his distillation of the complexity and violence of Scottish history in Macbeth, with nary a nod to his or our modern sensitivities of the moment, is, in the context of reviewing this movie, as of comparing Duane Allman's solo in Crossroads, to my awkward, and slow version of Pipeline by the Ventures.",Mary Queen of Scots

The empowerment of both Queens comes across as not entirely significant. With both Queens seeking control, Mary hopes to take the throne of England and Scotland. But the courts of both Queens leave them hopelessly powerless at times. The best performances come from the two leading ladies not that the supporting cast is bad. Margot Robbie mirrors Mary in her performance as a complete opposite with a lot less to do, but nevertheless good in what she does do. There is a lovely scene when the two Queens finally catch screen time together, built up well with good anticipation. Shades of the memorable duo of De Niro and Pacino in heat. Between sheets Mary anxiously awaits for Elisabeth to show her face. The makeup artist has also done a phenomenal job with Margot Robbies face when Elisabeth is ill.

It doesn't know when it takes place. It is set in the 16th century but everyone seems to identify with the politics of modern day America. It is incredibly unsettling and takes you right out of the film. It appeared to be more of a ""this is how you should think"" rather than ""this is how it was"" type scenario. *Cinematography/Editing: It is a beautiful looking film and is cut together very well, so there are no complaints here. *Dialogue/Acting: Very authentic performances by Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie. Jack Lowden and Guy Pearce do a phenomenal job as well. Any time they don't dip into modern American culture is totally captivating. Some very dramatic performances and well written dialogue made this a fun watch. *Music/Sound: Very standard in this area. Not much to comment on. *Production Design/Special Effects: Wonderful work in these areas. The sets and locations were beautiful. Masterful work in the hair and make-up department. This was one of the more authentic feeling parts of the film.*Conclusion: ""Mary Queen of Scots"" was so very close to being one of the best films of 2018 if it had not been for the political climate of the current day getting in the way of authentic artistry.

This film should have used fictional characters and locales in a fictional time.One day I hope someone has the cajones to make a film about Mary's son, James VI, who undid all the sacrifice and suffering of his fellow Scots, in their struggle for freedom, to ultimately bind Scotland to London via the United Kingdom.",Mary Queen of Scots
160,mattclap28,Historically False / Well Acted,7,27 January 2019,"You can easily be caught in a crossfire of liking or really loathing this film. Honestly its going to depend if you like your period films factually correct or you just want a well acted story.Looking at the first part you will be disappointed. Where do you start? Well firstly Mary and Elizabeth never met face to face, their only correspondence through letter. Mary only went to England because she was exiled. Most importantly Elizabeth personally never wanted Mary executed. This though is the scripts fault either through interpretation of the novel or the direction of the film.Secondly however the acting. Saorise Ronan and Margot Robbie are excellent in their roles, giving grace and strength to two important female figures in history that changed the monarchy as we know it. The cast can also be misleading too as others have mentioned being very PC.The film itself though is still worth it and by no means is as bad as people say.

Of course, there is a fictitous meeting between the two queens, but no filmmaker who has tackled this subject has ever been able to resist that. I did wonder why everyone was dressed in black all the time, a bit more colour would have been nice. Also it was a pity that Mary's own words at her execution were not used, her dry comment to the executioners that she had never before had such grooms of the chamber to make her ready is better than anything a scriptwrier could think up. Nor do we see anything of Elizabeth's agonising over whether or not to sign the warrant for Mary's execution, nor her total meltdown afterwards. I thought the actor playing John Knox was particularly good, it was only when the credits rolled at the end that I realised it ws David Tennant. I blame the beard.",Mary Queen of Scots

165,cinemawithcj,Mary Queen of Scots - Cinema with CJ Review,6,26 January 2019,"Mary Queen of Scots may or may not be historically inaccurate, but it is definitely in need of work.Directed by Josie Rourke - a very productive director of the stage - Mary Queen of Scots marks the first feature film and while it has all the markings of great direction and theatricality, Mary Queen of Scots feels like it overstays its welcome, and generally unremarkable in the medium.Saoirse Ronan brings the titular queen to life, continuing being a damn fine force in acting. In fact all the performances here are fantastic, from Austrailian Margot Robbie doing her best as Elizabeth I to the always brilliant David Tennant in a role that while relevant to the story also feels entirely unnecessary.The problem is that while Mary Queen of Scots is full of brilliant political intrigue, it makes for a particularly dry and bland movie. Sometimes it gets bogged down with the want to be true to history while also trying to be engaging that it fits in a little bit of everything and not enough of something great. One or two scenes stick out as highlights but the rest unfortunately feel drawn out so much so that if you weren't interested in the history or snapped it by its opening, you're in for a slog.All the elements of the filmmaking individually hold strong, in fact if this doesn't win for both Best Costume Design and Best Hair and Makeup I will be surprised, because on the eyes this film is gorgeous in those regards.It just remains a shame that this movie pushes 2 hours but certainly feels better if it were much less. It doesn't help that TV has become a home for similar stories told in a much better format in a much more engaging style.Mary Queen of Scots probably would fare much better on the stage. Attention spans shouldn't be a criticism towards film, but it does feel like this very small film with the odd establishing shot and battle would have fared best in a theatre rather than a cinema. It just feels dry and drawn out and developed in not always the best way.CJ",Mary Queen of Scots
166,roguegrafix,Worst movie in years,1,17 February 2019,"This is seriously a bad film and the worst movie I've seen in years. Others have exposed the greatest lies (the queens never met, Mary's Irish accent etc.) so a few more.: The ""battle"" / ""ambush"" scene never happened -- Mary's forces NEVER engaged those of her half-brothers; Mary was besotted with Darnley. The film lays the blame for her setbacks on him when in fact Mary's judgment was impaired through her infatuation with Darnley. Mary was rash and weak and dependent on the clan chiefs for her rule--not the leader portrayed here..The film claims Mary's guilt in attempting to assassinate Elizabeth was never proven when in fact, Elizabeth had Mary's guilt in Mary's own handwriting.The PC indoctrination in the film is overwhelming and vomitful.

172,rubya,Distracted by the agenda,5,16 March 2019,"In order to enjoy a film fully, you need to have a certain degree of belief in it. You need to believe the characters, the story, the timeline.Unfortunately from very early on in the film you have a black person as a member of Elizabeth's court and English ambassador to Scotland and a woman of Asian origins as Bess of Hardwick, a noble English lady and Lady of the Bedchamber to Elizabeth.
I don't for one second question the acting abilities of both actors but this is supposed to be a historical drama based on true events with real people. It is distracting when from the start you know that in no way would there have been black or Asian noble people at Elizabeth's court (and indeed these real people were Caucasian English).
If a film can change history this much on the basics, just because today the world is much different, what else will they make up in this film?
Well you can have a Catholic Mary Queen of Scots have a cross dressing homosexual Italian private secretary, played by a Porto Rican actor, giggling like children in a serious situation.
I'm not sure a Catholic Queen would have been quite as progressive in the 1500s as the film makes out.I am all for diversity in films and there should be plenty of opportunities for this when creating interesting and powerful characters, but changing history is not right and made the whole film not believable.
Just like you wouldn't cast a Chinese person to play Martin Luther King in a biopic or make a film where Abraham Lincoln is a woman, don't make English noble people in the 16th century black or Asian for the sake of a personal agenda.The film itself and the story while not wholly accurate are interesting but badly let down by the above.",Mary Queen of Scots

174,ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM,QUEENS HIGH,5,22 April 2019,"QUEENS HIGHI cannot think of any more popular subject for movies, TV shows, plays and books than the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I in England and Mary in Scotland. The time period is almost a century long, from Henry's ascension to the throne in 1509 to Elizabeth's death in 1603. Before we get to the fictionalized version of their stories, let's look at the facts.Henry VIII came to the throne when he was only 17 years old. He married a Spanish princess, Catherine, who was Henry's deceased brother, Arthur's, wife (Arthur died at 15 and Catherine swore the marriage had never been consummated.) Henry went through a succession of wives in an attempt to father a male heir. When the Pope refused to allow him to divorce Catherine, Henry broke from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, bringing Protestantism to England. His marriage to Catherine produced a Catholic female, Mary Tudor, who reigned briefly after Henry's death but was succeeded by Elizabeth I, Henry's child by Anne Boleyn, his second wife, who reigned for forty-five years, but left no heir.Mary Queen of Scots' grandmother was Henry VIII's sister and therefore Mary and Elizabeth were cousins, once removed. In the tangled web of European royalty, this was not exactly a close relationship. More importantly, Mary was raised a Catholic and Elizabeth a Protestant. At that time, the religious affiliation of a monarch could determine whether a country remained Catholic or not. The 1500's saw the rise Martin Luther and the Reformation in Europe, the beginning of Protestantism.The story of Mary and Elizabeth has fascinated writers for almost five centuries. Elizabeth has been played on screen by every generation's great actress from Sarah Bernhardt to Cate Blanchett. Bette Davis played her twice, in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex and The Virgin Queen.Mary, also, has a long cinematic pedigree, dating from cinema's earliest days when Thomas Edison in 1895 made an eighteen second movie showing Mary's execution. In 1936, Katherine Hepburn played her in a John Ford film. In 1971, Vanessa Redgrave portrayed the doomed Queen while Glenda Jackson gave us a preview of her much lauded TV portrayal of Elizabeth I.Now, a new movie, Mary, Queen of Scots, is devoted to the relationship between the two monarchs and has given Saorise Ronon (Lady Bird) as Mary and Margo Robbie (I, Tonya) as Elizabeth the chance to put their marks on these iconic roles. British theatre director, Josie Rourke, makes her film directorial debut of a Beau Williamon (House of Cards (Netflix)) script.The performances of the two divas are very good, but, sadly, wasted in this plodding attempt to light a fire under this oft told story. The movie's sets and costumes are the best part of the movie, and credit must be given to the open casting, giving Adrian Lester the opportunity to play an English Lord who acts as an ambassador for Elizabeth to Mary.The problems start immediately with one of those written prologues we see in so many historical dramas. Whenever I see one of these prologues I want to shout at the screen - a movie should not seem but be! If a fact is important, make it part of the movie, a visual medium, even in its silent era.From there, the movie both tells us too little and too much. For example, it keeps referring to Mary and Elizabeth as 'sisters', which, if they were, would make their relationship very different. Also, the movie has Mary and other characters claim that she has a more legitimate claim to the English throne than Mary. Not true. It does show the importance of religion in the quarrel between the two Queens, but it does not make clear that, at that time, Scotland was a seperate, legitimate country from England.The movie revolves around Mary's marriages, first to an English Lord and then to a Scottish nobleman. She does have one child, James, by the Englishman. Elizabeth never married and we see the physical change she undergoes when she contracts smallpox, scarring her face and causing her hair to fall out. Both women find themselves alone in a court of men, all of whom think that they know better than a woman what is best for her and their country. The founder of the Presbyterian Scottish Church, John Knox (David Tennant), rails against Mary, preaching that a woman can never rule a country. Mary is betrayed by the men in her life, including her half-brother. Elizabeth is shown to be more successful because, as the script claims, she becomes more man than woman.When a country is ruled by a monarch, the monarch's children are not just fodder for tabloids, as they are today - no, having a child to ascend to the throne was one of the most solemn duties of a monarch. Mary succeeded; Elizabeth did not.While history shows that Mary and Elizabeth never met, no fictional version of their story can resist a meeting of the two protagonists. In this version, they meet in what looks looks like a 16th century laundromat, with semi-transparent sheets screening them from each other's view as they walk around in a kind of textile version of Orson Welles's House of Mirrors in The Lady From Shanghai. It doesn't work. Rourke is betrayed by her theatre background as she forgets that five minutes in movietime can seem like a lifetime - the cousins seem to spend an eternity walking among the sheets before coming face to face.A final word to anyone who wants to fictionalize this story in the future, forget the facts and follow the drama.",Mary Queen of Scots

Coupled with Margot Robbie's portrayal of Mary's cousin, Queen Elizabeth as a cartoon character, who garners no sympathy as a constant whiner, and turns over every ounce of her power to the scheming men around her. And Mary is no better, with scene after scene of starry blue-eyes gazing in to infinity with bravery, while she naively selects and submits to her drunken, debauched husband and trust of her flip-flopping brother, who connives to bring her down. What finished this film off for me was a gauzy curtain scene where the Queens have a showdown, despite the historical fact that they never met.

178,tomfeller,Yet another movie about Mary Stuart,6,9 May 2019,"When I read that there would be another movie about Mary Stuart (Saoirise Ronan), I wondered why. The character has been portrayed in several previous films, notably by Katharine Hepburn and Vanessa Redgrave. Elizabeth I is played by Margot Robbie, who has been preceded by Bette Davis, Jean Simmons, Glenda Jackson, Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, and Cate Blanchett among others. This version frames the story with Mary's execution in 1587 and recounts her story from her arrival in Scotland in 1561 when she is 19 years old and after her first husband, King Francis II of France, has died. This film takes the position that Mary and Elizabeth could have been friends if it were not for the men around them. The best performance is provided by an unrecognizable David Tennant (Doctor Who) as John Knox, and I admire Robbie for being willing to portray Elizabeth with her small pox scars. Ronan is good, as usual.
There are historical inaccuracies, of course, the most blatant being a face-to-face meeting between the two main characters. At the risk of being politically incorrect, I don't like casting actors of African or Asian descent as Scottish or English nobles in historical movies, although I have no objection in adaptations of Shakespeare's plays. David Rizzio (Ismael Cruz Cordova), Mary's secretary, is revealed as gay and Lord Darnley (Jack Lowden), Mary's second husband, as bisexual, and that they were lovers, which is, of course, pure speculation, although at least one historian argues that it really happened. Her third marriage to Lord Bothwell is barely mentioned On the other hand, I had no problem with Ronan's Scottish accent, although historians claim that she spoke English with a French accent, because she lived in France from the ages of 5 to 19. Overall, I did not think that the new movie added anything to our beliefs about Mary. It was nominated for Academy Awards in the makeup and costuming categories.",Mary Queen of Scots

That was definitely a poor decision in marketing, since ""The Favourite"" is clearly superior to this film. If you disagree please let me know though! Both films literally have 2 female lead actors and are historical pieces centered around cousins as well. Really weird and ironic. In this were seeing Mary trying to one-up or overthrow Elizabeth, so way too close to the other flims concept.So right off the bat we see Mary being walked to her execution, so that kind of threw me off from the start. If you know the historical relevance of the events then that wasn't a shock for you, but it probably would've hit a harder beat if they had left that until the end. Literally the rest of the film just doesn't do much, there's nothing extraordinarily special about it or memorable. Other than the fact that I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out if David Tennant was in this movie covered in a bush beard and wearing a jaunty hat. He literally looked like Michelangelo!We get good acting from our 2 leads, Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie. But if they were given a better script it could've been amazing. There's pretty good costume design as well, which is very important for a period piece. But again the story was not gripping and there's erratic time jumps smattered about in this that had me confused. There's also way too much ""on-the-nose"" symbolism here. Other than Mary and Elizabeth I didn't care for any of the characters, other than Rizzio whom I want justice for by the way!The only other things I have to say about this movie have to do with the camera work. It was very basic and utilized nothing innovative. Compared to ""The Favourite"" which had some of the best cinematography I've seen in a while, this movie is very forgettable.

Ronan is just terrific, she plays the part with no melodrama, she is just like a late 16th century Princess from France might have been, married at 16, widow at 18, she had seen how cruel, the politics of Religion could be. The supporting cast, well the men where not much, Darnley whimpered,David Rizzio was a fresh and new take on an intriguing character in Scottish history. The ladies in waiting to Mary were as one just wonderful. David Tennant chewed the screen at Knox.
But we go to the Elizabeth, I thought Robbie was to capricious and Cecil was not half as cruel and ugly a statesman as he should have been shown. I see some have complained about the meeting between the queens at the end, this for dramatic reasons had to be included. Other films on the subject have done the same.
All together I feel the touch of a female director has done this epic story full credit. it is a story about love, murder, a child, a husband, a wife's bravery on one side and envy, missed opportunity, a spinster afraid of life and ultimately a failure in the way Elizabeth died alone and the strength Mary found right at the end to endure as Royalty, of a life lived so well we still go back to her story.

Stylised costumes. Weapons 200 years ahead of their time. People getting brought up in France and somehow ending up with Scots accents.

Any job, especially that of Ambassador, who in this film is black, would require you to be a noble of some consequence. Historically, there were no Africans in the Nobility or serving in the court with of whome theimmediately has a white girl flirting with him. Silly.
And then we get to one of Elizabeth's ladies in waiting and presumably her main lady. These weren't simply hand maidens, they were Ladies of Noble Families. Don't recall any Asian family there either. Worse yet she's a bit of a sneaky snippy sulking Asian gal with a bad habit of talking back. Striking a blow for mouthy independent women I suppose.

233,jjcarr-49015,"Josie, Princess of PC",3,27 July 2020,"While I did know the basic history of Mary and Elizabeth, I knew little about this film before watching it so I was surprised to see a black actor playing a Tudor lord to be followed by an ethnically Chinese Bess of Hardwick. After that it was hard to take what followed seriously, not that it particularly deserves to be.
Director Josie Rourke stated that: ""I was really clear, I would not direct an all-white period drama."" In which case, why bother? Suppose she'd been offered the greatest script in history, covering the Nazi inner circle. Would she have turned it down unless she could have a Haitian Hess and a Ghanaian Göring? Somehow, I doubt it. I suspect she'd be happy with all-white baddies, provided they were white and heterosexual and cis. Now there were some Africans in Tudor England but they were servants or tradespeople not lords or ladies.
In a sense the director didn't make a period drama. It's ahistorical and not very dramatic, given a very dramatic subject.
Mary' life can be divided into three acts. Her first 19 years before she returns from France, her 6 tumultuous years as reigning queen and her final 19 years as Elizabeth's prisoner. The film basically covers only those middle 6 years.
A problem anyone telling Mary's story is the same as that facing a film about the Third Crusade. The two central protagonists never met. So, the movie's makers invent a farcically filmed one. Josie Rourke is a stage director and the scene which might have worked in a theatre struck me as ham-fisted on film.
Then the movie skips over the next 19 years to a rushed ending. It's a bit like a Hitler movie showing the run up to WW2 then skipping from the invasion of Poland straight to the bunker. I suspect the filmmakers were less interested in telling Mary's true tale than in getting two woke women together.",Mary Queen of Scots

Maybe it's because one of my hobbies is medieval recreation (so I'm used to blonde samurai, and African-American Vikings) but other than the first raised eyebrow about the English Ambassador's skin tone, that didn't bother me. What DID bother me is that they left out so much (such as Mary's years in exile/capitivity). If you're gonna moan about ""inauthenticity"" do it about REAL issues. Such as the reason that Elizabeth agreed -- or was tricked into doing so -- to have Mary executed was because Elizabeth's privy council were convinced that stuff like the Oxburgh hangings were secret messages to Mary's loyal supporters. That's NOWHERE in the movie. Heck, the entire time Mary's in England under guard by the Earl of Shrewsbury and his wife, Bess of Hardwick, is nowhere in the movie....
One of the reviews compared this to the 2018 _Robin Hood_ remake. And trust me, this movie is not *nearly* as bad (whether everyone at the Scots Royal court would have been wearing black? I dunno; but Mary probably would have at least initially, since she was a widow). That being said, it's not all that good either, being slow moving. And movies that make you dive into IMDB to play ""Who's that actor"" instead of paying attention to the plot? That's a problem. Although David Tennant (heavily disguised with a long beard) as John Knox is clearly having fun, a lot of the cast have this look on their faces of ""Why did I let my agent talk me into this?"" Oh, and for the reviewer whining about ""Where's the Stewart Tartan?"" Newsflash -- the costume people actually got THAT part right -- that's a much later concept than 16th century Scotland (and comes into play during the ""Bonnie Prince Charlie"" era of the *18th* century.

What surprised me was the extraordinary drama that developed around Queen Mary's choice of a first husband as well as the tension that had grown around the intrigue of her courtier and the trouble that caused trouble among her advisors.Without giving too much more away, see this film under any circumstances; it is a real winner in all phases.",Mary Queen of Scots

The meeting between the two is pure fiction but like Schillers play allows the story to come alive in a dramatic way. There are anyway huge gaps in their history that allows for some fictionalising about what might have happened.There is factual evidence that Mary was strong and clever but surrounded by poor and ambitious advisers in the pay of Elizabeth; that Darnley was bi sexual and immature and that Elizabeth was insecure and less courageous than reported but surrounded by clever and manipulative advisers.Almost a role reversal from any previous films or TV seriesThe film shows the politics and relationships from a woman's perspective and is a lot better for it.. definitely a film for the MeToo generation. The two leads give strong and charismatic performances especially Ronan in the title role and their is good support from the mainly British cast.Great first time direction and as you would expect from a historical film costumes and cinematography.

246,andyfindlay,Mary Queen of Scots (2019),8,24 January 2019,"At ground level this lavish retelling of the Queen of Scots, is a leverage for a set of excellent performances, but within its surprisingly violent theme and 'Game of Thrones' style approach, 'Mary Queen of Scots' excels into being an ultra stylish drama which strays from genre tropes and provides for a bloody good watch.At the heart of this period piece, Saoirse Ronan perfects her art of being unnoticeable excellent in practically everything. She is a wonderful actress, but it has become a given to expect a knock out performance from the Irish lead. Here proves to be no different, though she maybe unnoticeable excellent, but that's excellence all the same.Despite having a significantly less screen time to her co-star, Margot Robbie further proves she is a force to be reckoned with. After 2018's 'I, Tonya' it may have seemed as if she has peaked too soon, but fresh off that, Robbie delivers a standout performance which arguable steals the film from under Ronan's feet. However, impeccable casting on both parts.A contiguous issue that keep arising was the passing of time. Many months would pass from one scene to the next and the film would fail to acknowledge it. Very rarely were time stamps added to scenes meaning many jump forwards in time went unnoticed (until a piece of dialog would confirm plot points in the previous scene occurred several months ago).This does not mean the film does not deliver stand out scenes, there are many. With the climax being built up to the inevitable scene where the titular character finally meets her cousin Elizabeth. An exception scene which deserves to go down in cinematic history. A overwhelming sense of both pure joy with anxiety accumulated from that scene alone.What does stand out significantly more than other period pieces similar to this, is despite being the perfect character study it does not shy away from the darker side of the story. Potentially a crime 'Working Title Film's' previous film 'The Darkest Hour' is guilty of. This darker and grittier approach aids the enjoyment factor forcing this out from being just a run of the mill period piece.This did leave to a few scenes feeling daringly uneven. The split between the 'Game of Thrones' like violence and character development sometimes did not compliment each other as well as they could've leading to a slight clunky feeling on occasions.Regardless my endless gratitude is gained by the make-up and costume department. Along with gorgeous cinematography many scenes where picture perfect, and at times breathtakingly beautiful.",Mary Queen of Scots

The flow of the film and in-accuracy is frustrating. The casting of the main character was I thought fantastic although the fear of keeping true to the story was sad. It is a Feminist PC mess and the director seems to ""act"" like she is being risque but fails miserably in every aspect. Scenes that could have been beautifully crafted and mystical seem flat and one in particular I kept referencing to my wife as ""The curtain house"" as it had no relevance and no drama.Casting of actors who may have been best for the job but in no way accurate was also a mistake. I may seem to come across as ""racist"" but this also came from my highly educated wife who just so happens to be black. She felt the movie stole from their fight for equality but doing this.To anyone from the outside watching this, it may seem good and stylish.

This is pretty fanfiction about Elizabeth and Mary with pretty costumes and strong performances by the two lead women, but it doesn't compare to the 1971 version, thanks to the ferocious performance by Glenda Jackson in that one. My main issue with this film is that it's really tough to make Mary a heroine given she made a series of totally bone-headed decisions and was pretty much outplayed by Elizabeth on every front, despite this film trying to make the major plot points more balanced.

It's beautifully shot and Ronan and Robbie do their damn best, but are given little material to salvage. Mary is historically recast as a progressive, tolerant, feminist queen with a fierce and singular ambition for the English throne (so she can do good and stuff). Despite her conviction she's also portrayed as somewhat schitzophrenic albeit I gather unintentionally. Often times she oscillates between kindness and threats, sometimes within the same sentences. Her interactions with Elizabeth were especially absurd in this way and I felt bad for Ronan trying to rescue these scenes.Overall, I felt dumber about the history of these fascinating rulers having watched this rendition, a shame considering how incredible both of their accomplishments truly are.The anachronistic casting was a massive distraction and unlike thoughtful (and accurate) works like Hamilton, here it serves no purpose other than the director's self indulgence.The costumes look cool and the cinematography is great.

It may not (pretty much certainly isn't) entirely historically accurate/factual but it features good performances from the main cast and some impressive settings and so its watchable from that point of view. I thought it was quite gripping in the scenes featuring both of the distant warring family members and I thought it featured some rather impressive examples of cinematography. Also, I thought David Tennant gave a quite powerful performance, even though you don't see him much as such but moreso in terms of his speeches heard by a crowd of people on more than one ocassion. I feel his voice is instantly recognisable and I'd say him and Saoirse Ronan gave the most memorable performances, although Margot Robbie pulls her weight too. Elements of the plot may be a bit fanciful but I found it quite a gripping and interesting watch regardless.Also, I feel I can't review it without mentioning that there are some sex scenes and partial nudity present. It would be a slightly awkward watch for younger people if with parents and it did add a bit of a salacious element to it, which perhaps wasn't entirely necessary but for the most part its a gripping watch.",Mary Queen of Scots

I know it is not historically accurate but I think there's enough ""truth"" to just get by. The husbands are correct and the portrayal of them, as are the deaths. Sure, the meeting never happened but I can forgive that. The sheets or whatever they were though were unnecessary. I liked the inclusion of more ethically diverse characters too. Personal opinion as I don't have a strong stomach, but I hated the death that occurred when Mary was pregnant. It made me feel physically ill. But again, that's just me.

266,enilorak77,I simply loved this movie,10,11 February 2021,"Don't let negative reviews stop you from watching this movie. It is exceptional and beautiful. I have never seen anything like it before.Mary Queen of Scots is a brilliant movie in every way; beautiful screenplay, engaging script, a gorgeous soundtrack and great acting. The pacing is perfect and unlike many other historical movies, all the characters stand out with voices of their own. I especially liked how Mary and her ladies in waiting were portrayed. They are young and act like young girls do, but not in an over the top and silly way. It is obvious that though young, these women are mature and intelligent. Another thing I liked was how outright the movie is about how it must have been to rule as a woman in a patriarchal society, and it doesn't gloss over the difficulties that these two queens faced in that regard.The scene where the two queens meet has an almost dreamlike quality to it. There is a certain improbability to the fact that they meet in a washhouse. To me it's symbolic more than anything. Mary follows Elizabeth through gauzy curtains of linen, saying she wishes to see her face, but Elizabeth tries to avoid her. It's a reflection of the historical accounts of how Elizabeth always tried to avoid meeting Mary while Mary wanted to meet her.People who rave about historical inaccuracy because of this meeting seem to forget that they're watching a movie intended to entertain, not a documentary. This movie takes us into the thoughts and feelings of these historical figures, trying to envision a story that can never be told in complete truth because the only people who could tell it are long dead. But in my opinion this movie presents an extremely nuanced and realistic take on the events.And to all the little trolls in the comments who are so eager to downvote this movie because of historical inaccuracy and «wokeness»; a simple Google search is enough to debunk those statements. Mary could indeed speak Scottish and it is a historical fact that Darnley and Rizzo shared a bed, just to name a few.Tbh, reading the comment section here is wild. Why is it that people have such a problem with representation? I think it was handled really well in this movie. They managed to do it in a way that seemed natural and believable. Maybe it's not historically correct but this is a movie for a modern audience and as such it should keep modern standards.",Mary Queen of Scots

So incredible performances, an amazing script and an incredible story, this movie had everything to be a nine for me. It was almost a masterpiece. But it is a historical film. A historical film that is historically inaccurate can't be a masterpiece, not even near considered one. It aces me, but it's true.

Artistic license was definitely used. I had an idea of how the movie would be and it was far from what was in my head. As I have a love of history I enjoyed watching an interpretive ode to both Queens. Who knows maybe they did meet in secret?
I think the depiction of both Elizabeth and Mary is far from what they were like in real life. Elizabeth was strong willed and had a fiery temper - which is why she reigned for so long. Mary wanted to be a queen have love and eventually become Queen of both England and Scotland, she was a romantic and that led her down a dangerous path. It's a shame that she wasn't able to see that. Isn't it weird how Elizabeth ruled and her mother was executed and James eventually ruled and his mother was also executed!

In Scottish schools she is taught as a heroine and I am worried this is not portrayed in this way. Like Mel Gibson badly depicting another Scottish hero I will not be watching this film to find out.

The plot seems slightly convoluted with a ton of subplots happening in the middle but then begins to smooth out as the latter half of the film commences. With strong performances from Saoirse Ronan (who I love), Margot Robbie, and that god of an actor David Tennant (In his glorious beard), it brings the level of the film to a higher standard. I feel like it had more potential but as a passable film it does it's job.

This version has so many axes to grind that it irritated me. Visually it is stunning, and the trials of women in a man's world very true if I could only get past all minorities cast as English and Scottish courtiers, which broke the spell of accepting this film as the reality of 16th century Britain, where blood was the tie that bound our nation, they may as well have been wearing pink flamingos on their heads, they stood out in neon as anachronistic. Secondly Darnley was bisexual but the gay theme thoughout was in the way it was handled another anachronism, putting speeches about 'being true to your nature, which is all that matters,' into Mary's mouth ( very shocked she'd have been) seems shoehorned into the script, no-one in their right mind would say to someone who had just slept with their husband and being counter to the Christianity and doctrinal divisions and allegiances that are or were at the heart of this situation. It's also a rather satanic thing to say, if we are all true to our natures, half of us would be murderers of the first person to truly anger us before we even reach adulthood.
So much about this film was nauseating. But the art direction was superb, it is ravishing to look at, when not anachronistic, the scenery of Scotland looks utterly magnificent, the performance of Mary Queen of Scots was touching and believable.

If you weren't a man-hating feminist before, it could turn you one; the men surrounding both queens had no integrity, and were such manipulative, two-faced, vile woman haters, it made me seethe.
It was fantastically directed, produced, edited and acted; I mean I never thought I could ever detest David Tenant, but in this I loathe the character he's portraying.
Margot Robbie, as Queen Elizabeth, and Saoirse Ronan, as Queen Mary, endeared me to them with their portrayals of strong, amazing, determined women in a men's world.
You absolutely have to watch this film. I enjoyed The Favourite, I loved Glass, but this was an incredible dramatised retelling of historic events at its best ... in my view anyway.
I'd happily watch it again ... although I suspect I'd still leak a few more tears as I watched history (with a little artistic licence) unfold before me on the big screen once more.Somehow I forgot to mention costumes, make-up and hair.

Both Saoirse Ronan as Mary and Margot Robbie as Elizabeth deliver believable, compelling performances. For me it checked off all the boxes: beautiful and stunning cinematography, proper historical costumes, dramatic court scenes and palace intrigue as the movie marches toward Mary Queen of Scots final dramatic scene. Very fine rendition by director Josie Rourke though I think the viewer would understand and enjoy the sequence of events much more just by reading, say, the wikipedia bio of Mary. In real history way too much going on and way too many arguments amongst historians about too many things regarding Mary. Rourke does take some very minor license with casting and according to some the accents are not perfect, as if they expected Saoirse (as Mary who was raised in France) to be spitting out Scottish dialect as if she were Bobby Burns. The movie naturally has to discard, refine and distill piles of intrigue, movements and events concerning Mary. Josie Rourke does a fine job.

314,ritafair,Once I gave up believing this was about Mary and Elizabeth...(mild spoilers),4,3 March 2021,"...I was free to try to enjoy this movie. I enjoyed parts but I had to bite my tongue through a great deal of it. I resent the opportunism of using famous characters to sell a movie with an agenda that has nothing to do with history. If you're going to fictionalize a story, go all the way and create fiction characters. The settings were good, as were the costumes. The story was okay but sometimes became confusing as huge chunks of time were condensed in a few scenes. All the Scots were bearded, had long hair and shouted which made it hard to distinguish among them. Mary was well-acted and engaging and Elizabeth's role was as well played as possible given a bad script. Making Elizabeth into a clown caricature was graceless and unfair. This was supposed to enhance the contrast between the two queens--the one youthful and beautiful all the way to her death, and the other hideous and a survivor but at great cost. My reaction was a kind of horrified disbelief which deflected from the dialogue and the drama of their meeting--a meeting which never actually occurred.",Mary Queen of Scots
315,BalconySeats,Ignorance is Bliss,4,6 July 2019,"Artistic license can be a tricky thing when it comes to actual history. The more you know about the story of Mary Stuart, the less you'll like this move. The misportrayal of both Bothwell and Rizzio weakened the plot to no purpose, making two pivotal events seems no more meaningful than misplaced commas. Darnley, on the other hand, has in every telling of this saga managed to avoid fictional rehabilitation and remains a ne'er-do-well. The best part of this reimagining is Elizabeth I's struggle to deal with the emotional and political fall-out of the queen of Scotland. Btw, they never met in real life but the theatrical lure is so overwhelming that most plays and movies can't resist the temptation.",Mary Queen of Scots

As a result, two of the most interesting and powerful women in History appear in this film as powerless, boring, tortured, insulted and controlled by the men in their royal courts. I am sure this is supposed to be a feminist film that tries to send the message if it were not for men, Mary and Elisabeth would have worked it out, but it utterly fails. Instead, It makes you wonder if these Queens were anything like the figurative Mary and Elizabeth in the film, why did the history bother to even keep a note of their name. Does Queen Elisabeth I, the female sovereign who changed the course of our world and civilization really need a feminist director to re-tell her story? And how is she presented in the film? She plays with horses, she makes flowers from ribbons and she just agrees to whatever her male counselors say! As a result of this chaos, the viewer does not understand why anyone does anything in the film, and the characters never develop properly.

321,ben-345-739716,Glenda & Vanessa did it better,6,27 January 2019,"In the 70s when I was quite young I adored the romantic sweep of the Jackson/Redgrave Mary Queen of Scots with its is brilliant tear-jerking John Barry score. Later I realised it was not a great film, but it does always have movement and conflict on the screen - mad kings galloping, Queens shouting, lutes getting broken. It was pretty unhistorical but at least it attempted an answer to the glaring enigma of Mary's life, the colossal failure of judgement that blights any attempt to portray her as a rational sympathetic person - why did she marry Bothwell just weeks after Darnley's murder? - by depicting a previous romantic relationship between the two of them, prior to the murder (for which there is at least some historical evidence) and showing Bothwell as a caddish charismatic Rhett Butler-like figure. Here there is none of that, and Bothwell is a particularly dour member of a platoon of black clad courtiers. It beggars belief that Mary allows him to rape her with her ladies in waiting standing outside. This makes a nonsense of all the feminist historical re-engineering that is done earlier in the film. But story and drama take second place to ideas here - this director was busy interpreting the script as she might with Shakespeare, but the trouble is this script was nowhere near ready to film. The structure is so slack, there is no exposition. Nothing has been set up before Mary is randomly washed up on the beach like Viola in Twelfth Night. Some positive points - personally, I had no problem with the race-blind casting. I liked the idea of Lord Randolph being black - it makes him an outsider and suitable emissary between the two courts. With Darnley I liked the fact that this time his father Lennox appears, pulling his strings. Whether Darnley was bisexual is certainly debatable, though the idea that he had to kill Rizzio to cover this up is a crude intervention. Saoirse Ronan has a fascinating face (not at all the 16th century idea of beauty though) and puts across the emotion despite some rather strained dialogue. And I did like the way Elizabeth was conceived, having to consciously give up her very gender, as she admits, to keep the Crown. Unfortunately Robbie is no Glenda Jackson, too pretty for a start, doesn't have the voice of a Queen. The whole point is that Mary should be the better-looking of the two. Too much time was spent on drone shots of Highland landscapes, spectacular but pretty recognisably wrong: Glencoe *was* not the scene of major incidents in Mary's life. The effect of these landscapes and the ruined castles (instead of the rennaisance elegance of Holyrood Palace) make it a Westeros version of history. The one battle scene at the bridge is at the wrong part of the story, too early, and based on a frankly crude suggestion of England funding an uprising by Moray. However having *one* battle is in fact an improvement on the 1973 film. What I can't understand is why both films skip so many well documented real adventures from Mary's life: her escape from Borthwick Castle disguised as a man, the showdown on Carberry Hill, imprisonment at Lochleven Castle and Island and escape again, the battle of Langside. There's enough real melodrama in Mary's life to make a mini series, not just a film. The enigma of Mary will always continue to fascinate, and if it fascinates you, go and see this film. But then go back to your DVD of the Hall Wallis production. (Hal Wallis, remember, was the producer. In the days when films had *one* producer, not a committee of them. One of his previous credits is Casablanca...)",Mary Queen of Scots

330,glennabello-01524,What were they thinking?,1,27 February 2019,"I generally enjoy period pieces, as I have a fond interest in history. However, ""Mary Queen of Scots"" was quite challenging to watch, as it had very little to do with actual events in the 16th Century. Here's what they got correct: 1) Mary was married to Francis of France when she was 15 years old and ended when he died three years later 2) Elizabeth did contract small pox in 1562 when she was 29 years old. However, the disease did not disfigure her as depicted in the film (in which she looks as though she was winning a backwards track race until she fell down) 3) England had changed from Catholic to Protestant during the 16th Century and the question of Royal Succession existed.The movie was 2 hours and 4 minutes of excruciating pain and politically correct diversity thrown in to confuse the hapless viewers who might believe that ""this is how it was"". There was an English black ambassador to the Scottish Court, an Oriental handmaiden and a mixed race (or Pacific Islander) minstrel among the historic fakery sprinkled throughout this clinker (such as Mary and Elizabeth meeting, which never happened, and Elizabeth being subservient to Mary). And, somehow, enough viewers thought that this was great theater to give it a combined 6.3 out of 10 star rating. I guess that legalized pot sales are taking its toll!My best advice, as an alternative to this ""gem"", is to read some real history about this period when England was emerging as a preeminent nation in Western Civilization.

334,CosmoFelani,"Stop complaining about historical inaccuracies. The problem is, it's just plain boring",5,27 January 2019,"The complaints about historical inaccuracy are overblown. I think it's clear the film's makers have not set out to create an accurate historical record. They are interested in the theme of women in positions of power and how they deal with the constant efforts of the men around them to influence and/or control them. So what if they made up a probably fake meeting between the two women (anyway, there's no proving that such a meeting did not take place) in order to flesh out this idea? And the culturally diverse courtiers are just a funny little extra head-nodding to the cultural perspective of today, by which the film makers are obviously telling their story. So cut them some slack ... it's story-telling, for crying out loud.It's just not a very well-told story. They didn't really make any effort to take a close look at what forces - cultural and otherwise - were at work to make the relationship between these two women so problematic, or that made their lives so intolerable. They really boil it down to the meddling of the hard-hearted men around them, and the fact that it's lonely at the top (which is true regardless of gender). But the men are portrayed as such mediocre and incompetent blowhards that the idea they could in any way outwit or manipulate these two strong women seems ludicrous. If they were trying to tell the story of two remarkable women and how they struggled to rule in a man's world, or maybe the story of what history might have looked like if women had been allowed to rule by women's rules instead of men's, they didn't try very hard. It would be an interesting story to tell.",Mary Queen of Scots

The fact that black and Asian actors portrayed historical figures was weirdly a perfect idea, in that these are actors and they are performing in a theatrical production. Then, I could sit back and really enjoy it. It portrayed pretty accurately the point of view intended.
Throughout the whole movie, I was wanting to yell out loud, Baby James is the next King of England and so is the UK created! And he had the Bible translated into English so that all could read the Great Book. Very Protestant.
Very interesting take on the story and yes, I admit, very feminist in mood.

339,opheliac306,I liked it... but only just,5,23 August 2019,"I feel as though I'm simply going to echo hundreds of other reviews here... I wanted to like this movie, and to an extent I do- but the numerous historical inaccuracies were its downfall. I am no history genius myself but even I, a self-proclaimed ignoramus, know my history well enough to know that nearly everything shown in this movie is entirely wrong. In fact, this would have been better off as a movie about two fictional queens. The content itself can't really be faulted, but it is not an accurate telling of Mary and Elizabeth. Don't even get me started on Mary's accent...And then there's the PC-ness... I'm all for diversity in media. I think social justice is important in every shape or form. A black girl cast as Ariel in The Little Mermaid? Why not! A black James Bond? Brilliant! I'm also not heterosexual myself, so more non-straight representation? Fantastic! However... Mary Queen of Scots was NOT the movie to dish out all this diversity. It just wasn't. It's historically inaccurate and feels like deliberate pandering. ""Ooh look at how progressive we are for having black and asian actors in our movie!"" That would be terrific if it wasn't for the fact that it's astoundingly inaccurate.And then, as soon as the pace of the movie felt like it was picking up... it ended. I don't even know what happened. I felt like I spent the whole time waiting for something to happen and it never did.On a more positive note however, Margot Robbie gave an outstanding performance as Elizabeth. She's one of my favourite actresses, always delivers 100% and does an amazing job playing a broad range of different characters. Hats off to her for not being afraid to play an 'ugly' role. Saoirse Ronan's range is also always a joy to watch.All in all; visually pleasant to watch, a good strong cast of talented actors, but it left so much to be desired and frankly it's just a bit of a let-down. This movie certainly isn't the worst I've ever seen and I would probably watch it again sometime, but it left a lot to be desired.

It doesn't really matter if the movie follows historical fact to the letter. As other movies have shown, Elisabeth 1, Catherine the Great, and even The Tudors series, the history of women in power is documented in less favourable ways than their male counterparts. Therefore, filling in the blanks spaces is completely by the rules, especially since this movie is clear from the beginning in choice of cast and costume that it isn't meant as a depiction of absolute truth, but a description of what it might have been through the eyes of a woman and a queen who had the world, her world, hanging in the balance through the control of men.It's a great movie because it shows what could be accomplished if we ie. women, don't hold each other back.It is with happiness that I see Saoirse portray a strong female monarch with intensity and conviction.

That modern issues of #MeToo, Brexit and Scottish Independence have echoes in 450 year old historical events should be of interest to everyone, and the inclusion of black and Asian faces in the cast merely underlines the idea that we could easily be watching a drama about events today.

342,julievanrijsewijk,"Amazing visuals, great acting",7,18 February 2019,"To give give this movie only a few stars due to its historical inaccuracy would not do it justice.Amazing camera work, fantastic costumes, formidable landscapes: The visual appeal of Mary, Queen of Scots should not be disregarded. Sure, the movie proposes some post-modernistic version of history, but if you're not too annoyed by historical inaccuracy, the colourful cast and powerful female protagonists are actually an enjoyable change. The protagonists are formidable actresses and rounded, well-written characters with strong, flawed personalities and questionable motives.The dialogue was a bit slow and unnatural, although theatrical dialogue is a common main ingredient in costume dramas. Usually, I am not a fan of non-linear story telling, but I can admit that it worked in this case, since the plot was already known beforehand.In short, I would definitely suggest watching this movie if you don't intend to watch it as a historic retelling but enjoy amazingly detailed costumes, mighty landscapes and fantastic acting.",Mary Queen of Scots

Is the use of token diversity in gender and color the only way youth of today will sit through a British historical drama? If I saw the film in slow mow, I might find more places to insert humor. Perhaps Mary Q as she approaches the block to depart with her head had turned to the camera and said ""I picked the wrong day to give up sniffing glue."" Now that movie, I would give a 10.",Mary Queen of Scots
346,tarakate,An enjoyable historical drama,9,4 January 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed MQOS even with its one or two ''inaccuracies.'' I thought the meeting of the two Queens was rather moving. I read the reason why that scene was added; author, Dr John Guy came across letters pertaining to the two Queens meeting, or were planning to meet which intrigued me. Also, the Queens meeting has been played out in Friedrich Schiller's ''Maria Stuart'' play, so I wasn't bothered by it as most of what we're told about re:history isn't factually true anyway. I think it's best to keep an open mind when it comes to history. Saoirse Ronan being the star of the film, gave an emotional, powerful performance as Mary Stuart. Her accent was on point also, as the Old Scots dialect she's speaking in the film is actually similar to Old Irish Gaelic which is why so many are saying they hear Irish come through. A linguistics expert talks about this on a video on YouTube. French would of only influenced her Scots dialect some-what, not fully, and Ronan does speak some French in the film for that reason ! Margot Robbie was just okay as QE1, and I personally think Robbie doesn't suit period dramas. The cinematography is glorious, as is score by Max Richter. I thought Josie Rourke did a fine job for her directorial debut. The weakest part of the film was the script...would of been better done by a female writer, and perhaps the slow pacing, though not uncommon for a historical drama.",Mary Queen of Scots
347,hammit,The Best Queen Mary/Queen Elizabeth Period Film So Far!,8,21 December 2018,"I just got back from seeing this film (it is only playing at one theater here in Knoxville, TN) and I really enjoyed it! I didn't find it to be as boring as some other movies from this time period, this was mostly due to th me acting of the film's main characters Mary Queen of Scots and Queen Elizabeth. Saoirse Ronan's timing, emotion, and delivery of her lines really made me sympathize with Mary's story. At the same time, you could see a lot of parallels in Queen Elizabeth's story that really connected the two in a unique way. Obviously, Saoirse Ronan is playing the lead and does a fantastic job, but we get to see Margot Robbie play a role in Elizabeth that we don't typically see her in (one that really showcases her dramatic acting talent). She does a fantastic job as well, and almost steals the show! The fact that they had to use prosthetics to make her appear less attractive is a compliment to her beauty, but she is much more than just a pretty face. I won't get into the plot (because I hope if you're reading this you'll go see the movie), but I felt pretty moved and satisfied when the credits rolled. That is saying a lot coming from me because I am very picky when it comes to what I'll pay $10 to see in a theater these days. It does have a few social issues in it, but they are relevant to the plot and the movie does not obnoxiously shove a political agenda or social justice in your face (nor does it sacrifice a good plot for it). It wasn't too much and it was relevant to the story. The costumes, sets, and visuals are awesome! I also enjoyed the cinematography. Overall, in my opinion, this movie is worth the ticket price and is also one that I will purchase when it is released on Blu Ray!",Mary Queen of Scots

I think Margot Robbie has the right look for Elizabeth but keep in mind Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn and you see how lackluster Robbie's portrayal was. Saoirse Ronan was ok but to young and modern to play Mary Stuart. She didn't behave as a powerful woman, why on earth would she choose a wimp like Darnley maybe for his pretty hair?I liked Riccio the minstrel the most because he has charm and beauty and was easy on the eyes and ears.

This is such a weak, denatured telling compared to the more glorious 1971 version; and yes, admittedly it was based on Maxwell Anderson's play. But it was precisely Anderson's language that gave the 1st go-around such dramatic fireworks. This one is a lame, telegrapher version that tailors the story to the camera; and similarly, panders to PC-ness by casting so many minorities in the Scot and English courts. REALLY? It is so distracting and a travesty on history and does a disservice to the paying movie-goer by feeding into that ""casting diversity"" BUT WHOLLY FALSE Representation, of historical fact. The hairdos of the 2 queens are quite silly and again, dressing all the men in BLACK and just giving color to the queens' costumes betrays such self-conscious techniques that they are all doing these FOR THE CAMERA, not in the interests of historical accuracy.

363,allibatch,Acting was superb,2,19 October 2019,"While I have sympathy for Mary QoS and the lessons the cousins learned about marriage, I find the movie to be far less historical, far more fiction. Fiction because of the gushing portrayal of Mary's purity who was indeed plotting to claim the English throne. Fiction because jealousy is cited here as the reason for E's destruction of Mary. But Elizabeth was a consummately skilled monarch, her England profoundly traumatized by the brutal dark-age style terrorism Bloody Mary had just dealt her subjects. Elizabeth provided the peace of tolerance. Mary QoS while Catholic and professing religious tolerance in Scotland, showed brutality in the Highlander massacre; she proved herself a puppet of religious faction and ill prepared to rule England. Elizabeth knew this.
So the film is lavishly produced, and the acting superb, hence the 2 stars. But the direction and score is way over the top and its content insultingly simplistic to any thinking person. It would have been less misogynistic a film to portray Mary as being brought down by poor council and novice skill in a complex political era of budding separation of church and state, rather than transmuting the monarchs' femininity as primary to their actions.",Mary Queen of Scots

I actually turned it off with the last 45 minutes remaining.Why?This film is so grossly inaccurate that it is cringe-worthy in its pretense of being a historical period drama.I understand that Hollywood and other movie studios take certain liberties in presenting a story. However, this is little more than a ""politically correct"" rewriting of history.From the ""inclusive"" cast to peculiar modern sexual subplots, this film completely hurts the underlying story. Apparently, the director thought that it would be prudent to change a primarily English and Scottish characters in the story and make them more ""diverse.""I suspect that the director must have felt that it was quite ""inclusive"" to have black, Hispanic and Asian actors to replace the English and Scottish historical figures. In addition, the director must have felt that it was important to rewrite historical heterosexual characters as LGBT characters in an apparent attempt to insinuate ""normalcy"" for them at that time (which cannot be further from the truth).This movie is a gross injustice to the story of Mary the Queen of Scots and the very racial, ethnic and orientation groups that they attempt to ""help.""This movie wasn't worth renting.",Mary Queen of Scots

I am not one who picks apart a movie because it differs from a book. I go to see a film because I like the story it may tell. It is one thing to nitpick a film because this portrayed character strays from the written character. I mean Daryl isn't in the Walking Dead Comics, but he adds to the show because of something called FICTION. Zombies are not coming to get you.This is a story about REAL people in HISTORY, CENTURIES AGO, so WHY does everything made today have to incorporate so much of the norm today. Tell the story the way it happened. You want someone to play the part that will draw ticket sales, I get it. Margot and Saoirse are great for these parts, some of the others not so much. Did the casting directors just give up, or are they trying to push us into thinking ""yeah these choices are ACCURATE"". I am not a history buff, but even I know this is just someone trying to appease a lawyer for an actor/actress complaining they didn't cast me because ""wha wha wha"". Just because you can do an accent doesn't mean your right for the part. Can we get a Russian guy to play Bruce Lee in a Fist of Fury remake? Sure, but will anyone be convinced that was the right choice. NO. I sure didn't think Matt Damon was Asian.Hollywood say ""F U"" to the creative license when it comes to a HISTORICAL FILM. Save it for the Sci-Fi. You can get the scenic countryside and the costumes right, why can't you get the STORY RIGHT.

To judge this historical nonfiction film in this light while others such the likes of Ridley Scott or Sam Mendes are applauded seems a bit unfair.At times the pacing was a bit off, and we are quite far removed from much of the combat and warfare that plagued this time. While it is unfair to judge the film on its inaccuracies it wouldn't be far fetched to say this long journey could have borrowed a bit more from it's subject matter in the regard of the battlefield.TLDR: Sick of seeing reviews taking this as a literal biopic.

There were some scenes that I appreciated a lot for how they were shot and how they managed to get a certain emotion across. That being said, I did not like the narrative they were trying to push.First of, I think what many people noted is that they were trying to be very inclusive in this movie. They tried to include people of colour and of different sexual/gender identities. In general, that is obviously important but it did feel as if they only did it so that they could shove it into the faces of critics. I think the point people miss that this is still essentially a story about white people. If you want to argue that there are not enough POC characters in a movie, why not stop making movies about white people?Which brings me to they way they portrayed Mary Stuart. What I did like is that they showed Mary and Elizabeth as contrasting characters: Mary's downfall was that she was too passionate, Elizabeth's that she was not passionate enough.What I didn't like is that they put worth on their actions. The focus was on Mary who I believe I was supposed to admire for being so outspoken or whatever. To me she came off as arrogant and self-righteous and I constantly found myself empathising with more Elizabeth, who was portrayed as more and more pitiful, but at least I could understand her motivation. Mary Stuart to me was a Mary Sue, whose biggest flaw was that She Was Too Bold!Also, something I will never understand is the casting choice. Why choose an Irish and an Australian actress? If you already make bold choices like that, why not choose a French actress to play Mary? A French accent would have made more sense than the ""Scottish"" one we got to hear.Again, I do not hate the movie because there were moment I liked, but in retrospect I think that the majority of those moments featured Elizabeth and I'm pretty sure that wasn't the point.",Mary Queen of Scots

Both Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie are prematurely cast. They're insanely good actresses and as I long as they're working they keep improving. Yet, given their inexperience, they made a huge effort which showcases their passion and will to learn and dived deeply into the characters. Saoirse's caliber is shown in many scenes from crying scenes to scenes where she shows the utter determination of a monarch. My most favourite scenes were the ones she didn't have any lines. She conveyed so many emotions with just facial expressions. Luckily the director saw that too and we got plenty of them. Margot Robbie's performance was more internalised/esoteric. She portrayed a fragile queen with adequacy and dare I say excellence in a few scenes. Her last close ups near the end were breathtaking. Both leads did a good job. And I loved their eyes. The supporting cast on the other hand was from inadequate to completely awful at times. Definitely undirected. James felt more like aquaman than a historical figure in particular.
Scriptwise, I couldn't believe it was written from the writer that gave us the excellent dialogue in house of cards. It was solid but sometimes it couldn't resist the forced feminist quotes and gay friendly dialogue which is admirable when you see it in movies who take place in modern times but in a period piece it's a little extravagant.

We know she lived in France, she said that, so the odd sentence in French wasn't necessary to remind us, if that is what it was intended to do.I didn't learn anything from the film really but it was an alright watch.

395,Dr_Graham_Barkley_OBE,I feel ill...,1,28 January 2019,"Hello everyone. I am paid to watch films in a quality control role for a major global broadcaster. Therefore I watch a whole gamut of different stuff that I wouldn't normally watch on my own time. A lot of it just breezes over me like farts in the night but sometimes I am so moved by a film that I am forced to try to impart my experience on others. Some of you might think ""OMG, what an amazing job! Second only to being a captain beer taster for a brewery or chief crisp muncher for a major food manufacturer!"" Oh my friend, you'd be so wrong. You see, I can't turn it off, can't look away or leave the cinema. Sometimes I feel like that droog out of a Clockwork Orange who has his eyes wired open and is forced to watch films he finds deeply unpleasant. I hold it against my employers but keep it secret. One day they'll pay...Mary Queen of Scots is a film that has moved me so much I have to communicate it to you. I found the film wanting on many levels. The biggest question I have I how did this director get to make this film? What financier / producer would say ""Oh I know, lets get someone really inept to make a really rubbish film and lose loads of money."" Whoever it was deserved to lose that money. If i were the director I would be so embarrassed. There are people working in telesales that would have avoided the pitfalls that she stumbled into. Maybe they should get the chance and she should work in telesales?Now, lets get on to the reasons that this film is unwatchable. Basically, it's the PC stuff and the story line. I'm going to jump in at the deep end and say something quite contentious here. There were little or no ethnic minorities in Britain in the 1500's. How do I know this? Because Britain's diversity has happened in my and my fathers lifetime. But this film has succumbed to a bizarre social agenda and air brushed them in. Every time I saw someone who wasn't of north western European decent my mind was completely taken off the movie and reminded of this modern day social agenda. In this time of being offended, I found it deeply offensive. Ok, so the music was alright if a bit uninspired, the costumes quite good and the setting also okay. But the story (when I wasn't distracted by the PC casting) was a bucket of manufactured, fermented pigs urine and was not historically accurate. No, sorry, pigs urine has a redeeming feature, you can use it a fertiliser, it was worse than pigs urine because there was nothing redeeming about it. I'd like to remind the director - you do know that people are going to attempt to watch this don't you?
Some of you may think that the combined skills of Margot Robbie and Sharon Ronan (Sharon is English for her Irish name, I think) drag this film out of the offensive / farce fire. You'd be wrong. Margot used to be in then Australian soap Neighbours didn't she. I used to thing, great face, but unfortunately all the acting skills of a medium density concrete block. I have to hand it to her though, she made it all the way to Hollywood where she mixes with the stars, gets paid loads, has a pretty face and all the acting skills of a medium density concrete block. Don't get me wrong, if there was a film about the life of a medium density concrete block she'd be perfect for the role, but I think she'd turn it down for fear of being typecast.
I think it was the filmmaker Luis Banuel who said ""Sometimes watching a movie is a bit like being raped."" Whilst I can't claim to have been physically violated by this film I definitely feel like I've just woken up in the back of a mark 2 Ford Cortina to find Fred West grinning at me.",Mary Queen of Scots

The two lead rolls are splendidly well acted, especially Mary herself, as played by the fresh faced Saoirse Ronan. Boy has she got venom, and bravery.

Queen Elizabeth is made to look like the mad hater and queen of hearts from Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland and spends most of the movie worrying about her appearance and her barren womb.

What some have decried as historical inaccuracies (oh no black and brown people! the horror!), realistically just come across as a modern lens through which to view the story. Were there black folks in Elizabeth's court? Is it likely that Mary's husband was gay? Probably not. But it was a refreshing way to make the world of the past feel less distant.We will always view history by comparing it to the present. Mary Queen of Scots simply brings a little bit of the present with us as we view the past. God forbid we suspend our disbelief about how white the world was back in the day when white people ruled.As for the rest of the story, I personally found it really interesting to think about these two women as adversaries and confidants, as two women without equals simply searching for someone to guide them. It was a fascinating take on power, womanhood, and sisterhood. These are the not the stories we hear about when we hear about female rulers. What harm does it do is to imagine them as complex and searching?The movie definitely has its faults (the storyline is a bit confusing to follow, and the motivations do seem lacking), but the story on the whole is a fascinating one.

Also, Mary does have a reasonable Scottish accent - Saoirse Ronan does hide her Irish accent quite well - although Mary having been brought up in France, it's difficult to understand where she got it.But, The British Isles in the 16th century - decades before the Indian or African empires and any form of Global travel - where did all those Black, Indian and Asians come from - there probably would have been a handful around and certainly not anything asgrand as Ladies in Waiting or English Ambassador.

427,missaking,"One flaw ""to sell"" ruining a great film",7,7 September 2019,"however anyone with the basic historic knowledge would know that no medieval Lord / ambassador was coloured in England in the 16th century. This is the same issue that ruined The Hollow Crown a few years ago. It's disturbing. It is vital and important to show equality, I agree, and to show that through equal representation. But when it goes against accuracy it's plainly overdone. It may satisfy the industry's need to reach certain %'s, avoid ""reviews"" (which if would happen would just as much be overdone, not about the ""product"" and skills of those who worked hard on it.) but it ruins the product itself.
Amazing performances from Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie, and the score is bold in that it's traditional and just at the balance between perfect and too much, it never becomes too disturbing.
The whole film has ""that typical British value"" that Hollywood could hardly reproduce. Scotland is beautiful as ever, and the film uses the scenery to its advantage without relying on it 'to sell itself'.
The supportive (male) cast does a fine job as well, but the film truly is carried mainly by Saoirse Ronan.
All in all, were the producers not so adamant to please 21st century anxieties this film Gould be great and would earn 10 stars from me. Sadly, I was disappointed way too early on. It's so sad they sold it out this way. There are roles in historic films that only coloured people and people who aren't Caucasian and they don't get replaced by Caucasians.

I had read a brief description beforehand however shortly after taking in Mary, the Queen is left with the decision to sign away on the execution with little happening in between to explain why such decision should be made.I'm not going to try and say I'm an expert on the history of the time, but didn't Mary grow up for the most part in France? Yet her and all her friends/handmaidens have thick Scottish accents? I have searched whether Lord Randolph was black and it seems improbable. I am a strong supporter for diversity in films and believes it to be very important however do not support diversity for the sake of diversity. Having said that I thought the acting of Lord Randolph was good. The era seems quite interesting however the two queens situation is treated like a soap opera, as one other reviewer put it, and there is no eveidence they ever met.

Unfortunately the rest of the casting was mixed. The choice to cast Adrian Lester who I loved in Primary Colors as Lord Randolph who historically was White was very jarring for me. There was a sprinkling of other minor lords and nobles who were dark skinned as well. Add to that, Mary having a lady in waiting being a woman of color and Elizabeth even having an Asian Woman as a lady in Waiting, really heavily detracted from the authenticity of a movie. It felt like there was a heavy political agenda being pushed here by the film Makers that was more important than the story being told and this sort of re-writing of history upsets me tremendously. I generally don't mind minor historical and timeline inaccuracies in a movie if the story is told well and the look and feel of the movie is captured but the casting ruined it for me. It is cultural misappropriation in reverse. How would people feel if they cast a white person in the role of Nelson Mandela for instance? People would be insulted and offended and the film would not be believable, regardless of of how well it was acted or how well the story was told, this is how I felt about Mary Queen of Scots.

437,davermarquez,Catastrophic Theatre Play on big screen,1,12 June 2020,"Where to start, yes it is a colourblind cast movie and afraid that makes is distracting, I do not need to repeat other fellow critics so I will emphasise that the director tried to direct a non white period drama but the point is she forgot she was directing period drama and not a Disney modern fairy tale.
Historical inaccuracies are mentioned everywhere I do not thing that is the problem, no period drama is accurate but there is limit for everything and I would say that Braveheart is way more near to facts that this mediocre movie.
To start us who like period drama want to be submerge in the sense that it feels I am in the 16th century, the theatre cast style brakes that illusion and btw I find it offensive but anyway art should offend sometimes so that doesn't merit my one star.
The deeper reason I have to rate this movie so badly si the over dramatisation, and poor representation of Queen Mary by the lead actress. Us in Scotland can tell She is Irish and that should have never happened because that is acceptable in theatre not in movies, you could know where a real characters were from on Titanic just by their accent for example.
Finally the colour blind cast is a tick-boxing exercise, what is the point of a black Scottish ambassador when the proper braking through would have been Genma Chan being queen Mary. I am sure she would have played that role better anyway.
To conclude this is not period drama is a theatre play over expanded to pretend is a movie and it fails as a movie, maybe theatre goers will beg to differ but movies are meant to make money and this one didn't. It is a case of public knowing better than critics who overrated this flop.",Mary Queen of Scots

444,kelskrebs,Lovely & More Accurate Than You Would Think,8,2 January 2019,"I've read a lot about Elizabeth I, so I was excited to see her portrayed on screen again. It was stunning. It was the first movie I've ever seen her portrayed as the fierce and still incredibly self-conscious woman that she really was. The books I've read showed Mary Stuart as having non-stop drama in her life that affected Elizabeth. This movie captured it perfectly. I'm also so disappointed by reviewers saying this is PC and historically inaccurate. Maybe some small moments are, but English courts were known to have Moors (ie, Black people), which is shown in this movie. Making it more historically accurate than most period dramas. All it takes is more academic research than watching The Tudors to know that. Also, Mary Stuart's husband was rumored to enjoy men's company. All in all, watching this movie and knowing those facts, I was stunned that they put it in because most people go with the standard idea of Scotland and England being white, heterosexual. It was so fun to see such a historically accurate plot.
Now, the 2 women in this movie made me emotional. Opposites in many ways, the movie juxtapositions how their choices in ruling affected them and the outcome of each woman's life. Basically he film shows (historically accurate) that you can't have it all. Which is not only true for these 2 women, but for anyone.
The scene where they meet up may not be historically accurate, but it nearly brought me to tears from the emotion of it. It solidifies each women and they each stand their ground on the choices they've made in life.

447,jennifertraini-31554,Such a pity,5,23 February 2019,"To put it mildly, this movie is very poorly made.
First of all, the screenwriter must have failed History because this movie is not accurate at all. If it wasn't marketed as an historic film, I'd be fine with that but not given this premise.The diversity in the cast was really weird for a movie set in XVI century Europe. Not even 50 years had passed since America was discovered so all European countries were still in a race to get as much colonies as possible and enslaving people. This was not a time for an Asian girl to be at a European court (and I found no proof online that in fact an Asian girl was in Mary's court).If we don't take into account historical accuracy and pretend this Mary and Elizabeth are not in fact the Queen of Scots and the Queen of England, the movie still lacks something.
The characters were bland and the plot itself not engaging.It's a pity because both actresses are really talented and deserved a movie worth of their salt.That being said, now that I watched it, I understand why it did so poorly with Oscar nominations.",Mary Queen of Scots

449,charles-65362,How awful can a movie get? Go see this film and find out!,3,24 December 2018,"What an awful film. I would have left after 15 minutes but stayed when my companion insisted that I do so. There are three reasons for my poor review.
(1) The actresses chosen to play Mary and Elizabeth were lightweight for the parts and were never believable in their roles. Saoirse Ronan does not have the gravitas to pull off the role. She may be fine portraying contemporary characters in movies, but not historical ones that are larger than life. Particularly annoying is that she speaks with an Irish accent and she is supposed to be a Scottish queen. The woman who plays Elizabeth is better, especially when portraying her as haughty and aloof, but when she gets simpering the portrayal becomes annoying. Besides, all Elizabeths will be compared to Cate Blanchett's portrayal and will ultimately fall short, and in this case, way short.
(2) What a disastrous decision to populate the courts of Elizabeth and Mary with Black and Asian actors. Of course I have no problem seeing these actors in movies... except when it harms the historical authenticity of the portrayal. There were no Black and Asian people in the high courts of both countries during that period. Let alone presenting the English ambassador to Scotland as Black. All this for the sake of artistic license. Such a dumb decision.
(3) The director of this film really missed the mark. I blame the director for the odd pacing and stilted dialogue. The real problem is that this movie is very literal, and lacks any type of nuance. It also lacks historical accuracy, for instance, Mary and Elizabeth never met in person. In this movie their meeting is a great example of bad acting, poor direction and cringe-worthy dialogue.
I cannot believe the good reviews professional critics have given this movie. My respect for them has diminished as a result. The only good points were the costumes and the cinematography. But if that is a movie's claim to fame... I say what a waste of viewer's time. Don't bother unless you know nothing about history and like your movies superficial and inane.",Mary Queen of Scots

Does not mean that all event occurring in the movie are accurate.The war between Mary and Elizabeth is however true. They were constantly at war with one another but, they were also very strong independent women who made history.
Everyone has a twist on history and to me this is just another one. I believe it is worth the watch.",Mary Queen of Scots
451,pliredlotus,Accuracy of history and details,10,23 January 2019,"Before you even read other critics ""it was godawful"" reviews, take a sip and read, the accuracy of this movie with history is amazingly put in place, i'm historian and i know every details about Elizabeth 1'st and Mary Queen of Scots, Margot Robbie's acting is simply the best in every encounter, the power that both queens posses is hard to imagine, there is deep meaning behind this movie and is well hidden by breathtaking acting, overall details such as : Nox,Dudley, James, the LGBTQ resemblance of the character is amazing as well! the movie is pure classic.",Mary Queen of Scots
452,rt-90461,Only go and see this if you have a vacancy in your ten worst films of all time.,1,20 January 2019,"This is a truly terrible film made worse by the appalling theft of time; had the actors cut back on the utterly pointless ""dramatic"" pauses we could have been spared about an hour of pain. But neither the cast nor the Director were merciful. If the object was to make a martyr-movie then it succeeded - but the martyrs were the long suffering audience not Mary. Just for the record though, Mary spoke with a. French accent not Scottish, Elizabeth was a strong and ruthless Queen who never met Mary and there were no black, Asian or openly gay members of Mary's or Elizabeth's court. I appreciate that diversity is essential to have a chance of an Oscar, but the paying public just finds this patronising; Elizabethan England and even more so Scotland was very white and very Christian (whether you like it or not). To say otherwise is not clever positional-play it is lying; lying with propaganda at its dark heart.
(By-the-way, whatever happened to cultural appropriation?)
Also, if they really want accolades then pandering to the BBC and its love of diversity is no substitute for decent acting or a supposedly historical movie bearing some resemblance to history.

Yes she was flawed and a very complex character but to portray her as a weak, snivelling woman is just simply shocking. There's a reason she reigned successfully for as long as she did. She was powerful, smart and knew how to manipulate those around her. Just imagine a woman who was of her time and felt like men were her superior but still managed to run a kingdom for as long as she did?

What on earth were they thinking when they cast multiple nationalities as high members of court? It was all so strange I was waiting for an alien/extraterrestrial twist at the end.
Margot Robbie seemed to be missing for a lot of it.. I honestly could go on for ages about how disappointing this was.
2 stars is being generous - I think you have to watch this to see how really shocking it is. Movies created around historic plot lines should at least vaguely resemble history.

It is perfectly okay to change who portrays a fictional character. A black woman playing James Bond? I'm perfectly okay with that. Gay Superman? Go for it. Anyone that has a problem with that is simply a bigot.
But you cannot do that with historical characters. You do not get to change history. Throughout history, ironically, people of power have often changed History to suit their needs. Americans tend to overlook the fact that they exist due to the help of genocide and slavery. The British do not like to remind themselves of all the evil they have done throughout the centuries. When we rewrite history we might as well tell the world the truth does not matter.
Lord Randolph was not a black man. Bess of Hardwick was not an Asian woman. Elizabethan Court would not have included people of power who are people of color. Servants? Yes. But not wealthy people of power. This was a time in history when people of color we're being sent to the new world as slaves. We must not forget that and we must not pretend that it wasn't so. And we must not believe that they were equals and that they served in the court of Elizabeth. No matter how much we want equality today , we should not pretend as if equality has always existed.

It is clear what politics are being played in this review section, it is clear this movie is not for fragile men ;)What I took away from this movie is that even a woman in power in those days, was still subjected to the ways of men. There are two women- Queen Mary and Liz I- who are seeking peace, but because of the politics of their palaces and the cruel culture of their religion, despite their efforts, they are unable to maintain it.So the big issue seems to be that there are people of color playing lords and ladies. ""PC gone mad!"" is what the boy snowflake will call it. I get it, they must have been so angry to see Alec Guinness play an Arab Sheik in Lawrence of Arabia, or Jake Gyllenhaal play a Persian Prince. It is indeed a departure from classic type casting and I understand that it might break the suspension of disbelief, but to me it doesn't. The fact that there are queer courtiers, or that the ladies-in-waiting spoke freely to men makes it actually way more historically correct. At least there's no sugar sweet love story that dominates the script.Master Margot Robbie plays an unbelievably believable Elizabeth I, whose many reasons to be insecure are being overshadowed by her conviction that she has to ""man up"" in a court filled with men and who is gradually forced into the proverbial straightjacket of queenhood. Saoirse Ronan is chilling as the headstrong but ultimately pacifist Mary who sees her dreams shatter on similar grounds. There is a dialogue between the two actresses that is unprecedented, as the two queens are longing for sisterhood but they don't trust each other.So, see this movie, don't believe the boyflakes!

489,lordoftorture,Unhinged propaganda piece with no regard of history,2,3 February 2019,"Everything about this movie from the title, cast, dialogue and the inserted narrative before and after the film is with one purpose - promote a fanatic ideology and maskarade it as historical fact.
The main theme - all women are smart, strong and good. All men are stupid, weak, chaotic and obsessed with bringing women and other men down.
Men are the main source of problems and pain for women.Even if women turn on each other it is because of men. Mary and Elizabeth wanted to be sisters and play together but men forced them in a bad direction. When Elizabeth turns bad she declares she is now more a man, than a woman and this is one of the high points according to the director.
Another important massage from this movie is that unfortunately men are needed for conception and procreation. Such a nuisance! And this is not implied, it is verbally stated because it is ""important massage"" and the director thinks some of us are too stupid to figure it out after the first hour. And not only that but Mary does not fail to mention her husband lasted only a minute, because... I don't know. Maybe someone well-verse in modern feminism can chime in.
The cast? The key word is diversity. Forget about the old times when the actor/actress has to be chosen to resemble the physical appearance of the historic figure. No, that is racist. The (politically) correct way to do these things nowadays is to have a fixed quota of minorities in main, supportive and background characters. English ambassador is a black man.He is still ignorant character because he is a man, even if from a minority. Some of the lords are also black. About 10% of Scottish peasants are sub-Saharan Africans. Why?! I don't know, something about diversity as divine virtue. If I was a black actor it would have been a humiliation and insult to work on such project where I am just a token of political massage.
The film takes no interest in the history. History is just a requisite that has to be tailored to serve the main agenda. Facts don't matter. If certain events never took place they will be invented to serve the narrative but the movie will still be presented like a historical drama.

Hair, make-up, clothing very well done! I love it.
In a lot of history movies they just change outfits, but never research how the hair is supposed to look like. So bravo.",Mary Queen of Scots

It's obviously historical inaccurate with Elizabeth's African Ladies-in-Waiting. You know you're in for a PC movie when you see that. You also know you're in for a movie geared towards millennials when all of the actors & actress are dressed in black from head to toe. Also, in one scene, Mary is sporting two different styles of earrings..a shorter, stud style in one ear and a dangle in her other. I guess she was trying to be a trendsetter back in the 1500s. This was a huge waste of time and especially money that could have spent more wisely elsewhere...perhaps feeding some hungry families! THUMBS DOWN.",Mary Queen of Scots
496,lillou-343-385170,Good for a movie 😊,8,23 January 2019,"Although not 100% historically accurate- for example:
The two queens never meet (although some people like to play around with the idea that they could have had a mystery secret meeting due to MQofS having an anonymous visitor on the books while she was prisoner/guest (lol) in England.
Mary was raised in France and so it is unlikely she would have a Scottish accent.
Lord Darnley was promiscuous but don't believe records say he had homosexual relations.As movies go though I was quite impressed with the history accuracy that was included. Usually when I watch a Tudor movie I end up picking it apart pointing out all the things that didn't happen etc. Usually movies take lots of creative licence with things.
The history nerd in me actually quite enjoyed it (for a movie)
As long as you watch it with open mind you should be able to enjoy despite slow pace in some areas.
I've come to learn with history movies not to be quick to pull apart and just take things with a pinch of salt. It isn't a history documentary it's a movie- remember that and you'll be fine 😊

500,charlie_superstar,Ignore the snowflake right wing reviews,8,22 December 2020,"It seems most low and negative reviews on this thread seem to forget that this film, is in fact just that; a film! Nowhere have I seen this to be advertised as an exact portrayal of 16th century royal court or to show the exact series of events that really happened. When watching any historical based entertainment most would expect some artistic licence to be taken with the story and yet a lot of reviewers seem to be very upset they weren't watching a documentary, which this film never claimed to be.It definitely seems to me that people complaining about all the diversity, must just hate diversity. In a film that is not in any way about race, the race of the cast doesn't matter at all to the plot of the film and I can honestly say before reading the hate filled reviews I didn't even notice this aspect at all. It doesnt distract or take away anything unless you are filled with rage at the sight of anyone not white in a historical drama. Whether this is 'historically accurate' is completely irrelevant in a FICTIONAL retelling of a story that again has nothing to do with race. The whole cast was talented and believable in the roles they played and it seems the anger and negative reviews were mainly caused by right wing people who believe this film somehow was a political attack because it contained non-white, non-straight actors and characters, even though this made absolutely no difference to the plot of the film.The film itself is very good, the acting by the two female leads is brilliant, the writing was believable and the story was engaging. It sometimes felt a little slow but the story carried it through so it didnt feel like too long a slog despite its 2 hour run time. The cinematography was also beautiful.Overall, this film is obviously not an exact retelling of the true story, but is loosely based on history which is exactly what I expected it to be and overall I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Mary Queen of Scots

513,umkam,3-4,2,2 February 2019,"For a long time I was not in the cinema on historical films ... when the kina lasts for almost 2 hours and we do not get an integral picture of the events taking place at all. The plot reminds me of a more overview of the TV series than a movie theater, very brief and uninformed events from 5 months to 10 years, which was known only by the mediocre writer or historically determined viewer. The essence of intercourse between sisters is almost uncovered, like some characters. In a heap with a mediocre scriptwriter you will receive a less talkative person who picked up the actors. England 1500 years, the nobility, the secret council, the reign of the Queen of Scotland and whom we saw next to in high positions? - blacks! I am not a racist, but before us, the historical work of art, based on really existing events and personalities, it is not in any gateway. Did the director at school not pass the story? It's a mystery to me, it's not even tolerance but a mania or an obsessive idea for another race ... Sirsha played very well, I confess I'm not familiar with her work, but now I'm not against getting acquainted not only with creativity. # morgrobbi is not that white girl # we used to be a nanny - this is a ""marionette"" ore in the hands of gentle men in power, whose figure has hardly been revealed. The first half is quite exhilarating, and in the second there is a bit of boredom which is quite fast passing, but that initial magic will no longer be. There is almost no musical companion, as I did not have the beautiful and cool water of the mystical Celtic music and the ore-noble man. The spoiler in the beginning also did not add an intrigue. But fog and rain created the atmosphere of Scotland. It was necessary to either cover a smaller period of Mary's life or make a film longer for 30-40 minutes. Calm, life without vulgar scenes but not perfect. A beautiful Ukrainian duplicate translation with French insertions with subtitles turned out to be quite organic.
I advise the film to people who are poorly aware of history, as you know that Narolon is not only a cake, but also a historical figure - this is not a movie for you. I do not regret having visited for the general development of 4 out of 10 and that is still a lot.",Mary Queen of Scots

Instead she turned what could have been a fascinating movie about two very strong and powerful women in a time where men dominated into 2 hours of PC Instagrammed twaddle.To top it all off, you don't even get to see Mary get her head lopped off. Trust me after suffering through two hours of such politically correct ""let's not upset anyone"" narrative, that's the icing on a very bland cake.A final note; Mary Queen of Scots would have spoken with a French accent, not with the very accent Mrs Doubtfire waffled.

I'll start with the few positives: Great acting, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful score. Also, cool to see they actually included John Knox.Here's where it gets bad:
It basically ""Hollywood-Washes"" most of the elements surrounding the story.
For instance, it makes the Ambassador between England and Scotland black. (Would have been cool, but totally inaccurate.)The film also makes Queen Elizabeth's handmaiden asian.The biggest misstep is blaming the downfall of Mary, as well as the murder of David Rizzo, because both David and Mary's husband Henry Darnley were gay.None of this happened, and it basically re-writes the entire portion of English/Scottish history.Really disappointed with this one.",Mary Queen of Scots

I liked the fiery and ultimately doomed Mary. Can you imagine how awful it must have been to have raised at the French court and then end up in sixteenth century Edinburgh. I liked the efforts made to bring a bit of french chic to the dour Scottish court. A woman born to rule and also we must remember quite aware of court intrigue. She survived Catherine de Medici, her first husband's mother, who did like her and effectively kicked her out of France when she became a widow. But inevitably ruled by her heart rather than her head. It's nice to see Elizabeth being played as a neurotic paranoid for a change. You felt sympathy for both women. I could have happily seen a bit more of Mary's House arrest and inevitable downfall, but as that took 18 years it might have dragged a bit.As for the bits that got everyone hot and bothered. It's called blind casting. I know it's a bit of a shock if you're English to have an Australian playing Lord Burleigh, but Guy Pearce managed to pull it off. As for the homosexuality, well guess what - it wasn't invented in the 1960's. I can well imagine a vain poppinjay like Darnley bedding anything that took his fancy, especially if he was drunk. Which he was, a lot. It also fed into the dislike the Scots had for the foreign interlopers Mary had introduced to her court.Did Mary and Elizabeth ever meet? Well why not? Mary was a prisoner in this country for 18 years. Elizabeth moved around the kingdom constantly, moving from country house to country house. Who can say that they never, definitely never ever met. Who'd want to watch such a dull film about real life where two fiery queens living in the same country never meet?It's a fun film.

543,benedictandrew,A Basic Guide to Critically Appreciating 'Mary Queen of Scots',9,23 April 2019,"Mary Queen of Scots received a backlash and hate mail on its USA release, having been positively reviewed following its first showings. Much of this backlash came from three groups.First, there are the misogynists who hated the female centrality of Captain Marvel and trolled their hate, as they did, too, on that poorly moderated site, Rotten Tomatoes, with Mary Queen of Scots. Objectionable were scenes of female sexuality and menstruation. The marketer's over-emphasis on depicting things female triggered a 'Me Too' type of Social Media movement that lay largely behind the backlash. It may be true that marketing shot this film in the foot. They were heavy-handed - and did we say Mary Queen of Scots understands gay people?Second, we have the positivists who are too closed to enjoy purposeful re-imaginings of historical personages, their words and actions - call these folk 'history pedants' if you must. An imagined and theatrical meeting of the minds of Mary and Elizabeth was just unacceptable, even though 'sliding door moments' and 'what if?' moments have long an element of critical speculation to the narrative. We don't own history. History as we know it is recorded by humans - historians; and Tudor novelists tread creatively on this ground, filling in the disputed and unknowable 'facts' with creative speculation. Blasphemous to this group was Mary's Scottish accent, a conscious, audience-centred decision, Saoirse Ronan said in interviews. We also hear Mary, in more intimate moments, speaking French. Rourke and crew embody awareness of these decisions within the film. Historical ignorance it is not; but we could call it creative license.Third, there are the 'anti-theatrical pedants' who couldn't accept imagining people of colour and diversity in the courts of Mary and Elizabeth. To paraphrase what Josie Rourke, the film's director, often said in interviews, the theatre has challenged viewers with black Isabellas (Measure for Measure) for decades. Yet Asian actor Gemma Chen received brickbats for her Bess Hardwick. And more than ten novels re-imagining Bess Hardwick have been written, including The Queenmaker by Maureen Peters. History, and its personages, are not objectivist statues set in alabaster; they are there or the reimagining, and understanding re-imagining requires a quality of critical thought. Rourke's gamble lay in the hope that audiences has critical thought; but increasingly, they do not, preferring such easy (and just as blasphemous to fact) re-imaginings as Bohemian Rhapsody.Mary, Queen of Scots was grand on the cinema screen, particularly the sweeping exteriors and shots of the rough terrains of Scotland and the intimate thinking close-ups, more of Saoirse Ronan than Margot Robbie. There is real life in those eyes. It deserves new eyes, new audiences, in its home cinema incarnations. The film's device of switching between courts to build intrigue is a mainstay of television; yet it was one of the critics' main objects of scorn. The script, neither Game of Thrones nor The House of Cards as populists may have expected, is a fair adaptation of its source, John Guy's speculative biography, Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart. It is true that there is a lack of momentum in the intercut scenes and a lack of clarity in the development of minor or secondary - and male - characters. The work of Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie is amazing in different ways, though Ronan has the upper hand with her uncanny knack at accents and her way with steely glares, and Robbie has the disadvantage of an Australian accent which raises its head in occasional syllables. There is some joy in the supporting players, too. The scenes of the two female actors leads us to wonder what sparks will fly between Ronan and Kate Winslet in the forthcoming Ammonite, a film where the stars are guaranteed to have more than one scene together (and which is already taking flack for re-imagining 'history', or rather 'herstory').Embrace Mary Queen of Scots with an open mind, fully prepared for the work of a theatre director adapting her technique and tropes to film, and ready to enjoy the work of two of today's finest stars.",Mary Queen of Scots

History is all about interpretation on how you perceive evidence and stories. I pictured this beautiful half Scottish/ half French queen quite successfully holding her own during her short lived reign in Scotland. A queen with wit, charm, surprising tolerance for her time, impulsive, talented and actually quite politically astute! The powerful Scottish men surrounding her were eventually her undoing combined with her own lustful decision to marry the awful Lord Darnley.The film matches all my thoughts about this queen. I sat with 9 other people who never studied Mary but who left the cinema stating, wow she's just as you had described. Therefore don't let the critics put you off. The movie showcases all these personailites of Mary. At times the story is harrowing to watch, that was reality of her life. Elizabeth supports well in the film showing a more vulnerable side than we see in other movies. The filming is just stunning (especially the scenes in Scotland). The meeting between Mary and Elizabeth is genius. Yes as far as we know it never happened. But the possibility that it may have happened is true.A tastefully filmed, mostly accurate portrayal of Mary Queen of Scots that brings back the fascination with this monarch. Must Watch!",Mary Queen of Scots

Still a good watch",Mary Queen of Scots
552,autumnj98,Inaccurate and generally just dull,1,26 January 2019,"The worst part about this film, shockingly, isn't what they did to David Tennant, it's instead the poor writing, often dull plot, poorly explained character motivations and the bizzare underlying feeling that the director was trying to make the film somehow 'acceptable' for 2019 through the inclusion of black and ethnic minority characters in roles they never would have had in that time period. Having Lord Thomas Randolph played by a black man, as well as an inferred reference to a trans character, who is immediately supported and encouraged to be who they want to be is just...bizzare. It's a historical film... You can't 're-imagine' historical figures because you're afraid of potential backlash of the 'oscarssowhite' kind.
It's pandering and insulting to black and ethnic minorities who only want to be represented for...existing in the world. This film has got that completely wrong and said 'Lets pretend these white figures were actually black' ...which is...just wrong but also could cause people who don't know as much about history to see the film, and not be as aware of the true history in which black people would NEVER have become lords in the 16th century...Only reason anyone may want to watch is for Saorise Ronan's acting, which is phenomenal in this, Margot Robbie doesn't have much of an impact as Queen Elizabeth.",Mary Queen of Scots
553,alilacey-91814,Icon of history,10,26 January 2019,"An amazing rendition of a timeless story! Debatable on historical accuracy but this movie definitely has countless moments where you are left in shock from the twists and turns the story takes. Never a dull moment and a great mix of romance, violence and social issues that are relatable to today's society. Definitely a must watch of 2019!",Mary Queen of Scots
554,HigumaNZ,The penny that Christopher Reeve found in his pocket...,6,29 January 2019,"When watching movies such as ""Mary Queen of Scots"", one wants to be as much as possible ""immersed"" into the time and location. Some choices of actors just for the sake of diversity bring you out of the proposed historical scenario. This is just like the 1979 Lincoln penny that brought Christopher Reeve back to 1980 in Somewhere in Time. If she just wanted to make a PC mockery of it all, I don't know why the director bothered to film it in Scotland. Why not Hawaii, for example? Much cheaper.",Mary Queen of Scots
555,rjwispy,Dissappinting,4,3 February 2019,"Historically incorrect more times than I can mention. When I finally rolled my eyes to the front of my head, found myself trying to match the inaccurate portrayal to the correct lineages of history. Mary's so call marriage where she was actually having an affair with Dudley under Elizabeth's nose, the Hollywood of a homosexual romance l, the uprising of James I could go on. If you know Tudor history avoid at all costs. If you don't then go watch but don't take it as gospel.",Mary Queen of Scots
556,monkybb,A waste of time,1,18 February 2019,"Boring. It looks really bad from the begining and it just get worse. Saorise and Margot were great and you can tell money has been spent but I think the director has ruin it all. The movie had the potential to be good but it is just full of modern open minded reactions that doesn't make sense in a historic movie and in consequence it is hard to emphatise with the caracters as it doesn't show the real struggles of their time, I just wanted it to be over. I was so disapointed this has put me off from going to the cinema for a while.",Mary Queen of Scots
557,efoss-72426,Bad/Awful,1,3 March 2019,We love historical pieces but this was hard to watch. Writing and directing were atrocious. Sloooooow and boring version of a great story. Acting was the highpoint.,Mary Queen of Scots
