0,Leofwine_draca,"The War on Terror, as seen from on the ground",7,16 September 2011,"A taut and engaging Middle Eastern thriller from Ridley Scott, who handles the political motivations just as well as the frenetic action scenes. BODY OF LIES is a modern-day counterpart to Scott's Crusader epic KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, revealing how the war between the East and West is nowadays fought through terror attacks and sinister subversion rather than all-out battles.DiCaprio continues to develop as one of the most interesting actors of our age while Russell Crowe is cast against type as a shifty CIA controller. Although the on-the-ground operations, bombings and betrayals are as exciting as you'd expect, the film's real strength lies in the back story: namely, America's interference in cultures it doesn't fully understand or get to grips with. Add in another dignified performance from Mark Strong and you have a winning combination for a movie.",Body of Lies
1,SnoopyStyle,Good action spy thriller,7,8 February 2014,"Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a CIA agent working on the ground. His handler is the cynical hard head of Near East Division Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe). When Ferris finds intel in Iraq leading to a terrorist safe house in Amman Jordan, he tries to work with Jordanian Intelligence. However friction between Ferris and Hoffman keeps causing problems.Director Ridley Scott knows how to make an action movie. The story and the locations have a certain realism. However I could never really buy the lily white face of Leo as a field agent. And while Russell Crowe is pretty good. He's too detached from the field. In fact, Leo and Russell don't meet face to face until almost 50 minutes in. They are better acting together in the same room. It's a good spy thriller with some realism but also some unlikely touches.",Body of Lies
2,Hitchcoc,Where's the Power?,8,30 August 2010,"With DiCaprio and Crowe out there, what is a very obtuse movie at times becomes quite a thriller. Crowe sits back and lets things happen. He knows how little say he really has, so he just puts people in harm's way. DiCaprio finds himself in Jordan trading secrets, and never knowing whom to trust. Crowe is a coach who keeps sending him back for more brutality. We also see the delicate balance that exists among the invaders (us) and the indigenous folks who are ever vigilant. There is a romance that is a bit distracting but explains a lot. The main character, however, is like a gang member trying to leave the game. It becomes very complicated and when he sees how much investment he has, he has to follow orders. This isn't the best movie of its kind, but it will keep one involved.",Body of Lies
3,claudio_carvalho,Disappointing Pyrotechnical Tour,4,6 April 2009,"After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the prime suspect is the leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). The CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) that operates in the Middle East is assigned by his superior at Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to keep a ""safe house"" in Amman under surveillance, and he associates to the Chief of Security in Jordan, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger does not disclose the whole operation to Hani, and it fails due to the intervention of Ed. Meanwhile Roger has feelings for the local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and he gets close to her family. When Roger plots another scheme to catch Al-Saleem using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as decoy to lure Al-Saleem, he jeopardizes not only the safety of Sadiki, but also Aisha that is kidnapped. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse.""Body of Lies"" is a disappointing pyrotechnical tour through Europe and Middle East despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The IMDb User Rating indicates that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology, satellites and all sort of lack of respect to the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking, but that is not my case. It is boring and ridiculous to see the fat Russell Crowe with a cell phone like a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character performed by Leonardo DiCaprio is poorly developed and in my opinion this great actor is miscast as an operative agent in Middle East due to his biotype. But the movie never explains his connections with the Middle East. The rescue of Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Rede de Mentiras"" (""Network of Lies"")",Body of Lies
4,kosmasp,Complex structure,9,20 April 2009,"I'm starting to get what and especially why people praised Leonardo Di Caprio so much. He really holds the movie together here. It's a great script story, but with his charismatic performance he really gives it the extra edge it needs.Ridley Scott has chosen a very peculiar story for (t)his movie. But he really treats it with much respect. His visual sense and his story-telling mastery combined with a great cast and the aforementioned script make up for a very interesting, entertaining, but still very complex and sophisticated! It's not something you can watch in-between doing other things. You do have to pay attention to what is happening to follow the story/plot. And I liked that very much :o)",Body of Lies
5,classicsoncall,"""That was the plan, my dear.""",7,18 August 2020,"The film had me thinking about the deceit and duplicity, and the lengths intelligence agencies go to get information on the enemy. But even more so, the kind of fake evidence that's often planted in order to draw out the enemy. This was a well crafted war time and espionage thriller with DiCaprio in the driver's seat most of the time, trading barbs and insults with his American based handler, portrayed by Russell Crowe. It didn't seem realistic to me that agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) would get romantically involved with a Jordanian nurse (Golshifteh Farahani); I thought he had his hands full running his post in Amman while developing a phony, diversionary threat to draw out terrorist mastermind Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). The ruse gets a foreign national killed, and is one of a number of actions that sow doubt in Ferris's mind as to the morality and honor of his mission. He makes it out of the story pretty much in one piece, but it doesn't mean he's immune to a world of hurt. Crowe's character seems a bit too aloof in the role, evidenced by the almost off-handed way in which he communicates with Ferris, though it probably typifies the type of agency head that gets promoted to even greater levels of responsibility. They're immune to common sense if it means compromising an objective.",Body of Lies
6,rmax304823,Ya Mustapha....,6,31 July 2017,"In this convoluted story of Leonardo DiCaprio as an anti-terrorism agent doing the wet work for the CIA in Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East, the chief distinction is between DiCaprio on the one hand, getting his hands dirty among the dust and squalor of cities like Aman, Jordan, and Russel Crowe, the savvy and dispassionate controller back in Washington, playing with his kids in the backyard and doing the laundry while issuing orders over his phone headset. They're friends, in a frosty kind of way, but part company, so to speak, at the end. That's after Crowe's promise of protection fails, DiCaprio is kidnapped by the jihadists, has a couple of fingers turned into road kill with a ball peen hammer, and falls in love with a nurse in Jordan, Golshifteh Farahan.Now, first of all, it's easy to see how DiCaprio would be captivated by Golshifteh Farahani. She is very appealing. The actress was born in Iran and has lived in Paris. Her native Farsi is overlaid with French harmonies and it turns her euphonious English into a melody. It's not an inept trope since Farahani is also a practiced musician and has performed with professional bands. DiCaprio is like one of those anthropologists who has ""gone native"" and refuses to come home. He grows to like the Middle East, represented by his girl friend, but I would have been turned off by her once she began administering the traditional course of treatment for rabies -- shots right into the abdominal cavity. I'd rather have the rabies.There has been a spate of movies about gathering intelligence and operating against jihadists or war lords in the Middle East lately. Surprisingly, most of them are pretty good -- especially ""Blackhawk Down"" and the two directed by Katherine Bigelow, ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty."" This one is more cynical than most. It has a modicum of action and is filled with suspense.Worth seeing.",Body of Lies
7,ma-cortes,"Thrilling and exciting movie about terrorism , spies and geopolitical issues",7,14 November 2008,"The film deals about a young spy named Roger Ferris(Leonardo DiCaprio), a CIA operative serving in Jordan. He's working for CIA chief named Ed Hoffman(Russell Crowe). Ed is a very occupied man, as efficient boss as father of family. The super-powerful CIA uses technological-gizmo-surveillance satellites for people spying and hound terrorists relentlessly. Ferris schemes a plot to chase the mastermind terrorist named Al Saleem . In Jordan Roger forms a shaky alliance with Hani (Mark Strong),the boss of Jordanian Intelligence to break the terrorist ring which are bombing civilian targets .Ferris try to stop cruel terrorist who plans terrorist bombings by means an uncanny masquerade . Meanwhile Ferris falls in love with a Palestine nurse and aid-worker named Aisha(Farahani).Story's core is interesting and script is dense with information and drama. The ultra-brisk editing and rapid scenes movement leaves little time to consider some inadequacies. The picture is a crossover from 'the Siege'(98,Edward Zwick with Denzel Washington,Tony Shalhoub) about the dangerous terrorism Arab; 'Enemy of state' (1998, Tony Scott with Will Smith, Gene Hackman) dealing the modern surveillance systems and 'Spy game'(2001,Tony Scott with Brad Pitt, Robert Redford)concerning the spy-world on Middle East. Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe sustain interest in this tale of technology run amok and terrorism. DiCaprio is good as tough super-spy and Crowe's cool displaying a sarcastic performance. The use of geopolitical messages to add weight to a romantic subplot between the spy and the Palestine nurse , though feels a little forced and ,at times, excessive. The film packs adequate,evocative cinematography by Alexander Witt and agreeable musical score with Arabs overtones. The motion picture is well realized by Ridley Scott who has a career plenty of hits, as American gangster,Kingdom of heaven,Black Hawk down, Hannibal,Gladiator... Rating : Above average, well worth watching.",Body of Lies
8,Quinoa1984,"plenty of generic points, but tense and well-acted enough to suffice for two hours",7,12 October 2008,"A person I saw the movie with said it best: Body of Lies represents a form of updating the ol' Cold War paranoia movie into the war-on-terror setting - which also means that, along with it, plot points wont be entirely fresh. Matter of fact, despite all what screenwriter William Monohan does to inject some good dialog into scenes and set up some nervous pacing, not much can be done to go past some of these somewhat tired conventions of the espionage-plot: smarter-than-most lead, smarmy co-lead, suspicious and shifty supporting character Hani (Mark Strong), and the quasi love interest (heavy on 'quasi' here, the nurse Aisha character). This is not to say some things in the plot don't stand out and become interesting. But what has been left over from other pictures feels that way heavily in the script, like a day-old ham sandwich.Thankfully, Body of Lies has a more than competent director- matter of fact one of the best professional directors from Britain in the past thirty years- as Ridley Scott pumps up the volume of the action and the skill with the essential elements of the production (not to mention a finite ability to adapt to this story like it's second nature) while not making it too hokey. Everything feels grounded in some sort of reality even when the plot takes its inevitable twists and turns. And he has two great stars for parts that need them desperately: Di Caprio plays the smart-guy angle naturally, and here he always has to be on his toes, slightly ahead of either his character's superior (Russell Crowe) or of Hani and his own group in Jordan. And Crowe, while maybe not giving it his all like in other performances, is enjoyable to the degree that he can relish simple scenes like dropping his kids off at school in the middle of deceiving Di Caprio.Body of Lies is reccomendable, but not overwhelmingly so. You won't really see anywhere near the best middle-eastern thriller nor a really great spy movie. What you do get is a Hollywood picture with A-list actors putting as much as possible for work that is fascinating and suspenseful and occasionally harrowing (i.e. torture scenes), but not much more than what's on the surface.",Body of Lies
9,edwagreen,Body of Lies-Can't Wait Until the Time Flies *1/2,3,24 December 2009,"I just love when they talk about low-level Al Qaeda. That whole organization is bunch of low-life stinkers, intent on killing us all.As for the film, it's hopelessly confusing and dull.A rather paunchy looking Russell Crowe spends the entire movie out of harm's way. How fortunate he is.As is the case with all bad films, it gets to the point where you can't differentiate between the good and bad guys. Everyone is under suspicion.It seems as though everyone is turning on everyone and the CIA is depicted as a ruthless, cunning organization. Wouldn't it be nice if a film were made to show the benefits of that clandestine organization?",Body of Lies
10,michaelRokeefe,Intelligent and bold spy thriller.,8,4 April 2009,"Director Ridley Scott and writer William Monahan create a bold spy thriller worth all the efforts. Skilled and determined CIA operative Roger Ferris(Leonardo DiCaprio)thinks he has uncovered the mastermind of a series of major terrorist activity operating out of Jordan. All of Ferris' scrambling, peeping and intelligence gathering is monitored by CIA veteran Ed Hoffman(Russell Crowe)via precise and elaborate spy in the sky satellite technology. As Ferris nears his target, he has to question how much he can trust his presumed allies and the openly helpful Jordanian intelligence agency. After being bitten by rabid dogs, he seeks medical treatment and becomes emotionally involved with a beautiful nurse Aisha(Golshifteh Farahani). Ferris realizes that the dangerous life he is living evolves around trust for survival; how much of his career and life does he have left.Just over two hours running time with very few dull moments. Very strong language with violence, torture and sexual content. Impressive special effects. DiCaprio and Crowe are in top form.

11,sunwarrior13,"DiCaprio,Crowe And Scott Elevates The Formulaic Film",9,11 January 2012,"Fresh off of their success with director Martin Scorsese's The Departed, star Leonardo DiCaprio and screenwriter William Monahan team with director Ridley Scott for this screen adaptation of David Ignatius' novel Body of Lies.It is a spy film directed by Ridley Scott.It stars DiCaprio and Russell Crowe together with Mark Strong,Golshifteh Farahani,Vince Colosimo,Oscar Isaac,Ali Suliman and Alon Aboutboul. Set in the Middle East, it follows the attempts of the CIA and Jordanian Intelligence to catch ""al-Saleem"", a fictional jihadist terrorist. Frustrated by their target's elusiveness, differences in their approaches strain relations between a CIA operative, his superior, and the head of Jordanian Intelligence.William Monahan's screenplay, based on the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, examines contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes.When CIA operative Roger Ferris uncovers evidence indicating that a major terrorist leader may be operating out of Jordan, he enlists the aid of CIA veteran Ed Hoffman in infiltrating the elusive saboteur's vast underground network. During the course of his dangerous mission, Ferris gradually comes to question how much he can trust his presumed allies -- who include not just Hoffman, but the outwardly helpful head of Jordanian intelligence as well.The movie relies on the performances of Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio to elevate it beyond the conventional espionage thriller.Scott's direction and visual style were superb but his handling of the story and use of conventions from the spy genre, such as surveillance shots from high altitude spy planes, are simply predictable and formulaic. The performances by leads as the three principals were excellent considering the amount of work they did put in as evidenced with DiCaprio's involvement with his character, Crowe's put-on accent and weight, and Strong's urbane sophistication.To summarize my review,it is complicated movie about the war on terror with two terrific performances and a terrific director but with a story that has been told in many movies before.",Body of Lies
12,jotix100,Spies R'US,7,3 December 2008,"Ridley Scott is one of the directors working in movies these days that can be trusted to deliver a big thriller such as ""Body of Lies"". This is by no means one of his better action packed pictures such as ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Black Rain"", just to name two. With this new venture Mr. Scott puts himself in a category that only a few people can match his ability to give the viewer a good solid two hours of entertainment. The film, based on a David Ignatius novel which we haven't read, was adapted for the screen by William Monahan, the man responsible for most of the success of ""The Departed"".We are taken to the Middle East, to Iraq, specifically, where CIA agent Roger Ferris has been operating at the time of the war in that country. His handler is in Washington, a chubby Ed Hoffman, who gives orders via invisible cell phone. Ferris is involved in following the trail of the man that has been masterminding suicide bombings all over Europe. In order to do that, he goes into Jordan, where a lot of Iranians and Iraqi citizens have fled their war-torn countries.The CIA uses techniques that can only be described as amazing. One thing came to our minds while watching the film, and it has to do if such exact way of monitoring people and sites was possible, why aren't they put to work in the prevention of the crimes themselves? Of course, where there are criminals intent in doing horrible things to their fellow citizens, as well as others, it would be a different world.Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job with his Roger Ferris. This actor is wonderful in most of his recent pictures. He makes a perfect hero with his good looks, attitude and boldness. Roger is always at odds with the boss, a man that clearly sees the situations this operative must deal with from a remote place, not taking into consideration what he is asking his subordinate to do. A chubby Russell Crowe, who has collaborated with the director before, makes an impression by doing so much without upstaging his co-star. The best thing in the film though, is Mark Strong, a Jordanian intelligence man with a keen insight of that part of the world. Mr. Strong cuts an elegant figure in the film.The film owes a lot to Alexander Witt's cinematography, Pietro Scalia's editing and the musical score by Marc Streitenfeld. The film will not disappoint fans of the genre thanks to the direction of Ridley Scott.",Body of Lies
13,dbborroughs,Great spy film works first as a thriller but also as a commentary on Iraq. This is probably the first Iraq film that will have a life outside of its connection to the war,8,21 October 2008,"I've been trying a simple way to explain the plot but its not that easy and its hung up my review of the film for sometime. I can either be very simple and not give you a flavor for the film or I can tell you too much. After much deliberation I'm going to go simple.A CIA agent played by Leonardo DiCaprio who is operating in Iraq get wind of a terrorist organization that maybe working out of Jordan. with the help, hindrance and manipulation of his boss back in the US (Russell Crowe) DiCaprio attempts to penetrate and stop the group before they can kill any more people.That does the film no justice, so let me say that this is the first film dealing with Iraq in a good long while that doesn't feel like a retread or cliché. Its also the first film to deal with the war that will play well as a spy movie when divorced of its subject. Yea its about the war and yea it has implications, but at the same time its a damn fine modern spy thriller and will in the end be remembered as that in ten years time. The cast is wonderful, even if Crowe's and DiCaprio's accents wander in and out. See the film because its a thriller not because its Iraq related.To be certain its not a perfect film, there are a few spy genre clichés it stumbles over but for the most part its a movie to watch with a big soda and a tub of popcorn.Recommended.",Body of Lies
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Credibility,8,8 December 2008,"Ridley Scott is usually one you can depend on to make a good, sometimes fantastic, film, and it'll mostly be well-done. This definitely fits the last two mentioned qualities. The plot is impeccably well-written, and keeps developing very well throughout. The pacing is flawless, it moves fast but never overwhelms, and manages to occasionally slow down, yet always maintains enough speed to keep you interested. The characters are well-written and memorable. The acting is beyond reproach, I see not a single performance that I could complain about. Mark Strong was particularly excellent. The realism is kept immensely high, and there are almost no Hollywood moments in the entirety. The story-telling is masterful, no time is wasted whatsoever, nothing is present that is unnecessary or doesn't serve a purpose. The cinematography and editing are careful and effective. This shows the Arab culture in a neutral light at certain parts, and actually features spoken Arabic, in nice amounts, which I would say should earn it recognition(in addition to all else I've mentioned in this review). I would say that this is a thriller-drama, with action elements... do not watch it expecting constant car-chases or shootings, albeit it is surely intense. It brings up several well-stated and solid points, for and against several sides, and offers food for thought. There is near-constant language, and it is always moderate or more. Also, there is a lot of violence and a little sheer brutality, and it is not for the faint of heart. I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it, not the least of whom the director, and I again state that it is not a popcorn flick. 8/10",Body of Lies

May as well have a charming one who can charm the beautiful Muslim woman right out of her hijab (or right out of her conservative ways).""Body of Lies"" was that until the end.

17,neil-476,Decent topical espionage thriller,8,26 November 2008,"My experience of three of Ridley Scott's earliest films - Alien, Blade Runner, and Legend - led me to the conclusion that he had the most amazing visual sense, but he couldn't tell a story to save his life. I've modified this view somewhat over the years (especially since learning some of the background to those movies), and this latest offering tells a story of some complexity, and tells it well.Body Of Lies is an espionage thriller set in the middle east. Leonardo DiCaprio is an arabic-speaking CIA operative and Russell Crowe is his US-based controller. The main story concerns the search for a shadowy Bin Laden-type character, DiCaprio's attempts to forge a working relationship with the head of Jordanian Security (Mark Strong), and how the fact that both Strong and Crowe are following their own agendas cause practical difficulties on the ground. Factor in DiCaprio's growing romantic interest in a young Arab nurse, and the two hour running time is more than filled.This film held my interest all the way through. The story is topical and credible, there are intermittent action sequences which are all plot relevant and convincing, sometimes frighteningly so (a sequence involving a hammer was very difficult to watch), and all the performances are excellent.My sole reservation relates to DiCaprio. He is now in his 30s and, while his features now look more lived-in, he remains baby-faced. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, unlike his beard. DiCaprio's facial growth is very light, and he sports it throughout this movie. Stubble would be OK, but his ""full"" beard is weak and straggly and, to these eyes, it looks distracting. He should have gone with stubble.But this is a minor quibble, and not enough to mar a decent thriller.",Body of Lies
18,evanston_dad,Solid Action Thriller Set Against the War on Terror,7,6 March 2009,"The war on terror has provided seemingly endless fodder for all manner of movies. Most of them have been earnest and thoughtful and have felt the need to say something important about the issue; unfortunately, most of them have also been dull and plodding and have quickly faded from memory.Ridley Scott's ""Body of Lies"" will not linger in my mind as one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen, but it was refreshing in that it doesn't pretend to be anything more than a good old fashioned action thriller that happens to use the war on terror as a backdrop. Scott keeps his film free of preachiness and editorializing -- this is action film served straight up.Russell Crowe and especially Leonardo DiCaprio acquit themselves well as two members of American intelligence working together, and sometimes opposed to one another, to infiltrate a terror ring, but this is not a film that relies on strong performances. Rather, it relies on a director who knows how to assemble an exciting movie, and Ridley Scott is that guy. He can be somewhat hit-and-miss for me, but this film following closely on the heels of ""American Gangster"" have put me in the pro camp for the time being.Grade: A-",Body of Lies

Director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe team up again and this time, to really spice things up, they drag Leonardo DiCaprio along for the wild ride. This one is quite a visual treat, though at times the story (or stories) is a bit jumbled.Crowe and DiCaprio have a love-hate relationship as CIO operatives and their missions come and go so fast that at one point Leo is in line at the airport to buy a ticket when he gets re-routed by soccer dad, Crowe.Based on the novel by David Ignatius, the espionage thriller is a jolt to blood pressure, though the love story does seem a bit convoluted. Still the bombings, shoot-outs and chases have a very real feel and the best scenes involve the tit-for-tat between Leo and Crowe, and between Leo and Mark Strong.As with ""Syriana"", I am not sure how the producers thought this subject matter might appeal to a wide audience, but it certainly has enough appeal for those fans of the genre.",Body of Lies

Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover CIA agent who feels torn in two directions as instructions from his boss, played by Russell Crowe nearly result in his death. It is a hunt for terrorist activity in Iraq and director Ridley Scott supplies the difference between an agent on the field and an agent observing. Scott is a skilled filmmaker who has made such classic fare as Blade Runner and Alien. Like American Gangster the previous year he proves that he is just as effective in action as he is in science fiction. Strong performances from DiCaprio as a frustrated agent who feels surrounded by deceit and unable to gain a handle on his circumstance. Crowe is great in this role because he believes that he is doing the right thing but he is in constant debate with DiCaprio who is on the field. Crowe is also an agent who is oblivious balancing family time with work. Fine supporting work by Mark Strong who steals every scene he is in as another agent. Golshifteh Farahani plays a nurse whom DiCaprio has relations with but she may become a bargaining chip. Oscar Isaac plays DiCaprio's CIA associate on the field in search of a safe house.

I get the movie's message, that we need troops on the ground who know the area, just not spy planes etc. The other message is no one is innocent in the wicked games that are played with the war on terror. I would rent the movie, but not buy Body of lies. I like the part where Jordian intelligence guy knew what the CIA operative knew, but either could not tell the truth.

22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Body of Lies,9,12 November 2008,"If you'd believe the angle the trailers adopted for this movie, I guess you're more than likely to deem it an adversarial duel between DiCaprio and Crowe, with the latter being some armchair smarty-pants willing to risk it all to ""save civilization"" by betraying the former. Well thankfully, the story is a lot more than that, and being a clash of ideals, personality and tactics, while still working on and for the same side, makes this a much more gripping thriller to sit through.We have Bourne, Bond and the occasional Spy Vs Spy type of movie, but Ridley Scott, in an adaptation of David Ignatius' novel of the same name, puts a very realistic spin on this, perhaps even too close in its unflinching take on the topical events on Terrorism, as is its treatment of the intelligence warfare game that that part of the world could be engaged in right now, where the truth is an invaluable commodity that can be traded, and half truths often passing off as facts, with lies just clouding and muddling everything up. While it does make the CIA look inept in the portrayal here, and puts the Jordanian intelligence service in much more competent light, you'd start to realize that anti-terrorism efforts do boil down to basic level human to human trust, cooperation and competence.Russell Crowe stars as Ed Hoffman, the head honcho of a very high tech counter-terrorism department with plenty of fanciful monitors to view events unfold thousands of miles away, and with advanced weaponry to call upon at his disposal, with a penchant for running many simultaneous side operations privately. But of course being far away from the action, he very much relies on his best field agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), young, energetic, smart and with the linguistic ability of Arabic, to feed him much needed intelligence from which to formulate his strategies. So we have an experienced, cunning management strategist, and a go-getter operations guy in what would be a dream-team pairing, if not for their fairly constant arguments because they each subscribe to different philosophies and approaches to the same problem. Which is to nab one highly wanted fictional terrorist who has faded off everyone's radar, because of the low-tech way how these terrorists operate.Sitting through this well paced film, you do come to appreciate how different tactics work at different times, with the US style of blowing up everything without remorse or much deliberate thought, versus the Arab's way of measured sowing of seeds of infiltration. One you get instant results, but not much to follow up from, and the other the results come far later, but providing constant intelligence feed, and moles everywhere definitely helps. On one hand, we get Ed Hoffman who pretty much bulldozes everything in his path, while on the other as Ferris would have preferred, to have trust in their Arab counterparts for the convenient cultivation of allies, which Hoffman clearly frowns upon given his preference for dispatching staffers who are no longer useful.With a number of similar genre films as The Kingdom, Syriana, Rendition and the likes, think of Body of Lies as all their good bits rolled into one, where the terrorists are indeed one ingenious bunch who think of simple tactics to thwart technology which they lack. You'll be left guessing and second guessing the intent of everyone in the film, and this amounts to putting yourself in the character's shoes, and allows you to play along as you decide whom you'd like to trust. However, there is a romance subplot thrown in which while crucial, I thought it distracted us a little from the main storyline of mole against mole and the devising and execution of a radical strategy, and of course for a movie to wrap everything up just after two hours, the ending might just be a little tad too convenient, and perhaps wishful thinking of everyone in the real world of course, to have problems solved with that little effort.While Ridley Scott has collaborated with Russell Crowe for a number of films already  Gladiator, A Good Year, American Gangsters and the upcoming Nottingham, here Crowe clearly takes a back seat, as hinted by the marquee on the poster which puts DiCaprio's name first. His character of Hoffman flits in and out of the film, being the unliked strategist pulling strings over satellite pictures from Langley. Most times we see him as a family man trying to set things ""right"" over the phone, while being an inept father. But when it comes down to walking the talk, he's definitely a force to be reckoned with, and his vast experience in great contrast to DiCaprio's young upstart character of Ferris. I thought DiCaprio is consciously moving away from his pretty boy romantic image by picking on more mature roles which require him to flex more of his acting chops, as seen with the likes of his roles in The Departed, The Aviator and even Blood Diamonds. He clearly carries the film here on his shoulders, being given some of the best lines about the current situation in the movie, and some fine balance with action sequences. If anyone's growing from strength to strength from movie to movie, my vote will go to DiCaprio, hands down.With an all round story which resonates viz-a-viz the real world, and commendable leads and supporting cast to pull this through, Ridley Scott delivers yet again a riveting tale that could rank high on my list as the top movies of the year. Highly recommended!",Body of Lies
23,siderite,This should have been better,6,31 March 2009,"If you compare it with other movies then yes, it is above average, but compared with the quality I would expect from a political thriller directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio, it is close to bad.Leonardo DiCaprio played marvelously, proving again that his boyish charm and looks are not the only reason he is a star, however, the character was more or less similar with the one in the previous movie, down to the head cap. He is a CIA agent that is very good at what he is doing, but maintains a strong conscience and a true innocence. He is basically the senior technician.But after describing the basic outline of the plot, it all goes haywire. Sacrifices in the name of a girl he just met, moral dilemmas after he orchestrates everything, his boss being a complete moron, etc. The effects were very well done, the acting was top notch, but the plot... it stank to high heavens.Bottom line: you could conceivably enjoy it, but don't expect too much.",Body of Lies

'Body of Lies' Synopsis: A CIA agent on the ground in Jordan hunts down a powerful terrorist leader while being caught between the unclear intentions of his American supervisors and Jordon Intelligence.'Body of Lies' has an utterly terrific first-hour, but an average second. The film begins masterfully & the intense mood of the film keeps you the edge of your seat. Its the second-hour, that's acts as a deterrent. The pace drops, and even the twists & turns in this hour, are predictable. William Monahan's Adapted Screenplay works hugely in the first-hour, but lacks the bite in the latter hour. Ridley Scott's Direction is intense. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are superb. Action-Sequences/Stunts are impressive. Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent. He enacts the central part with effortless ease. Russell Crowe is simply brilliant. Not a single false note could I find in his performance. Mark Strong is terrific, as well. Golshifteh Farahani is charming. In cameos, Oscar Isaac & Simon McBurney are most effective. On the whole, Despite its flaws, 'Body of Lies' is A Well-Made Action-Spy Thriller!",Body of Lies
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Too complicated for my tastes,6,12 November 2008,"Gosh, I know I'm going to receive a lot of hate for this review, seeing how the rating is pretty high on Body of Lies, but honestly, I just could not get into this movie. Don't get me wrong, I was really looking forward to it, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, it's like an automatic can't miss and would also just be a great movie. One thing I can definitely say is that Leonardo is doing a lot of serious message movies lately. There are a good hand full of political thrillers, but for me, I've never had one that I could watch a second time, so I thought Body of Lies might change that for me. Unfortunately I just wanted to beat myself after this movie, my head hurt so much, I know that sounds so bad, but for me this plot was just too complicated. I even had to step out for a few minutes during the movie just to take a breath. Now I'm going to try to explain the story as best as I can so just bare with me.Roger Ferris is a CIA agent who goes undercover quit a bit, constantly capturing terrorists, pretty much is always a success and he even gets promoted. But now he must go deeper, he must befriend a terrorist leader who tells him off the bat his one rule is to not lie, obviously if Ferris is caught, he will be tortured to death. Ferris wants to constantly pull out when things get too tight and he knows his cover will be blown, but his boss at home, Ed Hoffman won't let him, not understanding how far Ferris is away and how scary it must be to be in this situation and just doing his best not to get caught.Body of Lies was by no means a bad movie, I hope that the IMDb users understand that. I think it's just better to wait for the rental, because this movie is just incredibly deep and you definitely need a chance to pause the movie and breathe. The subject matter is just very intense not to mention this is a thinking movie, so you have to be in a certain state of mind. But the performances definitely make it worth your while, the surprise performance came from Mark Strong who plays the lead terrorist who Leonardo must befriend, his performance was the one that stood out to me best. Over all, this is a well made film, I think the subject is a little too dark, but this is a rental movie if you are into political thrillers.6/10",Body of Lies
26,blanbrn,An okay political and terrorism thriller with a sneaky twisting plot that's dramatic yet nothing special.,6,13 October 2008,"""Body of Lies"" is the latest in the ever going on lineup of films about the Middle East and the war on terror. And in my opinion while it entertains and has the star power in Crowe and Dicaprio it just falls a little flat to me. Directed by veteran Ridley Scott the film is well done as being a global drama of betrayal and CIA espionage it has the typical big scene explosions yet in the end after the plot twist it appears to be a far out film of a flush out of how to defeat terrorists, yet it fails to show that really our foes remain much more hidden as in real life the common sense approach doesn't always work like it does in this film. Young star Leonardo Dicaprio is CIA operative Roger Ferris who's doing the dirty undercover work in the Middle East. All of his information comes from veteran CIA desk man Ed Hoffman(Russell Crowe)they both have intentions to trap a mysterious radical leader only when making contact with general intelligence in another country the film takes on some interesting intrigue. The question enters who can you trust? is it a setup? or will the CIA go to any means to catch a terrorists? Overall the plot twist and mind games are the best part of the film because the explosions were expected anyway, yet this genre of Middle East cinema is getting old as even the star power of Crowe and Dicaprio doesn't carry it to being a winner.",Body of Lies
27,KineticSeoul,It's a entertaining spy thriller with a bit of political aspects thrown in,8,31 October 2009,"The CIA is on a hunt to bring down the main guy involved in the waves of terrorist attacks, the one that is running the devious terrorist organization. Roger Ferris(Leonardo DiCaprio) is the agency's man to bring the bastard down and the person that is keeping an eye on Ferris is Ed Hoffman(Russell Crowe) who is a intelligent but ignorant person that comes up with strategies from a thousand miles away from the actual danger and gives Ferris orders to do the dirty job, while also being the good family man at home. Hoffman wants things done his way and his way only with no exceptions. Which also can be more of a pain than a benefit since it also jeopardizes the mission which just shows that he is power hungry. This is a intelligent and thought provoking spy movie with some good amount of action thrown in and it doesn't drive the audiences to be confused, which is most definitely is a plus. Since a lot of movies like these has too much to do with politics and tries to be more confusing than what it really is. And since it's not that complicated or a deep film is why I think some people might bash on this movie. The character that stood out the most has to be Hani Salaam(Mark Strong) who is the head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Department and works with Ferris to take down the terrorist leader. And the only thing he want from Ferris in return is for him to not to lie to him and show him respect and trust. This has got to be Mark Strong's most memorable performance, he played his role in a very charming and charismatic way of being uber cool. He is cool and such a bada** that he can actually get away with saying ""my dear"" to anyone and still look bada**. I didn't like Leonardo DiCaprio playing Ferris though although he did a okay job, I don't think he is that great of a actor like what some people give him credit for, his character was actually similar to Danny Archer in ""Blood Diamond"" DiCaprio's past movie before "" The Departed"" without the terrible Australian accent. The chemistry between Ferris and Aisha isn't believable and seem to drag the movie, but there relationship plays a big role during the film's climax so it's forgivable. Also seeing Ferris working with Hoffman to come up with a strategy to take down the terrorist leader by taking advantage of his weakness was cool to watch as well. This was a awesome spy movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, it is a entertaining and thought provoking action movie.8/10",Body of Lies
28,Buddy-51,absorbing political thriller,8,9 November 2008,"Less pedantic than ""Lions for Lambs,"" but more pulpy than ""Rendition"" or ""Stop-Loss,"" ""Body of Lies"" is Hollywood's latest endeavor to bring the war-on-terror to the silver screen.Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover CIA operative working in the explosive Middle East under the guiding hand of Russell Crowe, his ruthless, acerbic boss who feeds him instructions straight from his cushy office at Langley Headquarters. Despite their double billing, Di Caprio and Crowe rarely appear on screen together, making DiCaprio the default star of the picture. He gives one of his finest performances as a man thoroughly dedicated to the cause he is fighting for but deeply cognizant of the fact that much of what he is required to do in the course of his job will wind up robbing him of a certain percentage of his humanity after all is said and done. Crowe as the cynical boss and, even more impressively, Mark Strong as a high official in the Jordanian government offer superlative support.As directed by Ridley Scott (from a screenplay by William Monahan based on a novel by David Ignatius), ""Body of Lies"" benefits from engaging dialogue, exciting action sequences and razor-sharp editing. The movie is long (128 minutes) but rarely uninteresting, and DiCaprio makes us care deeply about his character.It may not be the ""deepest"" of the war-on-terror movies, but it's certainly one of the most watchable.",Body of Lies
29,thesar-2,Body of White Lies,2,11 October 2009,"A friend called me 1 hour 40 minutes into the 2 hour 8 minute runtime of 'Body of Lies.' She asked me if she should let me go back to watching it and I debated, even after investing that much time and more than two-thirds done. I screamed 'I don't know what the hell is going on here!' Well, my statement, though it was true I said it, wasn't 100% accurate. I did have somewhat of an idea, but I was so incredibly bored, and the final 28 minutes didn't change anything. As for Crowe, an established, though hot-headed actor, literally ""phoned"" his performance in. I kept laughing at him throughout as a lot of critics hate it when an actor does that, and considering he spent 90% of his screen time on the phone (i.e. ""Kill, Kill, Kill"" and ""Get ready for school"" simultaneously,) I'm not too far off. Leo overacted as he usually does. And the 'Lies' that's in the title – what is this? Pre-Nixon, where the general public believes the government couldn't possibly lie, or commanding officers can't be deceitful? Are you serious? This probably would've been best served as a period piece war movie. Generally, I would write a synopsis in my reviews, but I saw this a few days back. I've already forgotten almost the entire ""spy-war-suspense"" plot and I doubt I could've done much better minutes after the viewing. Suffice to say, Crowe's pulling the cords in his lovely ""American-Dream"" home while Leo's pretending to be Middle Eastern to stop terrorist. Oh, and some people lie. Skip this mess, there was absolutely nothing new. And in a year that brought us the terrific 'The Hurt Locker,' I'm ashamed to call Scott a great director anymore.",Body of Lies
30,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Good performances, but sadly a dull and disappointing thriller",4,9 December 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A major terrorist plot is thwarted in Manchester, England, sparking fears that a new terrorist cell has sprung up and may be planning attacks around the world. It's not long, of course, before the major American intelligence gets wind of it and assigns Agent Ferris (Leanardo Di Caprio) to rendezvous with a source who claims to have information. He forms a relationship with Hani (Mark Strong), an Ammanian intelligence operative who he fools into searching for made up lead Abraham Sedeeki so he can get a grip on the real threat. All the while, Ferris is relying on information relayed to him by Field Agent Hofman (Russell Crowe) but is he playing him for his own agenda? Ridley Scott is a dedicated player in the world of film, bringing out a film each year without fail. The memory of last year's excellent American Gangster still lingers in my mind, but sadly after Body of Lies it's all too bittersweet.The film plays on current affairs in relation to terrorist cells springing up all over the world, a tale torn straight from today's headlines, in fact. It also subtly highlights the scary American surveillance technology that keeps tabs on everyone around the world and of events that threaten it's national security around the world, significant after 9/11 when suspected terrorists were taken from their homeland and placed in places such as Guantanamo Bay (even more pertinent with yesterday's confession of the 9/11 plotters. Yet with all this interesting stuff involved, Body of Lies is still an unbearably dull film. Maybe I'm a bit thick or just have a short attention span (yeah, that's it) but I found the sluggish pace of the film to just make it all really uninvolving. Scott's typically long, drawn out, humourless direction doesn't help matters and you just feel someone more hip and modern may have been of more use here.One thing you can't fault is the performances and the dedication behind them. Di Caprio has truly made the jump from teen heart throb to serious actor with serious, mature roles like this and he gives his role energy and gusto. Praise too for Crowe for immersing himself in the role of Director Hofman, purposely gaining 40 ibs for the role. He seems determined of taking the method acting route of Robert De Niro with this and previous roles, including his most recent American Gangster, where he asked for tapes so he could get his voice to sound just like that of Det. Richie Roberts. Sadly, they are not enough to raise this desperately dull take on modern fears regarding terrorism above it's roots. It's probably more my fault that I didn't like it, but I don't have a Mouth of Lies. **",Body of Lies
31,dromasca,better than average action thriller on a complex political territory,6,2 May 2009,"Making a thriller or action movie set on the background of the Middle East conflict may be almost as difficult as finding a solution of the conflict itself. How to avoid taking parts and alienate viewers on one or the other side of the conflict, how to build a cast and find locations that look credible, how to bring together characters from different cultures without hurting to many sensitivities and making too obvious mistakes, how to give to these characters enough depth so that they do not look just as stereotypes? Ridley Scott had to deal with these questions and many other, and the result is one of the better action films (and certainly not the last) this long conflict generated lately.The two principal characters in the film - super-spy-with-a-soul Ferris (DiCaprio) and master-spy-manipulator Hoffman (Crowe) are the pillars of the film. Connected permanently by a too perfect mobile phone technology they play mortal war games in the labyrinth of the Middle East anti-terror wars, Ferris facing permanently death, treachery and violence, Hoffman from his CIA desk in Virginia or even while driving his kids to school. The dichotomy between the high-tech world of the spy agency and the ground reality is part of the message of the film, which tries and partially succeeds to say more about the moral differences and the cultural issues that face the complicated dialog sometimes sliding into confrontation between the American and their Middle East partners/enemies.The lesser achievements of the film lie in what surrounds the two characters. While the film succeeds better than other similar films in rendering the local details, the atmosphere and the differences between the different places in the Middle East where the action is set, it still lacks credibility in building a set of local characters that are complex enough and interesting enough to be remembered. The more interesting character of the Jordanian chief of intelligence played by Mark Strong seems to belong more in a James Bond film than here. All these make the final part of the film hard to believe and too much alike many other films we have already seen.The Middle East conflict is unfortunately here to stay for many years, and many other films will be made around it. 'Body of Lies' is not bad as an action film, Ridley Scott is a professional and the result is a well-paced film that keeps the interest for all the duration of the screening, yet my feeling is that the more important films on the theme are yet to come.",Body of Lies

37,Rodrigo_Amaro,War on Terror,10,6 July 2010,"On the trail of movies like ""Spy Game"", ""Syriana"", ""Rendition"" and ""The Kingdom"" Ridley Scott's action film ""Body of Lies"" might not be an original work, it is filled with countless clichés but it still is a worth seeing film about the global war on terror. Less intellectualized than all the movies mentioned ""Body of Lies"" is a great accomplish by not stating a too much political point of view (most notably on not showing any judgments toward the U.S. politics on the war of Iraq or similar) but instead of that focused on the dangers of the global terrorism and how a terrorist cell attacks his ""enemies"" in so-called ""Holy Wars"".Forget about James Bond for just one second and think about these two opposite agents working on CIA and their ways to reach their goals. Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a field agent sent to several locations in the Middle East like Jordannia, Iraq, Amman, Dubai fighting the real battle against terrorists. Undercovered as a Muslim guy he's the one who got to survive bomb attacks, shooting, tortures and other threats while his fat boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) stays safe in home in America, always on his cell-phone only ordering Ferris to travel and fulfill his missions, and he gets the credit for all of Ferris work. But these two got one enemy in common, the terrorist sheik Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul) whose terrorists attacks on Manchester and in Amsterdan and possible threats to U.S. are disturbing the peace of many people. And that includes Hani (Mark Strong, excellent performance) the Jordannian Chief of Intelligence and an Allie with the CIA; he helps Ferris sharing informations on how to destroy Al-Saleem's plans. Hani is a man of great help for Ferris and he's not the kind of person that you can easily tell lies in front of him, friendship and collaborations means something to this powerful man but he doesn't get along too well with the two faced Hoffman, and Hoffman always tries to make a wrong move, ruining Ferris mission on Jordannia and his trust relationship with Hani. The strange contradiction of this story is that even if Ferris/Hoffman are supplied by the powers of technology (cell-phones, spy-satellites and other stuff) they're not able to catch the terrorists so easily just because these guys are living like 400 years ago, hiding themselves in the desert (Matt Damon's speech on the desert in ""Syriana"" suits perfectly here). The screenplay (based on David Ignatius book) is good but not great. There are some good old clichés (a romance between Ferris and a Iranian doctor); some implausible and not so good explained things (Ferris unnecessary torture scene with his fingers smashed, after all Hani infiltrated another agent on Al-Saleem's refuge so Ferris being captured sounds very pointless). On the good points of the story is the portrayal of the Arab characters, one of those rare times where you won't find stereotypes, excessive and extreme behavior pointed in so many other films; here we got a more deep look on Middle East affairs; and some of the secret weapons on the war on terror.People who claimed to have a dislike on this are missing the point. In simple words it is a film about how a dangerous job is done for a greater cause and how different people reacts towards on it. Some people will do the dirty work wanting to prevent that more bad things happen (Ferris); others won't share informations and will ruin a big operation in order to make things easily for himself and for his politician friends (Hoffman). A look into different hearts and minds with one common purpose.The performances were target of many criticism for many moviegoers and I think this was a underrated aspect of the film. DiCaprio is very good, delivering one of the funniest and infamous lines in the film history (""I need to take a s***, I need a shower and an Internet connection,""). Perhaps his ""fake"" beard and his so many Arab knowledge bothered some viewers. Crowe is incredibly good here and many people claimed he was wasted, that his character was a annoying fast talker. NO! He really lived this kind of guy, who always does two things at a time talking in the phone with Ferris and taking care of his kids, the guy who's never gonna live in danger, and never is gonna protect his field agent, even making his mission more dangerous. But if DiCaprio and Crowe are good Mark Strong is even better and he's got the best performance here. As a fellow film critic noticed you can't take your eyes off him. His character is friendly, good looking but he knows exactly how to show his sinister and darker side only with some smooth talk, very politely. He made of Hani a man of an incredible intelligence and power. It might not be Ridley Scott's greatest work, but his talent prevails here better than in some other minor films he made in his entire career. 10/10",Body of Lies
38,Dr_Coulardeau,"After the war, the mess and the cleaning up",10,7 December 2008,"This film is a pamphlet and as such is an essential film in our consciousness of reality the way it may be in this globalized world. It shows how the West cannot win the war in which we have engage ourselves without even thinking it over twice. The war that must be stopped at once, and at once is already too late, that war against Islam, even if we pretend at times it is only against the Arabs because we don't want to know better, this war is lost, and was lost even before starting it, because it is not a war against terror at all , but a war against those who don't want to be westernized because we have been dumb enough to pretend that the American way of life was the future of the world, once again without even thinking it over twice. But what can we do in that situation? Nothing, absolutely nothing. The war is in fact between those in the Moslem world who want to move with history and benefit from the alleviating technology of the modern world on one hand, and the others in the Moslem world who do not want that alleviating effect because for them suffering and physical exhaustion and corporal punishments are the norm and have to go on for ever because they are the law of god. They can accept modern technology but only if it enables them to fight the world that has produced it. In fact the conflict is a conflict we have known before them when we were divided between those who wanted to go on with the good old faith that was telling us every single detail we were supposed to respect, accept and suffer in our daily life in the name of our own god and in the patient expectation of the coming redemption of our liberation by death. That was the struggle we had to fight for education against those who wanted to keep us uneducated. And it is the fight we are still fighting in our modern countries against those who do not see the necessity of restructuring our economy, our political system, our daily life and want to keep everything the way it has always been,  well at least the way it has been for fifty years or so, maybe even less. They would certainly not torture anyone, except that they do sabotage the railroads and everyone would like to make us believe that it is not dangerous for anyone. Ask the students who would like to study for their future and who are blocked out of their classrooms by minorities who are numerous enough (most of the time a couple of dozens) to block the lifts that go up in the buildings and that blockade makes the security services stop all possible circulation in the buildings and on campus if necessary in the name of the risks people would run if they let them go through the blocking picket lines. The film is thus an absolute denunciation of the war on terror as being lost even before being fought, and as a means to make our own best patriots and soldiers regress to the level of pure animals, birds of prey, carnivorous saber tigers straight out of the jungle or Siberia, in one word regress back to the time of the crusades. And finally this film reveals to anyone who wants to know about it how the present surveillance based on the satellites over our heads enables the people behind the screens that receive their images to see details that are so small that they could not have a better view if they were just ten yards away. That mess was not created by Bush, of course not. He was just dumb enough to fall into the trap and Cheney was dumb enough to believe he could win that war, and John McCain knows how to win a war, like the one in Vietnam, or the one in Somalia, or the one in Afghanistan, or the one in Iraq, or  what would the next one be if these warmongers had the power to start a new one? And imagine the mess Barack Obama has to clean up, because now the eggs have been broken the omelet must be cooked. Good luck if we do not want the whole kitchen to explode knowing there are tons of flame sensitive explosive hovering just one foot over the gas-burner.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Body of Lies
39,Floated2,Fitting in a Tone,7,30 September 2015,"Body Of Lies is certainly a film about the world since that event. It's based on a 2007 novel by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who has reported extensively on the Middle East. It's not acknowledged but I suspect both book and movie are also influenced by the recent rash of spy-and-tell books by former CIA agents. The best known of these is by Robert Baer, who left the agency in 1997 after 20 years. Baer was considered one of the best field officers in the Middle East. One of his complaints about the CIA was that it neglected real spy work on the ground in favor of electronic intelligence.

I always thought that Ridley was like a renaissance artist, directing deep movies with powerful visual (a sort of a serious Tim Burton) so it's highly disappointing that this aesthete had done this absurd propaganda. It's impossible to believe in this blur of private and public life: I don't think that arresting criminals can be supervised from home nor than a love story can explain the demise of highly wanted terrorist. It's nonsense because no Arabic women would date so openly an American in the gulf, especially a spy! It's extremist propaganda because it justifies an invasion to fight terrorism and terrorism to fight an invasion. Pretexts from both sides are depicted like truth and that's the way of disinformation. It's amazing to see that a foreign country can occupy another, without being denounced as an aggressor. It's alarming to see that an intelligence administration has the technology to spy on everyone, everywhere. It can be police, military, executioner without any checks. At last, it's a pity to see that life in this modern global village is reduced to mobile conversations. Nowadays, the action movie genre has become a conversation genre.So, the story, the characters, their motivation are stupid and I can't buy it. The only appeal to this movie is the natural, native landscape and towns from morocco and the call for a talented cast. Nobody would believe that a gladiator could become such fat and Miss Farahani is a fresh newcomer.",Body of Lies
41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Good, but not as special as its talents would lead you to believe",7,28 July 2009,"Leonardo DiCaprio's done better. Russell Crowe's done better. Without a doubt, Ridley Scott has done better. Still, ""Body of Lies"" is an entertaining spy thriller that enjoys blowing stuff up and gunning down keffiyeh-wearing terrorists on location in the Middle East. It's good, it's just not the tour de force one might expect from the director of ""Black Hawk Down,"" the writer of ""The Departed"" and two stars with six Oscar noms between them.DiCaprio and Crowe star as two guys working for the CIA: the first an undercover field agent and the second his Southern-drawled superior who operates from Langley. DiCaprio gets sent to Jordan where he's trying to track down a major terrorist leader with the cooperation of Jordan's intelligence agency led by Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Disconnect between the two men leaves a lot of people dead and injured and mistrust between many sides leads to greater conflict.Like most other films set in the Middle East these days such as ""The Kingdom"" and ""Syriana,"" ""Body of Lies"" is thriller and action-oriented, not a drama. With numerous action genre credits to his name, Scott makes it look good, there's no denying that. There's just no ""it"" factor to make the film stand out. There's nothing so original or no twist so unforeseeable that could make this movie memorable.DiCaprio and Crowe are excellent, but these roles are small stuff for them. DiCaprio's character Roger Ferris, a tough and courageous bigmouth, isn't that short of his ""The Departed"" character and Crowe's newly grown potbelly, white hair and overuse of ending phrases with ""buddy"" might be different but don't exactly constitute a challenge for the guy who played the vengeful gladiator Maximus and the brilliant but haunted mathematician John Nash. These characters' spiteful and reckless working relationship is humorous but nothing all that inspiring.""Body of Lies"" is fast-paced, full of talent and Will Monahan's script easy to follow for the most part, but movies like this need to be able to boast something that other films of the genre don't have, and in the case of ""Body of Lies,"" having one of the greatest action/thriller directors ever and two of the best actors of their generation is not enough to make the film go from entertaining to something special.",Body of Lies
42,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Those to whom evil is done do evil in return.""",9,1 March 2009,"Body of Lies is a fast-paced action thriller laced with a healthy dose of some of the more dangerous of modern political and military realities. It is, however, also laced with over-the- top action sequences and just a little too much Rambo-style superhuman stunts, although not exactly of the action variety. It has a dense and realistic narrative, although one that moves along at such a fast pace that you're almost afraid to take your eyes and ears off of it even for a second for fear of missing something. I found myself rewinding the DVD at least once every ten minutes or so to make sure I got everything right.This does, however, make for a very engaging action movie with a strong appeal to the more mature viewers, who are sure to appreciate a break from the standard Hollywood trash. It requires constant thought about and re-analysis of our political beliefs, but it doesn't ever overtly support or condemn either side (if, in fact, the collective whole were to be reduced to two sides). For a movie to so directly approach the tense political atmosphere and the controversial situation of the American wars in the Middle East and not come off as pushing a political agenda of its own is a feat in itself, and it's only one of the many that Body of Lies successfully pulls off.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Roger Ferris the CIA's man on the ground in the Middle East, who keeps in amazingly close contact with Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) via what must be a satellite phone, and a miraculously reliable one. Ferris shuttles easily between Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and other locations, speaking sufficiently fluent Arabic that he is not only able to pass himself off as a local but can also recognize his nurse's hometown by her accent. This guy has studied well.Hoffman is the bureaucrat back in Washington, an overweight white guy with a Texan accent and such a swagger in his attitude that it would not be at all surprising to see him wearing cowboy boots and smoking an enormous cigar. The comparisons to the real players in America's presidency (at the time of the movie) are as obvious as possible, and Ferris represents the movie's political statement, which thankfully is not for or against the war but for reminding us that what we see in TV is not the reality on the ground over there.Ferris and Hoffman are seeking out a terrorist kingpin, an obvious Osama bin Laden clone, which forces them to form a shaky allegiance with the head of the Jordanian Intelligence Agency, a deadly serious man named Hani Salaam. His one, simple request, ""Do not lie to me,"" seems simple enough and Ferris believes himself when he agrees to it, but deteriorating matters on the ground and conflicting orders from Hoffman start to make his promise more and more difficult to keep.The story takes us all over the world, but concentrates mostly on events taking place in Washington and the Middle East. The leap-frogging that Hoffman does between the U.S. and Iraq (and the effortless leap-frogging that Ferris does all over the Middle East) seem like something that belongs in a 007 movie, but the exaggerations of their tactical abilities are all designed to make a very important point. In fact, if the movie weren't grounded in reality by the message that it's passing on, it would easily have come off as little more than a tense political thriller with little bearing on real life other than passing on the political points of view of the film-making team behind it. The movie is about the American war in Iraq, there is no point beating around that little bush. It's about the Bush administration having brought us there and it's about the fact that now we're there and there is no end in sight. But it doesn't criticize the war or the war effort, it's about the harsh reality that there is no all-good side and no all-bad side. Hoffman repeats several times in the movie that no one is innocent in all of this as he tries to convince Ferris of the fact that in order to save lives, some innocent lives have to be lost. Ferris can't accept this, especially when it becomes personal, but he understands that it's true. In order to defeat this kind of enemy, we have to become like them in more ways than most people are willing to accept. The other problem is that, in the war against terrorism, the terrorists are invisible, and it's the well-prepared, trained, armed, and uniformed soldiers who are the easy targets, and for every one of them that we kill or capture, not only do two more spring up where they were, but an unknown number of innocent lives are all too often lost. This does not speak well for our chances of success.Ridley Scott builds here on his work in his outstanding film Black Hawk Down, and DiCaprio is also picking up where he left off in Blood Diamond, as an American with an incredible ability to blend into very different cultures and as a man that simply looks great yelling into a cell phone. Russell Crowe captures the all-American swagger (and arrogance?) that got us into trouble in the first place, and for all of its excesses, it isn't until the final scene that the movie really reveals the real differences between Hoffman and Ferris which illustrate the meaning of the movie.In a heated exchange, when Ferris approaches the idea of no longer working for the CIA, Hoffman is understandably unhappy. ""You walk out that door,"" he says, ""and you're walking out on America.""""Be careful,"" Ferris says, ""about calling yourself America""",Body of Lies
43,jzappa,An Enjoyable 128-Minute Stock Phrase,7,1 November 2008,"In spite of the genuine relevant locales and concise dialogue, Ridley Scott's all-American action thriller is just a plot from one of his younger brother's movies slapped onto the framework of this morning's front page subject matter. This fundamentally well-plotted actioner wants to be convincing in its knowledge of modern-day espionage tactics and equipment, the inner workings of terrorism, the CIA and Middle East political affairs, but its hero is a hardened desperado who functions in three countries, albeit close together, all alone fabricates a decoy terrorist organization, and endures through explosions, gunfights, and unbearable torture. Throughout all this, he manages to find the time and energy to maintain a beautiful Jordanian nurse as a love interest. And needless to say he speaks Arabic sufficiently well to be believed to be a resident.The hero is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, He appears to function as a freelance in the war against a terrorist organization, naturally representing al-Qaeda. His idea is to concoct a competing terrorist organization, depict a low-profile terrorist financier as the rival leader and craft a persuasive evidence stream, all in order to bait the enigmatic bin Ladin-like head of the real terrorists. Why will he gamble his whole operation by coming out of hiding? His ego is his weakness. His illusory competitor is hurting his pride.The most stimulating facet of the hero's exploits is his developing cynicism with them. He finds one inside comrade has been deserted to confront definite demise, and after he frames he who will unconsciously take the part of the commander of the fabricated terror group, DiCaprio alone tries to save the guy's life from an expected hit. That DiCaprio survives this man's outcome is decidedly improbable.Scott's entertaining phone-in hinges on two gadgetry phenomenons. One is the power of DiCaprio's character to preserve unproblematic on-the-spot cell phone communication with Russell Crowe, back in the US. Sporting an ear-mounted domestic devices, he gives the impression of carrying on sustained dialogue with his superior, even throughout death- defying action scenes while Crowe is taking care of his kids or eating breakfast on his back porch. The other high-tech element is airborne surveillance so clear-cut that it can see a specific person minding his own business on a busy street. The aerial point of view is so steady and secure that it's difficult to fathom its source as a high-altitude plane.The romantic subplot is practical in portraying a Muslim woman's struggle with Western relationships. It is less rational in determining why she and DiCaprio are taking such a chance, seeing as they're given no consequential dialogue to form their connection in a way where it could understandably exist once he leaves the doctor's office. She clearly functions as an expedient plot device that sets up the film's doubtful finale.The acting is generally credible. DiCaprio makes his frustrated action hero convincing enough that we are entertained during the irrational action-adventure formula through which he is put by former Spy Magazine editor William Monahan who, after winning an Oscar for penning Scorsese's The Departed featuring a similar undercover hero in peril for DiCaprio, adapted Washington Post columnist and associate editor David Ignatius's novel. The story renders the protagonist as an American who becomes disgusted with the war in Iraq and the role of the CIA in it. Crowe, who curiously gained 50 pounds for his rather scarce screen time, is DiCaprio's unrelentingly commonsensical boss. I liked Mark Strong's performance as the debonair Jordanian intelligence head, who, like James Bond, perfectly juggles his love of decadence and women with his total grasp of his duty.So this enjoyable 128-minute stock phrase is in a realistic enough context for one to see its topical implication, but a formulaic Hollywood script. Some will see it because they are interested in its relevance to our current state of affairs. Some will just want to see some action, violence and high-tech production values. I don't think it was the greatest idea to put a formula spy plot into the context of what we enter the theater prepared to take seriously, not so much because it sensationalizes anything but because it takes a pivotal opportunity to make the first successful film about the war in Iraq and makes that milieu interchangeable. And so its topical point is lost, because people watch movies trying to see what they want to see. That's why nobody really sees the same movie.",Body of Lies
44,Turfseer,CIA made to look bad again in this mildly interesting spy thriller,5,13 June 2009,"Body of Lies is a story about a CIA operative played by Leonard Dicarprio and his boss, Ed Hoffman, played by Russell Crowe. Crowe gained about 40 lbs to play the middle-aged supervisor Hoffman who spends a good deal of time on a cellphone from CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia talking with Dicaprio's Roger Ferris who shuttles around the Mideast, principally in Iraq and Amman, Jordan. Ridley Scott, the director, makes use of pinpoint satellite images throughout the movie, suggesting that the CIA has the ability to spy on various targets closeup through the use of overhead drones. It's very cool looking but can they actually do that? I wonder.Body of Lies is divided into three sequences, the first taking place in Iraq where Ferris attempts to make contact with an Iraqi who may or may not have information about Al Qaeda. The informant's cover is blown and Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent the informant from being tortured and revealing Ferris's identity. The first sequence ends in an exciting shootout with militants in a rural area where Ferris obtains information regarding a safe house in Amman, Jordan.The second sequence involves Ferris taking over CIA operations in Jordan. He meets with the Jordanian intelligence chief, Hani Salaam, played by the British actor, Mark Srong. Hani is depicted as urbane, highly competent and ruthless. He denies 'torturing' informants and when Ferris is brought in and observes them beating one of their own agents who hasn't followed orders, Hani tells Ferris that the operative is merely being ""punished"" not ""tortured"". Where Hani is smooth and calculating, Ferris's boss, Hoffman, the CIA chief, is depicted as impulsive and arrogant. He demands that Hani allow him to interrogate a contact, Karami, at the safe house who is already known to Jordanian intelligence. Hani adopts a patient approach and is content to leave Karami at the safe house and pry him later for intelligence.After a terrorist bombing in Amsterdam, Hoffman feels compelled to get ""results"". Without telling Ferris, he orders some of his operatives to tail Karami. Somehow Karami's cover isn't blown but it's enough for the militants at the safe house to set it on fire and flee for parts unknown. Hani is angry at Ferris who denies knowing anything about what happened and is ordered out of Jordan.The third sequence is the most implausible and weakest part of the movie. Hoffman and Ferris meet and Ferris comes up with an absurd plan to capture the terrorist they've been after, Al-Saleem. Inexplicably, Ferris, who has been opposed to Hoffman's amoral and impulsive methods, outdoes Hoffman when he suggests that they invent a terrorist to make Al-Saleem jealous. With the aid of a computer geek employed by the CIA, Ferris focuses on Omar Sadiki, a hapless Jordanian architect who is set up to be the next Bin Laden. Incredibly, they're able to convince Turkish officials to desecrate corpses obtained from a local morgue and use them as part of a plot to simulate a terrorist attack on an US Military facility. Meanwhile, Ferris has a change of heart and finally realizes that Sadiki is at risk to be killed by terrorists. After the simulated terrorist attack, the plot goes awry and Sadiki is killed by terrorists when they realize he's a harmless dupe.I haven't mentioned that there is a romantic subplot in this movie. Ferris falls for an Iranian nurse, Aisha, after she treats him at a local clinic for dog bites. At the climax, she disappears and appears to be kidnapped. Ferris meets with the kidnappers who turn out to be Al-Saleem and his henchmen. As it turns out, the noble Hani was the one who grabbed Aisha all along and used Ferris so he could lead him to Al-Saleem. In a harrowing scene, Ferris is almost beheaded by Al-Saleem's goons but in pure Hollywood style, Hani and his agents burst in and prevent Ferris from being killed. Al-Saleem is also taken into custody.In reading some postings on the internet, some residents of Jordan feel that 'Body of Lies' maligns their dear country. This I can't understand; true, not all the scenes depict the natural beauty of Jordan but hey this is a movie about terrorism and not a travelogue. What's more, Hani, is the real hero here—intelligent, smooth and cool-headed (one who 'punishes' and doesn't 'torture'). Unfortunately, the CIA once again gets short shrift. Just like in 'Traitor' and The Bourne series, the CIA are either bumbling idiots or Machiavellian schemers (or both).Body of Lies has some nice cinematography and its greatest asset is the depiction of the Al Qaeda wannabe, Al-Saleem. He looks and sounds like the real thing and Ridley Scott correctly doesn't sugarcoat his terrorists. DiCaprio has a nice speech condemning Al-Saleem and his minions right before he's about to be beheaded.Despite this, Body of Lies errs in sugarcoating the Jordanian intelligence service at the expense of the CIA. Are they so much better than the CIA in real life? I think they're built up in order to shoot the CIA down and it doesn't ring true. Furthermore, Body of Lies features the ugly suggestion that the CIA would take an innocent man and set him up to be killed by terrorists. Of course if you're a conspiracy theorist, then you'll believe the CIA is capable of anything. Body of Lies is a mildly interesting spy thriller. It's worth viewing once but due to its implausible moments and somewhat anti-American bent, I wouldn't watch it again.",Body of Lies
45,Chris Knipp,Snappy nonsense,7,11 October 2008,"In espionage novels 'smart thriller' isn't an oxymoron but in movies by ""crack"" action directors like Ridley Scott it is. Soderbergh's complicated 'Syriana' doesn't count. It was smart, but nobody could follow it. Action movies from books have to be punchy and pared down. An explosion every ten minutes is 'de rigeur'--specially when the budget's $70 million, as 'Body of Lies'' is. And that buys big names--this time, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe--and good box office to go with such a package.'Departed' screenwriter William Monahan's adaptation of Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' novel, once run through the Ridley Scott ringer, is zippy but never once smart--nor does it contain a drop of real emotion. Like Jeffrey Nachmanoff's recent movie 'Traitor,' about Americans hunting down a jihadist, 'Body of Lies' works off the assumption that swarthy actors with colorful clothes and American operatives who spout Arabic phrases are sufficient to make a story seem in the know about matters Middle Eastern. It doesn't matter. The ideal audience for such stuff approaches with crude assumptions about a dreadful enemy and a righteous democratic homeland fighting to protect itself--assumptions fed up front with 'Body of Lies'' intro, the bombing of a row of houses in Amsterdam by Islamic terrorists and their leader's vicious statement of hatred for. . .us.'Body of Lies' doesn't bother with plot at first otherwise, but instead smartly focuses on setting up its two main characters and their special relationship. You've got Leo (Roger Ferris) with whiskers in the 'bled' dodging bullets and yelling at his sidekicks, and a puffy Crowe (Ed Hoffman) back in a Virginia suburb wiping his kids' bottoms and driving them to school in his SUV, munching cereal or sushi all the while and peering quizzically over his specs while using his fake Arkansas drawl (the two keys to his role: drawl and specs) to direct Leo over the cell phone to go out and get himself killed.In between the dueling duo is a lot of high-tech gobbledygook and gadgetry familiar to us from the 'Bourne' movies. We're asked to believe that CIA headquarters is watching Ferris in some marketplace in Amman on a big cross-hair screen in Virginia--with a voice (all the more chillingly, a woman's) giving the coordinates--though we've been told the terrorists are right off the radar now, avoiding all use of modern electronics. Later when a preposterous rogue scheme is initiated a Brit with a nice pad is called in to perform some elaborate long-distance cyber dirty tricks: he's called Garland (Simon McBurney). It's all just dressing. There's really not much going on, other than that our hero, Leo, is in great danger, and we're at war with the evil empire and nothing's stopping it.The story enlivens things opportunely by having Hoffman turn up by surprise in Ferris' Amman apartment: he does get on a plane once in a while. But quizzical looks over specs and personal appearances ""in country"" notwithstanding, Hoffman's foul language and cynical attitude make him continually, quietly repugnant, bossy, superior, smart-ass, and vulgar. Ferris is harder to figure. He's full of bluster (as Leo was in 'Blood Diamond'; but that was ABOUT something). He's a hard-bitten idealist? But where's the idealism? And where's the good sense? He takes command--but then he messes up. Even if the movie doesn't say so.It's a twist Ridley Scott never exploits that Hoffman's workaholic away-from-office ""multi-tasking"" means he too does nothing well, or with any real feeling, neither his relationship with Ferris nor his parenting. (This may have been more developed in the book; a review found it too critical of US foreign policy and too nice to Arabs.) Nonetheless the Ferris-Hoffman relationship, which is constantly pushed--it jogs the short attention span with its constant scene-shifts--is a lot more interesting than Ferris' corny on-the-ground love interest with a nurse in Amman. In fact his real flirtation, spiked by his own betrayal, is his dealing with the chief of Jordanian intelligence, Hani (Mark Strong), who calls Ferris ""my dear"" and tells him he must be true. The truth is that DiCaprio, who--implausibly, given his violence and bravado--decides to settle in the Middle East, is just angry and blasphemous. He doesn't seem to feel much other than a desire to save his own skin, and as a result we don't feel anything, and the movie doesn't say anything about whatever issues it has touched on.Ferris ""speaks Arabic"" but he calls the arch enemy leader ""Al Saleem,"" forgetting something absolutely basic, the sun letters and moon letters (in Arabic, it's pronounced ""AS-Saleem"", never 'AL'). This character is played by an Israeli actor, Alon Abutbul--maybe just as well. Ferris' would-be Jordanian girlfriend Aisha is played by an Iranian actress, Golshifteh Farahani. The keen Ferris, though he has exchanged only a few phrases with her, says he detects an Iranian accent--she's given an Iranian relative to explain her actually not being Jordanian at all. Yet Ferris screws up in Arabic so often his helper has to shoot people so he can escape from them. Mark Strong, who plays the Jordanian head of intelligence, wears ""superbly tailored Savile Row suits,"" 'The New Yorker's' Denby explains--and the suits are pretty; but Strong (an English stage actor of Iralian and Austrian heritage) can't even pronounce 'al-qa'ida' correctly. (There is one scene--just one--of a group of architects when Ferris develops the ""brilliant"" scheme of making up a decoy terrorist group to throw ""Al-Saleem"" and his group off--who are actual Arabs speaking real Arabic. Not to any of the main characters, of course.Stories like this, which begin and end with depictions of a terrifying and cruel Muslim Arab enemy, are a bonanza for Hollywood, which always depicted Arabs as cruel, stupid, and evil; see Jack Shaheen's book chronicling this phenomenon, 'Reel Bad Arabs.' The difference now is there ARE ""real bad Arabs,"" only American movies have never shown any other kind.",Body of Lies
46,Bezenby,Kind of good,6,4 February 2014,"Leonardo's got his work cut out for him this time! He's some guy working for some government agency involved in overseas anti-terrorism type shenanigans, with a beard and speaking Arabic and what not, while Russell Crowe talks to him from the safety of his home in the good old US of A (with slight variations of an American accent shot through with Australian, but that might have been down to his undercover work before he got his desk job. Who knows?) Leonardo's out to track down a terrorist cell run by a guy who's into blowing up stuff real good and does a bit of globe hopping (well, Middle Eastern country hopping) to get to his man. With me so far?Leonardo manages to get to Jordan where this guy is supposedly based, and gets cosy with the Jordanian secret service much to the chagrin of Crowe, who can't help but stick his nose in and mess things up for everybody. Also, he's got to find time to woo a local medical lady using local arab/Muslim customs (rather than buy her six bicardi breezers in a nightclub like what we do here in the good old United Kingdom of A). Although it did teach me a lot about how the secret services operate in the middle east, and how terrorist cells avoid being tracked by modern technology, and also although De Caprio's is a fine actor, I did feel a bit underwhelmed by the film in general. It looks great and there's a few standout scenes (especially when De Caprio gets attacked by rabid dogs while climbing a wall lined with broken glass). There was just something about it that didn't quite generate enough excitement. Maybe the romantic subplot? Or all that standing around talking about who had jurisdiction over what? Or maybe it was too based in realism to truly go full pelt with the action at the end. That's not for me to know – maybe the whole premise of the film is that modern covert actions have become so futuristic that war in itself has become boring. Where's Rambo?Now I'm off to watch something more intellectual: Cyber Tracker 2!",Body of Lies

This film "" Body of Lies "" is yet another triumph of his abilities. The movie is based on the efforts of the CIA in their search for the elusive individual called Osama-bin-laden.

In our story, experienced CIA operative Roger Ferris (Leonatdo DiCaprio) is given the task of locating and capturing Eastern terroristic, Al-saleem (Alon Abutbul). His boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) believes he can use any methods to achieve this objective. Unfortunately, important men of the middle east, have a code of honor which has defined rules of behavior. This is true with the Chief of Security for the King of Jordon, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Because of his middle-east experience, Ferris seeks the trust and confidence of Hani and desires to use diplomacy. A method belittled and ignored by Hoffman. To complicate his undercover activities, Ferris unwittingly involves Ali Suliman (Omar Sadiki) an innocent Artcitect and Aisha a local nurse who is also endangered. Despite all their high tech weaponry and spy satellites, the U.S. and it's intelligence gathering, they fall prey to the Arab enemy, as they are not as unaware as the US believes. because the film is directed by Ridley Scott, there is no shortage of drama, action, explosions and secretive intrigue.

49,generationofswine,An Honest Review,8,1 July 2017,"Crowe got second billing and they gave the limelight to DiCaprio instead...that's a great idea. that means that, as usual, DiCaprio is going to shine doing his ""this is how you become a different person"" thing and Crowe is going to actually act and not just try to hog the limelight.The result is a tense and very well acted film.It should have been a Masterpiece but...it was released in 2008 and America wanted pure escapism then, not tense spy thrillers that reflect the reality of two long endless wars...and it was released a little too close to The Good Shepard.In fact, it felt a lot like the Good Shepard set in the modern era.It was the Good Shepard with more action.It was The Good Shepard with better acting, but only just.So, if it waited another 2 years, we would have had a great film in a time when we were slowly starting to relax a little again.If it waited 4 years, The Good Shepard would have been a distant memory and the shady CIA boss character would have seemed fresher.Don't misunderstand, Crowe actually acts again and DiCaprio shines as usual, you will totally enjoy this movie.The flaws are not its own, but rather a result of bad timing, pure and simple.It should have been more, but the zietgiest wasn't there yet.",Body of Lies
50,dfranzen70,Serious misstep for all involved - skip it,5,6 May 2009,"In a role that's tailor made for his preening, self-involved public persona, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an intense CIA agent who doesn't play by the rules in his fight against terrorism in the Middle East. Russell Crowe is his slovenly Langley-based boss. The overly complex plot in Body of Lies is often ludicrous, with cardboard characters and a heavy-handed tone that attempts to paint a complicated situation in black-and-white terms.DiCaprio plays Roger Ferris, an undercover agent stationed in Jordan who also happens to be going through divorce proceedings. Crowe is Ed Hoffman, his middle-aged stay-at-home handler who talks to his agent while shepherding his kids to soccer games and the like. One is directly involved with covert operations; the other manges the operations from a distance, both physically and emotionally. Naturally, this distance causes problems in their working relationship, for how can Hoffman be able to tell Ferris how to handle things if he's too far away to get a feel for the situation? Ferris gets a lead on who might be behind some recent terrorist attacks, so he decides to become friendly with the head of Jordanian intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), hoping to use Salaam's connections to help land his target. Ferris prefers a subtle approach when dealing with citizens of foreign lands; embrace the culture and speak the language, and the people will be more amenable to helping you. Hoffman prefers the more stereotypical American approach of rushing in, demanding, raising heck if demands aren't met. Such conflicting styles are bound to create...conflict.The ultimate problem here isn't really the plot, however convoluted it is and no matter how many red herrings abound. The problem is DiCaprio himself, an actor who seems hellbent on proving he can act by being as intense as possible at all times. They're not the same thing. DiCaprio, as is his wont, plays a character who is always trying to do the right thing but makes dumb decisions along the way. Which is fine if you're a wooden action figure like Rambo, but it's pointless if you're in a heavily plotted espionage thriller. DiCaprio is a movie star, not an actor, and putting various cuts and bruises on his pretty-boy face will change the fact that he's simply not up to the heavy lifting.In fact, although I'm not much of a Matt Damon fan, the truth is that Damon would have owned this role - had he not already played it, basically, in the Jason Bourne films. Which means that essentially, this is a cheap knockoff of the Bourne films themselves, except with fewer action scenes and even more high-tech gadgetry.Here's something to look for: Ferris's girlfriend, a nurse played very well by Golshifteh Farahani. She's pretty, of course, and Ferris - in the middle of all this running around undercover in Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East - woos her, speaking Arabic and observing all the customs of her culture. First of all, you know as soon as they make cute eyes at each other that at some point she'll be kidnapped or killed or something, and he'll have to rescue or avenge her. Second, I found it interesting that while he's ostensibly undercover - an American in the Middle East normally sticks out a little - he doesn't seem to notice that people notice HIM interacting with her. If I'm a secret agent, the last place I'd look for a relationship is in the same exact spot where I'm trying to be a secret agent, because if the bad guys figure out I'm not on their side - always a possibility - they will also easily figure out that they can use my relationship partner against me. That would be stupid on my part, and it's unbelievably dumb on Ferris's part.Skip Body of Lies. Crowe is mostly wasted in a showy, slight role anyway, and DiCaprio is hammy, one dimensional, and vapid.

51,PWNYCNY,Is the movie over yet?,2,19 October 2008,"Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited, paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. Not exactly a pretty picture, but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious, noisy, overacted action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these movies has Hollywood made? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. The locales change but the plots remain the same, and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to run-on interminably. ""When will this movie end?"" I repeatedly thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA operative, but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie the on site operative is ""lean and mean"" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What was the casting director thinking? Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to pass himself off as an Arab ... speaking fluent Arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real Arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable Arab masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you get the point. Next time try casting an actual Arab in the role. Not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. In this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and oblivion. And one other thing. Don;t let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The pay may not be great, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.",Body of Lies

DiCaprio & Crowe were great but the film-making of ""Body of Lies"" was a world of confusion!",7,1 January 2010,"I am not going to feed you a body of lies in my film review of Director Ridley Scott's terrorist-themed picture ""Body of Lies"", but I will be totally candid in stating that I was in WTF mode just minutes into the film. Scott's film is extremely complex on the inner workings of the CIA on countering terrorism in the Middle East. I admire a cerebrally challenging film but this one throws you a body of confusing counterterrorism scenes that terrorize your MAL (movie attention level) from the start; que mal estaba eso. ""Body of Lies"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as in-the-trenches CIA Agent Roger Ferris. Russell Crowe co-stars as Ed Hoffman, Ferris' crafty & cynical CIA Boss Ed Hoffman, who hardly lets Ferris get a day off. Most of DiCaprio and Crowe's scenes are of them communicating via cell and are just in a couple scenes together. Nevertheless, these two outstanding actors were once again exceptional. Too bad the rest of ""Body of Lies"" is a body of ""states of confusion"". ""Ridley's Believe it Or Not"" direction was profoundly baffling and heavy-handed. Oscar winning screenwriter William Monahan of ""The Departed"" sure did depart from providing us a guiding storyline in his script of ""Body of Lies"". However, I still do recommend to catch a ""Body of Lies"" due to the marvel thespian efforts of DiCaprio & Crowe.

53,jimbo-53-186511,Too convoluted for its own good,5,6 August 2017,"I didn't realise until the end of this film that Body Of Lies was based on a book - given the nature of the story it could quite easily have been based on true events. Having said that, in hindsight, it's quite easy to see that a film like Body Of Lies could have been based on a book and with a film like Body Of Lies it just goes to show that sometimes things that work on the page don't necessarily work on the screen...Body Of Lies is about a CIA operative working on the ground who is tasked with flushing out a terrorist whom is committing acts of terrorism in various locations (mostly across Europe). The CIA operative on the ground is Roger Ferris (Leonardo Di Caprio) whom with the help of his boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) and head of Jordanian intelligence Hani (Mark Strong) all work together to bring this terrorist kingpin to justice...Despite big names like Russell Crowe and Leonardo Di Caprio and a credible director like Ridley Scott what you basically get here is a 2 hour sightseeing tour; you'll see the Netherlands, England, USA, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Syria, Turkey; there may have been more countries, but I lost track after a while. Each of these countries seem to be there to piece this ridiculous jigsaw together, but each of these little threads is given so little bearing that it becomes very difficult to follow what is happening and to a lesser extent actually care what is happening. Crowe's character is a bit of an oddity as he seems to be back in the US in one scene and then in the next scene he's in the Middle East and then again he's back in US and back in the Middle East?? Surely all this travelling would take its toll on Crowe's character, but the screenplay dictates otherwise and Scott carries on regardless..The performances are as good as can be expected and Di Caprio proves here that he is versatile enough to take on any project. Crowe is a good foil to Di Caprio and plays off him very well. Mark Strong is very good (I didn't realise it was him till I looked at the cast on IMDb). He's a spooky looking doppelganger for Andy Garcia in this film and is easily the best thing about this film.There are some plus points here and in fairness Scott is fairly good at staging some of the action; the early sequences are excellent and at an early stage Scott does a good job at throwing us into the horrors of war. On another note, Scott also doesn't hold back with the violence and some of the things that happen to Di Caprio at the end are pretty brutal and Scott bravely chooses to keep these things on camera so be warned that you'll need a strong stomach for some of the later scenes.Body Of Lies isn't a bad film and Scott injects just about enough pace and action to make it watchable, but the episodic and rather convoluted nature of the narrative makes it a film that is rather forgettable and hard to care about (which is a shame because given what has happened in recent years in the UK - the London bombings and the Manchester Arena bombings then it is clearly a film of social importance). However, despite its message, I found that Scott overdid it here and felt that there was too much going on and unfortunately I just didn't find it particularly gripping or compelling.",Body of Lies

I've seen it twice now, the first time left so little of an impression I didn't even remember watching it except in flashes this time around. Granted Leonardo DiCaprio & Russell Crowe do a great job but I didn't like either of them. The story itself is complicated, violent, dry, filled with explosions, exceptional cell service and everybody drives super fast all the time.Based on a novel, Body Of Lies is an international espionage thriller. It's a movie full of not nice people doing not nice things. Leo plays a dedicated, intense F-bombing field operative in Jordan on the trail of a terrorist and Crowe is his very fat, manipulative handler back in the States.On the plus side I did enjoy Mark Strong as the head of Jordanin Intelligence. I liked the locations, the action scenes were well done and unique as was the eye in the sky surveillance camera following 'Roger Ferris' at all times. There are subtitles throughout, Leo gets a small (and sweet) romantic subplot, (before getting tortured) and Crowe eats his way through every scene, which became quite comical. 4/26/15",Body of Lies

57,TdSmth5,Good action thriller,8,24 October 2008,"We begin by hearing Crowe's character, Hoffman, a CIA handler, preempt some type of report. He warns some higher-ups of America's underestimation of the enemy. A lot of it sounds similar to what Michael Scheuer has been arguing in his books. Hoffman is constantly on the line with CIA operative Ferris (DiCaprio), who is somewhere in the Middle East meeting a terrorist who wants out. This is after a bombing in England that killed many police agents orchestrated by the main terrorist head. Hoffman wants information but he doesn't want to give anything in return. Not only that but he is running parallel operations without letting the other parties know. In several instances he lets Ferris down and gets him in serious trouble.Ferris is sent to Jordan where an al-Qaeda safe house is operating. In a somewhat unrealistic scene of intraagency politics, Hoffman determines that Ferris is to run the entire department in Jordan, given the current boss' incompetence. Ferris decides to work closely with the head of Jordanian security, played with magnetic personality by Mark Strong. He teaches some lessons to the Americans when it comes to long-term asset management. Meanwhile the Americans, especially Hoffman, want immediate results. This will lead to conflict between the three men.After one of the many physical dangers and subsequent harm Ferris gets himself in, he lands in a local clinic where he becomes interested in one of the nurses. He will court her, which allows an interesting glimpse into another culture's norms on relationships.Back at the safehouse operation, Hoffman once again pulls the trigger and the whole thing blows up literally. Without any leads now, Ferris decides to organize a fake terrorist cell and create a major phony attack on an American base. That will get the attention and jealousy of our main terrorist. For that end, they dupe a Saudi architect who is (for some reason) low-level al-Qaida and present him as the head of this new terrorist group. Our main terrorist will end up kidnapping the architect who unaware of anything that is going is quick to point out that he was probably setup by the American who pretended to be a businessman. With this there is a falling out between Ferris and Jordanian security, who demanded only one thing, not to be lied to.To get to Ferris, the terrorists kidnap the girl. And in the final and most implausible act, Ferris agrees to an exchange: the girl for him. At this point Hoffman loses sight, literally, of Ferris who now is on his own and facing a grim situation. He is held at a table with a flag behind him and a camera rolling. He finally gets to meet the main terrorist, who takes the opportunity to hammer a couple of Ferris's fingers and eventually decides that Ferris is to be gutted on camera. But of course there will have to somewhat of a happy ending to this, and we don't get to see his guts spewed on screen. Having invested in long-term assets can come in handy sometimes.This movie is very good. It is fast paced, there's the all-around the world aspect, with activities going in in Europe, America, and the Middle East. There are neat bird-view shots of desert cities thanks to drones that Hoffman uses to keep tabs on Ferris. Director Scott likes these shots and overdoes them eventually. Despite the large scope of operations here, we pretty much never leave DiCaprio or Crowe, who discusses matters of national security on his cabled headphone set during his daughter's soccer practice. There are lighter moments here, too, with his kids, and DiCaprio meeting his love-interest's family.One has to suspend disbelief to some extent with these movies. Ferris is a lone ground operative, yet he gets to be a manager, too, and an organizer and brain behind certain operations. But it all gets to be too much when he agrees with Hoffman's blessing to the exchange for some foreign love-interest. That just doesn't add up. Still, the movie is interesting and fun. The acting is OK, with Mark Strong's performance really standing out . Recommended as a straight-forward fast paced intelligence/action movie.",Body of Lies
58,EUyeshima,Intense Political Thriller Takes More Cues from Hollywood than the Current Middle East Crisis,6,8 November 2008,"The craftsmanship behind director Ridley Scott's 2008 convulsive political thriller is impressive, but having acts of terrorism drive an intentionally labyrinth plot reveals how they impede the story structurally, an insurmountable barrier that screenwriter William Monahan (""The Departed"") can't seem to overcome. The movie's first half is all the more bewildering for all the double-crosses and cover-ups that serve to set up the central situation. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' 2007 novel, the movie focuses on embedded CIA operative Roger Ferris who is on an undercover assignment to hunt an Al-Qaeda terrorist leader named Al-Saleem. Ferris is not entirely alone as he is connected via cell phone with his stateside boss Ed Hoffman, who is the head of the CIA's Near East division and directs Ferris toward life-threatening tasks in a most nonchalant manner from his upscale suburban home.The plot's impetus is driven by the elusive Al-Saleem's unblinking series of suicide bombings in Europe in response to the invasion by US and UK troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The movie gets more interesting when Ferris decides to work with Jordanian intelligence director Hani Salaam, an erudite, enigmatic figure who is well entrenched in the Middle East militia and appears to take a page from Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" when it comes to loyalty and betrayal. Of course, it's a matter of course that Ferris' loyalty is tested when an elaborate plan is hatched to create a bogus competing terrorist group and use an unwitting Dubai architect as the head. The other complicating factor is that Ferris has fallen for pretty Iranian nurse Aisha when he gets treated for possible rabies at a clinic. It becomes inevitable that she also becomes a pawn in the political intrigue. Scott paints his canvas with a lot of graphic violence from large-scale bombings to more intimate acts of torture.All of the external elements are fitting, but they can't seem to masquerade the convoluted and often cliché-ridden plot at the film's core. A solid cast goes a long way to compensate for the plot holes. As Ferris, Leonardo DiCaprio applies his trademark wiry energy to an intensely compelling performance that could have shown a bit more variety. Adding fifty belly-stretching pounds to his frame, Russell Crowe, Scott's favorite leading man (""Gladiator"", ""American Gangster"", ""A Good Year""), plays the Arkansan Hoffman as a scene-stealing character part. The irony is that the Australian actor's Southern accent is more convincing than DiCaprio's. Their antagonistic interplay, played out mostly on the phone, is rather predictably developed. Fetching Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani provides gratefully calm relief to the ongoing mayhem as Aisha, although her character comes across as a mere plot device. There is a nicely fractious dinner table scene with Ferris and her judgmental older sister, although the movie plays down the more human-size hostilities in favor of the pyrotechnics.As Hani, Mark Strong (""Sunshine"", ""Stardust"") leaves the most vivid impression of the cast but for the most old-fashioned of cinematic reasons - he plays what could be a villainous figure as a suave, mysterious man of honor who is completely on top of his job, an intentional counterpoint, at least physically, to Crowe's slovenly Hoffman. The film's resolution defies credibility, but it finally becomes clear that Monahan is not interested in exposing the factors that have driven the Middle East political maelstrom into acts of escalating terrorism. Rather, his screenplay shows that testosterone-driven Hollywood-style entertainment can take place anywhere.",Body of Lies
59,jaybob,First rate action packed adventure movie STARRING Leonardo DeCaprio,9,20 February 2009,"This is a Ridley Scott film, That is a main reason to see this if you like adventure action packed films,like I do. Mr.Scott is a first rate director of this type movie.William Monaham wrote the screenplay,he adapted David Ignatius' novel. It is an involved story & is developed nicely. Its a typical CIA involvement in the affairs of the middle east. We have seen this type tale many times over the years,Just change the names of the organizations doing the spying and the countries.When it comes to action films I do not necessarily go for the story, I go because of the cast.Leonardo DeCaprio is the STAR here & he carries the movie, like action heroes of the past did. & thats superbly. Russell Crowe is quite effective in a type role he is a master of. (sneaky official-the type than can make your skin crawl)Mark Stong an actor from the UK is excellent as a Jordanian official.Now in all action movies there is a need of some diversion for our hero. Iranian actress Golshkirteh Farahani amply fills the bill here, She is beautiful & talented. She is a Muslim so we see no kissing or nudity.The rest of the cast are mostly ethnic persons of the area, Aand all are very good.The setting is supposed to be Lebanon, Syria ,Jordan area. These scenes were filmed in Morocco, as well as some areas of the US.Be warned there are 2 vivid but well acted torture scenes, One involving our hero, Leonardo. the other a well executed whipping.There are many explosions, very well done.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 96 points(out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",Body of Lies
60,dierregi,Everybody lies but some liars are worse than other,4,11 April 2020,"Di Caprio is Ferris, a ""good"" CIA agent working in the field, who speaks Arabic and actually likes the Middle East. Considering what we're shown of it, one does wonder why, as does Hoffman, the puppeteer working from the US.Hoffman is the cliche CIA guy the audience love to hate, bossy, arrogant, always on the phone and lying to everybody.Ferris and Hoffman are on the hunt for Al-Saleem, the boss of a suicide terrorists cell. The problem with catching him is that the cell doesn't use technology anymore but handwritten messages and face-to-face contacts.Ferris works with local-based, Jordan intelligence big boss Hani to find a suitable strategy and ends up enamoured of local nurse Aisha. This love story is relevant only as a device to provide leverage.What follows is a bizantine plot to ""fake"" another terrorist cell, so as to summon Al-Saleem out of hiding. Chances of such a plot to succeed seem slim to me, but perfect if you like conspiracy theories.The film wraps up with the tired cliche of the disillusioned agent who drops out to stick with the locals... and one is left again to wonder why anybody would deliberately choose to settle on a powder keg. The other point made is that it would be better to leave the Middle East solve its own problems, which I thoroughly agree with, except they choose to export their never ending issues all around the world.",Body of Lies

Alien , Blade Runner , Thelma & Louise , Gladiator , Hannibal , Black Hawk Down, American gangster ...I could go on. Ridley Scott certainly knows his trade. He is a director that manages to tell a story without adding too many special affects and over the top CGI. Body of Lies is another superbly told story that is entertaining throughout .It also helps that Ridley Scott always manages to persuade the cream of the crop of Hollywood's most talented actors. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' 2007 novel about a CIA operative, Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), who uncovers a lead on a major terrorist leader suspected to be operating out of Jordan. When Ferris devises a plan to infiltrate his network, he must first win the backing of cunning CIA veteran Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) and the collegial, but perhaps suspect, head of Jordanian intelligence. Although ostensibly his allies, Ferris questions how far he can really trust these men without putting his entire operation - and his life - on the line.We all know how good Leonardo DiCaprio and Russel Crowe are and in Body of lies they do not disappoint but there is another actor in this film that i would like to highlight. Mark Strong is pretty well known in Britain but is just starting to make waves across the pond and quite rightly so. His portrayal of the Jordanian "" Hani"" is mesmerising. If your not aware of Mark Strong now , you soon will be.What i like about Body of lies is that it's not all one sided . As Ed Hoffman ( Crowe) says in the film "" No body's innocent in this s**t"". I have not read the novel that the film is based on but you can tell that it is very well written by some of the dialogue in the film. One scene in particular really made me think. Hoffman is discussing the war against terror to his superiors and he says- "" The world as we know it is a lot simpler to put to an end as you might think""He then goes on to explain that the terrorist can just abandon all forms of electronic communication and just talk to each other and go back to how it was in the past. When that happens we are all doomed as the intelligent agencies are all about monitoring e-mail ,cell phones and all other forms of electronic communication . We would lose the war on terror if it was a primitive war. If i had to critical at all about Body of Lies is it lacks a sting in the tail. The whole film is exciting and enthralling yet the conclusion is a little bit too schmaltzy but don't let that put you off because this really is a classy movie.Directors like Michael Bay and Peter Berg would do well to take a good look at the way Ridley Scott tells a story and realise that it's great acting , a good script and am enthralling storyline not CGI and explosions that make a great movie.8 out of 10",Body of Lies
62,AudioFileZ,Keeps It Painfully Real In The Spy Genre,7,27 August 2017,"Body of Lies is an intense Middle East intelligence thriller. It separates itself because it's fiction that doesn't use Hollywood typical sensationalism in favor of that gritty black ops that certainly is just as sensational yet is harder to take since it dares to glimpse into the much more horrible goings on. It's a playing field where no one knows everything and distrust is the only common denominator. It's nothing like the story of a covert operation in a place where there is a definite line separating the sides. In fact there's multiple sides within those seeking similar agendas. It's a morass of trying to achieve moments of victory on what seems to be no agreement among the deadly sides. This is the hell hole CIA operative Roger Farris (Leonardo Dicaprio) initially thrives in. Early on he's playing his role with aplomb to which he seems to get a charge. Perhaps he's a bit of an idealist though as things get more involved he constantly feels a gulf widening between his boss (Russelll Crowe) and his own style of getting the job done. This is the underlying tension as Farris is on the ground in the hot zone and his boss is thousands of miles away in real and figurative terms. Add in some ill-advised romantic interest and soon Farris is much more vulnerable at his own hands. He plays both sides too as he partners with the head of Jordanian black forces as he needs their power and intel to defeat a common terrorist. The thing is that there is no wiggle-room for playing the Jordanians and the man who leads that group. Farris becomes a target by his own mission to get to the terrorist through a construction project in which he's fronting yet not being honest with the Jordanians. This causes a problem for both and Farris is suddenly in the wind having to make a choice to attempt to save his local romantic interest. If Farris was a totally hardened company man he would cut and run when things go upside down, but he's already left so much behind in any kind of normal existence. This is why he throws his safety away with only a sliver of hope. He has a inner moral compass that won't let him. Something bad is almost a certainty with only his belief left he has to sacrifice himself to attempt to do what he feels he must.This is a pretty action laced spy story. It has many of the elements of any decent one. What is seeks to bring, and mostly due to Dicaprio's excellent performance is the gritty human factor. No big chase or fight scenes in which our main character performs with super-human skills to survive. Only the space between humanity and the consequences of attempting to root out and destroy a warped theology of terror. It's to the credit of the excellent cast that this dark gritty story stays uncomfortably real and entertaining at the same time. One will never know how much of this was inspired by real events but it, nonetheless, keeps a degree of credibility to give the story some legs. In that it is a fictitious spy thriller that works. You know Farris likely wouldn't survive the many sides he's at times carelessly playing. But you know it's human to err and it is also human to keep trying to achieve the goal you've made a decision to reach. Body of LIes touches that unique place in a mostly painfully realistic spy story. Dicaprio in many ways is why this movie works at all and he's really delivered an outstanding performance here. I can only imagine if it was anyone else it simply wouldn't have come alive the same way. This is a movie that I give a 7.5 to of which the entire rating is based on Dicaprio's performance.",Body of Lies
63,pc95,Lots of Problems,5,24 May 2009,"Directed by Ridley Scott, ""Body of Lies"" has too many problems to be considered worthy of a good rating. As a whole it's story is sort of garbled and includes a lot of dead-weight cell-phone scenes between it's stars. This completely diminishes the nature of cinema. Instead of having 2 savvy actors face-to-face more often than not we see images of screaming or smug characters on a cell-phone. This might be the point of the movie, but the characters are not really worth caring about so it doesn't matter - they're caricatures and clichéd, from the agents to the terrorists - we've seen them before as the movie itself seems like a rehash of terrorist/good-guys movies that all have definitely worn out their welcome. I thought the romance was utterly weak and phony as well as the poor stereo-types it was framing and perpetuating. To boot, DiCaprio acting like his usual self is unconvincing as a supposedly Arabic-fluent agent. His language comes off stilted, and his fuzzy black glue-on goatee looks like it was manufactured in China. This is close to a dud for Scott, whose had so many triumphant productions.",Body of Lies

There's a lot of running around and shooting and intelligence-speak, but all of that only adds up to a very average movie. You'd think that another combination of Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, with Leonardo DiCaprio thrown into the mix, would be a home-run, but none of them bring their A-game to this. Ridley's direction is acceptable, but a distinct step below Blade Runner, Gladiator, or American Gangster. I have a new found respect for DiCaprio after seeing what he can really do in Revolutionary Road, but little of that is on display here. Crowe gives a better performance than DiCaprio, but still nothing particularly memorable.Both of them were overshadowed by Alon Aboutboul as Al-Saleem, the uncertain ally who is Director of Jordanian Intelligence, and Golshifteh Farahani, who plays a beautiful, quiet young woman who gets unwittingly drawn into the world of intelligence gathering and terrorism. The only time I was really interested in what was happening, was when one of them was on screen. Other than that, Body of Lies is just an average movie with an anti-climatic ending.

70,antoniotierno,agreeable movie,7,1 December 2008,"Body of Lies reminds in my opinion ""Syriana"", e.g. in the sense that both have action and ping pongs between Langley and the Middle East. Nevertheless this terrorism story is more obscure, impenetrable and hard to decode. Both the main characters act with inexplicable intents and the story evolves in an original way that defies linear templates but certainly keeps the viewer engaged emotionally and psychologically. In addition to bearing some resemblances with ""Syriana"" I also see elements and other (creative) contributions of ""The Departed"". To sum up a spy thriller, far from genre conventions and never boring. Leonardo Di Caprio and Russel Crowe complete themselves, in spite of their distinctions and both are in the right place at the right time.",Body of Lies

72,sarastro7,Impressive,9,28 December 2008,"I think some people misunderstood what went on in this movie. What I believe the producers were trying to show is this: a wrong, arrogant, mistrustful and power-abusing way to deal with the middle-east, represented by Crowe's character, and a positive, constructive, forthcoming way to try to cooperate with the middle-eastern countries, represented by DiCaprio's character. Two very different approaches, necessarily conflicting with each other. Crowe's way is, regrettably, the realistic way, while DiCaprio's way is the idealistic one, but just because that's the way it is now, doesn't mean that this is the way it always has to be. The real message of the movie - what we need to learn - is that we should be using DiCaprio's way more than Crowe's, because this would yield better results for all involved; save lives, start mutually beneficial dialogs and agreements, and generally improve the quality of life for everyone. Of course, the tragic end of the movie is that Crowe's character and his approach stay in place while DiCaprio's character is essentially ostracized. The world is not yet so civilized that the strongest nations have stopped bullying the weaker ones, although there really is no need. Being forthcoming and willing to cooperate instead of strong-arming everyone into line by force and subterfuge would work so much better, and this is what this movie is saying. It's showing how pathetic, immoral and just plain unnecessary it is for the stronger nations to keep pounding on the smaller ones, which are ending up with less and less to lose, which necessarily means that they become fertile breeding grounds for terrorists. I think this movie does a great job in demonstrating these things, and I hope people will be listening.",Body of Lies
73,Richie-67-485852,Body of Truth,8,1 October 2017,"Look forward to thrills and if done right a nice two hour ride of entertainment. This is done right! Lets all acknowledge that our favorite stars are giving their best here as well as the Director. This team pulls off telling a good story that is believable and tense. The viewers attention span is never abused and there are some scenes that reach out and grab you and wont let go a good thing. Its interesting to note how powerful and respected (as well as hated) the CIA is. This organization can go into a country and wreck havoc and leave before that country even knows what hit it. This accounts for such hatred around the world for America. We use these forces and other special forces to make sure we get what we want just like the other fellow only we do it better. I particularly liked the use of Drones in this movie which demonstrate just how effective and powerful they are and will continue to be. There is no defense against them and they can be used for so many reasons. Right now we have superiority in this technology but it wont last. However look for anti-drone technology to enter into the arms race. Note the street life of the Middle Eastern countries full of outdoor cooking, heavy traffic and people coming and going non-stop. Also consider how in certain parts of the certain cities how devastating a bomb blast would be and there is no prevention against it either. That's why retribution is swift on those that do this cowardly act. I also found it interesting and ""true"" of how miscellaneous people send email congratulations to bombers who do a good job of blowing something up encouraging and praising them in the name of Islam? Sad but true as with any ancient manuscript it can be twisted and turned inside out and away from its original intent especially when dark forces prevail. The real Truth cannot be so easily manipulated but people can when it is mixed with lies. Keep this in mind the next time hindsight visits with you. Its telling you what you didn't know or do or not do after the fact proving that we know not what we do and need insight above all things. The world suffers from a lack of insight nicely portrayed in this movie as a reminder. Enjoy a hearty sandwich with a tasty drink and a snack is a must have or you may fidget or bite nails at some point of the thrill riding here. Enjoy",Body of Lies

I thought there was too much dialog between the two stars while in character but then perhaps it had to be done that way.

75,jaredmobarak,And that means you work for usBody of Lies,7,12 October 2008,"The new Ridley Scott film has come upon us, the drama/thriller Body of Lies. I remember a time when Scott's movies were must-sees, way back when. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the same of late with me having no interest in Hannibal, finding Gladiator and Black Hawk Down to be grossly overrated if not just good, and his latest American Gangster dragged along. Besides Kingdom of Heaven, which is a fantastic piece of work if you give it a chance, nothing has really hit me too strongly. I can't say that this one does anything to change that perception. While better than I expected, there really isn't anything new or surprising here. You've got your CIA agents on the lookout for an Arab terrorist, one on the ground who experiences the war everyday and the other back in the states delegating and making decisions for the global sphere and not worrying about collateral damage at all. Not only that, but you also get the secondary story of our lead putting himself on the line risking his life not knowing if he will be extracted or left to die. If that sounds familiar, you may be thinking of a movie called Spy Gamethat exact story done better by Tony Scott, Ridley's brother. Now there is a Scott who's films are still highly anticipated each year.Trust plays a major role in the proceedings on whether we as Americans can rely on a nation like Jordan to help our cause. The young upstart on the ground, Leonardo DiCaprio's Roger Ferris, believes that he can and tries to keep an open relationship with the head of the secret service there, Hani, (the always creepy villain type Mark Strong in a role that allows him to be human, if not still a bit intimidating). No matter how much these two like each other, though, means nothing as long as Ferris' boss is pulling the strings. Russell Crowe's Ed Hoffman is the eye in the sky watching everything going on around the world involving CIA operatives. He makes life and death decisions without emotion while putting his children in the car and dropping them off at school. He has the cold-hearted detachment necessary in war to make the tough call and still be able to sleep at night. War is no longer led by the men in the trenches, watching the opposition die by their own hands; instead it is the overweight politically intelligent men moving the pawns around into the correct position. If one soldier dies, you replace him with another, no emotions can show.Everyone plays their roles effectively and help drive the film to its conclusion. It spans multiple locales and at a breakneck speed that can at times disorient you as a viewer, but for the most part runs smoothly. DiCaprio builds on his already extensive filmography of exotic venues and warzone subject matter as he travels between Middle Eastern nations and the US while mistakes are made and new missions conceived. The dynamic between him and Crowe is electric as they play off each other with mutual respect as well as the knowledge of how they are from different generations of the job. Crowe is methodical and ruthless while DiCaprio makes connections and relationships to hopefully lead into reliable intel and successful results. However, while the two give each other ideas and smart maneuvers, Crowe will not back down from his assertive stance and if he must continue on while leaving his man in the dark he will, no matter what that means for his best agent.Now the trailer really misleads you into thinking that at some point these two will stand on opposite ends of the spectrum and work against each other. That never happens. Crowe's Hoffman really only comes and goes as a Big Brother type, not really playing a massive role in the plot. The main source of story comes from DiCaprio's Ferris as he develops roots and friendships in Jordan and attempts to earn the trust of Hani so that they can create a strong intellectual bond to help disrupt terrorists in the area. Ferris and Hani's comings and goings are what matter and the lies that they keep are the reason for the title. The one thing Hani asks is that he not be lied to, that is the one condition for which his helps hinges on. The manipulations of Hoffman lead Ferris into heading an operation outside of Jordan connections. Once his short exile from the country ends and Hani invites him back, Ferris must decide whether to disclose what is going on or not. This is the main decision that leads into the third act of the film and what makes it interesting, building on the exposition of characters developed in the first two-thirds.It all entertains and enthralls like any good thriller should, but in the end, besides the acting, there is nothing worth talking about. Whether the novel it is based on is better or worse, the film version becomes a tale of espionage and disparate attitudes to the ongoing topic of how information should be delegated to friendly Arab nations. It can be seen as a comment on the war, as anything made today can, but ultimately it's just a piece of entertainment, hoping to expose the underbelly of deceit and backdoor deals going on in the US government. It's nothing new; we all know the stories. I'll wait for Ridley's brother's The Taking of Pelham 123, because even though it's a remake, Tony's penchant for style and flair just excites me more.",Body of Lies
76,carbuff,"A decent TV show, but it's supposed to be a major motion picture.",4,25 September 2018,"Let's start with my biases. I cannot stand DiCaprio, I'm ambivalent about Crowe, and I think that Ridley is one of the finest directors in Hollywood. My politics are a bit left of center. This is the first time I watched this film, and it hasn't aged well. It's obviously supposed to illustrate the moral ambiguity of the modern political world, but in the end it's just blunt, simple-minded, politically-correct preaching from your run-of-the-mill, left-wing, Hollywood, limousine liberals. It's completely lacking in subtlety. It's about as transparent as a jellyfish, although I'm sure that everyone involved considers it thoughtful and sophisticated. It's also scores nearly a perfect 10 in predictability. I have to acknowledge the very high production standards, but we're used to that even on TV nowadays. I got absolutely nothing out of watching this at all. Really, you're telling me that global politics isn't simply black-and-white? I had no idea. Every character and plot device in ""Body of Lies"" has been stolen from prior films. It's an empty desert as far as originality goes, right to the bitter end. It wasn't even necessary to number the dots on this plot to connect them. I'm thinking that maybe this is the first movie script generated by a computer. On the other hand, if you want to kill some time with a slick but mindless political thriller spiced up with sporadic violence and wearing its heart on its sleeve, this might do just fine. I can't honestly say it's actually bad, but instead so painfully ordinary that I sure wish that I had spent my time otherwise. (Did I mention it's quite long too.)",Body of Lies
77,joebloggscity,"Spies, lies and the internet in the race to capture a terrorist leader",7,15 January 2009,"In the current environment in the Middle-East, films focussing on the espionage can an interesting insight into the murky world of international realpolitik. ""Body of Lies"" comes into this sphere, and thankfully steers clear of any gung-ho action, and concentrates on the games and friction that can develop between the many sides both within and out-with the sides. Leo DiCaprio gives a good performance as the spy trying to keep each side happy but is hampered by his colleague (Russell Crowe) at every turn. The prime aim of the Americans and the Jordanian authorities is to capture a prime terrorist leader, and the chase is on.Mostly filmed with a Middle East background across several states, the settings and camera work are as good as ever by Ridley Scott. A strong, developing story at many points can be quite confusing to fully keep up with the multitude of sides and people, however if you persevere then you will follow what is going on. Leo DiCaprio doesn't always convince in his role in the film whilst Russell Crowe's accent just doesn't seem real too often, but it doesn't get in the way of the film.For anyone who misses the old Cold War spy thrillers then this is a contemporary update on the genre. It's intelligent and thrilling at many points. Not the best that has ever come out from the genre, but still an enjoyable film nonetheless.",Body of Lies
78,jpschapira,The man in the dark,7,3 December 2008,"In essence, ""Body of lies"" is a film we could do without. It has no specific message or declaration about a situation it depicts quite accurately, it takes no sides, it brings nothing new (cinematically speaking) to the table, it's long but it doesn't feel like it (courtesy of William Monahan's again fast-paced adapted script) and still doesn't entertain very much; but it's better than your average movie of the type and this is useful to highlight, again, one man's talent: Ridley Scott. I admire Scott because he knows exactly what to do, and because he cares about the viewers recognizing how he does it. It's impossible not to be familiar with Scott's film-making; he's been trying hard this decade to establish a style that sometimes achieves greatness (""Gladiator"") and other times is not very far from that (I'm among the few defenders of ""Kingdom of Heaven""), but no matter what he always delivers a good product. Effective might be the word, but I believe it's more than that. You may search compulsively and you'll find there's always a connection, but the bottomline is that Scott generates the mood for us putting his crew to work: the melancholic music, the stunning images of the desert, the perfectly shot action scenes, the connection with the characters. If you pay attention, you'll realize the director has a brand of his own that goes beyond our regular brainless entertainment. Watch something epic like ""Gladiator"", or something more minimalist like ""American Gangster"" and tell me if I'm wrong. As in 'Gangster', where he put Russell Crowe alongside Denzel Washington, here Scott tries to introduce a new unexpected acting combination, putting his favorite actor in front of Leonardo DiCaprio, who's at the top of this game these days. Now I don't know if Scott was ever able to get brilliance out of his actors, and this speaks well of, for example, Denzel Washington, who's able to give memorable performance in something like ""American Gangster"" and also in the dreadful things Tony Scott's been doing lately. In this movie, DiCaprio outshines Crowe because he comes from the cockiness of ""Blood Diamond"" and ""The Departed""; and he holds on to the elements of those two great performances to play Ferris, the CIA undercover agent. Again somekind of an agent, again sure of himself (specially with women), and now with more action than ever, the character provides a strong basis for DiCaprio to accomplish a splendid job.But I guess all this is because Scott's way of working is something more general. In that way, there's something he must be sure of doing and it's probably the thing I love about him the most: he bets, always, for his characters. He makes sure they are three-dimensional men (yes, Scott's main characters are mostly male) with emotions, who suffer and put their lives at risk for the codes they stand for, whether it has to do with religion, with family or with defending your country. As I implicitly said in my review of ""Kingdom of Heaven"", Scott's heroes are kind of 'silent martyrs'. They shine but they prefer to stay in the dark. Don't be fooled by the pyrotechnics and the action scenes that this time are not so emotionally connected to the characters (a minor flaw), Scott is also a 'silent martyr'; a guy who shines in his job but is humble enough about it, and prefers to stay in the dark.",Body of Lies
79,Maziun,Another boring Anti-America movie,2,16 August 2013,"Long long time ago Ridley Scott made rarely a movie , but when he made one it was a good movie . Now it seems he's hyperactive , because he's making one movie after another in short time . Too bad that almost nothing he makes now isn't watchable .

Add to that a lot of ""blame America"" comments.Russell Crowe is terribly boring in his role . He looks like he could fall asleep any moment . Leonardo DiCaprio repeats the same catalogue of facial expressions , gestures and shouting that you've seen from him in his other movies. Mark Strong gives a nice (and the best performance of the movie) performance , full of elegance and silent charisma.The movie is often visually ugly (the shootout at the desert) , but at least the pacing is quite decent.

BODY OF LIES stars Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio, both doing good performances, and although they rarely share screen-space they have a nifty relationship. Ridley Scott's eye for the visual and knack for good set-pieces is all good, but it doesn't avoid the film's messy plot-line, I sort of sat through this trying to understand this piece, but who knows what's going on here? DiCaprio is CIA's man in the field, and he makes his way through explosions, car-chases, investigations, lies and even love with a interesting perspective and even look (that beard's gotta go Leo). Russell Crowe is the America the way the Middle-East sees it, fat and ugly and discussing war-problems over cigars and bringing kids to the school. This is a messy political thriller, and although it's got its moments of suspense and moral complexity, it's got some of that American Gangster-feel (though it was better), two good performances trying hard, but Scott himself is doing better as a director of photography, than actual director.",Body of Lies
82,jdkraus,A very realistic look on terrorism and also very entertaining,9,31 October 2008,"Russell Crowe says it best, ""What we're dealing with here is potential a global war that requires constant diligence in order to suppress."" The U.S. and other nations are at war with terrorism. ""Body of Lies"" demonstrates this very realistically, but also maintains as a great action thriller. The bad guy is Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul), an Islamist mastermind who devises plans to attack European and American cities. CIA operative Roger Ferris (Leo Dicaprio) is sent into the Middle East to track him down with the help of his boss in Langley, Ed Hoffman. The uniqueness of this film is that it is told through two different perspectives, Ed's and Roger's. Whenever we see Ed in the film, he is either eating, trying to take care of his kids, and in the satellite room, while watching Ferris via satellite or talking to on a headphone. Crowe turns a rather boring role into something that is funny and amusing too watch. He delivers one line after another fluently and with a bit of humor. This is unusual for Crowe since he always plays a touch guy, but nevertheless he's excellent. As with Dicaprio, he lights up the screen, proving himself to be a very talented actor. Since the release of ""The Aviator"" he seems to be getting better and better in his roles. No doubt he'll get at least a Golden Globe nom for his performance in this, portraying a man who is drawn between a love interest (Golshifteh Farahani) and his job, between whether to trust his Middle Eastern associate against terrorism Hani (Mark Strong) and his somewhat unreliable boss in Langley. Director Ridley Scott tells the story uniquely with his combination of different camera shots and angles. In the action sequences, the camera is shaky, giving an intense and chaotic to the film as well as the intense medium and close up shots in the scenes of dialog. I personally found one of the most well done scenes to be towards the end where Dicaprio is captured by the terrorists. Not only is the mood of the scene dramatic by the low key lighting, creating deep shadows, but also by the well-placed shots that capture the magnificence of Dicaprio's performance, as well as Alon Aboutboul's. This scene reminds me how much people take religion so seriously that they are willing to kill in the name of a God. As Dicaprio says, ""you've twisted' the understanding of the Koran, which the terrorists in the Middle East have done and are doing. The only downside to this film is the length and somewhat of the structure of the action. The first half of the film has a lot great foot-on-foot chases and some cool explosions and gun battles, but the second half falls into the category of an espionage thriller, little action, more mystery. This is not a bad thing, but I found this rather odd and dull, making my butt itch a little in my seat. Overall though, ""Body of Lies"" is another masterwork by Ridley Scott, although like his other moviesthere is graphic violence, including a very, very unpleasant torture scene.",Body of Lies

Ferris is a CIA agent operating against terrorists on the ground, taking orders from a tubby Russell Crowe who cold-bloodedly (oh, the irony!) orders death and destruction from the side of his daughter's soccer pitch. Ferris is a hotshot pro, their best guy, but incredulously seems unaware that his romantic maneuvers towards an Arab woman might bode ill for her...Ridley, you're having a laugh mate...Like the risible The Kingdom, Arab characters are clearly marked out for an untimely end by the fact that they are shown loving their kids.

For all those people there's Peter Berg's ""The Kingdom"". Ridley Scott's movie, however, is much more intelligent than that.Carried by the wonderful Leonardo DiCaprio in yet another landmark role and a solid performance by Scott-regular Russell Crowe, ""Body Of Lies"" doesn't get boring for a moment of its entire 128 minutes running time. The plot is intriguing and the dialog is delivering its message spot-on without ever being preachy. I think it's a good sign that we're living in a time where American movies can be as critical as ""Body Of Lies"" even though the so called ""war on terrorism"" is still raging.

86,anselmdaniel,Mixed formula,7,18 May 2019,"This review contains spoilers.'Body of Lies' is a 2008 thriller movie. This movie is directed and produced by Ridley Scott. The movie is based on the spy novel of the same name written by David Ignatius. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe as they seek out a terrorist. Body of Lies is an incredibly mixed movie. This movie has problems where it can be unengaging at times. The movie presents itself as a grounded spy thriller, but at 128 minutes of running time it felt long. There seemed to be too many characters for the audience to pay attention to and this caused the supporting characters to suffer. I found myself bored even though I was following the plot. Ridley Scott's direction is good and kept me captivated on some scenes but most of the criticisms here are levied at the screenplay.Body of Lies has loads of problems in the pacing of the movie. It can feel both slow and rushed. It felt as if the movie had to utilize familiar spy themed tropes to move the scenes quickly but then it wanted to be a realistic spy thriller. One of these examples is Mark Strong's character of Hani Salaam. This character plays an important part of the movie and it felt like more time should have been devoted to him. Instead the movie rushed this and it felt weaker as a result.Despite the problems, I would still recommend 'Body of Lies.'Grade: C",Body of Lies
87,moviesleuth2,Refreshing,10,20 June 2010,"""Body of Lies"" is a breath of fresh air in the Hollywood dreck of formulas and special effects. This is an intelligent and well-acted thriller that is completely invigorating. You must pay close attention in order to catch everything, but the great thing about this movie is that it's almost impossible to get lost (because there are little reminders along the way, and it is so involving to begin with).Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a ground operative of the CIA in Jordan. His task is to find a terrorist named Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutbol), a terrorist responsible for a number of bombings all over Europe. His handler, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) watches his every movie via satellite, while on the ground he is working with the director of Jordanian security, Hani (Mark Strong). And it's never possible to serve once while working with the other.This is what happens when Hollywood takes a chance and makes a movie for an audience that that doesn't include teenagers with IQs in the double digit range. Fortunately, it's not ""Michael Clayton"" either, so you don't have to be a Mensa member to get it. Nothing is easily predicted in this film, and the plot trajectory is anything but normal.The acting is very strong. Leonardo DiCaprio continues to give terrific performances in every film that he's done, and Roger Ferris is another character to add to that list. He's a smart guy, but unlike Ed, who views things from a safe distance back in the US, he experiences everything first hand, which gives him a different perspective than the politicized Ed. Ferris is there to do the job, and he allies himself with whoever will get him closer to that goal. Russell Crowe actually acts for once instead of just grumbling and mumbling his lines to manufacture intensity (see ""Gladiator"" and ""Robin Hood for examples of this). He's an arrogant jerk, and sees everyone as pawns in this political game, spouting Bush-era jargon whenever the need arises. He's also deceptive and a liar, which seriously irks Ferris because this nearly gets him killed a number of times. Unfortunately, Ferris is working for Ed, not Hani, who demands that he is never lied to. Strong has been making great headway into the Hollywood circuit, and he has impressive versatility. With subtle changes in his voice and body language, Strong can play a large number of characters, and Hani is among his best. He wants to catch Al-Saleem, but demands absolute trust, something that Ferris can't give. He's a powerful, and often dangerous, but likable man.What I really liked about this film is that it functions as a sort of tug of war game between Ed and Hani, with Ferris caught in the middle. Only this time the knot is independent. This is an interesting character conflict that is deftly handled by Ridley Scott. This is character-based battle of wills is part of the reason why this film is so engaging.This is a masterpiece of storytelling and directorial skill.

91,the-movie-guy,You can't trust a spy during war time,8,10 October 2008,"(Synopsis) Roger Ferris, Leonardo DiCaprio, is a CIA covert operative working in Jordan searching for terrorists who have been bombing civilian targets. Ferris uncovers information on the Islamist mastermind Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). He devises a plan to infiltrate Al-Saleem's terrorist network with the help of his boss back in Langley, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe). Ferris enlists the help of the Chief of Jordanian Intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong) on this operation. But he doesn't know how far he can trust him without putting his life in danger. During war time, a spy doesn't know who he can trust, not even his own people.(My Comment) The film explores the conflict between the West vs. Arab conflict. The setup gives enough time for character development of the rough-and-tumble CIA operative, Roger Ferris, who is fluent in Arabic and works in the treacherous streets of the Middle East. Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job in portraying this dedicated CIA operative. Russell Crowe, on the other hand, basically phoned in his part. The film is realistic in that it shows that a democracy is an easy target to the terrorist. The film is full of action with shootouts, car chases, and big explosions about every 10 minutes. There are several interrogation scenes that are very brutal and graphic. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:09, Rated R)(8/10)",Body of Lies

Yes!,5,12 February 2010,"Though far from being the best espionage thriller, or the most insightful movie about the Middle East, it is well written and exciting for the most part.Leonardo DiCaprio proves once again that even though he has a rather limited stature, he is absolutely the most powerful actor in movies today. Russell Crowe, also shines once again in an absolutely thankless part, as a bigot and a pompous bureaucrat. It's amazing that he can project that kind of impression without really doing much of anything - he rarely speaks above a monotone here.The movie is worth seeing mostly for the entertainment value, not if you are looking for some great insight into the conflict between the Middle East and the west. There are many comments about how USA's invasion is a big, fat waste of human lives, but hey, that has pretty much been said since the invasion began. This is not a political movie.Thus, we have a love story for compensation. It is as insightful as you would expect. Yes, we know already before it starts that it could never end with that the couple will live happily ever after and we know that something terrible will happen in order to pound that point home. So no real interest there, except for the rather playful scene at the lunch table. Really well written and surprisingly, it doesn't end with a bitter argument.The end is a bit unfulfilled but overall a very passable time to spend two hours.",Body of Lies

A CIA agent hunting for a terrorist gets in trouble when his boss does something stupid and has to find alternative ways of finding his target. Apart from the political edge this film has nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, that hasn't been done by any of the other war-on-terror films the last 7 years.I will have to admit that it is acted out quite nicely, and as a fantasy story it works out well too - it could be real and it looks real. But it comes in a time when there are too many films just like it and thereby becomes a thirteen in a dozen political thriller. Therefore, it doesn't amuse, it doesn't make one think, it doesn't leave one with a profound insight into the grim reality, it doesn't thrill or keep one tight to his/her seat. It doesn't do anything. It goes in the one ear and out the other and that is a bit of a shame.To make a film like this work one should search for different enemies in different places and search for different threats to different targets.

Crowe is his handler and eye in the sky determined to get the job doneno matter who's in the way.Thoughts: Crowe continues his teaming with director Scott (they've already done 'Gladiator', 'A Good Year' and 'American Gangster' not to mention a 'Robin Hood' film due next year) as capable but ultimately unlikable analyst. DiCaprio takes center stage and does a great job as an agent looking to do his best in a bad situation only complicating things more by trying to manage a love life amidst a terror war. The script was very well constructed and Scott once again proves his visual flare and keen eye for framing the action. In Conclusion: 'Body of Lies' is a solid enough of a post-9/11 terror thriller but in the end I thought it could have used more action especially in the mid-section.

So I felt like I was expecting another great movie of his that appeared to be fine. Felt kind of cheated by that point. Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe are doing a great work, good performance but they're characters are not interesting: we don't get to see much of their personal lives. We know that they don't get along well, we know they have different opinions over the government and the mission. The characters to me feel empty. Also the relationship between DiCaprio's character and Aisha doesn't serve the plot. Their relationship has no effect and doesn't go anywhere at the end of the film.

Next in line would probably be THE DUELLISTS, a period picture but one with enough idiosyncrasies to stand out. This just feels like more of what we've seen before. Where's the vision? Well constructed, sure, but nothing that will stick with you. DiCaprio is fine, not much of a performance to comment on, though. Russell Crowe bores me, he just does nothing for me at all.

And I'll be honest, it's not a film that's going to blow you away, but it's definitely interesting and yeah, it's a good thriller to get stuck into.The film does have some negative points I'd like to mention. So the first for me is that Russell Crowe's character just wasn't a likeable or engaging guy. Whenever he was on screen I just didn't want him there. He did the role well, but the writing of the character just made him annoying above anything else.The small element of romance they added into the film. I get some will enjoy that part of the plot, but for me I just did not care whatsoever. It wasn't involved long enough to really mean anything so it just felt like filler. I mean ultimately I don't watch a movie on the war on terror to see a romantic connection between 2 characters. Not for me.The plot itself was actually really good. Just wanted to mention a couple of minor things. So I thought the start of the film (first 20 mins) was a little slow. I wasn't too sure on the direction of the film as not a lot was really happening. It does massively pick up however and it's a dead good watch.Finally I thought the ending was a little underwhelming. It ended nicely, as you'd expect it to end. Maybe that was the issue? But, it kind of just happened suddenly and boom, it ends. It just felt a little rushed and I wanted to see a bit more on the whole ending.These points aren't movie ending though and overall I really did enjoy this film. As mentioned at the beginning, it's a plot that really keeps you invested and connected to the characters. I'd definitely say it's a different take on an idea that's been done multiple times, so it's worth watching in my opinion.",Body of Lies

It gets clearer the more you watch it, like other of Ridley's films. Great attention to detail, which works a lot of the time, but not always. Visually effective. However, it's not an uplifting story, or rewarding to watch, in spite of Golshifteh, as attractive here as she was in Paterson. Another reviewer has pointed out that there was nobody else pleasant or decent enough to root for; they were all nasty in varying ways, with DiCaprio slightly more appealing than Crowe, which isn't saying much. What's the message ? That war, especially Middle East war, is brutal, cynically treacherous and indifferent to suffering; kill or be killed ? Suicidal, sacrificial, martyr-minded ? Not very entertaining or enlightening. I don't need to know that. I'm sufficiently aware of it already, in any case.",Body of Lies
101,pfgpowell-1,Of its kind very good - but doesn't quite go the whole mile,6,6 November 2010,"Body Of Lies is rather like one of those games in which you have 16 movable pieces in a frame and you are required to slide each piece into place to show a sequence of numbers or complete a picture. It isn't an easy task. You think you are about to complete the puzzle when sliding one piece forces another piece out of place. Body Of Lies has all the pieces but they are so jumbled up, it is very difficult knowing just what kind of film you are watching, or even what kind of film producer/director Ridley Scott wanted us to watch. Is it really supposed to be just a shoot 'em up James Bond adventure flick with 21st-century technology and production values? Or does it want to be taken more seriously as a tacit critique of US crypto-imperialism? (For whatever it wants to say the CIA and the US don't really come out of this smelling of roses.) Or are we intended to watch a process of gradual disillusionment as Leonardo Di Caprio seasoned CIA operative loses the faith and hands in his badge. One thing is certain: as filmmaking goes, Ridley Scott is one of the top of the class, and doesn't disappoint here, either. So perhaps it would be best to take this film at its face value and regard it as just another, though exceptionally well-made, adventure flick. Certainly, it works on that level, and will completely satisfy many. But I've seen enough of such, essentially shallow, adventure flicks and want something more. As I have outlined about, Body Of Lies does indeed seem on the brink of delivering more. But it never seems to actually do so. So we have Russell Crowe's utterly pragmatic, not to say amorally cynical CIA boss, representing all that seems to be soulless in US Middle Eastern policy. Russell Crowe always gives good value, but here his part seems just a little too thin to satisfy. He seems to be more of a cypher than a real character, and to be honest anyone who has seen similar films will have seen this kind of man 1,000 before. Here he's called Hoffman. In other films he has other names but the point of view is the same. Then there is Di Caprio's character Roger Ferris: only in Jason Bourne/James style schlock does an operative work alone. In the kind of film Body Of Lies seems to want to be, something a little more serious, the 'lone wolf' spiel doesn't really worked. What about 'the love interest', the nurse Ferris meets and falls for? As far as the story is concerned, she simply fulfils a function. She is no more than a plot device. That is fair enough in your common or garden adventure flick with big bangs, fast cars and slick fights, but here she is presented as something more. And undoubtedly knowing her brings about the change which sees Ferris become disillusioned with his work. So, to be honest, the film is obliged to provide more, but that is just what it doesn't do. Finally, mention should be made of Mark Strong's suave and highly professional head of Jordanian intelligence. He exists quite happily in either film – the adventure flick or the deeper think piece – and, in a certain way, is the most satisfying character of all. So there you have it: well-made but something of a jumble. It would be unfair to mark Body Of Lies down because very many people, those who think a new Jason Bourne/James Bond film is better than heaven, film thoroughly enjoy this. You will only be disappointed if, like me, you felt you were led to believe something more would be delivered (perhaps something along the lines of the Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser version of Graham Greene's The Quiet American) which, in the event it is not.",Body of Lies

What I didn't expect was to enjoy Crowe and DiCaprio's portrayals as much as I did. In fact, in the end I can't quite figure out who really should be singled out as the most key player here. I guess if I was forced to choose I'd choose Scott, but both Crowe and DiCaprio are quite excellent and either of them could have sabotaged the whole project with false moves. They more than do their part to carry the story forward.There's nothing unconvincing in this movie with the one possible exception that someone like DiCaprio would know the native language. Other than that it's all pretty plausible. You're going to get a lot of location visuals of the Middle East that I've never seen before, and you're going to get a storyline that's fairly easy to follow for a change.

Early in the film after an attack, Roger gets posted in Jordan to work with their local team, headed by Hani (played brilliantly by Mark Strong), to track down a fledgling terrorist group believed to be based there.

108,dvc5159,"Excellent film, one of the year's best.",6,7 December 2008,"Ridley Scott, at the age of 70, is still going strong and shows no signs of slowing down. Having helmed classics like ""Gladiator"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"", and ""American Gangster"" within the same decade, Scott adds another classic to that list; this one. Taking on the risky theme of Middle Eastern terrorism, Scott has crafted a genuinely fine piece of work, if not for his two outstanding leads, DiCaprio and his regular Crowe.DiCaprio delivers another winning performance here as the young CIA field agent who is given authority within a short time period to do what he wants to get what his superior wants. Here he is cocky, brave and smart, exactly what his character should be. He is the true lead of the film because without him, the story and film would be meaningless. His solid performance also makes the film better. DiCaprio is now recognizable as a character who completely immerses himself in the role. His ""Leo-the-pretty-boy"" days are long gone.Ridley Scott's regular Crowe takes a back seat here, to be DiCaprio's supervisor. Crowe delivers the best performance here. From his Arkansas accent to his leniency at handling somewhat drastic situations, Crowe steals almost every scene he's in. It's good, really, because it makes his character slimy yet interesting. Although his role is understated and underused a bit, it also makes his character cautious.The script is excellent. Plot driven, the superb dialog at times serve as a reminder of what these people face everyday until they act lenient to be calm of the situation. Without being too preachy, it has shown what the Western Intel has correctly and incorrectly affected this post 9/11 world. Sometimes bordering on situational comedy, the script cleverly manages to evade these to move on to more mature and dark scenes. The high tech scenes are added here for visual effect, and they get the job done.Scott still has his touch, the dialog scenes are dynamite, the action sequences are brutal, realistic and stunning; and the direction is swift and gripping. It never loses your interest. Although slipping on the pro-Hollywood side at times, this quickly makes up with its intelligence; high tech gizmos cannot compare to the traditional word of mouth used by terrorists.The music score suits the gritty atmosphere well, and the cinematography is beautiful and captures the Arabian sands well.Overall, an excellent espionage thriller with two fantastic lead actors and a master director who has not lost his touch, with a gripping premise and violent action, ""Body of Lies"" may very well be one of the year's best films.People this is the world we are living in, whether we like it or not.Overall: 8.5/10",Body of Lies
109,gary-444,Terrific Middle East Thriller,8,27 November 2008,"Despite an ambivalent response from the Critics this is the best Hollywood effort yet about the intrigues of the modern Middle East. Sir Ridley Scott produces a densely plotted, yet accessible, thriller which steers clear of the failings of other efforts in the genre so far. Di Caprio produces yet another fine performance as a high flying young CIA Station Chief, Ferris, in Amman, and Crowe gives a scintillating performance as Hoffman ,his bloated, arrogant, corpulent boss back at Langley.Skilfully, Scott throws in the crowd pleasing elements, ""there are some people who don't want to be negotiated with"", and the, literally, knife edge release of Ferris, amidst a much more even handed exploration of the geo-politics of International Terrorism. Aisha, Ferris's love interest, an Iranian born nurse ,becomes an innocent pawn in this battle of wits, and the Jordanian head of Intelligence outwits the CIA at their own game.Al Qaeda's cynical atrocities are matched by the cynical indifference of the CIA to achieve their own objectives, whatever the cost. Hoffman coolly gives life and death telephone instructions whilst attending to various mundane family duties. The cinematography is superb with lush, yet grimly authentic images abounding. As is Scott's, trademark, the action sequences are superb, yet show commendable restraint. When people are shot, they stay shot.The three obvious predecessors to this, The Kingdom, Rendition, and Lions for Lambs were all flawed by the requirement for there to be an American Hero to win over the home audience. ""Body of Lies"" attempts, and largely succeeds in conveying a much more morally ambiguous landscape.

DiCaprio is okay as point-man Roger Ferris; Crowe gives a very convincing performance as Hoffman, Ferris's control guy back in the States. Golshifteh Farahani is particularly good as Aisha, the half-Iranian Palestinian refugee nurse that Ferris falls for in Amman. The whole conflict of the film is the CIA's attempts to catch Al-Saleem, a bin Ladenish terrorist mastermind whose followers are committing suicide bombings all over Europe. Quite violent, as you can imagine, but it's not completely dominated by blow-'em-up scenes.I like the way that BODY OF LIES portrays the CIA ops: Hard-edged, cynical, without any real lives of their own, but not the completely soulless spooks that they are in certain other books and films. Plot-wise, it's not entirely predictable, but there's something missing in the way of really surprising complications. Some good themes: The way the amoral Hoffman has to keep reminding himself and everyone else, ""We are at war,"" that no one on either side is innocent, etc. The parallels it shows between Hoffman and Al-Saleem, Ferris and the suicide bombers, are quite acute. Still, there's not much here that hasn't been better-done elsewhere.I found BODY OF LIES watchable but pretty unfulfilling. Many people obviously like this film, but many others are obviously finding it to be 128 very draggy minutes, and I can see why. It's obviously dated by everything that's happened in the six years since it was released, and was probably a better film then than it is now.",Body of Lies
112,B24,Mildly Entertaining,6,20 December 2009,"Normally I would not comment on a movie like this because it is just another over-the-top potboiler I watched on HBO without much interest. It has a certain topical feel, however, and I was much taken by what seem to be authentic references to actual places and events. And it does contain evidence of a great deal of skill put forth by its producers and directors among others in crafting the thing in such a way as to demand the viewer's attention to its technical merits. As an example I mention a scene photographed in part from the air in which the protagonist as played by DiCaprio is spirited away to a presumed secret meeting with the good/bad guys out on the desert. It involves a genuinely amusing mixture of visual deception and constant action.Indeed constant action is the one element that holds an otherwise thin plot together. DiCaprio as a kind of Tom Cruise/Daniel Craig/Matt Damon superhero shows us a few new angles to standard laid-back emoting, though his vocal range as usual needs further work in the manner of Demosthenes or at least Richard Burton. A silly and sentimental love story intrudes on an otherwise straightforward portrayal of American spies in over their head against insidious and treacherous enemies/friends, with Russell Crowe in a throwaway performance designed, one supposes, as a kind of casting against type.Something to watch on a snowy evening as a desert antidote to the cold.",Body of Lies
113,jb_campo,Chilling espionage drama,7,16 January 2016,"Body of Lies is a scary film because you are never certain what is going to happen next. Dicaprio excels as Ferris, middle-east-based CIA agent who actually likes being in the middle east. He and his counterpart, Crowe (as Hoffman), who is based stateside, are both seasoned espionage agents tracking a middle eastern bomber blowing up places in Europe. Deals and side deals, observers in crowds, cars following you, people talking quietly in groups. All this ratchets up the drama about who knows what, and who is being grabbed next. When you throw in a potential love interest for Dicaprio, that raises the tension and mystery yet more.By far the surprise star is Mark Strong as Hani, the suave, debonair head of Jordanian security who has a symbiotic relationship with the CIA. They need each other, but who is using whom? Ferris tries to play both sides of the street by not lying to Hani, while working with Hoffman who would lie to anyone to get what he wants. Hani is terrific. When he steps in a room you don't know if he's going to sweet talk you, or rip your fingernails out.Body of Lies has terrific acting throughout by the entire cast. The story is quite realistic. The cinematography is realistic, and the editing and directing keeps this espionage action drama moving along.There are several violent scenes that might not be for the squeamish, so be warned.

He has occasional flashes of genius (Alien, Gladiator), but always seems to make steady, good, interesting, and watchable films. The same applies here with Body of Lies. While the film will not be this year's major awards contender, Body of Lies is among the better films by Scott, somewhere between American Gangster and Black Hawk Down.One thing Scott always manages to do in his films is ground the film in reality very well, setting a mood that allows us to get into the film easier. While it has its dark moments, I wouldn't consider this a supremely dark or depressing picture, despite the subject matter. In Body of Lies, his take on the War on Terror in the Middle East is gripping and realistic (especially the sets), though not as thrilling as it should be. Though put in danger many times throughout the film, I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat whenever those moments rolled around.As we already know, the film features two of the most dynamic and talented actors working today in Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. Here, Scott gives his usual tag team partner Crowe a break to let DiCaprio take the reigns. Leo has long been one of my favorite actors for his ability to bring intensity and grit to every role he plays (outside of Titanic and Gilbert Grape, of course), making real and believable characters time in and time out. Again, DiCaprio steals the show and makes the movie watchable, as he's in almost every scene in one way or another. Without his commanding and charismatic presence, the film would sink. He delivers yet another winner of a show, showcasing his ability to grow into even more adult roles as he grows older. His role in the film is strikingly similar to his position in his career. He's in between young heroic roles and adult authoritative roles, which is what his Roger Ferris is: a young CIA agent dealing with new found authority and choices.Though on paper, Russell Crowe's role is pretty weak, he manages to turn in a great performance through an altered appearance and voice. Once again, Crowe's character symbolizes who he is as a person: a shaken soda bottle one twist from exploding. It is because our two leads (I feel weird saying that, as DiCaprio is the only true lead) work so well together and hold our attention so well that the film succeeds. An able supporting cast adds to the film as well.Technically well made, just like every other Scott films, Body of Lies brings nothing new to the table while taking things we've seen before and one-upping the last to do it. The sound in particular was a plus for me, as was the art direction (like I've said, these are always good things in a Ridley Scott film). The preview can be a bit deceiving in marketing the film as an action political thriller, like Blood Diamond, when in reality it is the thinking man's thriller without that plot twist I thought would be coming. While the film does have some marvelous and well done action, it's few and far between, as the film is more about gathering intelligence than intelligently blowing everything up.I also appreciate that the film rarely dragged or got boring, and I credit this to yet another winning script from William Monahan, scribe of The Departed. I think another Oscar nomination for Monahan is possible here. All in all, Body of Lies is a well made film that would be nothing special (again, the lack of thrills in some parts) if not for the commanding presence of Leonardo DiCaprio and the always consistent Ridley Scott. It's not worth losing your head over, but it is worth giving the price of admission to your local theater.",Body of Lies
116,shadowman123,DiCap adds another to his CV,8,25 November 2008,"Body of Lies is Ridley Scotts return to the thriller genre and he shows us why he is just so dame good at the job he gets those big bucks for. Body of Lies on the surface might just seem like a run of the mill middle East thriller but actually by checking it out we see the amount of realism involved in it is what makes it stand out from the rest of the hyped up Hollywood blockbusters. Leo DiCap adds another fine performance onto his CV and proves why exactly he is one of the most talented actors to grace the screen , I can't believe this was the same squirt who I could not stand in Titanic! The film has a constant pace, there is action, suspense and drama . It maintains a constant twist and turn feel to it and has a lot of realism added to it . My only only complaint is that although it runs with the realism theme a little too much and thusly it drags on and ends up being longer then it should be. On the whole a good film put together by Scott, worth a check out especially if your a fan of thrillers.BODY OF LIES: 8.1 OUT OF 10 TRUST NO ONE , Deceive EVERYONE...",Body of Lies
117,jemps918,"Engaging, intelligent",9,11 October 2008,"V. well-made; everyone from the cast and crew pulled their own weight in Body of Lies.Director Ridley Scott's genius shines through what could have been another unpalatable, trite topic of the US' relations with the Middle East and terrorism. He expertly unravels the story of CIA operative Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is assigned to flush out an evasive terrorist who is blowing up public places all over the world. Ferris is increasingly frustrated with his boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe)'s impatience and double dealings, which more than once puts himself in jeopardy, challenges the trust he is trying to build with Jordanian leader Hani (Mark Strong) and his budding romance with the pretty Palestinian nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani).DiCaprio just keeps getting better and better as he is now more able to lose himself in a role and successfully shed the pretty. Crowe does well in an understated but dangerously quiet role as a Washington-based puppetmaster. The versatile Italian-Austrian Andy Garcia-lookalike Strong is fantastic as the powerful Hani, while Farahani's face lights up the screen and turns in a memorable performance as well.The attention to detail in this movie is just awesome; the action sequences are not over the top but satisfactory enough to not lose the main storyline despite the complex thread of subplots. Overall, an engaging, intelligently-made film.",Body of Lies
118,pinkliz41,Scotts worst since Black Hawk Down,1,10 April 2009,"Ridley Scott, director of such classics like Alien, Gladiator and American Gangster takes on an important subject but destroys the aim of making it this by being selfish and incompetent by not giving any of the actors descent morals or a good build of structure. The direction, well, thats another thing. Is he high or something? well it seemed like he was during this film. Most of the shots are uncanny and hard to adjust to and, they repeat themselves over, and over again.The backdrop to the film is realistic and at-times, profound. But this doesn't turn the tide of other major mis-steps. Whats happened to Di Caprio?, he's turned into some what appears to be happening, washed up and a poor collaboration to the film industry.Better luck next time Mr Scott, and please don't pick Di Caprio again!",Body of Lies
119,rhinocerosfive-1,Body of Lard,2,4 March 2009,"An action movie with no action. A thriller with no thrills. A political story with the politics of a third grader who maybe read a Scholastic book for RIF: The Little Foreign Policy that Couldn't.Fortunately for the film, eating away at the heart of this travesty is another great performance by Mark Strong. He was scary as hell in SYRIANA and he's reasonably intimidating here. Unfortunately for all of us, he has nothing to do but smoke cigars and wear nice suits. His character, really the only character in the movie, goes nowhere. What this world needs is another bloated third-rate Middle East spy movie with nothing to offer in the way of insight or interest. What is Ridley Scott, anyway? That's right. He's the guy without whom we'd have to leave these things to Peter Berg.",Body of Lies
120,krzysiektom,naive and simplistic,6,30 November 2008,"It is not as interesting or visually captivating as it could be. Especially Scott is known for good visuals, but this time he did not make such an effort. The love story seems a bit forced and naive, they meet thrice in a doctor's room and then have two dates and suddenly he is ready to be tortured and killed for her? Yeah right. He is an ordinary CIA field operative and he ""decides"" he will draw and asset in and then ""decides"" to be exchanged for the girl? Yeah right, not in a real world. The nurse, her sister, her nephews and the mid-level Al-Kaeida terrorist all speak fluent English. Especially to DicAprio's character, though he allegedly is fluent in Arabic. Hmm, how convenient for the viewers, and how realistic... In one earlier scene DiCaprio's character shows to be a fantastic shot, later he takes five or six clear shots at an escaping car but cannot hit the target. Hmm. I know CIA and the US in general are know to be heavy'handed and ignorant at times, but if the CIA were run by guys like Crowe's character they would not last in Middle East for a month, and would not be a superpower. My point is: Moynihan wrote a naive, simplest script and Scott made an average film of it. What stands out in the film is the music only.",Body of Lies
121,kunalkhandwala,Intense and power-packed!,9,14 October 2008,"'To whom evil is done, do evil in return'. Not to be deceived as a preachy docu-drama about America's foreign policies relating to the war on terror, 'Body Of Lies' is in fact, a slick and sophisticated espionage thriller with a view on terrorism never seen before. Sir Ridley Scott has always redefined genres - 'Aliens' and 'Blade runner' for sci-fi , 'Gladiator' for epics, 'Black Hawk Down' for the ground reality in the middle east, 'Hannibal' for psycho-crime thrillers and American Gangster for the crime lords of America. With Leonardo Dicaprio and Russel Crowe as the two superlative actors in the lead, 'Body Of Lies' promises enough fireworks.The film's adroitly conceptualized and masterfully executed action is showcased in the opening sequence as Apache helicopters come to the rescue of a Land Rover that is being pursued by relentless terrorists. They are providing back up for CIA field agent Ferris, whose sound knowledge about ground realities in the middle-east and fluency in Arabic lead him to critical connections of the terrorist cells; at times too close. As if simply following orders, Ferris jumps from one lead to another as per the instructions of his boss at CIA headquarters who monitors the happenings of America's war on terror with his cell phone and the agency's Google Earthly technology. Manipulative and insensitive, Hoffman (Russel Crowe) is the resourceful CIA director whose shrewdness and power hungry ego meets face-to-face with Ferris' moralities and approach towards ethics of espionage. Wits, charm, intensity, experience and knowledge about the various cultures enables Ferris to befriend an Iranian nurse on one hand and the support of Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), the head of Jordanian intelligence, on the other. This tense alliance with the smart, suave and respectable Hani challenges Ferris to maintain his trust by not lying to him. Whereas, the game of deceit is played by Hoffman as he launches missions behind Ferris' back, thus infuriating both Ferris and the Jordanian allies.In all this intensity, Ferris devices an ingenious plan to set up a fake terrorist cell in order to lure Al-Saleem's (alleged terrorist) attention and expose him at a vulnerable point. The plan jeopardizes the vital relationship between CIA and Hani and with an ugly turn of events, the film turns darker and meaner. Being an adaption of a David Ignatius novel, the flawless screenplay by William Monahan brings life to the characters of Hani Salaam, Roger Ferris and Ed Hoffman. A convoluted espionage plot that deals with deceit, trust, breach of trust, cultural understanding, radical Islam and America's agenda for its war on terror through the CIA, has been depicted in a remarkably stylish yet realistic manner by Ridley Scott. Notice the distinct style of the aerial shots of Google Earthly images, the convoys of cars racing through the Moroccan desert, the middle- east locales against the backdrop of the setting sun and simply, the jaw dropping action sequences. Scott's direction controls the audience for the 2 ½ hour duration and grips them with the intricate plot and a powerhouse of performances.Russel Crowe's portrayal of the heavy set Hoffman as he tucks his chin and glares through the brim of his glasses makes his blatant point even sound convincing. His approach maybe too American in being insensitive to moral and cultural issues but he justifies every aggressive action when he describes the foes being radical jihadists who have gone back in time by ignoring the very technology that America uses as its weapon. Thus, Crowe's remarkable versatility is reflected through his performances in 3:10 to Yuma, American Gangster and now, Body of Lies.Leonardo DiCaprio somehow, just manages to transform himself into a character in the most convincing manner. Forget Titanic and look back at Catch me if you can, Gangs of New York, The Aviator,The Departed and Blood Diamond. He has matured in every role with his intensity that has become his hallmark, establishing itself clearly in Body of Lies. The intensity comes with compassion, intelligence, anger, composure and charm that make DiCaprio the 'par excellence' actor of his generation. But surprisingly, even with such great talents in the lead, Mark Strong steals the show as the suave, direct and powerful Hani Salaam. Every single appearance of his in the designer suits commands attention and his cold, direct actions leave us in awe of his power. His intensity in performance brings a menacing touch to a character that is an ally of America but is proud and righteous enough to do things the way he seems fit. Americans are weary of watching the war in Iraq and thus, Body of Lies may not contain the theme to set the box-office on fire but nevertheless, Ridley Scott gives us an intense film about human relationships across cultural barriers, trust being breached with deceit, technology overcome by power of simplicity and a hero marred by his agency's intentions and terrorist's assaults. 8.96 on a scale of 1-10.",Body of Lies
122,daniellawson-14-787057,"Great first half, then drops off",7,11 May 2020,"POSITIVES:1) DiCaprio, Crowe and especially Strong all give great performances
2) The phone calls between DiCaprio and Crowe are very engaging because the characters are so chalk and cheese but forced to work together
3) The film is very gritty and grounded in reality
4) The more espionage focused first half of the film is terrific with great tension and dialogueNEGATIVES:1) As the title of my review says, I was completely immersed in the first half but then the film drops off
2) The romantic sub plot is not engaging at all and when it is first introduced is exactly the moment that the film starts to drop off
3) It could have done with about 20 minutes cutting out. Get rid of the romantic sub plot altogether and also the subplot with Sadiki seemed unnecessary
4) The film suffers from a common problem with action films set in the Middle East, which is that, because it focuses on the American characters, the Islamic characters all get no character development and are forgettable
5) Crowe's character does nothing useful the entire film",Body of Lies
123,lediscipledessocrates,Why Is It So D*** Underrated?,9,7 August 2015,"This movie is so underrated across the board that even I am penning a down a review for it 7 years after I actually watched it. Back then , the decision to buy the tickets was more due to the cast and production credentials than anything else. Also (fortunately ) unlike these days my dependence upon the internet was rather limited preventing me to form opinions about movies which hadn't hit the screens. How I miss those days!Anyhow, moving on from nostalgia to this movie. With super sharp direction, a splendidly candid story, a smart screenplay , Body of Lies was undoubtedly one of the better geo-political espionage movies to have hit the screens in a long time. Cutting loose from the browbeaten tales of the Cold War, the movie offers a chillingly fresh view of the troubled Gulf politics. The scenes and sequences are extremely well shot , and build up a very attentive volume of cinematic tension on screen-an absolute fundamental for any movie in the genre. There is a dominant yet subtle aroma of suspense and anticipation something that was deliberately effaced by the 007 franchise of the 70's and 90's with License to Kill(1989) being a pleasant exception.The plot is believable and the editor avoids narcissistic over indulgence . The entire cast has done a commendable job. Leonardo , accordingly to me, carries on his good work from The Departed (2006) as a wily, calculative yet conscience stricken agent looking to do the job for the flag. Russell Crowe plays out a character well suited to his on screen persona . But it is Mark Strong who injects the extra zing into the movie. His casting is perfect in the role of a local intelligence baron. The movie is a great suspense thriller with good action scenes and credible storytelling . It is thoroughly underrated and I cannot assign any reason for this . Unfortunately this means that it will not be telecast often on television unlike The World is Not Enough. My advice would be to watch it at least once .",Body of Lies
124,chiumt,A Gritty Middle East Terrorist Hunt,8,14 July 2019,At first I thought it was some erotic thriller. But it was entirely different genre altogether. It started off with a terrorist bomb blast in Manchester. Then it transformed into a Al Qaeda hunt in the middle east. The CIA got involved with all the accompanying lies and twists. A good movie with 'star power's.,Body of Lies
125,joestank15,Well made yet could have said more.,8,11 October 2008,"Body of Lies - Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a CIA covert operative working in Jordan searching for terrorists who have been bombing civilian targets. Ferris uncovers information on the Islamist mastermind Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). He devises a plan to infiltrate Al-Saleem's terrorist network with the help of his boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) back in Langley.To start with: The acting is solid all around. Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor I have always respected, gives a believable solid performance. I don't understand why he still receives backlash from being in Titanic 11 years ago. He's a good, sometimes great actor! And no, this film is not ""The Departed in Iraq"". Russell Crowe plays a largely untrustworthy CIA chief alternating between his job and family life. Unfortunately the two men rarely occupy the same space, and as the story focuses more on the Middle East, Crowe's character is sidelined. We don't see as much of him as Dicaprio's character Ferris, so Hoffman seems rather two-dimensional as a result.The rest of the cast is solid. I particularly liked Mark Strong's character Hani. He's powerful, charismatic and dryly funny. Golshifteh Farahani plays a likable romantic interest named Aisha, an Iranian woman.This is a skillfully crafted film. It should be, with veteran director Ridley Scott at the helm. I must say that I do not care for all of his films. I loathe Gladiator and could not get through American Gangster (mobster films just do not do it for me generally). But whether you care for a film of his or not, the cinematography is always superb, and this one is no exception to the rule. I expect at least a pair of Best Cinematography and Editing Award Nominations for this effort. The film maintains a sort of vulnerability throughout, which is how I would feel were I in the Middle East. One of my favorite scenes is when a character (spoiler!) receives congratulatory e-mails from terrorists for an attack he did not commit. It sent absolute chills.The usage of overhead shots is fitting (and cool) as an eye in the sky plays a pivotal role in the plot. Mr. Scott captures a strange beauty in the Middle East, making it that much more unsettling how such a place has been torn apart by violence for ages. That message seems to be on the tip of the film's tongue, but it never really delves past the issues of good guy/bad guy. As such, it's a well-made entertaining film, plain and simple, and intelligent to boot. The ending kind of cuts the film off I feel. There is something mentioned near the end of the film that receives no closure. This was disappointing.Body of Lies is very suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat several times. But I doubt I will see it again soon.B+",Body of Lies
126,caseynicholson,A Well Made Film that Just Barely Misses the Mark,6,16 April 2016,"I watched ""Body of Lies"" the other night for the first time since having seen it in the theater. This is a well made film that just barely misses the mark of being outstanding.Russell Crowe is good in this movie, and it's arguably one of the few Crowe movies in which he transforms into his character rather than simply playing himself. DiCaprio is good enough, though he definitely suffers from his ongoing inability to play a character rather than being stuck in his same old mannerisms.The plot of this movie is quite intriguing. It's a film that revolves around post-9/11 terrorism in the mid-east, with most of the movie taking place in the very places that make the news the most some eight years later: Iraq, Syria, and Jordan. Sadly, the movie predicts the spread of terrorism to Europe (it was filmed after the 7/7 bus bombings in London, and references them, but shows an attack in Amsterdam that brings to mind recent attacks in Paris and Brussels). Its fictional drama mixed with real world terrorism makes for a compelling story. Unfortunately there's just something about the movie that makes it obvious that it misses the mark just a tad. It might be argued that the studio was trying a bit too hard to make an Oscar worthy picture, but didn't quite pull things together enough. The romantic element of the film feels a bit forced, and despite its strengths it comes across as being a bit more like a made-for-TV drama series than an award worthy feature film.All in all I'm going with 6/10 stars. It's certainly worth the time to see, but ultimately a good popcorn flick rather than a more substantive film.",Body of Lies
127,C22Man,High-Quality Espionage Thriller,7,5 July 2016,"What is most interesting about Body of Lies is that it manages to rise above the predictability and formula that plagues the vast majority of espionage films. It is post-Bourne wrapped up in a more mature Bond plot with a politically conscious edge. Yet it never feels like it is stealing elements of those, more using them as a launch-pad for its own ideas. Though the film itself is sometimes guilty of falling back into safety, it remains consistently exciting and intently engaging even when those moments occur because of how keenly detailed and acted it is. It makes it standout as a cut above many of its contemporaries.We follow Roger Ferris, a ground CIA operative who moves throughout the Middle East in an attempt to lure out and capture terrorist Al- Saleem. Of course his practices involve plenty of lies and deceit as he tries to retain the support of the head of the Jordanian Intelligence. Ferris is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who makes an excellent centrepiece for the film. DiCaprio is a great choice for the role, given his superb ability to convey emotion and his delivery making even mundane dialogue seem important. I'm not sure many could have been as appealing as he is here. Ferris grows into a more interesting character as the film progresses. His disillusion with the lies he has to sow and backstabbing from his superiors make for some of the most intriguing moments, whilst providing some welcomed morality that never feels forced.His superior Hoffman is played terrifically by Russell Crowe, whose weight gain and distinct accent allow him to become the character. Crowe is at his best playing characters like this. Confident, forcefully honest, almost egotistical, yet understanding the importance of the situation. They're traits he always nails. Hoffman appears all-knowing, frequently surveying from the air, keeping constant contact with Ferris as he aids him in setting up a fictional terrorist group to smoke out Al-Saleem. He also clashes with the Jordanian head Hani Salaam, who is convincingly played by Mark Strong, a man who only asks that the CIA don't lie to him, which is something that Ferris finds increasingly difficult to avoid. The interactions and differences between these three main characters is definitely the film's most interesting aspect. All three have distinct personalities that are well developed, conduct their jobs in very different ways and are portrayed by actors who always convince. The scenes that bring them together are always gripping, Ferris meeting Hoffman in Washington to devise a new plan, Hani questioning how Ferris could lie to him, the three of them discussing their mission. They all share a suspicion of one another that is fascinating to see play out.There is a romance between Ferris and an Iranian doctor that is nicely played out and expands the characters. It also offers us an interesting look at the perception of a relationship with someone from the West in the Middle East. However, the issue is that it doesn't really fit in with the tone of the film and ends up becoming a plot device later on in the film which makes it feel rather forced. The action scenes and shootouts are always very fluid and exciting to watch. Notably, there is a weight to them that makes the injuries feel painful, these operatives don't just bounce back up like in so many spy flicks. There's a torture scene near the end that is brilliantly intense and really keeps you guessing as to its outcome.With Ridley Scott at the helm the film is fantastic to look at and his direction is as smooth as it's ever been. In fact I don't think the Middle East has ever looked this vibrant and authentic on screen before. Scott directs the film masterfully. He manages to make the dialogue driven scenes feel just as tense as the action ones. I especially like the use of aerial surveillance, as it gave the film a much wider scope and added to the feeling of always being watched. Scott is saddled with a script that can be jargon heavy, but he's able to make it understandable and technical without dumbing it down or filling it with dialogue that nobody would comprehend. The funny thing is that this is type of film Scott's Brother Tony would usually at home doing, so it's nice to see him try his hand at it and go for a more subtle approach.Despite its amalgamation of various espionage tropes and some misplaced plot points, Body of Lies is an exceptional genre film. It manages to work as both an exciting action thriller and as a more controlled politically-charged piece. The story is packed with deception and intrigue, just right for this type of film. The main characters are well-rounded and captivating to watch, they guide us through the film and I always wanted to see what their next move was going to be. It is a layered story and it's impressive just how well it is conveyed. Plenty of praise should go to Scott, his three leading men and script writer William Monahan. They have crafted a film that is well- balanced, a vivid portrait of the CIA in the Middle East and makes a number of potentially clichéd aspects feel fresh again.",Body of Lies
128,Simon_Says_Movies,Engrossing and engaging conflict driven thriller,8,26 October 2008,"War films have always been a spectacle at the movies. While a hurried deliberation, may give the assumption that movies based upon wartime and conflict would have a narrower audience then those films portraying less heavy subject matter, the contrary is often the case. War films often cater to a larger base then credit is given, as some will flock to see a piece of history, others to see the love-soaked romance that Hollywood was wedged in-between the blood-soaked battles, others like the action, and others the drama. Maybe most of all, it is the fact that movies centered around hostile circumstances often bear the truest of heroes and the vilest of villains that piques the interest of the every-man. However, contrary to past conflicts, that of the Middle East seems to be the opposite of what people define as righteous and what sparks wonderment. And while I have to agree, that should not discourage people from delving into the situation on a purely cinematic level, to better understand and to form their own opinion, especially when viewing a movie as well crafted as Ridley Scott's Body of Lies.When examining cross-sections of the Iraqi conflict it is difficult and important not to portray the locals as faceless murderers, as most are just citizens who want the war to end, and detest terrorism as much as everyone. Body of Lies does this well, by giving us a central antagonist, but a number of Arab allies as well; something that last years The Kingdom did less effectively. If anything, you can draw more similarities with the Don Cheadle film Traitor, which are both more of a window into a situation, then a gimmicky and one-sided battle film. Ridley Scott's follow-up to the sensational American Gangster is about as contradictory as one could expect, but if history has shown us anything it is that Scott is not constrained to a single genre. This feature is a typically sharply written and slow burning effort, with the usual interlay of fiery skirmishes and emotional confrontations that piques interest and demands intelligent thought.Leonardo DiCaprio continues his string of excellent performances as Roger Ferris a CIA operative working in Jordan and other parts of the Middle East who is attempting to net an illusive terrorist bomber named Al-Saleem who has dropped off the grid using low-tech methods of operation. Providing support, mostly from over-seas while taking his kids to soccer, is the pompous Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe, who is merely solid in this effort) who cannot help but interfere with Ferris' tactics. Deciding to somewhat distance himself from Hoffman, Ferris enlists the aid of the Jordan Chief of Intelligence Hani Salaam (Mark Strong) who demands nothing but loyalty, to entrap and track Al-Saleem. Complicating things is a lovely nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) who looks after Ferris after his latest scuffle. But lies are rampant in Jordan, and Ferris soon learns he cannot trust anyone and must test how far he can go to without destroying everything he believes and everyone he cares for.There are not so much twists in Body of Lies, as there are intelligent revelations, which eliminate the need to manipulate the storyline simply for the final hurrah. Something audiences seem to miss with movies like this is that they are often not directly about the war, but about the people, their lives and the cost which everyone pays. While not without foibles, Body of Lies is solid intelligent entertainment, and those looking for a dumbed down splatter fest should look elsewhere. Framed by the performances and highlighted by the glossy action and poignant dialogue, Body of Lies never seems one sided, yet never seems like a cop-out, it is fully realized entertainment that pulls truth from its lies.",Body of Lies
129,quinnox-1,Boring,5,30 March 2012,"This movie seemed to be mainly an excuse to show a lot of middle eastern desert environments and cities alongside random action scenes. The story was muddled and uninteresting, with DiCaprio proving to be a very boring lead character. And since he is on screen for most of the film, it made it that much worse. Normally I'm a huge fan of Russell Crowe, but here he is playing a wimpy and soft spoken non-entity of a character, and anyone could have played this role and done the same thing. The plot was not tense or thrilling, but mundane and rote, lacking any suspense. The best parts of the movie were city shots of the exotic and colorful middle east, I enjoyed those scenes as far as it went anyway.The movie was too long for its own good, with lengthy scenes between DiCaprio and his romantic interest in the movie, a middle eastern woman, that added nothing and were awkward to watch. Dull and disappointing.",Body of Lies
130,Craig_McPherson,Like watching the Amazing Race.... with gunplay,3,12 October 2008,"Based on the 2007 spy novel by David Ignatius, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA operative Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) who is sent to Jordan to track down an Al-Qaeda mastermind, all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to his Jordanian hosts and his manipulative American boss Ed Hoffman (Crowe).Anybody who's seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of Ferris by Hoffman, but the actual story is much more mundane. Instead we are served a tepid broth of ridiculous subterfuge as white pretty boy American Ferris moves with virtual impunity through the teeming streets of Amman Jordan with nary a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of attention from the locals. Only during a scene where Ferris takes his new-found Iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality intrude as the couple are bombarded with glares from Jordanian men.Compounding the film's problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris gets expelled from Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to the UK, Ferris flies back to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of his kids  an on it goes. This is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not a spy thriller.In body-punishing loyalty to his craft, Crowe gained an impressive 63 pounds of flab for the role of portly Ed Hoffman, thus joining the small select club of actors consisting of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as thespians who've subjected themselves to massive weight gain or loss for their roles. It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.",Body of Lies
131,frankenbenz,Ridley Scott Cruise Control,7,6 December 2008,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.comLegendary directors like Ridley Scott have the enviable ability to cherry pick the best screenplays, the best actors and the best personnel to help them make their films. This access to Hollywood's most desirable property and the industry elite undoubtedly increases the chances their projects will be both a critical and box office success. But somewhere along Ridley Scott's way, something has gone wrong. There is no question Scott is a master craftsman with chops rivaled by few in the business, but over the last twenty years Scott has been consistent at one thing: making mediocre films. Not since Alien and Blade Runner has Scott put together back-to-back masterpieces and in many ways, his career is still living off of the fumes of these two films. Today, we can expect Scott to dump beautifully polished turds into theaters once a year. Sure, each of these turds possess overwhelming potential, but they somehow never manage to transcend mediocrity. What has become commonplace in Scott's movies is the feeling you get that everyone above-the-line is mailing in their well paid efforts.Body of Lies is no exception. Despite being expertly constructed by all the technicians on Scott's pretty payroll, the film never manages to exceed its technical proficiency. Much like Scott's last film American Gangster, BOL plays out like a greatest hits medley, many of its scenes poached from the genre's iconic predecessors. While AG was a mashup of The Godfather, GoodFellas, Scarface and Serpico, BOL seems to be spliced from the reels of Our Man in Havana, The Third Man, and more recently, Syriana and The Bourne Franchise. Even Ridley's brother Tony's mediocre Spy Gamee, seems to be in on the espionage collage cobbled together in BOL.In the end audiences are left watching meticulously crafted film-making devoid of any real or heightened suspense. It's impossible to attach stakes to something we can't help but feel we've seen before, from the politics, the betrayals, the explosions, right down to the protagonist's inevitable defection. As bitter a pill as it is to swallow, it isn't much of a surprise Beverly Hills Chihuahua is destroying BOL at the box office: everyone has seen BOL before (in one form or another) and very few people (myself included) have seen a movie about talking chihuahuas...not that we really need to.",Body of Lies
132,tubby1,Slick action - excellently done.,7,7 June 2009,"Ridley Scott directs and produces another fine piece of cinema after the gritty realism of American Gangster. The star-cast of Di Caprio and Crowe certainly raise the profile of this film but it is the slick screenplay and camera-work, which makes this stand-out.Roger Ferris (Di Caprio) is a CIA agent on the ground in the Middle-East trying to discover and avert further terrorist attacks. Back in the US Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) is Ferris's controller issuing instructions.The opening monologue to the film is written matter-of-factly and informatively and quickly conveys the real troubles facing the world of today. Di Caprio as always is in good form as Ferris a man of logic and practicality. Crowe although very much in a supporting-role is good as Hoffman who seeks unequivocal results in a rather laissez-fare manner.Mark Strong is the actor with the greatest gravitas as the Jordanian 'director' of intelligence Hani Salaam , providing a striking figure of authority and ambiguity and is the stand-out performance. A mention should also be made of Farahani who captures her role well.There are not many faults with Body of Lies it has an intelligent script, intense action and character interplay which will keep you occupied to the very end. Body of Lies is a masterful piece of cinema which I very much enjoyed.",Body of Lies

135,das417,"An excellent plot with a ""too easy"" ending",8,28 February 2009,"Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a deep undercover CIA agent who works some of the most dangerous operations in the world. The War On Terror is his everyday life and especially so as he quickly travels from Iraq, to the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan in order to track and destroy various terrorist cells. With his handler Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), a bureaucrat who safely sits in his home or in Langley while openly disdains humility and anyone who disagrees with him, Ferrris finds that he is little more than a pawn in a game that he no longer has the will to play.A terrorist known as Al-Saleem (Alon Abutbul) is responsible for several terrorist attacks in London as well as Amsterdam and Hoffman, along with Ferris, are both determined to bring him down. The problem is that both men see two different ways how to do this. Hoffman, a man who cares little for codes of edict when he deals with foreigners, sees little in common with Ferris's respectful ways of dealing with the locals. This becomes an issue when Ferris must deal with Jordanian intelligence official Hani Salaam (Mark Strong) who finds little reason to trust Hoffman even though he personally favors Ferris. Hoffman blows an early operation which comprised not only Ferris's goals but also Salaam's plans. Of course it is Ferris, not Hoffman, who faces the consequences.There is of course more to Ferris than just a simple CIA operative. He becomes fascinated with a Jordian/Iranian nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) who brings out the more humane side of the American. While never fully explaining who he really is, Ferris does let on to the fact that he is more than just another American who looks down on Arabs and waves the flag when it comes to the War On Terror. Ferris's own marriage has recently failed and Aisha appears to be something of the opposite of previous wife though we never really know who she was.Spy movies always have the inevitable twist where the hero discovers that something has gone wrong and, in this case, this happens when one of his plans backfires. Ferris finds that he has been compromised and that Aisha and her own family are in danger. This leads to his capture by Al-Saleem himself and a brutal torture scene which is ironic considering that we have glimpses of Ferris sitting at the other end of the table during such events. However, at that moment, Ferris is rescued by Salaam who later admits that his ""capture"" was set up by the Jordanians and that Aisha was never in danger.The problem with Body of Lies, and spy movies in general, is that they often have endings that are too easy. Hoffman and Ferris are supposed to be excellent spies who are in fact later played by the Jordanians. Shouldn't this have crossed their minds? And wouldn't Ferris know that any relationship he had with a woman in the field would lead to a potential danger to himself and his operation? And why would Saleem open himself up to capture torturing a CIA Agent in person? Wouldn't someone like him stay far away even from a captured American? Body of Lies has an excellent plot that tries it's best to explain the gray that exists on the political and moral level when it comes to fighting the War on Terror. Crowe does and excellent job portraying a complicated man who lives in his own world and DiCaprio who proves himself more and more to be one of the best leading actors. However, an easy ending makes enjoying it somewhat difficult despite the great writing and acting by everyone involved.8/10",Body of Lies
136,Manal1987,Way much better than I expected!,8,21 December 2008,"Wonderful!! This movie has exceeded my expectations, and in my opinion it's one of Scott's masterpieces. Ridley Scott made sure that each and every little detail would seem real. Moreover, the techniques he used in directing this movie are haunting and completely suitable to the whole intended atmosphere. Leonardo DiCaprio has now officially proved himself as a mature and professional actor and maybe one of the best nowadays. As for Russell Crowe, it was quite hard to judge him because his role was not big enough and with no much to talk about. But generally, he was not THAT good. It was the first time for me to see Mark Strong in a movie, but after Body of Lies, sure I'll keep track of all what he does!! His performance was amazing, and his charisma is irresistible. His presence on screen reminds you of Marlon Brando, with all his grandeur and aura. Bottom line, everything about this movie is perfectly in place; even the soundtrack which will make you feel and smell the Middle East. However, the only drawback about the movie is the Arabic language; it was a failure! The Arabic tutor did a horrible job teaching the actors Arabic. For the foreign ear, it might sound native Arabic, but for me, it sounds gibberish!! (bearing in mind that Arabic is my mother tongue!). Even the actors who were supposed to be Syrian or Jordanian, their Arabic sounded like hell. I think this made the movie lose some of its credibility.",Body of Lies
137,antony-1,Very poor. The only good thing was the ending.,2,6 September 2009,"With such big name talent, and a respected director, I expected better than this.There are far more detailed reviews on IMDb on why this movie is bad, and to be honest it doesn't warrant an extensive review from me.But to cover it briefly, this story is totally by the numbers. Other movies have dealt with Middle East politics and done a much better job. Even The Kingdom was better than this.Ther are totally predictable plots (like a love interest so that the main character has something to lose when things go bad) to the point where you can just describe what will happen next.No character is interesting, or in depth... only Alon Abutbul gives anything close to a decent acting performance.Probably the worst thing is the totally affected directing that creates scenes that come across as very false. A lot of characters chat while doing normal every day things. This is fine when done naturally, but is an overused plot device to the point where one looks for the next absurd moment. ""Oh look, a character is helping his son pee while chatting on phone. Oh look, he has a family, life in action!"" Also due to this interfering directing characters are always eating. Okay a little bit adds realism, but overused to this extent it becomes like a drinking game. When I mentioned this to my friend, on comes Crowe eating as if to prove my point. It just became a good laugh to wait for the next eating event in the plot (if that doesn't show how bored we were, nothing will I guess).So all in all, a film with no original plot, boring characters, and overzealous director that tries to overly complicate every scene with the most mundane of actions for its characters.Pretty much a failure on every level.",Body of Lies

Auden?) and I thought it was perfectly cast. I thought Leonardo Dicaprio gave another bravura performance. Sort of cross between his characters in The Departed (though he's less twitchy and strung out here), and Blood Diamond (though he's less arrogant and less cynical too). I think the movie combines the best elements of previous films on this topic - for example, it's less Hollywoody than The Kingdom and less deliberately confusing than Syriana. Turns out it's based on a novel by Washington Post reporter David Ignatius, which would explain why it's so smart. And directed by Ridley Scott, who can generally be depended on to make a very watchable movie. It's a tiny bit long and the violence is very realistic (not a problem for some, but I covered my eyes more than once), but overall, it's really worth seeing.",Body of Lies

Body of Lies started off well though and I was soon unable to tear my eyes away. The story wasn't particularly original, but the character development was well done and very interesting to watch. This was matched by a very convincing performances both from DiCaprio and Crowe. Mark Strong was also excellent as always.

The directing of this film is very inspired as usual for Ridley Scott. It's visually striking and beautiful.
The actors are all gifted. Di Caprio delivers a top performance and the rest of the cast follows.
But where the film surprised, it was regarding the story, plot and main character's developement. I was engaged and not basic at all.

The story, being mostly character-driven/based, is dependent on the two lead characters, and the script enables them to remain in focus for the majority of the film. The acting by Leonardo Dicaprio, following his magnificent performances in BLOOD DIAMOND and THE DEPARTED, and more recently REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, is excellent, and on par with his recent successes. Russell Crowe is perhaps not as strong, but is effectively solid in a role that seemed catered for his range. If anything, the performance by Mark Strong is perhaps the finest the film has to offer, and may be the only one worthy of acting accolades.Overall, the brilliance of BODY OF LIES manages to shine through in the end. Scott does not seem to take sides, but instead presents the story as unbiased as possible. A movie of this quality should not be missed, and should not be left forgotten. 9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4).

149,markymark70,Too Complicated and dull for my liking,5,18 March 2009,"Political thrillers are not really my bag to be honest - I watch them but do I enjoy them? Not really. So it needs to be a very special type of movie for me to give it the thumbs up. Body of Lies is not that special.DiCaprio is a good actor - you have to give him that - but I am not so sure about all his film choices. Of course he ain't gonna get them all right so I need to give him some slack - but this one falls on the wrong side. He plays a CIA man in the Middle-East and essentially his plot point boils down to him on the trail of a hard to find terrorist bad guy. There are other complications in his way of course - explosions, double-crosses, car-chases and even love - and the plot permeates through all these items slowing everything down to a grinding halt. Crowe plays a soccer dad, CIA HQ man calling the shots from his earpiece, computers and satellite imagery. Neither Crowe nor DiCaprio do a bad job per se - but their very limited shared screen time bogs the film down. To be honest the whole thing is too complicated, too complex and - a word NO film-maker wants to hear said about his movie - dull. The plot is hard to follow and I felt myself looking at the movie and watching it for what it was - but not really understanding what the hell was going on? Throw in some Arabic dialogue and hey presto - total confusion. There is one good thing to come out of this though - Mark Strong's performance as Hani Salaam is impressive. His scenes with DiCaprio are - for me - the highlight of the movie and his dark, polite yet menacing presence throughout the film is testament to his fine acting. I've never heard of this guy before, but he looks like one to watch. Overall - the complex nature of the plot means there are a few scenes thrown in here that practically explain to the audience what is going on. This - although required as I guess half the audience won't know what the hell is going on - further slows everything down and looks contrived. Even DiCaprio himself looked like a guy playing the scene against his better judgement. In the end Body of Lies is a messy affair that turns into an uninteresting, muddled, tedious couple of hours. It's always a bad sign when you just want the film to end - and the sooner the better. The ending by the way is pure Hollywood - contrived and a nick-of-time rescue thrown in for good measure.Scott too has to take a lot of the blame here - after all he is both producer and director. His flashy style gets a little tiresome after a while and even though he is a world away from his brother Tony's quick-cut editing, he seems to be getting closer to him rather than further away. Although the production values are spot on, the locales suitably impressive and authentic - the formula for these type of movies lends itself to global manipulation of governments and also grandiose, complex plots thus dragging the enjoyment factor way down.Body of Lies is a quickly forgettable film. 5/10.",Body of Lies
150,Reel_starz,"Finally, an intelligent and thought-provoking thriller",8,11 October 2008,"This morning, I watched Body of Lies, and I was pleased to see that, unlike many other recent movies that involved the war in the Middle-East or terrorists, this was a movie that handled the subject with intelligence. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe and relative newcomer Mark Strong, Body of Lies is about CIA operative Roger Ferris, who, with the help of his handler, Ed Hoffman, and Jordanian Secret Service head, Hani, is tracking down leading Muslim terrorist, al-Saleem, the obvious equivalent of Osama bin Laden.Ridley Scott directs this political thriller with the hand of a true professional, and the visual effects look convincingly real. One of the strongest aspects of the film is its script, written by The Departed's William Monahan and adapted from the book of the same name by David Ignatius. Filled with witty and sharp dialogue, the screenplay was clearly written to not only entertain the audience, but to make them actually think. The pace is fast enough to keep viewers entertained and to provide tension that lasts throughout the film, but there is enough drama and character development to prevent it from feeling like a full-out action flick. While DiCaprio, Crowe and most of the supporting cast are solid and believable in their roles, Mark Strong as Hani is the true stand-out in a performance with possible awards potential.One of the greatest accomplishments of Body of Lies is its ability to stay politically-neutral despite the subject material, which draws attention to many issues that are relevant to the modern times. It never supports or completely condemns the actions of the characters, and the plot could easily have been adapted to suit another time or setting.Though it has a few flaws, such as occasionally mediocre editing and the Iranian actress that plays DiCaprio's love interest could have been given more screen time, Body of Lies is a thriller that transcends both the typical action movie and the other recent movies made about the war in the Middle-east. Smart, compelling and gritty, Body of Lies is one of the best movies of the year so far and definitely worth the price of admission.",Body of Lies

The cinematography of course is a very high standard, but the action largely consists of SUV's screeching to a halt in various urban and desert settings. In fact, A.O. Scott in the NY Times pretty much nailed this as a mediocre attempt that falls flat. Leonardo DiCaprio shows very little of the flair that made him compelling in Blood Diamond and Departed, though in fairness he is hampered by a hackneyed script. Russell Crowe, meanwhile, literally phones in his part in the now-familiar role of the comatose control who practices realpolitik.The plot stumbles on to a predictable Hollywood ending that's neither surprising nor thrilling through some unlikely plot devices like a CIA station chief politely courting an unvetted refugee in Jordan or same agent trying to pass as an Arab while enunciating his Arabic with a North Carolina twang. Truly a weak effort from Ridley Scott.",Body of Lies
152,laursene,A marvelous character study,9,22 October 2008,"Amidst all the slam-bang, Body of Lies is actually a superb character study of two preening, bumbling CIA (presumably) agents trying to save the world in the Middle East. Roger Ferris (Di Caprio) is the agent on the ground, and Ed Hoffman (Crowe) is his remote-control boss in Washington. Their collective M.O. is to overreact and improvise at every turn, aided and abetted by their deep attachment to high-tech gadgetry and fundamental disregard for human lives. Their ally and foil, the Jordanian head of intelligence (Mark Strong), prefers more patient methods informed by a less skin-deep understanding of the people(s) involved.All three are trying to penetrate and take out a shadowy, violent Islamic fundamentalist group and its leader. The plot is serviceable, the elements familiar, but it all works well to coax out Scott's and screenwriter William Monahan's critiques of the American way of unconventional war in the Middle East. The movie itself is funny, visually fine (Scott's touch hasn't deserted him), and engaging. Its center is the uneasy but highly entertaining partnership between Di Caprio and Crowe. At times verging on pure comedy (their semi-serious macho argument over which of them could beat up the other 10 years ago is a high point), the film never tips too far in this direction thanks to the two actors' easy skill and Scott's sure hand at maintaining a certain tone.Is Body of Lies an antiwar statement? I don't think so - it's possible Monahan and Scott even think the Americans' grotesque imperial venture has a chance, if only they could learn a few lessons from the likes of the self-possessed Jordanian. But this seems unlikely. At the beginning, Crowe makes the very good point that it's precisely the Americans' mastery of (by?) their high-tech appurtenances that makes it nearly impossible for them to see their foes, who use much more down-to-earth techniques - like passing instructions by word of mouth. He then proceeds to ignore his own advice throughout the movie. Di Caprio rips into Crowe for his disregard of the lives of their local operatives, then goes on to thoughtlessly place in mortal danger an architect and an Iranian refugee nurse with whom he's infatuated.They just don't learn. If they did, they wouldn't be who they are: the gallant spreaders of justice, democracy, and casual calamity. If that's what Scott and Monahan are trying to tell us, it's antiwar statement enough, the same news that Graham Greene brought us over 50 years ago with The Quiet American, updated and just as pertinent.",Body of Lies

I should mention that I had just thrown out The Dark Knight, the new batman movie, which was boring and silly; so to put this movie on was a treat. I hadn't even watched 50% of the batman movie before becoming annoyed at its silliness and pretentiousness. Body of Lies kept me interested throughout. I think this is what a movie is supposed to be about: tell a story that leaves the viewer to think through, and not to push points of view on the viewers. Ridley Scott usually does an outstanding job on both counts - he makes entertainment for two hours by drawing the viewer into his film. Kudos to him on this venture. I should also mention I was in the Middle East for several years and I thought there was a very good balance shown. Some of the scenes in neighborhoods were very familiar.",Body of Lies
154,Vishal_s_kumar,Sharp writing and strong performances deliver the goods,8,24 April 2010,"I recently re-visited this movie again. Hotheaded method actor Russell Crowe and acclaimed director Ridley Scott have forged quite a partnership over the last decade. Crowe's commitment to his craft and Scott's precise vision have been a perfect match, allowing the award-winning collaborators to charge through lavish productions, forgotten history, and controversial subject matter with great success. After inspiring a Roman revolution and taking home Oscar gold with Gladiator, the pair tackled love and prosperity in A Good Year, the rough-n-tumble criminal underworld of '70s Harlem in American Gangster, and, most recently, the disconnect between American and Middle Eastern interests in Body of Lies. Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover CIA agent working in Jordan, turns tragedy into opportunity when a botched assignment nets him precious intel concerning a terrorist cell led by an elusive mastermind named Al-Saleem (Alon Abutbul). Reporting directly to his supervisor at Langley, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), and working to maintain a shaky relationship with the Chief of Jordanian Intelligence, Hani (Mark Strong), Ferris struggles to appease both men, stop a recent outbreak of global terrorist attacks, and keep his head on his shoulders (quite literally). Caught between two warring factions and two diverse cultures, Ferris devises a clever plan he hopes will trap Al-Saleem, satisfy Hoffman's demands, and strengthen Hani's trust in his countrymen. Body of Lies manages to rise above the genre fray with the help of screenwriter William Monahan's unconventional script and Crowe, DiCaprio, and Strong's electric performances. Ferris isn't simply a brash upstart; he has a keen sense of the situation, respect for Hani's authority and culture, and a distinct understanding of his own duty. Hoffman, on the other hand, is lazy, self-centered, and pushy; a man who constantly ignores cultural sensitivities in favor of blunt shock and awe. His encounters with Ferris dabble in the debate at the heart of American involvement in the Middle East. The two allies never turn on each other (as one might expect after watching the misleading theatrical trailers), but their constant bickering illuminates the internal arguments that have embroiled US agencies and officials for decades. Their's is a particularly refreshing relationship that defies the typical trappings of geopolitical thrillers and leads to plenty of exciting exchanges. Hani is the world-weary power-player caught between Ferris and Hoffman's differing methodologies; a man whose interest in his homeland far outweighs his need to engage in global politics. It's this trio of characters and performances that grabs hold of the story and molds it into a different beast entirely. Thankfully, Scott and Monahan make few attempts to disguise their political agenda. Both storytellers go to great lengths to focus on the cultural tug-of-war that continues to keep the world at odds. There's always a force who wants things their way, always a force who longs to reach a middle-ground, and always a force content with protecting personal interests. It's Scott and Monahan's experiments with these three philosophies that allow the film to emerge as a rare and effective political morality tale; a study of exactly what perpetuates conflict and what helps to subvert it. Unfortunately, Body of Lies stumbles upon reaching these lofty heights with a few tired developments. After incorporating a contrived romance into the story, fumbling around with the film's pacing, and devising a fairly anticlimactic closer, the filmmakers lose their grasp on what could have made the film so wholly and utterly unique. Fleeting flaws and missed opportunities aside, Body of Lies works on several fundamental levels. It soars as a tense, action-packed thriller, earns legitimate laughs with a surprising dose of humor, and pits three fantastic performers against each other in a game of wits and lives. The film may occasionally meander and get lost in its own tangential subplots, but I still found myself enjoying it from beginning to end.",Body of Lies

Another problem is the pacing; events fly by at the start in a choppy way, and it's difficult to keep pace, or form a connection with the characters and story - this is the movie's main failing.

DiCaprio"" - The tag line said it all and that is all you need to know about a movie to know that it is going to be good especially when you discover that the ""Scott"" in question is Ridley and not The plot is the standard CIA V Iraqi terrorist. Nothing new or original about that but the quality involved is what makes this movie. Crowe and DiCaprio are two of the best actors in Hollywood so they raise the standard of the movie compared with other recent terrorist related movies such as The Kingdom.The Last half hour is the movie is surprisingly tense which is in itself a brilliant climax to a fast movie film.The worst moment for me was using the love interest cliché as the McGuffin to get us into the last half hour - but that is only nit picking!! 9/10 - such a good movie.

157,mbanwait,A strong political thriller,7,24 May 2009,"I found this film to be quite a strong political/action thriller. The story/script was a bit weak but Ridley Scotts direction and execution of said script was quite good.It was obvious that Leonardo carried the entire movie. And his performance as also very strong, along the lines of maybe Blood Diamond, which is another of his films I immensely enjoyed.Russel Crowe was simply lost in the movie, and has very few scenes which have an impact on the viewer. He could have been played by any second or third tier actor. I could even see Chris Cooper in the role.The action scenes were intense and spaced out thru out the film. I hate when movies are just one long action scene and would rather watch an intelligent thriller with some character development.Overall a very good film to watch.7/10",Body of Lies
158,MidnightWarrior,Not the film I expected,4,13 October 2008,"This film is NOT recommended if you're looking for an engaging, fun, entertaining and interesting movie. It's also not recommended if you don't like seeing Muslims. The script itself is paper thin and even though there's tons of action on screen, the script does not follow the traditional Hollywood values.The reason I gave this four stars as opposed to one is because there are some elements of this film that really shine while the other elements fall flat.DiCaprio, Crowe and the entire cast give performances that make their characters very believable; who knew DiCaprio could speak such good Arabic? There's lots of exploding objects, guns, foot chases and overall action.If you're looking for a cinematic movie with a fantastic script, you'll quickly discover that the worst part of this film is the paper thin plot and story. Was something lost in translation from the novel to the script to the big screen? Or maybe the novel is just like this? I don't know.What remains, however, is the fact that important parts of the film seemed to be incoherent, chopped and rushed. Specificially, when the characters get into the explanation of what went down after the climax of the film, the explanation moves at lightening speed! The people in the film were quoting the Qur'an, but they missed an essential verse: ""Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the right reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those are they who are the losers."" (2:121) Those people in the film who were blowing themselves up and using the Qur'an verses to justify their acts of murder, failed to understand the proper context of those verses which they were quoting, hence not reading it the way it should have been read. The sad thing is this same thing happens today - people fail to understand the context of the verses and then commit atrocities based on their limited understanding of the verse or their own agenda.And even though DiCaprio's character tried to get them to understand that their terroristic ideals and behaviors were wrong, he failed to bring up this very important verse and so essentially failed to convince them.But I digress. 4/10",Body of Lies

Fine, it is wicked, we know that, but do we really need to spend so much time having this simple point rubbed into the ground again, and again, and again?Foreign johnnies are, of course, there simply to be that, foils for the Yanks. They are portrayed as having even simpler minds than those of the simpletons who are the star actors - one bases his entire judgment of people on whether they 'lie to him'.I think that, mainly, we're supposed to be impressed by how advanced the war is - now there are even Yanks who speak Arabic.

162,dsa_ca,The end surely was a body of lies,7,18 October 2008,"Lies, deception, double cross, and espionage these not very cheery words to relax your audience while living in a very depressing time. And worst of all for Americans another word to tag 'Iraq'. The Iraq war itself is the biggest lie. So what is there to prove? The title says it all 'Body of Lies' and it is about Iraq. So this film is one of those which will question your conscience? Well! Yes, if you take the quotation at the beginning of the movie which states ""Those to whom evil is done Do evil in return"", seriously. Other than that body of lies is gripping and also lot of fun. Yeah! It's Fun. Not that you shouldn't take this movie seriously, but because the director does not want you to take this movie seriously. Due to which he has chose the film adaptation of this David Ignatius novel on which this movie is based, which has credible central characters but goes soft on final outcome of the story with a very farcical end.So what we got here? Well, there is Leo in his Blood Diamond mode as Roger Ferris, and then we have Russell Crowe in his Insider get up in 'A good year' mode as Ed Hoffman along with director Ridley Scott at the helm, trying to create something that would be between his last two films 'a good Year' and 'American Gangster'. The movie is really fast paced, considering the amount of situations and scenarios it covers. It starts with a suicide attack in an Asian neighborhood of Manchester, England along with a threat of spate of more such attacks. So the focus quickly shifts into present day Iraq. Roger Ferris goes on his daily job of encountering with rogue elements of the 'Islamic' terror network, while the lumpy Ed Hoffman goes around doing his job, in the power corridors of U.S intelligence, of explaining people why the covert war against terror is important for the safety of western way of life and then goes on a routine surveillance watch over Roger Ferris's activities in Iraq, with whom he has a very intimate 24 hours a day cell phone relationship. During such routine work of Ed Leo Harris, he encounters a defected extremist who give him the lead for the Manchester bombing, which have been conducted by a certain Al Qaeda spin off whose leader named Al-Saleem is based in Jordan. So the story moves to Jordan, where Roger Ferris takes the intelligence command and then teams up with his straight faced Jordanian counterpart to capture the suspected leader living in his ghetto hideout. What unfolds after this untruthful joint collaboration between Jordan intelligence and C.I.A is a very complex and surreal cat and mouse game of deceit and lies which grips you right till the end and then suddenly let you loose, in the process it devalues its opening message. Roger Ferris also gets time to start a relationship with an Iranian origin nurse working in a Jordan hospital. The relationship is given a disproportionate importance and affects the story to a certain unwanted level. All this transpires under the watchful eye of Ed Hoffman from Washington while performing his family routine of dropping his kids to school or while cheering the kids during there soccer game.To say it quickly, the movie is pretty good and has a lot of action, but nothing that you have not seen before. You will not walk out on this film, Ridley Scott has a firm grip on the film and the lead superstars guarantee your interest. But the story itself fails to support these fine talents at work. The ending more or less turns out to be quite happy (like 2001 Brad and Redford movie Spy Game), as the Jordanian intelligence chief executes his job satisfactorily enough to remain in his poker face expression. Ed Hoffman, is also satisfied with the result by any means, to remain cocky for the rest of his life and Roger Ferris, well, his actions are the most fictitious of this very fictional tale. He comes off more of a love fool. Ridley Scott movies have had some strong endings, especially, Gladiator, which though tragic was hard hitting and perfect to make it one of his best works. Can't say the same for this one, it's more of a run of a mill entertaining action film and just coincidently is based on current scenario.",Body of Lies
163,gevalero,One of Scott's lesser movies.,7,28 November 2008,"Hard to understand how with all the talent involved this movie turned out so very so-so. I find it hard to point out exactly why I didn't like it that much. Crowe seems wasted in such a small, repetitive role (a first for him). DiCaprio is at it again cursing throughout the whole movie with another of his ""I'm way past the Titanic-pretty-boy role"". The exact moment you see an attractive girl turn up in the movie you realize he is going to fall in love with her and she is going to be threatened in some way by the bad guys. And then all the middle eastern names sound so very all the same to me, half the time I didn't know who or what they were talking about. Spending so much time in such rough unattractive places made me constantly wish they would show commercials in theaters half-way through movies and I find it a miracle I didn't fall sleep watching BODY OF LIES. All of this is not to say this is a terrible movie. The satellite spying scenes are pretty good and you'll be wondering yet again how exactly it is they can't find the 9/11 terrorists with all this technology (you'd think they'd have to get out of the cave once in a while). Anyway, this ought to make a better DVD rental than theater going experience.",Body of Lies
164,fidelio74,Leonardo DiCaprio is both the new Marlon Brando and the new Robert De Niro,5,26 November 2010,"Leonardo DiCaprio is both the new Marlon Brando and the new Robert De Niro, all rolled into one glorious package. His performance as Roger Ferris in 'Body of Lies' is typically strong. This techno thriller is very like one of author Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan adventures; there is plenty of cloak and dagger intrigue, and a dash of pretty spectacular action. Ferris' sparring partner is Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) and the New Zealand-born actor is in fine form. And, in a fairly small role, Simon McBurney is excellent as IT wiz Garland.Roger Ferris gets a tip-off about a major terrorist leader who is believed to have his base of operations in Jordan. Roger must undertake his investigation in partnership with Ed Hoffman who is back in the USA, and who instructs and advises Roger by telephone and email.'Lies' contains some very unpleasant torture scenes which no doubt have a very disturbing basis in reality. It is a complex film which requires close attention, but the viewer is rewarded by William Monahan's ('The Departed') intelligent and multi-layered screenplay.In the course of the movie, Ferris pursues a love interest named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani). If Aisha wishes to date the American, her sister Cala (Lubna Azabal) must first approve of him. So a meal is shared at which Roger is the guest but, unfortunately, Cala does not believe the relationship is going to be possible due to the two's cultural differences. But Roger is determined to date Aisha and she is happy to continue to see him. This love story lightens the mood and also offers some humour which is a pleasant relief considering that the film often shows the darker side of the human condition.It is great that director Ridley Scott is being so prolific these days. What is even better is the fact that the quality of his films is not suffering; each of his offerings is exceedingly well-made. He obviously has a very good relationship with his muse, Russell Crowe, as they have made quite a few films together now. And while 'Body of Lies' is not the best flick they have made together, it is still worth a look, especially if you like the techno thriller subgenre.",Body of Lies
165,mcoats-71101,Story got lost along the way,5,22 December 2018,"Firstly the whole Russell Crowe ""hey buddy"" shtick is probably going to annoy you after a while, but anyway - this film starts off ok but then loses itself along the way - who knew espionage was this easy! At times preachy and at others nonsensical, why does Leo do everything himself, from in the field surveillance to running the Jordan office for the CIA? Why is Hani so camp? What was he doing in Syria when he's a head Jordanian secret agent? When would Leo have time to date the Iranian girl who by the way wouldn't speak Arabic as a first language at home with her sister, when they are Farsi.Not one of Ridley Scott's best, despite the big names.",Body of Lies
166,jeev7882,Not A Run-Of-The-Mill Political Thriller,7,8 October 2008,"Finally an above average political thriller that is effective and surprisingly politically neutral. That's not to say it won't irk those on the far reaches of either aisle in addition to the always irritable Iranian government. But, Body of Lies is a plot driven espionage thriller that demonstrates the basics of what Western intelligence has done right and wrong in the post 9/11 era without being preachy or shoving too much at the audience.The movie follows Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), an operative trying to gather intel on Islamic terrorist cells to get to the head: Al- Saleem. He works closely with local contacts wherever he goes, only to find that his boss, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) finds them useful but disposable. After losing such a friend in Iraq, Ferris travels to Jordan to head up the U.S. Intelligence operations there. In Jordan he befriends Hani (Mark Strong), the head of Jordanian Intelligence, who places more value on patience and trust than speed and technology.Anyone who read the title of the movie can guess the basics of what happens next: Ferris gets caught in a web of lies, some created by him, some by his boss, and he struggles to do the right thing and break free from all he has constructed. The lies are actually relatively simple and easy to keep track of. There isn't betrayal upon betrayal which so many movies get caught up in these days, but the pacing does suffer due to a plot that forces itself to be intricate when it would be better served by simplicity.There is a point about halfway through the movie where Ferris comes up with the idea to construct a fake terrorist cell to challenge the cell they are going after. The idea isn't all that bad, but it basically restarts the plot instead of building it. The pacing of Body of Lies is suspect with plenty of these moments. Ferris doesn't seem to learn much from the err of his ways until the very end, so the characters, while compelling, are also stagnant for most of the movie.Still, the performances are excellent if not extraordinary. DiCaprio has established himself as the best young actor out there for quite sometime now. His command of different voices, different languages (I've never heard a southerner speak Arabic as well as he does in this movie), and different mannerisms make him a consummate professional. Crowe, in my opinion one of the top few actors working today, is underused in what is really a smaller role than what the trailers showed. I guess every Ridley Scott movie just has to have Maximus in it. The two biggest standouts are Mark Strong, who plays the Jordanian Intelligence Head just serious and slick enough to make you wonder what his interests really are, and Golshifteh Farahani, who is the first Iranian born actress to appear in a Hollywood flick since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Incidentally Mrs. Farahani can't return to her native Iran until the court sees the movie and then decides what to do with her passport.Admittedly, the love interest of Aisha played by Farahani seems a bit forced. Are Ferris' feelings for a woman really the only thing that can humanize him and realize that maybe he hasn't been doing things the right way this whole time? Body of Lies does such a good job of injecting emotion into it's storyline unlike so many recent political thrillers (think Syriana, Munich, The Constant Gardner, etc.), that it is disappointing to see it resort to such means in an attempt to humanize Ferris and give his life some real meaning.",Body of Lies
167,goldwriting,Political Punch Without a Point,5,12 October 2008,"There are certain things a country does when it goes to war, the economy usually booms into action, the populace rally behind the sitting President and Hollywood starts production on films portraying America as the patriotic force of good against whatever evil it is we are currently fighting with. And so it went during the early years of the Iraq War, but as time dragged on everything started to slip away. The economy slid into one of the worst depressions on record, the general populace turned on the sitting President with such vitriol and distaste it is a wonder he's still in office, and lastly Hollywood began to show another side of the conflict, one where we were not cast in the best of lights. The movie going public usually eats this all up with a popcorn flavored spoon, but eventually there is a line crossed where the audience just doesn't care anymore. We've moved on, the war has become old news and we don't want to be reminded anymore about how badly we screwed the pooch. But films take a long time to go from start to finish, so this weekend we were graced with one more wartime vision, Body of Lies, this one from greatly acclaimed director Ridley Scott and powerhouse actors Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio.Russell plays Ed Hoffman, an arrogant, egotistical CIA operative constantly wired to the cell phone in his pocket and somehow managing to pillage information from halfway around the world while still attending his daughter's soccer game. Leo takes the role of Roger Ferris, the rough edged man on the ground who provides Ed with his intel and carries out whatever orders flow through those encrypted phone lines. As with anyone who stays in those situations for too long, Roger is getting strung out and he starts to wonder if these secret missions and assassinations are really the correct course of action. Ed does what he can to talk sense into him, make him see the bigger picture, but Roger begins to think the two of them are picturing different things. Old loyalties are tested and broken, while new ones are forged in the heat of a silent war. Once again, it's shown that every man must choose his own destiny and find out what he truly believes.The main thing getting in the way of this film's success is the timing. No matter how much action you put in, no matter how much drama you layer over it, the fact remains this is yet another Iraq War movie and the audience just isn't there anymore. We have grown weary of seeing our enemies, the ones fighting against us and the ones claiming to be fighting for us. There will always be a place for war movies in the annals of cinema, but the market right now has become glutted with them, especially with the extra helping on documentaries on the subject. Deep down we all go to the movie theater to be momentarily distracted from what we see on the news every night and right now the voice of the people is speaking loud and clear on that point.Yet, even if this movie had been released earlier by three or four years, I'm not sure it would have done much better. Ridley does his best here to set up tension and a good sense of paced action, but with only an hour gone from the opening shot I was already beginning to wonder how long we had left. The film seems to drag itself towards an end, which when it finally arrives has little to no impact. The story lacks a sense of closure, which possible stems from the reality of the situation in Iraq. There is certainly a ride to be had by watching this, but I'm not sure you finish the ride feeling any different than when you got on.The excitement surrounding Russell and Leo getting to work together was palpable when the casting was first announced, but they both deliver only during certain scenes. Russell relaxes into the skin of Ed Hoffman, a man who can't be bothered to think about the humanity of his actions because he has the safety of the world on his mind. Yet barely underneath that is his own desire to be recognized as the one who saved it. In particular moments of the film, Russell really flowed with the brimming confidence of Ed, but in other scenes he came off rather uncaring and unmotivated. Leo got a touch luckier in his role because all the drama and conflict really resides in him. He showed some good chops while playing the political game between Ed and the local contacts, but it never came up to the power of Leo's earlier stuff, like The Basketball Diaries, What's Eating Gilbert Grape or most recently The Departed, which he will forever be measured against. The one person who actually stepped out of the film and truly gave a measure of weight when on screen was Mark Strong, who played Hani the head of the Jordanian Secret Service. His cool demeanor was a translucent mask over an intimidating and unremorseful nature. Hani saw the world very plainly, those who were with him and those who were against him, and you knew which side you wanted to be on.Recommendation: I can't honestly say there is much here we haven't already seen in the last couple of years with films like The Kingdom and Lions for Lambs. If you really want power and performance inside a war story, Ridley is still your man, just go rent Black Hawk Down instead.",Body of Lies
168,JackBenjamin,Two Dimensions,6,17 October 2008,"This is relatively standard fare, and I'd hoped for more from this team. But there is one very potent concept touched on, and it's in the way Ridley uses the medium itself to express his disdain for all of us.My most disturbing personal memory of the Iraq war is watching the first attack on TV. I did nothing to stop it. I stood by and watched as if it were any old fall drama. And that's what it was, to me and to most Americans. They marketed the war to us like network execs... ""Watch a campaign of shock and awe"" -- and we did. Like catatonics.And until we count the balance in family lost, safety forfeited, dollars lost (real dollars, not funny money), the war means nothing to us. We're a complacent people who see two dimensions when there are so many more. And today, we experience life more on these two-dimensional surfaces than we do in three. Computers, TVs, movie screens. A replacement for reality. Almost an assembly manual for modern reality.So, here Ridley plays the game with us, and shows us how horrifying this this modern world really is. Russell is the American mastermind. He runs the war on a giant monitor, much like a film director sitting in an editing room, deciding what goes where, who stays, who goes. He watches it unfold with frightening apathy, entertained, as if it were all inconsequential; and we, the audience, detest him for it. It's reality anaesthesized into unreality -- that's the real lie.But the joke's on us because here we are again, watching a giant screen ourselves, delighting in the explosions, the chases, gunfights, the bone fragments, bulletholes, smashed fingers -- yet again we're entertained by a disconnected world that has no direct bearing on our lives. Not until our friend's bone fragments are lodged under our own skin. Russell does an exceptional job as the gluttonous couch potato, a.k.a., the audience.",Body of Lies
169,twi1609372,not Good,2,18 May 2009,"This was a complete waste of Russel Crowe's ability. Anyone could have plaid the character and been OK, he kind of sleep walked through the movie. Yes it's true, CIA agents cannot use the toilet without permission from a low level bureaucrat in Washington DC. Surprisingly DiCaprio was a bright spot, he did his character well,he had little to work with, but he had done much worse. The plot fails because it was not set up to tell a good story, it was set up because they had political points to address and the plot molded to fit that, a bit confusing, not mission impossible level though. Lessons: 1. America is evil. CIA agents use, abuse and kill innocent people at their whim for any reason or no reason. 2.America is evil.The CIA works with other countries who are not very strong on human rights issues. 3.America is evil. The war, enough said. 4.America is evil. Guantanamo bay they had to slip that in. 5.America is evil. Terrorists kill people suspected or cooperating with the United States, it's the US's fault. 6.America is evil. The government will fake terror attacks to further their agenda, I was waiting for the ""9/11 was an inside job"" truck of loons to pull up. 7.America is evil. America supports Israel, and there are Palestinian refugee camps, all innocent victims of America or Israel. 8.America is evil.

170,adrian290357,Good Movie full stop,7,20 December 2008,"Body of Lies is without doubt an above average film. Direction is assured and the performances of di Crapio, Crowe and -- in particular -- Strong are easily worth the cost of admission. I would have preferred a somewhat less gory rendition though I accept that the Middle East is a violent place and the action on the screen had to reflect it to look credible. I accept that but I am still not convinced by the Deus ex machina when Ferris was about to cash in his chips at the hands of the nefarious al-Saleem. Ultimately, I doubt very much that the CIA would just let one of its agents roaming freely and independently about the Middle East at the end of the movie. It would just pose too many State and other security risks. The movie also lacks a consistent female presence. Aisha is a pleasantly looking and story-convenient love interest for di Caprio but even she is not on the screen for more than about 20 min in the whole flick... and her performance is largely anonymous. The action sequences are effective, as is usually the case with flicks directed by Ridley Scott, but car and chopper chases have become so common that it is difficult for me to watch them without a sense of dreariness at all the deja vu.",Body of Lies
171,snncy2000,As fair as it gets...,8,12 March 2009,"Body Of Lies tires to portray rather objective look into issues in mid-east which are pain in the ass for the world last 50 years. Although movie seems to be about individuals and retaliations among them, it tells a separate yet powerful story in the background.Every flip of the camera from some desert or some crowded Arabic street to lush lifestyle going on in DC, we easily see the source of the conflict. When it comes to bombings, killings no one seems to be innocent. Even though the movie shows it a less dramatic way (Incirlik blast), it wouldn't be surprise to me learn both sides using terrorist attacks to entrench oneself.Nice movie, a must watch for anyone interested in mid-east issues and good movies.",Body of Lies
172,fred-kolb,The great performances by Crowe and DiCaprio and the atmosphere will keep you on the edge of your seat!,7,18 September 2009,"Well, I doubt that this is the movie that Ridley Scott will be most remembered for. For someone like him, who has made numerous critically acclaimed and award winning films, it becomes more and more difficult to produce a movie that leaves a considerable impression with the audience. ""Body of Lies"" is a very enjoyable and thrilling movie, that kept me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire running time, but the material just isn't spectacular enough to be remembered indefinitely. A spy, who has to work against a net of terrorists in a war zone, is probably not the most original idea ever, but, it still manages to be entertaining, especially if there are enough twists, and things turn out the way you don't expect them to. If there is a surprise, even the oldest concept can fulfill the purpose of attracting an audience.The war on Terrorism in the Middle East is just as bad as ever, with numerous Americans acting as spies working to infiltrate extremist cells. After the most recent bombing in Sheffield, England, the CIA officer Roger Ferris uses his connections in Iraq, to hunt down the terrorist leader Al-Saleem. Even though, he and his partner manage to track down some valuable information, Ferris' asset dies in the explosion of their car. Ferris has an extremely strained relationship with his boss Ed Hoffman, who trusts in permanent observation, and refuses to make the operations any easier for Ferris. He sends him to Jordan, where the Intel Ferris acquired in Iraq leads them, and is supposed to make contact with the head of the Intelligence Department. His name is Hani Salaam, and while he is more than ready to help Ferris with his investigation, he requires one things from him, which is never to lie to him. Ferris, who realizes that Salaam puts loyalty and honesty above everything else, tries to form a complex bond with him, that is purely based on trust. But, while Ferris is successful and stands quite high in Salaam's eyes, his boss Hoffman, refuses to tell Ferris about other missions he's authorized, and eventually he screws up one of Ferris' operations. Eventually that ends with a chase through the city, where Ferris is attacked by dogs, and has to go to the hospital, where he meets the Iranian nurse Aisha. Trying to hide his true purpose of being in Jordan, he becomes closer to her, but since Hoffman proved that he can't be trusted, he is quite worried that he will loose his target.Ridley Scott, like very few others, knows exactly how to generate suspense and keep the viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the entire movie. That is what he does in ""Body of Lies"" and doesn't even need that much action (chases and fights to be more precise) to achieve his goal. While we know the main villain from an early point on, the movie folds out as less than a hunt for him, but for those who turn out not be worth the trust put in them. A large web of lies is weaved around the characters and it is for the audience and Roger Ferris to find out, who his allies are. After a large number of twists and turns though, they become a little bit to twisted and turned, and some of the events seem rather implausible, or at least play out a little bit to conveniently. But, well, otherwise the movie probably wouldn't be as entertaining and gripping as it turned out to be.A lot of the movie's continued suspense throughout the entire running time is due to the interesting relationship between the characters of Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. DiCaprio stars as the rough CIA-operative Roger Ferris, who sees himself confronted with violence and hardship every day. He proves once again that he is no longer an adorable boyish actor with a baby face but a great character performer with a rough-edge attitude. His face,surrounded by a horrible, but effective beard, now has a powerful edge, it didn't have 10 years ago, which allows him to show some emotions like anger much better. The only other big name in ""Body of Lies"" is Russell Crowe, who plays Roger Ferris's supervisor in Langley. Ed Hoffman is overweight (Crowe gained 63 pounds for the film), and pretty much doesn't give a crap about the people he commands, as long as they deliver. He and Ferris are strongly contrasting characters and Crowe, who is actually pretty hard to recognize here, plays his role a lot calmer than usual. That is an interesting change for a man, who is used to play no-nonsense characters. All in all, the movie has a very rough element to it. Since most of the action takes place in the Middle East, the locations are not exactly the most pleasant ones. A certain kind of sadness and depression can be found throughout the entire movie, which illustrates the senseless war fought in Iraq and against terrorism. This is an enemy that can't be fought, unless the right people are targeted, and those that deserve our trust, can be trusted. But considering that even those that are on the same side, lie to each other without any regrets, it seems impossible. The thrill and constant suspicion of never knowing who the good guys are, keep ""Body of Lies"" alive for the entire running time, as well as DiCaprio and Crowe in two great performances. It won't become a classic, but shows a piece of the contemporary time period that won't be forgotten.

173,sioenroux,A good if unassuming spy caper,7,27 December 2008,"First off, this is a Ridley Scott movie. Expect him to telegraph plot twists, provide a few action-y sequences and generally live up to Hollywood's bland reputation.That said, this is a pretty nice spy caper. Despite being able to see what was coming, watching it unfold was entertaining, helped along by Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Strong turning in strong performances. DiCaprio seems to be recapturing a bit of the sense of acting he had when he was young and acclaimed. Strong is just superb.Scott attempts to be even-handed in his approach to the Islamic situation, but really it only comes off that way because he runs roughshod over every ambiguous or difficult moral issue with DiCaprio's hard-boiled, know-it-all attitude. It's not so much moderate politics as it is seen-it-all ennui. Still, it's nice to see a film that doesn't take a blatantly for or against approach to what is a much more complex world.All of that hangs in the background, though. Mostly, it's just a spy flick. Pay attention to who knows what when, and you'll easily see where it's headed. Then enjoy the pretty decent ride.",Body of Lies

Leo Dicaprio gives a solid performance probably Oscar-worthy (maybe, just maybe in my opinion) and Russell Crowe gives a good (not his best) performance as well. Body Of Lies is full of exciting stuff through beginning to end despite not having as much action than last year's political thriller with The Kingdom, it definitely deserves some amazing action sequences, of course great performances & gives us something to think about. Ridley Scott who is one of the best filmmakers out there, gives us a watchable, exciting, interesting & cool flick that definitely deserves from it's genre.

175,nerfball_king,Why bother?,3,24 September 2014,"""Body of Lies"" is essentially every Middle East-based/US-Iraqi invasion picture shot since 2001. The US is a bad guy, filled with some deep- seeded spies who apparently can kill anyone in the blink of an eye and with no remorse. Leonardo Di Caprio plays one of these guys, with Russell Crowe as his handler who also doesn't seem to give a $hit if people live or die, so long as his group gets some intel off of them. It's a fairly depressing movie, not fun to watch and really not even necessary to have been made. If you want to watch a bunch of Arab people shoot or get shot at, a convoy of SUVs roaring through the desert and views from Predator drones, save yourself the money and watch CNN instead.",Body of Lies
176,owlglass,Kingdom of Heaven: 1000 years on...,10,9 October 2008,"Films involving 'current events'--particularly those relating to anything happening in the Middle East and Terrorism--tend to be soaked in the writers', producers' and director's politics, which usually end up very much in-your-face and spoil the film, because you suddenly lose the story and drown in the preaching and proselytizing.Ridley Scott, who has already addressed the West-East/Christianity-Islam issue in a previous film, 'Kingdom of Heaven', this time bit the bullet (instead of the sword) and continued KoH's story about 1000 years later. 'Body of Lies' is very much a Ridley Scott movie and this translates into the film's politics as well. Thing is, you can't leave politics out of a political movie; and so what do you do? Well, here's a newsflash for the poli-preachers on all sides: it's possible to have it all, and just watch Ridley Scott do it. Just like KoH, it's all about even-handedness and realizing that (1) every side in a conflict has a point of view, which, to itself, is perfectly valid; and (2) every side has people you'd probably like and some you really wouldn't, (3) the way to peace lies with understanding (1) and (2); and not with having just one point of view, no matter how righteous it may appear. Both, Islamophobes and Islamophiles--or those on the extremes of any aspect of the political spectrum--will probably find ample elements to dislike about this film. Others of a more moderate and even-handed disposition will find much to like and appreciate.All of this, rather profound, stuff is wrapped up in a gritty Ridley Scott production and direction, that keeps your full attention for its full 2+ hours. Leonardo DiCaprio has really grown up and cast off his annoying persona, which was so prominent in just about all his movies; until 'Blood Diamond' came along. Russell Crowe is basically a secondary character, eclipsed almost completely by DiCaprio and Mark Strong. The latter has come a long way since I first saw him in the BBC production of Jane Austen's 'Emma'. The gentle and understated romance element provided by Golshifteh Farahani as 'Aisha' provided a nice contrast to the testosterone-soaked male world in which this drama plays out.The movie confirms what I've known for a long time: Ridley Scott apparently can do no wrong.",Body of Lies

Nah.Jabal Al Hussain: It's one of the oldest places in Amman. It was depicted as a Palestinian refugee camp, which is totally wrong.Dar'a, Syria: When they were smuggling DiCaprio to Syria from Jordan, they entered Dar'a, a city in Southern Syria. They showed it as a huge desert. I mean, come on, have you seen any photos or did some research? The place looks like the Arabian desert!DiCaprio said to the lady doc ""you sound like from Iran"" or something in that context. She was speaking Arabic... Arabic=/Farsi.People in Turkey were speaking Arabic. Again, Arabic=/Turkish.I'm not even going into the whole accents dilemma. You just need to know that they're bad and won't make any sense to any Arabic speaker.Some might say that I'm just nitpicking, but no, we expect to see some efforts from big budgeted movies.I gave it 4 just because my man Leo was amazing in his Arabic pronunciation!

179,sobeit712,"Decent movie, if you can forgive some of the obvious silliness",6,27 December 2008,"From a technological point of view, this movie fulfilled its mission of being somewhat entertaining. It's not particularly thought provoking nor did it offer anything new, partly due to the fact that the subject has been done to death. While it does not excel among the abundant cache of spy movies of Hollywood (one of its favorite subject and stable of annual production to fill the quota of the genre), it is not any worse either.May I impose a rather philosophical question before we delve into the judgment of the movie: Is Hollywood capable of making a real thought provoking movie concerning the subject of politics and religion? Movie is ultimately a commercial entity. When a director is facing the choice of being truthful and being commercially successful, what would he choose? Often than not, most directors, especially the big names, would choose the latter as the more famous he is, the more is at stake.Now let's take a quick look at Ridley Scott's track record. Being one of the better directors in Hollywood, he's very good at sensationalize a controversial subject. He's very skillful at making a movie look more serious and truthful than it really is. To be honest, I enjoyed Gladiator immensely. But what exactly is Gladiator about? Probably nothing that's really relevant to our daily life. Now, let's look at some of his other pictures (I will come back to this later to illustrate why I want to do this): Black Hawk Down (a propaganda movie that though depict the cruelty of war on the surface, is actually glorifying the war machine - soldiers, by not asking the real question of why do we fight for wars that seems serves little or no purpose, instead, praising the heroism of soldiers and loyalty of brotherhood between them). Let's take a look at another big budget movie of his: Kingdom of Heaven, a more ""sophisticated"" historical epic. What's so sophisticated about this movie then? That though there are some corrupted, greedy, scheming and cruel militants, crusades in general are decent, trustworthy, kind, loving and generous? Are they not grand inquisitors, liars, thieves, robbers, rapist and plunderers that kill and rape in Christ's name? Now let's come back to this movie, in which we witness Hollywood master doing what he does best yet again. From the surface, we see a cunning yet conscience CIA operative fighting against all odds, trying to capture a top level terrorist leader. Let's forget about all the silly tricks of Hollywood such as hacking into anyone's computer by running some software and tracking anyone down by pushing a joystick. Leonardo DiCaprio's Roger Ferris is so unbelievably self contradictory to a point that no matter how good Leonardo can act, he can not make this character look real. DiCaprio is such a naturally charming actor, he can make you like him within a few seconds of screen time. Without his charm, this character will literally become such a laughing stock. In one scene, he's angry at his supervisor and accusing him of being deceitful. He seems to conveniently forget that he's also all about lies and scheming. I guess that's what this movie is about: lies after lies. But the problem is, the director also want you to believe that he's also very decent, righteous and truthful.The romance, seems to be rather out of place, turn out to be a major trickery to propel the plot along.The whole movie is just inches away from sinking down to the level of recent Hollywood popcorn garbage such as Eagle Eyes. Like I said, it is entertaining, but you have to suspend your intelligence and logic for 2 hours in order to enjoy it.",Body of Lies

181,Shrykespeare,Ridley does it again,9,7 October 2008,"You really have to admire Ridley Scott's moxie.Even though the 70-year-old director has long established himself as one of Hollywood's best and most durable directors; having helmed some of the most entertaining films of all time, in virtually every genre (including sci-fi classics like Alien and Blade Runner); and having been nominated no less than three times for the Best Director Oscar (Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down), to decide to take on theme that has produced exactly zero blockbusters thus far  the Middle East and terrorism  takes an incredible amount of chutzpah.But it does help if you have the help of two of the biggest actors in Hollywood at the moment, those being Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe (who has worked with Scott on two previous films, Gladiator and A Good Year). It's ironic to think that the last time these two actors shared the screen was back in 1995, with the clichéd-but-entertaining oater The Quick and the Dead. Of course, at the time, Crowe was a complete unknown and DiCaprio was a 21-year-old newcomer with only a couple of notable titles under his belt. But oh, how that's all changed now.It's not easy to describe the plot of Body of Lies without giving too much away. DiCaprio plays CIA operative Roger Ferris, who is trying to flush out a terrorist leader named Al-Saleem in Jordan. He gets his orders from Ed Hoffman (Crowe), a man for whom results are the only satisfactory outcome, delivered with a fair amount of arrogance and a cocky Southern drawl. Ed plays the situation like a kid playing a video game, and has the resources to change the rules anytime he feels like it, dispensing his orders from his office, from his backyard, from his daughter's soccer game, for Pete's sake! This, of course, infuriates Ferris to no end, because he is the one who is in the trenches, chasing the bad guys, dodging bullets, ducking explosions, and procuring the badly-needed intelligence that Hoffman needs. Ferris is also trying to build a productive working relationship with the head of Jordanian Intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), a relationship that is made even more tenuous by Hoffman's double-dealings and hidden agendas.There are so many ways that Scott could have screwed this up. A lesser director might have chosen to ramp up the action, sacrificing intelligence for entertainment. A lesser director could have taken this story of espionage and twisted it into a convoluted and indecipherable Gordian knot. A lesser director would have gotten less convincing performances from his lead actors.But Ridley Scott is not a lesser director. Though the plot is indeed complex, with many layers and sub-layers, deceit and treachery, Scott never lets you lose sight of the overall picture. He tells a solid, wonderfully entertaining story, without the need to drive home its message with sledgehammer subtlety (after all, very few things are black and white). And most of all, he gets electric performances from Crowe and DiCaprio, whose symbiotic relationship with a thinly-veiled veneer of mutual contempt is a pleasure to watch.I don't know if Body of Lies will end up breaking through the barrier that every movie in this genre couldn't; but for what it's worth, I hope it does. One thing's for sure if anybody can, Ridley Scott can.For this and other reviews, please check out www.thelatestmoviereviews.com.",Body of Lies

Cinematography is great, the story advances at a good clip, and when it is all done you are going to wonder what and why. Why did they bother making this movie and what could you have done, instead of wasting your time watching this annoying movie? According to Ridley Scott and the writers, Westerners cannot be trusted while Muslims are noble, sincere, committed, and always tell the truth. As best I can tell, that is all there is to this movie. Hmmm, now where have I seen this before? Ah yes, Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I am sick of it.Even Muslim women are better than American women, according to Scott & Co. So, Ferris (DiCaprio) admits to his new love interest, Aisha (Farahani), that he was a bad husband but the woman he divorced was a worse wife. Of course, Aisha (coincidentally (?) the name of the 6 yr old girl that Muhammad married when he was about 54 yrs old, and who was his favorite wife) is transparently in the plot so that she will be kidnapped and so that Ferris will have to sacrifice himself to save her. Pointedly, something Ferris's boss, the backstabbing Ed Hoffman (Russel Crowe) would never do.Oh, and Ed Hoffman, who works out of CIA at Langley, hates his kids, whereas Aisha loves her nephews.

190,SkullyD,A Surprisingly Balanced portrayal of the War on Terror.,9,16 October 2008,"Something I've always admired about Ridley Scott, is that he never gives you an easy answer. His films never allow the audience to make simple distinctions between the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys. Body of Lies continues this tradition of challenging the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Roger Ferris, a CIA operative who attempts to flush out a big-name terrorist by creating a fake terrorist group, while working with Jordanian Intelligence. His ""boss"", Ed Hoffman, played by a comically out of shape Russell Crowe, continually undermines him by double dealing behind his back. By the end of this film, the web of deception created by Ferris and Hoffman costs an innocent man his life and lands Ferris in mortal peril at the hand of Islamic extremists. What sets ""Body of Lies"" apart from so many other politically minded thrillers, is that it never preaches to the audience. Hoffman, while an arrogant, borderline racist boor, is never portrayed as evil or as a scheming villain, he's just a guy trying to do his job who is disconnected from the realities of war. Similarly, the terrorists aren't reduced to one-note psychopaths. They are portrayed as intelligent, cunning enemies who understand us better than we understand them. We don't get the typical ""The US is screwing everything up"" angle that is typical of other political thrillers. But this film is far from a flag-waving patriotic blow job. It shows that there are horrors and atrocities committed on both sides of the fight. ""Body of Lies"" shows us that the war on terror is not as simple as the politicians, pundits or even the terrorists make it out to be.",Body of Lies

The writer introduced a few sub-plots in the story. That keeps you on the edge of the seat, especially every time when there seemed to be the final solution. It would begin another story.

Films like the recent ""Bourne Identity"" trilogy attempted to update the old format by infusing it with action and modern pop culture references. ""Body of Lies"" doesn't bother to connect it's mood with the espionage movie genre, but it does make use of several spy movie clichés like the rouge agent, the girlfriend in danger, and end plot twists.""Body of Lies"" takes place in the current wartime, in settings that have become increasingly familiar to the American public. The film does a good job of presenting the setting in a realistic manner, and shows a slice of the war in Iraq. However, don't expect to swept away with a great narrative or human drama, it's just not there.This would not be a problem if it was a documentary, or it had a particularly compelling element of realism and an important realistic message, but I didn't see any of that. I just saw a spy movie using a realistic wartime backdrop and succeeding only in being exciting and entertaining in the action sequences. Nor did the film really develop characters much. I wanted to know more about the computer guy that DiCaprio works with, and to see DiCaprio's relationship develop, but it never happened.""Body of Lies"" was occasionally exciting, sometimes very sad, and never actually bad, but also never really brilliant.

The intrinsic problem is how (or if) one can tell the difference. In this instance, Di Caprio, Crowe and Scott make this conundrum all too real.In the central thesis of this film lies a problem that predates the CIA and the intelligence gathering communities of the world. It is the enduring conflict of religion testing the mettle of its non-believers. Referred to in the film as ""infidels"", are those of the Islamic world trying to rule the rest of the world until all others are ""bled dry"", or is it just dirty politics fed to the masses via the film media?Even deeper is the question: who can you trust?

Ferris senses that Hoffman is just a presser of manipulative buttons and discovers that betrayal is a truth that does not set him free but takes him captive. Whether or not the CIA can literally ""spy"" on anyone is a moot point.

199,Chris_BS1212,Suave action thriller from Ridley Scott and Leo DiCaprio,6,24 April 2010,"This is Ridley Scott's effort at making a modern spy thriller set in the middle east which is definitely closer to the Bourne films than it is to Syriana although it handles it's politics fairly well. DiCaprio plays Roger Ferris a CIA agent operating first in Iraq and later in Jordan, he does a great job here of crafting an engaging character who is definitely not Jason Bourne when he could so easily have been given the amount of similarities the two share, they are both heavily influenced in their actions by their consciences and are the best at what they do. In the opening 25 minutes Scott delivers a number of compelling action sequences as Ferris, doing his best to blend in with the natives in his cheap sports clothing and beard, attempts to recruit an informant who is on the fringes of a group run by Al-Saleem that we learn has been setting off bombs all over Europe.Ferris is constantly watched by his handlers at CIA back in Langley, whether this is by predator drone or spy plane is not clear but which ever this film is full of new technology like this and how intelligence agencies are using it to fight the war on terror. Ferris is also frequently in contact with his handler, Ed Hoffmann, played with fantastic disdain and arrogance by Russell Crowe. These two are frequently at odds with each other as Hoffmann, ignorant of Ferris' situation initiates side operations that put Ferris in considerable danger. However they also collaborate effectively to provide the main storyline for the film as they try to snare Al-Saleem. Although too much examination of how they hope their plan might work could lead to you wondering how it ever would.Body of Lies has a good storyline which does require quite a suspension of belief at times, but I was happy to make that leap of faith given the strong acting of the three leads: DiCaprio, Strong and Crowe. Strong is particularly effective as Hani, the suave yet brilliant head of the Jordanian intelligence service. Where this film does fall down is in the romance between Ferris and Aisha, a nurse who volunteer in Palestine, which seems too contrived and a bit of an afterthought as it does not fit entirely with the rest of the film. Inevitably it is also rather formulaic and there are few surprises apart from at the climax but Scott has made a good, stylish, modern spy thriller.",Body of Lies
200,logos1,Impressive visually but disjointed and long winded,6,2 November 2009,"As a visual spectacle, Body of Lies often impresses. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance also has its moments in the movie. For other commentators, those factors seem to be sufficient to rate it highly. I, on the other hand, was tempted to rate it lower than 6 as I found it to fall completely flat as entertainment.The movie is simply too long and too disjointed to be entertaining. It has an impressive buildup that whets your appetite for a great climax that never really comes. Even the torture scene referred to in other reviews was not credible for me.It takes a long time for this movie to, ultimately, get nowhere. Russell Crowe is largely wasted in an unlikable, one-dimensional role. There are moments of excitement that make for great trailer material in this movie, but the thread that would tie them all together is not sufficiently compelling.

202,mbuckingham-1,Great Action! Great movie!,7,29 November 2008,"Ridley Scott's new movie is quite similar to Black Hawk Down and American Gangster.**SYNOPSIS**Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a covert CIA operative working in Jordan searching for terrorists who have been bombing civilian targets. Ferris uncovers information on the Islamist mastermind Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). He devises a plan to infiltrate Al-Saleem's terrorist network with the help of his boss back in Langley, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe). Ferris enlists the help of the Chief of Jordanian Intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong) on this operation, but he doesn't know how far he can trust him without putting his life in danger. The uneasy alliance leads to a cultural and moral clash between the men.Source: IMDb **ACTION: 4 Stars **This movie really shines as an action movie! Such excellent sequences! **STORYLINE: 3 Stars **Both engrossing and tense, it kept my attention throughout the whole movie.**MUSIC: 3 Stars **The Music is wonderfully created with an original score created by Marc Streitenfeld **CONCLUSION **I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it to anyone that would be interesting in this kind of movie!

The film seemed to jump from one plot to another and i didn't really understand what was going on... or why. The first 30 minutes are interesting. The action and storyline are gripping to watch. But after Dicaprio's friend is smashed to 'pieces' in a car crash, i had no idea what was going on. the final 30 minutes started to make sense - the CIA setting up some people with mild terrorist connections into a fake terrorist group so they could infiltrate the big bad terrorist. But I still struggled to make sense of how they went about it and how it fell apart. And couldn't that have been the plot for the whole movie? it sounded good enough and it was the part of the film that made me think 'aahhhhhhh' But what i ask myself is, what the hell happened before all that?

After the third or fourth time we see titles announcing: ""Langley"" along with a sweeping (unnecessary) shot of the Pentagon, or ""Amman"" with a shot of SUVs cruising up to an impressive building, this technique becomes predictable and wearisome.Of the many movies lately dealing with America's role in the Muslim world, espionage, terrorism, etc., this compares favorably.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe do very good job.Also Mark Strong with a solid performance.The movie from the very beginning engages you into the story and never once slows you down. DiCaprio does it again as in departed when he is caught between the two agencies. The entire concept is something different. The climax is so awesome and the dialogues are The Best!!!My personal favorite is when DiCaprio asks Strong What would have happened if he was late to rescue him and strong says she(nurse) would have loved you forever and now he has to earn it!!!I also like the way DiCaprio answers Saleem after he gets caught!!!Totally its a Complete Package with everything!!!

It will be worth getting the DVD just to look at the editing and direction  it is that good (but, then and again  I'm one of those people that watches DVDs with the directors commentary on. Whatever!) As others have said  Mark Strong was very impressive as Hani. Smart suit, clean cut, but ruthless.DiCaprio gave a convincing performance as the field op  Ferris. Much better than I expected.Crowe  oh, dear God. It must have seemed such a good idea at the time. But really, was there nobody better. Perhaps it was intentional that Hoffman should be a characterture of what we might expect a CIA man to be. But there are so many better ways to do this. I was left unconvinced. The accent didn't work either.Then there's the script. OK, it's a film, not a documentary, but there were some glaring holes. Here's an American  clearly American because of the looks he gets when eating with Aisha in the Palestinian camp  but can walk around with impunity right next to a suspected terrorist strong-hold. It helps with the story, I suppose.A very enjoyable film  worth watching.

Leonarda as usual he has delivered a great performance. The movie has a lot of facts and they have researched more about the terrorist groups and fabricated properly. Ridley Scott has done a great job in coming with this script and delivering. The screenplay is a bit slow and in the end you will forget about the negatives.

212,screenwriting-2,"Enjoyable, not amazing.",6,20 October 2008,"Another middle east terrorism film, Ridley Scott's Body of Lies is actually enjoyable. There have been a whole slew of these things lately, including Rendition, Traitor, The Kite Runner, and movies about War and today's soldiers like Stop-Loss and Lions for Lambs. The middle east is popular these days, or unpopular, whatever it may be, tons of movies are coming out that take place there and have some relationship with terrorism, religion, and war. Body of Lies sort of sums a lot of these things up, considering many of the angles that were each the focus of one of these other films. Although in doing so it doesn't make as strong a point as the others which very simply illustrate ONE THING so that it's very clear to the viewer. Body of lies considers all of these things and carefully weaves much of it in to the overarching plot of the film. The result is a very engaging enjoyable film that is no slouch in it's depth, but also no hard hitting political statement. Within the run of these movies Body of Lies was one of the most consistently enjoyable and overall well balanced films. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for the pleasure of an adventure movie that's more than just action, or maybe to someone who likes to think about international relations, terrorism, and morality, but I would NOT go to this movie to be inspired or enlightened.I saw this and then went to Sex Drive, and the combination made for an evening of good fun, which has been lacking in my trips to the theater of late.

One has come to expect a certain level of perfection from Ridley Scott and he does not disappoint. The move delves in the conflict one faces in trying to do the right thing vs the patriotic thing. The supporting cast gives a strong performance, Crowe as the handler who is always second-guessing his protégé, Strong as the Jordanian head-of-security who has a hidden agenda and Farahani as the love interest. The pacing of the movie is a bit off and seems a bit slow at times but still it is money well spent at the theater.

214,sweet_lady_genevieve,Not a mind-blowing blockbuster but a well-made action thriller,8,8 April 2009,"From acclaimed Oscar-nominated director, Ridley Scott (American Gangster, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down), comes this gritty political action thriller based on the novel by former Washington Post columnist, David Ignatius. With a celebrated production team and two of Hollywood's most distinguished leading actors, it inevitably carries high expectations.Roger Ferris (Di Caprio) works for US Intelligence. His orders come from Ed Hoffman (Crowe), who remains detached from the war he wages through his laptop as he stays in the comfort of his suburban home. Hoffman is monitoring the movements of a sophisticated terrorist organisation after a number of attacks occur – from bus bombings in Sheffield to a mobile phone-triggered bombing in a Dutch town.Ferris is mostly stationed in the Middle East, where he is required to locate a terrorist named Al-Salim. As his pursuit takes him across the globe and back again, Ferris is faced with mortal danger and learning from the beginning the implications of having anyone close to him. He comes to realise that trust is key – he depends upon it for his life, whilst trust placed in the wrong person could lead to dire consequences.We would expect nothing less from Ridley Scott than to deliver slick direction and superb cinematography. There is a strong political agenda within the film, implying questionable conduct within the US Intelligence. It focuses on recent global issues concerning terrorist activity and the American response to this, so many will feel its relevance. However, there is an overriding feeling that the issues of trust, backstabbing and corruption shown in the film are all too familiar within this genre, so in this sense the film gives us nothing new.Having said this, the performance given by Di Caprio is one to be commended. His character's overall passion for his cause is convincing and as the film continues, he develops a war-weary persona, fed-up with the immorality of his organisation. This is combined with him effectively delivering parts of his dialogue in fluent Arabic. Crowe, who gained 63lb for his role as the egotistical Hoffman, is intended to depict many of those in power within the American government, successfully appearing so far-removed from the realities of war and conflict that people's lives are only worth as much as the information they can offer.This is another brilliantly-directed film to add to Ridley Scott's work. Whilst it is not a mind-blowing blockbuster, it is a well-made action thriller and if you enjoy films of this nature, it is definitely worth a watch.",Body of Lies
215,chser453,Best movie of the year,9,21 February 2010,"Best way to watch this is to take it for what it is, a movie, and forget about scrutinising it for the political messages that may or may not contain . We all know what the current political climate is like and movies are our mean of escapism. The set pieces were visually impressive as you expect from Scott reminiscent of Black Hawk Down, a movie which often get mentioned in comparisons , my criticism would be that weren't enough of them. Obviously this isn't your standard brainless explosion filled fare, but would have loved Scott to explore the full 'arsenal' of high tech gear, spy drones, tactical assault units etc the CIA has at its disposal.As for the acting performances, all i can say is close to flawless. Di Caprio was excellent as the CIA field agent in the Mid East tempering his admiration for the arab peoples and culture alongside his clear ambition to make a name for himself hunting down the bad guy terrorists. The penultimate scenes of his capture by the terrorists were his best and unlike other 'tough guy agent' leading roles, you began to feel the despair and panic to his situation.The real standout for me was Scott favourite Russel Crowe as Di caprios slimy CIA boss and handler running the show over his handsfree in the US, alongside his day to day life ferrying his kids to soccer and picking up the shopping. You pick up straightaway his contrasted attitude to the mid east from di caprios character and isn't willing to offer the same respect to his mid east counterparts. This creates create tension from the outset between boss Crowe and his no 1. Special mention must go to Londoner Mark Strong for a chillingly impressive performance as Hani Salaam head of Jordanian Intelligence, ferried around in a convoy of Mercs in sharp suits like a mafia don, but not the standard ""fingernail-puller"" to quote Crowes character, speaking like an educated man but always with a menacing undertone.Im not going to do a full synopsis of the movie, there are plenty of those, all i will say watch this movie, its great from start to finish.",Body of Lies
216,ldw-eg,Incompetent subtitles of foreign-language dialog,5,22 February 2009,"I suppose this was a good movie, and looking at the number of comments people have posted, there's no reason for me to comment on the plot or acting. My enjoyment of the movie was badly marred by the incompetent subtitles any time the characters are speaking a language other than English (usually Arabic). Note that I am not referring to the closed-caption type subtitles that you can turn on and off. I did turn them on in the hope that they'd include a readable-sized translation of the Arabic but all they had was ""(speaking Arabic)"".I watched this on DVD on a friend's 26"" (?) old-style standard TV. My vision isn't good to start with, and the translations get smaller and smaller as the movie progresses, starting from way too small going all the way to microscopic. I'm sure that the director had some reason for doing that, but I don't care. Whomever was ultimately responsible for the translated-Arabic subtitles needs to be fired and blacklisted from the business. By the end of the movie it was necessary to freeze frame it and walk to the TV set and practically put my nose to the screen in order to read the subtitles, and some of them still weren't readable due to being pale yellow against white objects.Without being able to easily read the translation of the Arabic, it's very difficult and painful to follow this otherwise-good movie. I suggest that the studio issue a recall for all DVDs and re-issue them with readable sized subtitles, after firing the original tech responsible for that small text size.",Body of Lies

218,s_m_osama,There are two types of Americans,8,19 July 2020,"Body of Lies is an American spy film. The theme of this movie is that the CIA and the Jordanian intelligence get together to catch a jihadist by the name of Al-Saleem. In the process, the movie attempts to portray the real motivations and designs of the Americans in general and the CIA operatives in particular.The story revolves around two CIA officials: Hoffman (Russell Crowe) and Ferris (Leonardo Di Caprio). They are two different personalities, yet are on the same mission. Hoffman is stationed in the CIA headquarters and he watches out for Ferris who is stationed in the Mid-east. Both have different perceptions and different set of ethics. Nevertheless, they manage to accomplish the mission.Hoffman and Ferris consider the mid-eastern public as pawns which can be used anytime to fulfill the operational purposes of the CIA. That is why they formulate a plan involving an innocent citizen (Omar Sidiki) which portrays him as a terrorist in order to get hold of another terrorist. However, Ferris also believes that after using them, they are not to be ditched, rather rewarded. That is why he makes a decision of getting hold of Omar Sidiki after the bomb blasts because he fears that Omar Sidiki would be tortured and killed. Hoffman does not like the idea of bringing Sadiki in. Similarly, after Bassam's death, Ferris wants his boss to financially support Bassam's family as he was their man. However, Hoffman refuses to even know him which shows his thinking of foreigners as toilet papers to be used and thrown. Ferris's ethics, on the other hand, are based quite a lot on empathy and returning the favor.The difference in attitude is also visible even when Hoffman and Ferris go to meet Hani Pasha, the head of the Jordanian intelligence. Ferris meets him in a respectable way. It shows that he universally follows the rule of 'give respect and take respect'. On the other hand, Hoffman's body language says, 'You are my servant and you are going to do what I say so.' When Hoffman asks for Karami and Hani refuses, Hoffman passes a smile. That smile says everything. It says, 'Listen Hani kid, who do you think you are messing with? You do not know me, you do not know CIA. I am going to get what I want.' He therefore continues to ask for Karami threatening him of embarrassing him by making his king call him. It is only when Hani says 'insaa' that Hoffman realizes that Hani is not going to pay heed to his demand easily.Ferris believes in working with the Jordanian intelligence and respecting their approach and methods. Hoffman obviously considers his approach and methods as far superior to those of other intelligence agencies. This attitude nearly ruins his operation when he runs a side operation in order to keep surveillance on the safe house.Ferris also loathes the CIA operatives, the politicians and the bureaucrats for not showing any empathy for the field operatives like him. This is evident from his reply to Hoffman when he tells Ferris that he is not thinking straight after Omar Sidiki's death. 'You know what? I am thinking straight. You're not, all right? You can't, because you're a million miles away. I'm here, Ed, every day. And I see the unnecessary travesties of this war... that the rest of you backstabbing political bureaucrats... only look at pictures of. So, don't you dare tell me I am not thinking straight! This is not working, all right? It's not working, I'm out.'Ferris also has a soft spot in his heart for the native girls as he falls for one of them and tries his best to gain her and her sister's approval. He literally goes berserk and lets out his plan regarding Omar Sidiki to Hani Pasha when she is taken away. This shows his prioritization of his friend over his job. He also informs his boss about Aisha.'I like the middle east'. With the passage of time, Ferris has gotten attached to the people and maybe also likes the culture and their way of life. 'Nobody likes the Mid-east. There is nothing here to like.' This is how Hoffman refers to the Mid-east.After the operation is over, Ferris is tilted towards Mid-east and wants to stay there. As a result, he refuses to go with Hoffman back to the USA. He ends his meeting with Hoffman by saying '...good luck with your war...' meaning he finally realizes that it is not America's war but of some power-hungry officials in the political administration of the USA and of the CIA.'Walk out on me and you know what it means. It means you have given up on America.' This is what Hoffman replies to Ferris when he refuses to come to the USA. This shows that Hoffman thinks that he and people like him who have imperialistic ambitions are the true representation of America.Before leaving, he points out to Hoffman, 'Be careful before calling yourself America.' He believes that the aspirations and ambitions of workers like Hoffman are not the true representation of the United States of America.So, by portraying Ferris and Hoffman, this film attempts to depict and display the two types of people generally existing in the USA. There are those who believe that the world is their playing ground and they need to maintain supremacy and control over it. The second type believes that the USA should stop poking their nose in other's affairs and that the US does not deserve the right to do whatever it wills.",Body of Lies

He is one of the best active directors around, and while he's in his 70's he can still put out movies that entertain us, even though they don't come up to the level of movies like ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" that Scott used to put out in the highpoint of his career. In Body Of Lies it feels like he... isn't as interested in making a really good movie, The directing feels rushed, and we don't get to see any beautiful shots of Iraq, or anything like that. The writing is good, the story is good but I feel that the love story should have gotten a bigger part, because it's a subject that really needs to be discussed, two people who can't love each other because of their religion. And I couldn't feel any real emotions between the characters. The acting is great, DiCaprio, while sometimes seems to just copy all of his other characters lately, makes a believable performance and manages to carry the movie on his shoulders. Crowe is one of the best actors of his generation and he is great here as well. But I feel that he is trying to much, he is practically screaming: ""Give Me An Oscar!""

222,can-da-spam,"Entertaining, but a bit of a fizz given the huge talent firepower",6,1 January 2009,"Late to the screens with a tired ""adversaries and intrigue"" story, both leading men do a decent, but uninspired job as if they've become so minimalist, they're playing themselves playing the character. And the Aussie needs to go back to the dialect coach and recover what used to be a much more convincing ""Yank"" accent -- now he sounds like a bored caricature. It's not droll to be so deliberately bent on being droll and the dialogue misses the mark.From one scene to the next it's as if the director was running hot and cold, one minute the characters were developing and the viewer could begin to care about their fate, the next the characters are gone and there seems to be a rush to get to the next plot point.For what it's worth, in my humble, amateur opinion, it was the supporting male actor, Mark Strong, playing the good-bad-good guy that captures the imagination. The character is a little ""oversold"" at times, but holds his credibility (something I don't think anyone could say for the mess that Crowe leaves on the screen in almost every scene.) Perhaps it's fair to say that the Crowe character was abused by the writer(s) trying to move things along and make their point in dialogue instead of creating real, credible characters. It seems to me the movie should have jettisoned Crowe's character entirely and gone without that facet of the plot altogether. I wonder if that entire character was stitched into the movie just for the business purposes of Crowe involved -- it certainly looked like all his scenes were shot the same day and purpose built for the teasers and trailers.There's been so many movies on this general topic, some of which were far better than others, but it's become a topic that requires more powerful writing and much more significant plot, it requires more than two leading male actors and a top shelf director. Strangely, though I was bored by this movie, I watched it to the end and I felt like it need another 30 minutes. The action scenes, the technology scenes, they're all boring, they took up precious minutes, they distracted from the intensity of the danger and threat to the main character. It's an epic that didn't survive being compressed into conventional time constraints. I wish the director had cut the expensive stunts and gadgets to give us time to understand the characters and to enjoy more depth in the story. There were really four big characters at play, plus the war, plus the concepts of religion and the behavior of terrorists, just too much. We don't need another ""in the mind of the terrorist mastermind"" and we didn't get much of a sense of culture or religion, just a easily palatable romantic skim of the top of Arab life neatly presented without the burden of reality.I think the story requires (and certainly deserves) a level of honesty and reality that this movie doesn't attempt -- we certainly didn't need to see another a quick draw on the box office for holiday season.Well, I recommend it as well worth watching, but don't wait for the DVD or the iTunes rental, this is a point in time flick that will be all the more expired in a few months. I give it a subjective 6 out of 10. I'd take away two points for writing and one point each for acting and direction.",Body of Lies

224,Birdhasflown,Unites States Foreign Policy presented in Body of Lies- Apathy over Empathy,8,25 January 2009,"""Body of Lies"" begins with a stirring quote by poet W.H. Auden: ""What all school children learn / Those to whom evil is done / Do evil in return."" As the war on terror ensues, it grows more difficult for America to fight actual terrorists. They live in worlds on the verge of utter disorder. The landscape of war is muddled with new technologies and materialistic comforts.This stark difference in realities tarnishes understanding of Middle Eastern nations, creating a serious problem in the way the U.S. deals with them. This is what ""Body of Lies"" explores.The film centers around two CIA agents, Ed Hoffman (played smugly by Russell Crowe) and Roger Ferris (a whiskered Leonardo DiCaprio). Hoffman calmly gives orders to Ferris via cell phone as he sits idly by his computer or at his daughter's soccer game while Ferris conducts missions across the globe. Ferris is willing to work with other nations in thwarting terrorism as Hoffman gives little to no consideration for adhering to the moral code of foreign diplomacy.Hoffman is always eating or inactive. He's seen in one moment loading his minivan, the back door conveniently shutting automatically. Through Hoffman, the film paints a message that Americans' lazy lifestyles have seeped into the nation's foreign diplomacy. Ferris empathizes and reasons with foreign officials; Hoffman is merely apathetic toward them.Ferris becomes conflicted with his own ways of dealing with suspected terrorists and advisers and the indifferent idealism of Hoffman. Ferris constantly aims to protect his informants while staying focused on his objective to find terrorists. Through his orders from Hoffman, Ferris sometimes treats both one and the same. This separation of ideals makes the film enthralling to watch.A cloud of murkiness and shadow hovers over every frame. The sounds of searing violins rise up in moments of tension and eloquently highlight an ominous threat on Ferris. Hoffman seems to constantly go behind his back in carrying out missions which hurts Ferris' stability with his mission and foreign officials in Middle Eastern nations. The film centers on his relationship with a foreign adviser from Jordon, played mysteriously by Mark Strong.The film has jarring action scenes, and the plot moves quickly. DiCaprio shines with authentic intensity and vigor in a role similar to his turn in ""The Departed."" He's batted around a lot in this film, and it is a testament to DiCaprio's immersion in his roles. Crowe has never played such a bastardly obnoxious character, which makes the viewer forget it's even him.""Lies"" is an intriguing viewpoint into American diplomacy to combat terrorism, often seen as aggressive and selfish. To Hoffman, agents are as expendable as the Islamic martyrs who give their lives for their ideals.Can there be a just way to combat terrorism without becoming something evil ourselves? ""Body of Lies"" begs you to ask the question. How different are we from the terrorists we're trying to pursue?",Body of Lies
225,Lyserod,Better than the previews,9,22 October 2008,"I hesitated going to see this movie mostly because of the aggressive advertising campaign, which presented this film as a Russel Crowe/Leonardo Dicaprio showdown with big explosions and snippy one-liners. Luckily the movie turned out to be much more innovative and thought-provoking than that. For one thing, as it plays out, the really captivating acting was between Dicaprio and Mark Strong. Generally, movies dealing heavily with war tactics don't hold much interest with me, but this one points out some interesting mistakes in the American tactics for resolving conflicts in other countries. There are great lessons to learn about relying on technology when doing surveillance on an enemy that gets messages around by putting little paper notes in empty disposable coffee cups. Also, as the title implies, the most intriguing topics in this movie deal with how America's intelligence agency has problems sharing information with the agencies in other countries - even when they are fighting the same enemy. On top of all the heavy issues, the movie is also a great ride with everything from moments of extreme excitement, fear and horror to comedic turns, romance and cultural appreciation scenes. My only small complaint regarding the story line would be squeezing in the typical romantic interest for the lead as ""the nurse"" to ""the soldier"", but she does turn out to be important for the story later.",Body of Lies
226,pranobg00,Lie Low,8,21 October 2008,"In Body of Lies, Ridley Scott juxtaposes two faces of America in the War on Terror. The one, cold and aloof, ensconced in comfortable American suburbia. The other, tough and gritty as he is vulnerable, the man on the ground who has fallen in love with the Middle East. While movies like The Kingdom show the war on terror as a series of military actions, Body of Lies manages to capture the human touch of being in the Middle East and having to deal with Middle Easterners. One liners like ""Nobody Likes the Middle East"" and the potent understated argument against Americans linger long after the movie. For those who would like to know what America is really working on in terms of counter-terrorism in the Middle East, this is possibly the best movie yet. Di Caprio continues where he left off from in Blood Diamond and The Departed and puts in another sterling performance.",Body of Lies

228,mohak79,If you are craving a good drama then this is a treat for you,7,20 June 2015,"Body of lies is nice and dramatic depiction of intra agency politics and situation during a war with terrorists with a sprinkle of love story. The movie is a about a CIA spy who is placed in Jordan in order to get in-tel about the upcoming bombing in Europe by Al-Saleem a terrorist Al-Qaeda. DiCaprio is assisted by Russell Crow (his senior) and Mark Strong (local businessman) but is most of the time mislead by his own organization resulting obstructions in his operations, until the master plan is constructed and is ready executed, but it's a master plan not a perfect plan, now the story unfolds in a really thrilling way which is difficult to predict. The beginning of the movie was slow and viewer tends to get bored and if you are a impatient person you would probably give up the movie. Honestly speaking only my liking for DiCaprio made me stick to the screen for the first 50 minutes. Though a slow beginning was necessary to create a plot still it could have been a bit quicker. After the first hour the story becomes interesting and a bit of suspense arises. Unlike the first part the second part features more action less drama, introduction of the love story and some more action. Acting wise all the cast did well, DiCaprio stood up to his reputation but I was particularly impressed by Mark Strong who intensified the character to its requirement. The story was well connected and had no fault except the speed thing. The presentation was satisfying and all the blasts and violent scenes were convincing. The only major thing except the speed thing it lacked was thrill, I expected a lot more suspense but it served me a pinch of it. So, I would say that you have to be patient enough to watch this movie and if you enjoy drama then you must see it. I wouldn't consider my time wasted on this movie.",Body of Lies

230,John_Acrob,Throws the same tired ideas out there with the same tired conventions.,6,25 November 2008,"The war in the Middle East. It is a war we cannot win, because for the most part, it is too complicated to even understand. Perhaps we shouldn't be involved... Or maybe we should. Who's to say? That is, in essence, what Body of Lies seems to say. In fact, that is in essence, what every film about the conflict in the Middle East has had to say over the last five years. The problem is Body of Lies doesn't have a new, innovative or particularly interesting way to get that idea across.In fact, even though Ridley Scott was once one of the great pioneers in film-making, this movie adheres to every filmic convention possible when it comes to a film set around terrorism in the Middle East. The music, the fast cuts, the shaky camera angles... It's all been done a thousand times.Body Of Lies main port of call seems to be an unflinching view of paranoid reality in the Middle East. Leonardo DiCaprio's character understands that reality, kill or be killed. He is the protagonist but he kills a basically innocent man in the first fifteen minutes of the film because the man could have described his face. That is interesting and realistic and I was impressed. However, just as The audience feels as though it may be treated to a raw, gritty view of the Middle Eastern conflict... Without giving anything away... It turns into just another Hollywood movie towards the end.Leonardio DiCaprio is a good actor. One day he might be regarded as one the greats. But he tries too earnestly to be tough in this film. He is still baby faced and relies on furrowing his brow and glaring all too often. I can't be sure if this was the direction he received or his own idea, but he simply wasn't convincing. Also we have seen his tough, jaded yet still-a-good-man thing before in Blood Diamond, where frankly, he did a better job.What to say about Russel Crowe? He plays a character named Ed Hoffman, a high level CIA operator who heads up several large scale organizations in the Middle East. His character was, I suppose, important to the film, but I didn't really take anything significant away about him. His character is pig-headed, untrustworthy and arrogant. There was potential there for something interesting. But did his character really serve a purpose other than the plot? I'm not so sure. They certainly gave him some antique dialog. ""Aint no one innocent in this s___"", for example.That example right there does somewhat illustrate the strength of William Monahan's writing in this film. There wasn't really one line of dialog in the whole 128 minute runtime that to me stood out as original or interesting. There were admittedly a few moments of humor which were a pleasant respite, but apart from that the writing was pretty by-the-numbers. David Ignatious' novel might have been good enough to build a decent film around, but I guess no one was interested in doing anything different.Body Of Lies is a movie which everybody will respond to differently. Many will like it much more than I did, many will dislike it much more than I did. Personally I just felt underwhelmed by the whole thing. It was average, and if it were some other director, I wouldn't even bother writing a review. I would think ho-hum and go about my day. But Ridley Scott used to make such brilliant films and I just can't understand why he's stuck to formula so much in Body Of Lies.We have seen this exact movie at least half a dozen times before. Filmmakers need to go about this type of film in a new, more unique way. Otherwise they should just stop trying.",Body of Lies

Russell Crowe is a disgusting fat slob who serves as his handler in the CIA. I swear he was eating in every scene....UGH! It was riveting and thought provoking.

236,mazmorrero02,Another honor graduated from the Bourne university,8,1 December 2008,"The movie is as intelligent as the novel written by David Ignatius.

THE GOOD In the novel, they detail very precisely the divorce that Ferris is going through, and in the movie they skip it because is irrelevant for the main plot. The finale in the book is the kind of ""happily ever after"" and in the movie has a more dramatic tone. THE BAD Ferris girlfriend in the book is beautiful and you feel you can fall in love with her and in the movie it's an awful and silly woman, that no-one could fall in love with. I mean, Ferris risked his life for her. Why did they had to change the main terrorist name from Suleiman to Al Saleem? Was it necessary? When they start deceiving Al Saleem, in the novel they are in a big super technological war room under the CIA building and in the movie it's only a nerd in a log cabin with 5 laptops and an LCD screen.

Boby of Lies isn't anything more than an American flick about terrorism. Althoug, there are some good aspects on it.I'm gonna focus this review mainly in the lacking aspects of the film. Here it goes: (i) there is a great amount of information shown, obliging one to pay very close attention to every single detail on the story, otherwise one will be lost and confused.(ii) the lack of criticism/position on the film. Personally, I couldn't understand if it was a story pro or against the ""situation"" of America in the middle east. Though there is some draft of criticism, as like as the scene where the character of DiCaprio makes the distinction between the American bureaucracy (personified in the character of Russell Crowe) and the American State, it is weak and insufficient. In this point of view, the film cannot be compared to the much better ""Shooter"", for example. And I'm not saying that the film should have a position against the war. It's genuine and democratic to be in favor of it, if it is what you think. The film, although, doesn't show any position.(iii) the obviousness of the story, in which the ""American soldier"" is saved in the last minute and solve all the situation in his favor, with some help of a middle east group that really need the support of USA. Also, the love (?) story between the American and the ""exotic foreigner"", with no reason at all.However, I like to mention the good aspects of the films, even of those I dislike. In this one I would highlight: (i) the amazing action scenes, like that one in which the cars are persecuted by the helicopters  Hollywood is becoming better in it day by day.(ii) the actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Russel Crowe and mainly Mark Strong.(iii) and the fact that the couple of the film didn't kiss each other.

He expertly unravels the story of CIA operative Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is assigned to flush out an evasive terrorist who is blowing up public places all over the world. Ferris is increasingly frustrated with his boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe)'s impatience and double dealings, which more than once puts himself in jeopardy, challenges the trust he is trying to build with Jordanian leader Hani (Mark Strong) and his budding romance with the pretty Palestinian nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani).DiCaprio just keeps getting better and better as he is now more able to lose himself in a role and successfully shed the pretty. Crowe does well in an understated but dangerously quiet role as a Washington-based puppetmaster. The versatile Italian-Austrian Andy Garcia-lookalike Strong is fantastic as the powerful Hani, while Farahani's face lights up the screen and turns in a memorable performance as well.The attention to detail in this movie is just awesome; the action sequences are not over the top but satisfactory enough to not lose the main storyline despite the complex thread of subplots.

E.g. Rendition, Syriana, and now this Body of Lies. Syriana was probably the best. However Hollywood has done this region before, e.g. Lawrence of Arabia (1963).Syriana to some extent, but none of the rest, address properly the political dimensions of the conflicts in the Middle East.What we get left with, are simple action movies, with no depth. Action movies coming out of Hollywood, need a background or context. These seem to be limited to Alien Attack (Terminator, Transformers, ...) , Fast Cars (Fast & Furious, etc) , Espionage (Bond & Bourne, ..) and now the Arab world.

He has produced another mature piece of art that has so much to it that the stupid mundane audience cant comprehend. This movie is not for people who like just silly popcorn flicks. Sir Ridley has made a movie which depicts the life of a spy in the real world. Its not a phony and dodgy depiction such as in movies like James bond etc. It takes a setup that is topical to the present world (Middle east) and doesn't glamorise or promote the life of a spy. It gives you all the hard facts as they are. No sugarcoating whatsoever. The realism and the grittiness of the film really blew me away. I think i feel exactly how it is to be in the middle east in today's world.Quite frankly when i went in to see the movie i didn't know what to expect. But when the movie started, the opening frame had a trademark Ridley Scott placard with a very meaningful quote. That really caught my attention and gave an idea of what was to come. I remember saying to myself 'OH BOY!! here we go!!'. As the film progressed, it kept getting better and better with not a single dull moment in it. The plot was fabulous and very believable. The thing about this movie which you don't expect is dark humour every now and then. Thats Ridley Scott for you. the music of the film, as in all Ridley's movies, had its own character. At the End of the film the new guns and roses song was simply brilliant and very catchy. Leonardo Dicaprio needs a special mention. He was absolutely awesome. Whereas Russel impressed in his own subtle way. Pretty unusual to see him like this but a nice change of pace for him. Mark Strong really left a decent impression with his brilliant portrayal of a Jordanian head of intelligence bureau.

It wasn't your typical spy thriller in that it tied everything up in a nice little pretty bow by the end. Leo plays yet another convincing character as a CIA deep cover operative working in the Middle East in present times. If I were to bet I'd say he studied some real life spooks because he played his character flawlessly while believable too. You couldn't help rooting for him throughout the picture as he tried to hunt down the world's most elusive terrorist (which was obviously a movie pun for the real life Osama Bin Laden if you ask me). For some reason Crowe's depiction of a Middle Eastern Section Chief for the CIA seemed quite believable as well. It as almost comical how he'd enjoy his breakfast in his docked boat while teleconferencing with his man on the ground in the sh*t (DiCaprio).There were many things I enjoyed about this film and little to none I didn't enjoy. I felt like for once this current/spy/thriller was dead on and didn't BS around the hardcore real business these folks go through trying to fight the people who'd like to make you and me go bye bye in the name of Allah. This film actually gives you both sides of the war without truly being one sided even though we all know we're rooting for DiCaprio and the Jordanians. I don't want to give too much away in regards to the plot itself but I wanted to give some enticing details about the film so you'll go enjoy it. I'd compare the likability of this film to Spy Game which I also loved immensely for it's true life impersonation of spooks in the sh#t. Nothing is ever what it seems to be and I'm sure heroes die all the time protecting the likes of you and me.

But, this time it seams that he asked his brother Tony Scott for some Directorial Guidance, so that this movie can look more gizmo-tic, and can feel like a Spy movie. So here comes the movie with a twist every 15 minutes, Satellite Views, conversation over Cell Phones and of course awesome piece of photography, with music resembling to ( Ridley Scott's ) Gladiator.The movie has got all the ingredients which makes it a full entertainer and a cutting edge thriller at the same time. And yes It will not waste a minute to tell the audiences that what is next, so if you miss a minute, you may loose some thing worth a ten minutes.Leonardo DiCaprio tried to be all like a Jason Bourne part 2, but alas his character was not meant to be like that. But he perfectly obeyed what the director asked him to do and a 10 out of 10 for him. Russel Crowe playing the "" fat piece of nothing"" type boss, giving orders on phone to DiCaprio boy, what to do next. He didn't appeared for quite a much time on screen but when ever he was there, he was the best among all.Roger Ferris versus Hani scenes were too good to be watched, they were to the point and fits best with story.And in between the movie we have two surprisingly great great performances, First one is Mark Strong playing Hani and the second is Golshifteh Farahani playing Aisha.Very noticeably worthy performances by the two.In between the dry and rough plot, the moisturizing romance between Ferris and Aisha felt soothing.Now Some thing about the plot.The movie is all about Roger Ferris, created as a one man army to go down to middle east and create a trap to capture Al Saleem. Ferris is following special orders from his Hoffman and (dis-)obeying them by heart. On the way to capture Al Saleem he has to travel to and fro between CIA headquarters and Middle east countries. After trying numerous times, when he is unable to produce some RESULTS, he creates a conspiracy and after that in next 30 minutes the movie is some thing near to brilliant.Watch for : Performance from DiCaprio and Russel Crowe.

Body of lies is two hours long but you'll never feel like movie is long winded, or never find some scenes boring and don't get at the end of the movie, why was there some dialog or scene. Although scenario is very complicated it is enjoyable to understand it all, well written, well directed, great actors all. Maybe DiCaprio was like DiCaprio always is and the same with Russell Crowe, but Mark Strong did good role.

251,tomhardesty-1,You'll see better but it's still good.,7,21 November 2008,"This review is from a person who did not know what to expect due to mixed reviews about Body of Lies.The film has great acting which is what surprised me the most about the negative reviews that I have read as the acting is pretty much flawless from the leads. The plot can become confusing at times but it was an enjoyable film.The sound effects department deserve a lot of recognition for the marvelous job they did. The sound effects in The dark knight, Transformers are a lot better but this does a great job. The cinematographer should also be noticed for the amazing job that he did.The film also boasts a torture scene that is all the more terrifying as it actually happens which makes it all the more believable. Not for the faint hearted then! The film did lack structure and it is a long way away from Black Hawk Down (The army scenes in a yellow filter sort of pay reference to BHD) but it's worth watching. It's just too bad that the films story is a bit of a mess as this had all the right tools for being the perfect action thriller.",Body of Lies
252,t-adorissio,Great Espionage Movie. Unique Flavour to the tradecraft !,9,28 December 2008,"I've always been intrigued by espionage films. Since the UK's 007, to America's Jason Bourne, to movies more realistic like Breach,The recruit,Enemy of the state & SpyGame.This movie channels along the same genre as 007 and Bourne, but those movies are more action orientated, where one man takes on all.However,Body Of Lies is more realistic, where the main character needs help, and is in danger, and finds solutions to problems instead of shooting away like Rambo.Unlike many of the other spy films it is staged in the middle east where they don't have technologies like the UK or USA, so they have their own way of passing and soliciting information. You still see satellites and and USA machinery, but it is only for a fraction of the movie.It is a very unique fresh take on the Spy Genre and is a must for all who have enthusiasm for the Tradecraft. Especially since today, the USA is in a war with terrorists in the middle east, and the political madness is portrayed in this movie.I gave it 9/10. I would give 10/10, but i felt the ending could have been built up slightly better. And i am critiquing harshly here,so Just watch it! Very Good movie!",Body of Lies
253,leventkacar05,so many facts...,10,3 February 2009,"This movie has a lot of messages for Americans and Muslims.The most important one is that not every Muslim is a terrorist( in fact just some of them are and I don't call them Muslim).As Di caprio told in the movie;The Quran forbids killing innocent people.Killing one innocent man means killing all of the men in the world is the most important message in the Quran.At this point,Al Qaida is not the servant or soldier of God but the servant of evil and the enemy of Islam.Al Qaida has given the worst harm and damage to Islam.We have to open our eyes and look around.generally in most American movies nearly all the Muslim characters were villain.But this movie set things straight.It showed that religion has nothing to do with terror.Di caprio was excellent again on the other hand.Apparently he had some Arabic lessons and his accent was really good.The adviser of the movie must be appreciated.he had done his work.I mean the meeting with the Arabic sister was all like real.A Muslim woman wouldn't shake hand with a stranger man.Event that was included and not as 'ugly' or 'bad'.but as a culture.Finally I must say everybody should watch this movie.",Body of Lies
254,actorAVENUE,A stellar action film that only tightens its grip!,9,8 February 2009,"by naturalACTOR- As a producer, you want your movie to make money, to be entertaining to its utmost ability. As a director, you want your movie, well, to be good. This movie accomplishes both of these things in a sensational fashion. It is one of the best action movies I have ever seen, thrilling the audience with swooping spectacles that are daringly breath-taking. It is fast-paced, and loaded with energy. Bullets are fired powerfully, and vehicles are exploded triumphantly. If one thing is certain, this is one hell of an entertaining film.On the other hand, William Monahan (The Departed) succeeds with a smart, in-your-face script that is Oscar-worthy. Brilliant, realistic camera-use comes together perfectly with edgy sound, creating a certain atmosphere. This movie dares to show how things in the middle-east are really like, serving plenty of realistic, almost scary action, and suspense, leaving the audience convinced, and thinking about what they just saw.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a fearless, no-holds-barred performance, a deep portrayal of patriotism and what it's like working as a CIA operative. He is very committed to his role, and is more than believable. He is raw, and real. He gets down to the point with this performance, and doesn't for a second let up. One of the things I was left thinking about after the film was DiCaprio's ruthless aggravation that he so greatly gave to his character, Roger Ferris. He is meant to be this way in this film, and you can't possibly think he could have done anything better.The performance and the film as a whole are probably the year's most underrated works. Ridley Scott delivers, with a knock-out of an action film, with drama and even some romance that draws eyes to the screen, in what is sure cinematic beauty on many levels.",Body of Lies

One thing that struck out was the fact that there a subtle comedy element matched very well with the darkness of the movie.Now to the actors, what we are witnessing is leonardo dicaprio at his peak. I don't what he's been doing, but lately his acting game has been on point. Before i used to hate him, but now i can't wait to see what he does next. Also, Russell Crowe is brilliant as pig-headed CIA controller ed Hoffman. And Mark Strong is deceiving as Jordan Intelligence Director Hani Salaam, when i say deceiving i mean to say that you would never have thought he was Italian.Theirs also a satisfying amount of action. If you like intelligent drama and action, this is the movie to see.",Body of Lies
256,mobilehead,A very good political thriller,9,22 October 2011,This movie is a completely new way of film producing. It is some sort of a new genre that was procured after all the bombing and terrorists' attacks around the world. Fast paced suspense and mystery around the main plot makes viewers thrilled and impatiently waiting for another turn of events. Excellent character played by Russell Crowe and very mature role of DiCaprio whom mostly I perceived as a young child able to play only in romances. The latter received more adult look thus making him being treated more serious which is extremely good! I recommend this movie to anyone who is fascinated by the things going around the Middle East. You will not be disappointed after this two-hour long movie.,Body of Lies
257,etteneo,Bold & Gripping Political Action Film that lends insight to US - Arab Security Issues,8,15 June 2013,"Ridley Scott, William Monahan and DiCaprio really deliver an insightful film here into the Arab-Middle East and US security issues. Whether CIA operatives and the people in Arabia really live like the movie depicts them is out of my humble understanding, but completely believable in the 21st century political and security climate. And there right there is why this film is helpful- it actually contributes to lending insight to the oft neglected and misunderstood Arab security situation and makes you believe that this is what exactly happens daily in the war torn cities, the infidels in hiding, the cartels running on oil money, the security teams and the players caught in the crossfire.The film succeeds as an action film on a small level with typical Ridley Scott pacing aplomb, but really succeeds in delivering a heartbeat through the subject material being handled with military respect and attention to detail. The sets, the sequences, even the street scenes from Jordan to the UAE and through Syria, are all utterly believable, and set the tone for the sombre and edgy nature of life in a war torn region. Yet, Scott doesn't leave it there, he actually bothers to take that heartbeat, and give it a soul. The film blends the realism of terror and war with an air of human fragility and tenderness as well as themes of affection and love, without overplaying or sensationalizing them. A lot of the credit for this is down to the actors, and Leonardo DiCaprio puts in a superb performance here, in being the pulse of the film in that he represents the ""ideal"" non-republican American who has post post modernist views on the war on terror and is willing to differentiate Arab culture, language and the people, from the terrorist infidels. Heck, his character even gets into a romance with the elegant and dignified leading female actress who brings an emotional depth to this piece. Crowe on the other hand, is juxtaposed as the republican traditional American with supremacist boy scout jabber, but still always being a good guy and man who just wants to be a good dad back home to his kids (who are clearly safe back in America but affected nonetheless- demonstrated well in a scene with soccer Mums and a great ""whatever"" comment from his baby girl). Scott excels and showing how American every day life is being defended by two types of American mindsets who are both fully committed in defending their nation as operatives. Whilst Crowe has no issue with lying and screwing the Jordanian intelligence partners of theirs over, DiCaprio is painted as being sympathetic to them; respectful, and even speaks their language (lines delivered well and all)!The actual plot is terrific, and without giving it away, actually has a really key plot arc in the middle, which really lifts it- when DiCaprio and Crowe come up with a great idea to catch the terror Jihadi leader, Al Saleem (brilliantly portrayed by an unknown actor who captures the parallels to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda superbly). All the other elements of a great plot are there- betrayal, intrigue, using a straw man (in the plot and then as a filmmaking technique), with very realistic intelligence community operatives' mannerisms, action scenes and even a realistic interpretation of the nuances of working with the Jordanians and the complexities of relationships and cross cultural understanding with Hami Salaam (another brilliant performance delivered with sleek cold yet powerful nuance by the actor). In fact, the screenplay by Monahan is as good as his work on The Departed, if not, better. Tight, pacey and never having anything in there that doesn't move the plot and characters and their motivation forward. This is Ridley Scott, Monahan and DiCaprio at their best, and really o form, they deliver a great political and yet gripping action film at the same time that will leave you feeling for DiCaprio as he gets tortured (emotionally and physically- viewers would be advised discretion on the final scenes), and yet really also resonate with the insightful commentary that is both political and social right through the film, and best summed up by DiCaprio's response to Crowe's comments that ""nobody likes the Middle East""; highlighting the root of the divide. It is great to see a film take a panoramic view of the situation and use juxtaposition between DiCaprio and Crowe to do some introspection on America's own divided attitude towards the Middle East, and to see that Scott really had something to contribute here, even if it was just a film. 8/10 Stars.By Stephen Thanabalan",Body of Lies
258,nido-03799,unrealistic stuff unfortunately,5,11 January 2018,"The movies was well made. I enjoyed it very much at the beginning then it starts to be dull. as an Arab who watched this movie I have some notes that I want to clarify, first it was stupid when leo said to the nurse are you Iranian and she didn't even talk enough Arabic so he could notice and even leo doesn't know that much of Arabic in the film.
2 there is no way to date an Arab girl as easy as shown in the film Arabs are so strict on their daughters especially when it comes to deal with men outside the family how about foreign man . 
3 Arabs community = male-dominant community so how come at Aisha's house there is no men at all if there would be a chance to still see this American men will get involve for sure.
4 women dont sit in coffee shops even with girlfriends in front of men like that
local and tiny coffe shops like that considered for men. 
5 I don't buy that whole story with leo and Aisha and how in this short while of knowing Aisha he became willing to sacrifice himself for her I don't think that any agent in reality would do that it makes no sense .
6 they are keep saying koskos as a name of a meal but the meal koskos is actually Moroccan not from Jordan.
7 this one is very naive see the scene where leo was about to die the Arabic man said death for the non believer blah blah blah then he says (tashahad ala rouhk)
that means say the shahada on yourself its an Islamic thing how u say that at him and he is a non beliver or christian or whatever. 
I hated these stupid yet important deatiles they should pay more attention after all the movie was very good but this semi ruined it.",Body of Lies
259,Kaaazingg_47,"Not a memorable Scott film, but still an entertaining movie.",7,18 February 2009,"I just finished watching this movie, and I must say I was quite disappointed. I think the biggest thing that killed it for me was my high expectations going in. Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors, and his movies Gladiator and Black Hawk Down are 2 of my top 5 movies I've seen. When I saw the preview for this movie last summer sometime, I was immediately excited. Crowe, Leo, Scott, together for a crackling action movie...this equation spelled success in my book. But now I know I should have never set my hopes so high, heres why:The good things: Ridley is a man who can set up his action sets perfectly. They were intense, brutal, realistic, and furthermore(sp?) engaged you into the film. The acting: Top notch. Crowe was excellent as always, Leo has become one of my favorite actors after Blood Diamond et al, and this movie is no exception. Visuals: another thing Scott does so well is set up amazing shots, esp. with overhead camera angles. The bad things: I mentioned above that the action was everything you could ask for, but this is also the movies curse. All the big exciting scenes are left at the beginning of the movie, where you barely have time to get caught up on what exactly it is these characters are trying to do. While the plot/goal of this movie wasn't necessarily to be an action movie, it def. set itself up to be which is why the rest of the movie sort of flounders. After a couple intense scenes, the movie slows down to become boring, tedious, and repetitive. Also, one thing that had Gladiator working so well for it, was that you cared so much for Crowe's character and the outcome that you were there till the end. In this movie, Crowe (while he was excellent) was just kinda..there. You really didn't care at all what his objective was or that he was trying to help Leo. And then there was Leo, and while he too was excellent, the narrative carried him along, but failed to get the audience to really understand what he was doing, and, like i already said, to care. I just didn't care for either of the two actors in this movie, which was a shame because they worked so well with what they had. Now, the biggest thing for me that I found sorely missed (and this could just be me and my opinion so don't take it too seriously) is the rousing and thundering score that was so predominate in other Scott films. In Gladiator and BHD, the score moved along with the picture and helped it flow, and gave it more excitement. In this movie, the score was rather...annoying...and didn't carry the scenes along as well as other pictures have.As you can see, the paragraph with the bad things is much bigger than the good things, but don't think its just a bad movie. This movie was a movie I somewhat enjoyed..but just once. I probably wont ever watch it again unless the occasion calls for it. I commend Scott and the actors for giving it their best, but unfortunately, this will be one of Scott's misfired movies, right there next to A Good Year. I give it a 7, because its worth a look. Sorry for the long post.",Body of Lies
260,krish_kartik,"Truth, Lies and Betrayal",8,19 October 2008,"Firstly when big names like Leonardo Dicaprio, Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott come together for a movie, the expectations are going to be sky high. So does the movie live up to them? The answer is YES.This movie seems like a planned innovative sequel to Scott's well made Kingdom of Heaven (2005).It starts off as a high octane thriller and the pace is retained almost very well. It does go into some subplots which do little to contribute to the main story but again the movie is redeemed by its strengths which covers up all the minor blemishes.The basic plot is about a CIA operation to uncover potential terror threats. Roger Ferris (Leo) is a CIA guy who has to dig the Middle East to hunt for a jihadi (read - terrorist) who has big terror plans and its his quest that makes up the story. Ed (Crowe) is his boss and is quite a cold opportunistic guy and the duo are on back slapping terms which make them a treat to watch. The strengths of the movie are :Leonardo Dicaprio and Russell Crowe (Their pairing works very well because of the dark humor and the absence of forcibly inserted confrontation scenes. Their chemistry rocks). Mark Strong - He excels as Hani (definately a nod for best supporting actor). The screenplay by William Monahan and David Ignatius is quite intricately woven and has a few holes (Read subplots). Cinematography by Alexander Witt and Editing by Pietro Scalia lends much to the gritty style of the flick. Last but not the least - the music by Marc Streitenfeld Now for the weaknesses :The Love interest of Leonardo Dicaprio, played by Golshifteh Farahani is quite a weak character and does nothing to move the story ahead. The second half of the movie drags a wee bit and can do with a little trimming of about 15 minutes.Also this movie deserves its R rating and there are some gory scenes and is not recommended for those with a weak stomach.All in all, a thought provoking action thriller and Scott scores again.",Body of Lies

Crow didn't appear much but he did a good job too and shows by his performance the stupid of the CIA with dealing with the world terrorism problem , a way from 007 foolish lies and all that silly characters and talking about the clever of CIA and how they are unbreakable and unmistakable , it didn't show America as always the biggest , the best and the hope, it shows the reality , AS an Arab man i felt this movie is very close from the truth , or say very very close.Really well done Scott",Body of Lies
263,mika-hakkinen-1,Best movie of the year!,10,14 October 2008,"Ridley Scott has done it again! There was never a chance of Body of Lies failing. Directed by Scott, written by Monahan, and with Crowe and DiCaprio in lead roles, it makes for a great experience. The movie may not be loved by all critics, but it sure does deliver! Russell Crowe, although playing more of a supportive role, I felt gave an amazing performance (as usual) - he was what he was supposed to be! And obviously DiCaprio who did great by all means as well. There's great chemistry between these two lead characters. Body of Lies is very much a Ridley Scott movie and this translates into the film's politics as well. Thing is, you can't leave politics out of a political movie; and so what do you do? Well, here's a newsflash for the poli-preachers on all sides: it's possible to have it all, and just watch Ridley Scott do it. Just like Kingdom of Heaven, it's all about even-handedness and realizing that (1) every side in a conflict has a point of view, which, to itself, is perfectly valid; and (2) every side has people you'd probably like and some you really wouldn't, (3) the way to peace lies with understanding (1) and (2); and not with having just one point of view, no matter how righteous it may appear. Both, Islamophobes and Islamophiles--or those on the extremes of any aspect of the political spectrum--will probably find ample elements to dislike about this film. Others of a more moderate and even-handed disposition will find much to like and appreciate.BODY OF LIES - this is the best movie of 2008 and no doubt worth seeing!",Body of Lies
264,dntmjr,Layers finally ...,10,23 October 2008,"I seldom see American films these days. I don't because they are products they've lost the charisma and the power, with fewer and fewer exception. This film instead is not just an exception, it's an important film, not only for his great technical qualities but because it talks about something important: Americans do not know how to fight a war, and they are incapable to accept criticism on this and other matters. In this story we can see it clearly through the different characters: Hoffman and Ferris. Hoffman is ""global"" while Ferris speaks the language and tries to understand how to do things. Hoffman needs to get results quickly, his way, yet he is unwilling to learn from his own mistakes. Ferris understands he will get results only adapting to the local factors and context. Their dialogs are not ""funny"" they are tragic. Why Hoffman does not understand? Because he believes there is no way but the American way. Therefore he fights but he does not need to understand his enemy. He looses but he never wonders what moves the enemy and why. Not knowing this points leads to defeat. It happened almost all the time after WW2. Machines do not win any war. But Americans seems to miss this point. Reading reviews and some comments here it feels as if the lines in the film, the scenes are ""just"" parts of a great action film. While to me the ""birds eye view"", the satellite images show me that watching and understanding what we see are very different matters. In the film it feels as if the watching happens but a proper usage of the images is just not there.Properly this film requires minimal knowledge of geography, international politics, cultural differences, poverty, and more. Too much for the standard American and his average education. This perhaps explains the poor success of this film: 31,757,483 ... not much. I was very sad when I left the cinema, because of the distinct message all over the film: ""we don't understand our enemy we are loosing but we aren't aware of it"". Yet I got sadder as I read the American reviews and the comments generally centred about the cinematic issues: acting, effects, story flow, when they got bored, how better it could have been if ... and so on. Not a word about the content behind the acting, the camera work and the script qualities ... what happened to your once upon a time great promised land? What is it?

Did Rid pull it off?Body of Lies is a smart political thriller on the state of some of the world's debacles, Some of the high points of the film were the action sequences which were very similar to the style of action sequences of ""Black Hawk Down"". The acting was also great. Personally i liked Crowe's performance more as a CIA head he was very dedicated to the role and put on 66pounds for it, he also had the Virginian accent down. But I thought that Leinardo DiCaprio was very similar to his role in the departed. (Watch when he is talking on the phone you will see what I mean) The cinematography was Grade A also.But the thing that impressed me most was the way Ridley Built up the story and tension not knowing who to trust, (obviously one of the themes of the movie) this brought me back to the days of ""Alien"" with the slow building atlosphere which made ""Alien"" one of the most respected films of all time. It was also a balanced look at the Iraq situation as it wasn't following the Anti-America trend but it also wasn't trying to justify the war.

266,palandu,Classic spy thriller,7,19 October 2008,"I went to watch this movie expecting a post-911 geopolitical spy movie(à la Syriana), however, it was quite different and i liked how it dispenses(mostly) with political messages common in movies nowadays and goes back to the roots of being a classic spy thriller.Extremely well made, with excellent acting on part of Leo DiCaprio playing the part of Roger Ferris,an American spy who has forgotten why exactly the war is being waged the way it is. His handler, Ed Hoffman(Russel Crowe) is in constant communication with him, reminding how ""no-one is innocent"". Mark strong plays Hani,the charismatic head of the Jordanian intelligence, cruel and calculating, an extremely likable character.Following multiple terror-bombings in Europe with warnings of future bombings on US soil the Americans with the help of Jordanian Intel are engaged in a furious pursuit to capture Al-Saleem, the fictional terrorist head of Al-Qaeeda.The direction and cinematography are very good as always with Ridley Scott, with breathtaking views of the Arab landscape and extremely detailed shots in the cities.In a nutshell the production,direction and acting in the movie is really good but unfortunately, it brings nothing new to the scene, the story seemed to lack a certain something and it could have been a little more believable at points.

267,saffarpour,Thriller for sophisticated viewers not teenage crowd,9,14 October 2008,"Body of Lies is an adult thriller with such a convoluted storyline that even a brief trip to the restroom results in key plot points being lost. It both demands and rewards thought. It involves current events and has a political viewpoint, but it overplays neither. It isn't going to find much favor among the teenage crowd but it is a motion picture that older, more sophisticated viewers hunger for. It is consistently well paced and it exhibits more of what we expect from a thriller: tension and suspense. There's nothing suave or dignified in the ways these characters interact, and the characters in this film seem like real people  not like James Bond.It is not exist only in the realm of fiction; it's possible that things like those depicted in Body of Lies are happening now in the real world. And probably that's why a distressful scene has been introduced late in the movie. Everything is well balanced and for that just one scene of levity and a little light romance have been added.None of the recent movies which focused on the current unstable geopolitical situation have done it as effectively as Body of Lies and almost none are as free of preaching.I am not going to talk about what are ideas behind the movie and if those are right or wrong or why a half Iranian nurse has been introduced as a lover into the movie. I am not going to highlights mistakes, like the accent of the nurse. Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) can tell that a nurse working in Amman is from Iran (and she says she is half-Iranian) based on her accent. Actually, Iranians are speaking Persian which a completely different language than Arabic  it is closer to English than Arabic from the linguistic point of view. But this half-Iranian nurse, who has grown up in Amman and speaks Arabic at home with her sister and Nephews couldn't have accent as a man with Persian mother tongue can have when speaking Arabic.Although Leonardo DiCaprio gives strong performance, I don't think he will be nominated for Oscar as a result of his work here, as he is not in line with what Academy is looking for, this will be same as what happened to him for Blood Diamond and The Departed.For those who love a thriller more than pointless car chases and over-edited fight sequences, Body of Lies offers a satisfying dose of mind stimulation and truth, where the viewer is not always two steps ahead of the characters.",Body of Lies

Body of lies is a political thriller adaptation of the 2007 book Body of Lies. In Body of Lies Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), a CIA agent goes to Jordan to track a high ranking terrorist. Throughout the movie the story constantly builds with action scenes that keep you guessing till the end of the movie. Overall Body of Lies is a thriller action movie that is worth while.",Body of Lies
273,manu-personal,One of the best movies on Middle East,8,22 March 2009,"This is one among the best movies I have seen on Middle East.As the name rightly portrays, the movie is about the big lies spreading across the world on the Middle East. I had been to middle east recently, and I could readily relate many scenes and situation in the movie to what I have seen and witnessed there. This movie is a bold move to bring some, but not all, truths into the vicinity of our knowledge.Why is it always the case that movies on middle east have dull yellowish frames, people wearing dirty, sometimes filthy,clothes,crowded and primitive market places ... I consider Middle East beautiful. Some of the places there can truly take your breath away.This is a true master piece.The cast was perfect, direction superb and the story relevant. This is movie is definitely going into my collection.",Body of Lies

Like, last 5 years, came across one or two movies of quality like this.Some says there is not action enough, the one that is there is excellent and remember able and in right place.The acting (rasing expectations)is equivalent to action part, so no need for extra action. The dressings as said by some experts, not really the one used in really life, doesn't really matter, because hardly anyone knows how it really looks, the one used is good enough to point out ""milion f****** miles away""",Body of Lies

Actingwise everyone was gud but the movie lacked the chilling quotient nd also the love track introduced wid Leo was not that convincing and shows the weakness of script.To me it was an average fair wid gud screenplay and worth watching once.",Body of Lies
276,pedro-235,Why is this a good movie?,3,1 June 2009,"Everybody says this is such a good movie and Ridley Scott did it again, and all that. Is this a good movie just because it was directed by Ridley Scott? Or starred by DiCaprio? The characters are somewhat hollow, almost random, the plot isn't very interesting and where's the action? The nurse - I see it as a character that exists only to justify some later developments but I, the viewer, don't create any kind of connection with her. Russell Crowe's character - boring! The nurse's sister and her kids, what are they doing there? The plot in general is very dissatisfying and I reached the end with the sense of having lost my time. My wife fell asleep. I didn't hate it but I was close. Or maybe I just missed the whole point.",Body of Lies
277,minky-9,Lame Lame Lame and more lame with some lame on top,1,30 June 2009,"Leo has pretty good movie choices so I have no idea what he was thinking when he agreed to do this one. Its a lame predictable good guys v bad guys with a random girl thrown in to make a bargain.It's lame and I wish I had read some reviews before I watched this. I hate two dimensional movies and absolutely no character development. I like the atmosphere of the movie but Leo as some CIA spy just doesn't fly, he's way to flamboyant and outlandish for this role and does not make it in the least believable. I don't know what happened here? This is like one of those Steven Segal movies LOLThis was really really bad and a waste of time.1/10 and 11/10 LAME",Body of Lies
278,tnster,Pointless American Bull,1,12 January 2010,"This is an American-Republican ''War on Terror'' propaganda wrapped  into a 2 hour long torture.  I can't believe how DiCaprio and Crowe took part in this piece of  garbage. The boring plot is pointing out the whole time how America is  the greatest ''Democratic'' nation in the world on a mission to save  mankind from the primitive suicidal terrorists in the Middle East.   After 3 minutes of viewing this patriotic masterpiece I thought it's  going to suck and predicted the ending in my head. And I was right,  twice.  I didn't care about the two annoying CIA protagonists, instead I wanted  them to get killed by an AK-47 bullet...  If you're an American viewer you will probably like this film and rate  it with at least 6 stars. On the other hand if you're anything but an  American you'll probably hate it as I do, because it stole and  brainwashed 2 hours of your life.  Enjoy.",Body of Lies
279,wesbroadway-639-558264,"Almost Clever, But Not Quite",3,20 January 2010,"Very hard to develop any attachment to any of the characters. Many of the characters just do not come anywhere near matching up to what one would reasonably expect from their types - especially the highly-intelligent and suspicious CIA spook who falls almost instantly for a girl he knows nothing about. The script simply fails to bring these characters to any point where I could emotionally connect with them, instead just allowing them to dangle along throughout the whole film. Due to this, I found it very hard to even think about entering the world as presented on the screen, it was simply too cluttered with lingering thoughts about what just happened, and why it didn't make any sense.Aside from that, the quality of cinematography is decent enough, although I'm certainly no buff in this regards. Sum total: The few almost-clever twists along the way simply couldn't rise above the noise created by a poor script.",Body of Lies
280,feck_off_cup,Nasty piece of propaganda.,1,16 May 2010,"'Body of Lies' is set in the same universe as FOX News and '24', a world that is divided into can-do-no-wrong Americans on the one side and savage 'Islamofascist' terrorists on the other. If you believe in that interpretation of reality, you might enjoy this film.It starts off with CIA man Leonardo DiCaprio hunting some 'terrorist' in Iraq. Leo's local asset and friend dies in an RPG incident involving more terrorists, but Leo survives to recuperate at a military hospital in Qatar.Meanwhile, a bunch of British Muslims blow up their terraced house in Manchester and the cops that were about to arrest them.Back in the States, Leo's boss Russell Crowe is giving a lecture about how the 'terrorists' are living in the Dark Ages: As opposed to the Americans, those crazies don't even use mobile phones, plus they all look the same.All this in the first ten minutes.The problem I have with this film is that its premise is utterly unoriginal. It's exactly the same establishment propaganda Americans are fed every time they turn on FOX News or CNN. Even if one were to generously view the title as self-referencing irony and the film itself as satire, the manner in which all these clichés are delivered is too dead-pan for this viewer to maintain that illusion.",Body of Lies
281,jsohlx-9-788177,I can't believe this move is rated this high,2,24 March 2011,"This is my first review. I feel I have to say something on how terrible this movie is. It's boring and really doesn't go anywhere. The ending leaves you thinking; really? I just wasted two hours of my life on this? I've watched some movies that where bad but this is unbelievable. If you want to watch a movie that leaves you wondering why bother, then this is the movie for you. If you like movies that have a point and an ending then this is NOT the movie for you.To each his own, I'm sure there will be people out there that think I'm nuts, but then again they'd be the ones that think the movies I like are crap. I saw the rating and figured this would be a good one to watch and honestly it's the biggest waste of time I've seen.",Body of Lies
282,imdbbob-194-814461,Ridiculously implausible and unconvincing,4,24 October 2011,"I agree that the acting was quite good here, and some of the plot was intelligent and interesting, particularly the Hani character. Ferris' moments with Hani are the only elements that support his emotional conclusion - you can see his respect for the culture come through. But this should have been supported by more positive modeling from the local characters.But overwhelmingly I could never escape a ""give me a break"" factor for Ferris' easy movement around enemy territory and his magical ability to take out huge numbers of foes unscathed (at least for the first 2/3 of the movie). And the ending was completely unconvincing. Really? He's going to stay there? Why - because he's been treated so well in the country? Even ""don't lie to me"" Hani has been lying and manipulating him.His relationship with the girl is never established. It's like he decides ""I think I'll fall in love with her"", because nothing she says or does would seem to explain the emotional bond that drives him at the end. She never really seems to show much affection or concern towards him beyond her professional duty as a nurse (and you have to wonder how well he's going to be received at the end, after putting her life into danger - particularly by the sister/guardian).",Body of Lies
283,michaelhagber,racist,1,5 February 2013,"If you enjoy bigotry and racism without reason then you'll love this movie. I didn't enjoy this movie, because of its negative portrayal of Islam. Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. The way the religion was portrayed was meant to send subliminal messaging to the masses, as the media has been doing since 9/11. This is more of a rant, rather than a critique of the movie. But i just wanted to make some points, that Muslims would like it if people believed in God Almighty but at the end of the day if someone wants to worship something else that's fine (everyone has the right to chose what they want in life). Secondly, for someone to commit suicide (by blowing themselves up for example) isn't a praise worthy action in Islam. Committing suicide, as Islam teaches, would cause them to go to Hell. And it is mentioned in the Quran that if you kill someone innocently, it would be as if you had killed the entire existence of humans - in sin. Therefore, to kill/blow yourself up, you would inevitably kill innocent people and therefore they would be a sinner and therefore go to HELL (as Islam teaches). So, this notion that Islam teaches to blow yourself up as a form of jihad is ridiculous. Jihad just means to struggle, which could mean many different things. If someone had a flat tire while driving on the freeway and had to fix their car that would be a form of JIHAD. If you don't have any food in your refrigerator that would be a form of JIHAD. Much more could probably said, but after watching the first 20 minutes of the movie i had to turn it off because it was filled with too many actual lies (no pun intended with the movie- Although one could argue that the BODY OF LIES was actually speaking of the BODY of this movie being FULL of LIES).",Body of Lies
284,MiltonAngelo,Possibly the Best Espionage Film,9,8 October 2008,"I can think of no greater political/espionage thriller. It was thrilling, the time flew by, the performances were strong, the cinematography at times stunning. The narrative complexity brilliant, and the sheer magnitude of locations and production value are stunning. Its utilization of modern technology will change the way future directors treat the genre. Of course it has its flaws as all works do on this earth, but this reamins a major achievement for many reasons. One interesting, but possibly not most important reason: Here is a man, Ridley Scott, nearly 71 years old, who has made a film with the vitality of a twenty-something. It's no wonder he's been knighted. I'm not even English, and I'd call him ""Sir"". The film-making team's nobleness in trying to show the beauty that exists in the middle east amidst the turmoil, especially through DiCaprio's love interest - who is pure with old-fashioned manners that exemplify a time that our American world of show, advertising and egocentricity has all but lost. How dare any critic not recommend this film? May I dare say only out of some personal bias, maybe a personal vendetta against Mr. Scott? For though this film is not perfect, no film is, and this one more nearly approaches that ideal than most others. Body of Lies is a masterwork that both highly entertains and contains great substance, transcending the fictitious world of cinema and inspiring the real earth world in its altruistic motive  the loving desire to more tightly bind a fragmented world - a rare feat in today's cinema.",Body of Lies
285,ravenjobe,Body of Lies (Part I & II),1,8 March 2009,"Body of LiesBy Mike V.Derderian, The Star, February 23, 2009 The title of this movie is an understatement; it should rather be ""bodies of lies"" piled up, not too far different from the photos of piled up Iraqi prisoners being humiliated and tortured by sadist marines and private US contractors at Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq in 2003.Here is a quick rundown of its utterly clichéd storyline: Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a CIA operative sent to ""Amman, Jordan"" to hunt down Islamist leader Al Saleem (Alon Aboutboul)no, not Al Gore! Ferris' superior is hammy Langley officer Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe). With the help of a very fictional and unbelievable Chief of Jordanian Intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), Ferris goes after the terrorist cell stationed in Amman.No sooner had Amman flashed on the black screen the moment Ferris arrived, I saw a city that I haven't been living in for the past 26 years. Where have all the olive oil trees gone! The so called ""Amman"" scenes were shot in Ouarzazate and Rabat in Morocco. Hey, did we switch countries after the New Yearcause nobody told this Jordanian! One more thing, the American embassy in Amman certainly looks different. Last time I passed by it in Abdoun there was no stadium behind; it but it was still heavily armed.Did Scott ever come to Jordan! Mind you if there were any Jordanian efforts involved in making this banal film they should be prosecutedperiod! By the way, the head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate wouldn't pour coffee to a guest even if it was Leonardo DiCaprio; they have employees to do that and are quite hospitable if you ever had the pleasure of visiting them.The dialog is as hackneyed as it gets. Obviously some clever person in the production team realized that Golshifteh Farahani, Aisha, the ""Jordanian girl"" Ferris meets, looked more Iranian than Jordanian so they decided to throw the following line to be delivered by Ferris himself, ""Are you Iranian? Your accent is Iranian?"" The person, who wrote this cinematic debacle and bad PR, David Ignatius (novel) and William Monahan (screenplay) should be banned from penning another script for the rest of their lives.They shamed their craft. ""Jordanian piece of Poontang""! Is this the proper way to refer to our Jordanian girls even if it is said by the most politically incorrect American operative-cum-character in cinema history. We might as well call every American girl we meet an easy scoretrailer park-white-trash-redneck-ready for bedding bimbo.Aside from the fanatics, who helped distort our image in the West and vice versa, Scott did a fine job in hiding the magnificence and beauty of our Amman under non-existent piles of cinematic scenesoops I meant trash.The artistic merits of this film are very minimal as is the accuracy of the research put into creating its storyline, architectural or geographical settings. ""I and the public know what all school children learn: Those to whom evil is done do evil in return,"" is a quote by W. H. Auden which appears at the beginning of Ridley Scott's movie.When you blow up someone's house, kill his children and take his land away, he will certainly avenge himselfit is called resistance. No one dubbed the French resistance terrorists except for the Nazis.My first question is: How did a movie that refers to our Hashemite Monarchy as ""Towel Head Monarchy"" get screened in Amman? According to the manager of a cinema in Amman it got edited and the edited version is available at the Audio Visual Commission (AVC)!Hollywood is renowned for discarding facts for fiction and any avid movie fan would know this and there are many movies that are filled with factual errors and fallacies that I will review in columns dedicated to this purpose.At the movies, one has to suspend his imagination the same way a trapeze artist suspends his partner; our hands are placed over our hearts in anticipation: When will he drop her? Body of Lies is the fallen trapeze artist and she is deadno longer satisfied with spandex wearing and gun totting villains with over-sized brains before and since the 9/11 events Hollywood opted for the Arab villain.In the beginning we had Nazis (World War II era), Russians (Cold War era), Palestinians (Palestinian-Israeli conflict era), back to Russians (James Bond movies era), Arabs (with Arabic- English accents in True Lies era), Aliens (probably of Arab ancestry) and finally Islamic Jihadists (post 9/11 era).Mind you Hollywood always hires Pakistani and Indian actors to play us. Thanks to unknown Arab actors, who provide their voices in those films, such callous villains materialize on screen and are forever ingrained in the minds of foreign movie goers.One of the painful things to watch in Body of Lies is when Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), the CIA operative sent to chase Al Saleem, meets up with Hani Salaam Pasha (Mark Strong), head of the Jordanian Intelligence in a place full of trashmountains of human waste amidst chaotic edifices. If you've been to Jordan you know we don't have mountains of piled up trash. We also don't have fliesOK, now I am lying.Aren't you sick of American producers, who take our own stories, tragedies and eventful lives and turn them into no more than bodies of lies like in this movie!On a finale note: Dear Mr Scott, just because you were not able to secure a shoot at the castle of Karak for your Kingdom of Heaven, at a reasonable price, doesn't mean you have the right to trash my country the way you did with your Body of Lies.",Body of Lies

CIA tries to take down a terrorist leader.. action / drama and thriller moments mixed to a enjoyable movie. There are quite many things to keep track so pay extra attention to the story. Overall a well done movie.With fantastic editing and a well-structured story, Body of Lies is a dark, gritty, and complex spy thriller.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a CIA agent undercover in the Middle East, gathering intelligence on an Al-Qaida terrorist network, negotiating and double crossing with both the Jordanian security service and his CIA superior (a very snaky Russell Crowe).
