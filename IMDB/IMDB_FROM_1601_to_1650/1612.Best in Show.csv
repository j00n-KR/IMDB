0,MartinHafer,It gets better and better with repeated viewings,10,10 November 2008,"This is the best of the films (so far) that Christopher Guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast. Previously, they'd made the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and following BEST IN SHOW, they made the very enjoyable A MIGHTY WIND. As for their latest, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less said the better.The film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. You follow these few chosen dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious ""Mayflower Kennel Club"". However, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. Amazingly, even though the characters are rather outlandish, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying--as decades ago I had some experience with dog shows and this is a VERY cutthroat group of people! My favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. I also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. However, the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from Fred Willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history. His comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid person--how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone's guess. The other contestants featured were also quite funny--the high-priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner, the country boy and his hound as well as Winkie's ""parents"" who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show.Despite the improvised style of film making, the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story--one that is NOT for dog owners only. Exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. Clever and consistently funny.By the way, try to find this on DVD as the extras were actually worth seeing. While a bit painful to watch, I loved seeing Harlan Pepper and his beach ball collection in particular!",Best in Show
1,SnoopyStyle,Wacky characters in mockumentary,7,3 August 2014,Christopher Guest and friends are now making a mockumentary on the dog show circuit. It's a whole bunch of wacky characters with their wacky problems and their wacky life. Everybody is doing a great job. Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins are the gay couple. Catherine O'Hara is married to Eugene Levy with his insane glasses. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are an uptight couple. Jennifer Coolidge is married to an old geezer and Jane Lynch plays her trainer. There is a big problem in this movie. The separate teams have a hard time getting together because they don't really function as a team. They are separate and they stay separate. It limits their interactions and limits the possibility of comedy. It becomes a series of the characters separate and talking into the camera with wacky stories or having a wacky time. It's not until halfway through the movie that the characters start getting together as they prepare for the dog show.,Best in Show
2,lee_eisenberg,not a dog at all,10,12 January 2006,"Functioning as a sort of midpoint between ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""A Mighty Wind"", ""Best in Show"" portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate. Some are weird, some crazy, and otherwise, but they all make the movie good. Director Christopher Guest is particularly funny as gay Harlan Pepper, very much trying to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara, and Bob Balaban also do great jobs (I can't imagine them not doing great jobs, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As someone who's never attended a dog show, this movie is my main exposure to them. They sure look neat.",Best in Show
3,jboothmillard,Best in Show,6,12 June 2007,"From director/writer Christopher Guest (one of the band members in This Is Spinal Tap, and acting in the film), and co-writer (and actor) Eugene Levy (American Pie), this is an interesting comedy with a hardly interesting contest, but it does actually become fun. Basically an array of characters from all walks of life, and all as unusual as each other, are preparing their dogs for the 25th Annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. A film crew is filming all individual contestants, and the judges, including Harlan Pepper (Guest), Gerry Fleck (Levy) along with his admirer Cookie Fleck (Home Alone's Catherine O'Hara), Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean), Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins), Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (American Pie's Jennifer Coolidge) and Buck Laughlin (American Pie: The Wedding's Fred Willard). There are some giggly moments of dialogue, and small gross or silly comedy, and the winner of the contest is almost obvious, but worth it. It won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, and it was number 30 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Good!",Best in Show
4,ccthemovieman-1,"A Bit Sleazy, But Very Funny",8,25 October 2006,"Considered by many who have watched all three of Christopher Guest's ""mockumentary"" films as his funniest, ""Best In Show"" is guaranteed to evoke a number of laughs and offend someone.This is a typical modern-day comedy meaning that sex jokes dominate and there is both a gay and lesbian ""couple."" So, if you've heard this is about dog shows, don't rush out and rent this and watch it with the kiddies. It is anything but family fare.Yet, despite all the sleaze factor - and there is a lot of it - I still found this ""charming,"" for some reason. The laughs range from crude to subtle and the characters who enter their dogs in professional shows are really the subject of exaggerated ridicule here: from Yuppies to gay men to redneck hunters to dog trainers to nerdy types to whatever. No one pictured in this movie is a healthy, normal person. Everyone is ""whacked"" to some degree, except the announcer. However, his sidekick, the color man (played by Fred Williard) is brutal! The message, obviously, is that some people just take their pets a little too seriously!",Best in Show
5,rmax304823,"Successful comedy about a dog show, sometimes very funny.",7,16 October 2007,"Diverse people travel to Philadelphia to show their dogs and vie for championship, and we tap into all the relationships. Let's see. There's the argumentative, spoiled Yuppie couple. The taciturn guy from the Southern bait shop. The affable trailer-trash couple from Fern City, Florida. The lesbian couple who show their manicured poodle, ""White Rapsody."" The gay couple who are way out of the closet.It's well directed by Christopher Guest, has sometimes extremely amusing dialog and situations written by Guest and Eugene Levy, and is acted to perfection. It's done quietly though and hardly seems scripted at all, a kind of comedy verite in which performers sometimes speak directly to the camera while evidently being interviewed. There's a quiet, semi-documentary feel to the film.I can't go through the whole thing without spoiling some of the gags but I want -- no, I NEED -- to mention specifically some of the exchanges between the two commentators we see, probably speaking on the radio. Fred Willard and Jim Piddock play roles we're all familiar with from talk shows. Willard takes the part of the talk-show host, asking naive questions and making what he thinks are amusing comments, taking the role of the audience. Piddock, with a serious mien and Brit accent, is the expert who supplies precise knowledge and answers the host's dumb questions.The dogs are trotted out one by one to be examined. One of the dogs is hoisted onto a table and examined manually by the judge. Willard: ""The judge here is Eddie Franklin."" Piddock: ""I believe that's Edie Franklin, Buck."" Willard: ""Oh, yeah. It's a woman alright. What's she doing now, Trevor?"" Piddock: ""I believe she's examining the animal's testicular area."" Willard: ""Oh, Wow! I'd hate to go out on a date with Edie! Can you imagine? You're on a date with Edie and --"" Just one more. A judge picks up the dog's tail and examines it. Willard: ""I'd hate to be handled like that, Trevor. I really hate it. You know, I once said to my proctologist, why don't you take me out to dinner sometime?"" Stop me, please. Piddock: ""The judge was trained for the priesthood, I understand. Of course he didn't finish. Dropped out after one year."" Willard: ""No KIDDING? Boy, it would be interesting to find out what went wrong there. But I guess that's a whole nother show, eh?"" Some of it is more silly than funny. Eugene Levy has two left feet. But that's nothing compared to the many comic scenes that connect so squarely. It all ends happily in a couple of filmic postscripts. At the beginning we see the Yuppie couple complaining that their ""child"" is interfering with their sex lives, and the camera shows us their bored Weimerener. By the end, the couple tell their counselor that their sex lives are now terrific and the dog isn't a bother at all. ""She likes to watch."" Meanwhile their second ""child"", a bulldog, is humping the counselor's leg.You really ought to see this.",Best in Show
6,BA_Harrison,"Not 'Best of Breed', but still very funny.",7,17 February 2018,"While not as brilliant or as quotable as This Is Spinal Tap, writer/actor/director Christopher Guest's character driven mockumentary Best In Show-which is centred on the world of dog shows-still has plenty of wonderful, well-observed moments of dry wit, and is one of those films that I believe can only improve with repeat viewings.The film owes much of its success to its superb cast: Guest plays Harlan Pepper, redneck owner of a prize bloodhound; Eugene Levy is superb as buck-toothed Gerry Fleck, husband to Terrier owner Cookie (Catherine O'Hara), who has been around the block a lot more times than her dog; Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey are the neurotic yuppie owners of a pampered Weimaraner; Jennifer 'Stifler's Mom' Coolidge plays Sherri, rich owner of a champion poodle, while Jane Lynch plays her lesbian dog trainer; and Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins play a camp gay couple who are showing their Shih Tzu. Meanwhile, Fred Willard shines as the hilariously un-PC co-host of the dog show, whose every remark is a howler.7/10, but this rating may well go up in the future.",Best in Show
7,moonspinner55,Dryly outrageous satirical humor...presented and performed with a loving bite,7,4 April 2009,"Philadelphia is home to the 125th Annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show, which brings out several colorful couples and their prize pooches for competition (the prize, a silver cup, is big enough to take a sponge-bath in). Mockumentary extraordinaire! Endless pithy witticisms from actor-co-writer-director Christopher Guest, whose troupe includes some really marvelous talent, all of whom get a chance to shine here. Occasionally, the targets are flabby or obvious (lots of 'bitch' jokes and a labored marital spat over a squeeze toy), but otherwise this is right on target. The outré humor which coated Guest's ""Waiting For Guffman"" in 1996 (and had, at times, a sour residue) is toyed with here in a much more loving way. I got the feeling Guest genuinely liked this group of characters better than the ""Guffman"" bunch; and though he does poke and prod at them with his camera--and encourage his actors to go all the way with the material--the nimble editing never wears them out, and the picture does not overstay its welcome. *** from ****",Best in Show
8,Quinoa1984,A good fakeumentary,9,6 October 2000,"Christopher Guest's Best of Show follows his great tradition of fake-documentaries which includes This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman.  This time, he takes a poke at dog shows, which is something no one has done before (I think).  Here, he shows 5 different contenders (including himself which is one of the great parts of this film).  Other contenders include Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey and in a exceptional effort as a man with 2 left feet, Eugene Levy (he also co-wrote the script with Guest).  Often very funny, sometimes poignant, and like all of Guest's projects, never dissapointing, only liability might be that it isn't for all tastes (but hey, not everyone found 11 on a sound stsyem great either which seems odd).

9,Hey_Sweden,"""He went for her like she's made out of ham.""",8,3 September 2019,"""Best in Show"" was the second of a series of ""mock-umentaries"" by a talented comedy ensemble, directed by Christopher Guest (a.k.a. Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap). Officially written by Guest & co-star Eugene Levy, it was also heavily improvised, like the other films, and as such, it has some humour that is uproarious and some that doesn't work so well. But when this movie has a good joke, it's a riot.The film basically pokes light fun at the various dog owners that enter their beloved pets into the prestigious Mayflower dog show. Harlan Pepper (Guest) is a fly fishing store proprietor with a bloodhound, Gerry and Cookie Fleck (a hilarious Levy and Catherine O'Hara) have a Norwich terrier, gay couple Stefan and Scott (Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins) have a Shih Tzu, Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge), the trophy wife of a much older man (Patrick Cranshaw), has a standard poodle that is handled by Christy (Jane Lynch), and Meg & Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock) are a combative yuppie couple with a Weimaraner.These are our main characters, but there are also plenty of funny characters in the margins, as well. Fred Willard is hysterical, as always, as one of the two dog show emcees (the other played by Jim Piddock, a good straight man to Willard) with some priceless off-the-cuff remarks. And Larry Miller plays a hostage negotiator with whom Gerry and Cookie stay along their journey. He's a hoot when he has to talk his son down from a garage roof. Together with Levy, they provide the brightest moments in the movie - not that everybody here isn't great. The Swans are definitely unlikeable types, though, which makes it kind of hard to laugh at them.And the dogs themselves, of course, are endearing, especially that little pooch Can. Ch. Urchin's Bryllo (where do people come up with these names?) that plays Winky the Norwich terrier, and Ch. Quiet Creek's Stand by Me as Hubert the bloodhound.Overall, a bright, zippy (only clocking in at a trim 91 minutes), and engaging comedy - good for comedy fans (and dog lovers) in general, but particularly worth catching for any fan of these performers.Eight out of 10.",Best in Show
10,lastliberal,Why have I missed these films?,8,6 May 2007,"So who was the ""Best in Show?"" Was it the incredibly neurotic Meg Swan (Parker Posey). I mean, can you believe how she went ape over that bee toy? Can you believe that she or that husband of hers (Michael Hitchcock) should ever be allowed to own a dog? How about Gerry (Eugene Levy) and Cookie (Catherine O'Hara)? I was just cracking up over how he had to deal with her promiscuous past.Then, there is Scott (John Michael Higgins) and Stafan (Michael McKean). Naturally, they would own the Shih Tzus. Scott's costumes were too much, but they were supposed to be. I cracked at the line: What Shih Tzus need rescuing anyway? You don't see Shih Tzus straggling around the streets in an old coat ""help, alms for the poor"".The repressed lesbian, Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge) and her new partner Christy (Jane Lynch), who said, ""The heart and the soul which was what my mom did, that was her role, she was there for the unconditional love and it worked for my family, you know... until my mom committed suicide in '81."" Or, was it Harlan (Christopher Guest), who looked just like his dog. Do people still do ventriloquism? Best in Show? It goes to Buck (Fred Willard). He was a hoot, and he didn't even have a dog! You can be sure that I will be watching the other mocumentaries to see these actors again.",Best in Show
11,Boba_Fett1138,Some good fun to watch.,7,15 March 2008,"If you like a more subtle comedy, this is a great movie for you to watch. It features a wide variety of a bunch of odd characters and a main story situated around a dog-show.Well, to be honest, there isn't really much story in this movie actually. It's a fake documentary, or mockumentary, focusing on the world of dog-shows and their owners. The first halve of the movie mostly consists out of fake interviews with the characters about them and their dogs, while the second halve concentrates more on the travel to- and the actual dog-show. The movie is not always made credible as a fake documentary because of its way of filming, editing and overall story-telling, so the movie is more stuck somewhere between a mockumentary and just a subtle comedy. Not that this makes the movie any less fun to watch though. It's obvious director Christopher Guest tried to make his own ""This Is Spinal Tap"", a movie and early fake documentary he was involved with previously as an actor, song writer, composer and writer. He also does all of those things in this movie by the way and then some more as well.It's obvious director and writer Christopher Guest let his actors do a whole lot of improvisation and gave them lots of room to play. At times he just lets the camera role and let the actors do their thing. They come up with with things at times as they just go along. Some of the actors handle this better than the others. I think this is because every actor is itself is very individualistic and want to do things their way, which is not always possible when the actors opposite you is having a monologue concerning the other actor opposite and all you can do is respond to it and just go along with the other actor. Some actors on the other do know how to handle this and go along perfectly with it, such as for instance Eugene Levy. Who must have really enjoyed his improvisations was Fred Willard, as the commentator of the big dog-show. Man, some of the stuff he says is absolute great and hilarious.The characters and the sort of not everyday and sort of odd background story of a dog-show is what makes this movie work and fun to watch. It's a real subtle sort of comedy that doesn't try to be funny in a forced way but let the actors and characters be the center of the movie its comedy instead, without trying to make them look too funny and more real and humane like, despite all of their oddness's.It's a fun in-between movie to watch, just like this was a fun in-between movie to make for the actors involved I'll bet.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Best in Show
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pretty good satire on 'dog people' and common issues,8,12 March 2005,"When I sat down to watch this, I really didn't know what to expect, but I had spotted a good bit of small names in comedy on the cast list, so I thought 'what the hey, it might be good'. Turns out I was right. It's a great film, with plenty of commentary on dog lovers and various general issues(there is some great dialog between Eugene Levy and his wife regarding how much she dated before she met him... great stuff). The plot revolves around a dog show, and we see the various characters(read: dog lovers and friends) either going to it or talking about it. The acting is all very good, there really wasn't any performance I found anything less than satisfactory. The characters are well-written, credible and realistic, human. The dialog is real and funny. The dog lover stuff is funny, but possibly slightly clichéd or stereotypical, but never overly so. I know I laughed every time a character talked to or about a dog as if it was a human being that could understand everything it was told, instead of simply an animal that is easily trained. The film is a treat for anyone who thinks animal lovers are somewhat ridiculous and/or any fan of any of the comedians and comic actors in the film. I recommend it to anyone who finds dog lovers particularly amusing and knows of(and enjoys) at least one of the actors in the film. 8/10",Best in Show
13,view_and_review,Best in Show a Good Show,7,9 July 2007,"Who knew? I mean, who knew that a movie about a dog show could be so good? Now, of course the dog show itself was relatively insignificant and was only a small part of the movie, but it is what the entire movie was centered around. The movie was made by the characters though. Boy those were some funny characters. Even though I'm not a dog lover or owner, I've seen enough to know that some of those characters were spot on with their antics.While I'm praising this movie, I would be remiss if I didn't give props to Eugene Levy for co-writing this movie. I didn't check to see if this was his first writing project, but this certainly was a good one for the old resume. Write on Eugene, this was a funny flick.",Best in Show
14,evanston_dad,Best in Show? Not Quite.,6,23 July 2010,"""Waiting for Guffman"" may just be my favorite comedy of all time; hardly a scene goes by without a dozen hilarious little lines and moments. It would, therefore, have given me nothing but pleasure to report that ""Best in Show,"" the first of Christopher Guest and ensemble's attempts to recapture the blissfully goofy chemistry of that earlier effort, was a rousing success. Unfortunately it's not. There are quite a few amusing moments, but the film never inspired in me much beyond a modest chuckle.Mostly to blame, I think, is the fact that Guest enlarges his ensemble too much, with the result that no one really has enough screen time to create full characters with personalities of their own. The film feels much more episodic, and the actors even more than in ""Guffman"" play caricatures rather than people.Still, these complaints will probably only pose a problem -- or at least problems to the same extent -- if you are as much a fan of ""Guffman"" as I am to begin with.Grade: B",Best in Show
15,Sylviastel,A great effort!,10,15 July 2003,I have to say that this movie recently aired on Comedy Central and it was addictive to watch couples with their dogs at this Westminster style dog show in Philadelphia. It is great cast with Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara paired again in another Christopher Guest film. Levy and O'Hara were wonderful and sweet as the small town odd couple with their dog. Parker Posey was wonderful as the yuppy wife. Jennifer Coolidge and Jane Lynch provided some laughs. Even Chris Guest played a part as well as directed and co-wrote with Levy the script. There are very few quality films especially something satirical and wonderful as this film. It's worth watching! I loved Ed Begley Jr. as the hotel manager.,Best in Show
16,Mr-Fusion,"Liked it the first time, loved it the second",8,11 November 2021,"Christopher Guest is a comedic treasure. Not only does he know just how to ""mockument"" the truly mundane (in this case, the show-dogs and their weirdo owners) but his characters are always so run-of-the-mill yet bizarre; they're either out of touch or wacky Midwesterner; people you can't help but laugh at. With Best In Show, it feels like he's playing that to the hilt and I think it's my favorite movie of his as a resultThis is an ensemble cast in the best sense, a group of people perfectly at home with the material -- clumsy, ordinary and awkward -- yet they utter some of the most ridiculous things. I don't think I could stand to be around any of these people, but they kept me in stitches the entire time. The only person I can really single out is Fred Willard, and it's because (I have no doubt) he was let loose as the competition's sportscaster and improv'd the whole thing. The guy doesn't let up!",Best in Show
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,Just great!,8,17 December 2005,"You know, this movie reminded me so much of so many people I know, I think that's the reason why I loved this movie so much. I was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it, but the dialog is so hilarious, that you can't help but have a good time. Basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best. Whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously, it turns out the owners are just as insane. Megan, one of the dog owners, goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog.There is another couple that is just great, Gerry and Cookie, this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable. In the beginning of the movie, Gerry describes how many boyfriends Cookie had. Throughout the movie, her ""lovers"" see her and hit on her even in front of Gerry! It was just great and fun to watch Gerry's looks. This whole movie is just a hoot, and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up. It's a great movie is just fun to watch, I'd highly recommend it! Now, I have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. :D 8/10",Best in Show
18,=G=,Grrrr! Woof!,7,15 May 2001,"""Best in Show"" is a mockumentary spoof of one of those things which people do but which most outsiders can only view with raised eyebrows and quizzical looks askance: The championship dog show. This cute lampooning of the complete dog lover looks at a handful of stereotypes (gays, yuppies, a good old boy, etc.) and their pooches as they prep for, converge on, and participate in a dog show spectacle.

19,Red-Barracuda,Well-acted character-driven comedy,7,12 January 2016,"This is Spinal Tap (1984) is in my humble opinion perhaps the greatest comedy film ever made. By making it so good, its creators simply set the bar so high, no one else – themselves included – have subsequently ever been capable of reaching its heights ever again. So it's not really much of a criticism in pointing out that Best in Show is not as good as Spinal Tap. It is a satire on the kind of people who participate in championship dog breeding. The events revolve around a gathering called the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. There isn't really too much of a plot-line here, it's very much a character-driven comedy. It works because the actors in the ensemble cast are all adept at improvised comedy, so it's a film full of little moments rather than a major story arc.Spinal Tap's Christopher Guest directs as well as acts in this one. He certainly has a feel for the mockumentary genre and has contributed to many of the best ones out there. I would probably describe Best in Show as amusing rather than hilarious though. There are a few laugh-out-loud funny moments though, such as the scene revealing the man with two left feet; while virtually every line uttered by the TV commentator played by the excellent Fred Willard is comedy gold. Truthfully, mixed in with the best material are some more strained jokes. However, as a whole, it works pretty well and the talented cast elevate the material when it falters on occasion. All-in-all, a solidly enjoyable movie.",Best in Show
20,thesar-2,Show Me the Mutts,8,29 August 2021,"Pitch Perfect? Well, close.I love Improv. It shows extreme talent and genius. About half-way through this, I had to google how much of this was Improv as I thought it was funny, but not as hilarious as I imagined it would be. Once I learned how much was made up on the spot, I was (more) onboard.In this famous mockumentary, we'll follow people I would never, ever...EVER...want to meet in real life. Dog handlers ascend to Philly for the 125th Annual Dog and No-Pony show and it really is fun watching these incredible actors make up the movie as they go along. The commentators stole the movie for me and the couple who won was my pick. So, yea me! I mean them.All the way through this, I kept thinking of Pitch Perfect which HAD to be inspired by Best in Show. Hell, they both starred John Michael Higgins. Some of my favorite bits from both movies were the commentators. In this movie's case it was Fred Willard, the real star of this movie (Catherine O'Hare a very close 2nd, Jane Lynch in 3rd place) and his absolutely hilarious commentary. Nice they gave the job over to John for Pitch Perfect, which I suspect he learned a lot from Fred's brilliance.Full disclosure, I can't stand these types of people. Not sure how close this movie represented them, but I have zero interest in people using animals to make themselves feel better. I have a movie critic friend who feels the same about pompous writer characters and now I understand him a little more.Again, not AS hilarious as I thought it would be, but I did laugh a lot and enjoyed it for a pretty high recommendation.***Final Thoughts: The other movie(s) that came to mind was the fantastic Lethal Weapon franchise.

21,paul2001sw-1,Highly commended,7,24 March 2004,"Christopher Guest's 'Best in Show' may not be an all-time champion, but it is funny, the most important attribute for a comedy.  A mock-documentary look at the world of dog shows, there's no plot and it hits at easy targets, but it's full of essentially daft gags delivered absolutely deadpan. The ghastly self-absorbed characters can't really command your sympathy, but their petty awfulness rings horribly true. 'Best in Show' is not as outrageous as Guest's earlier film, the classic 'This is Spinal Tap', but the conjunction of solemnity and silliness works very well, and like that film, it actually convinces as a picture of its world.",Best in Show
22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A straight-laced interpretation of an absurdist's dream.,7,24 June 2018,"'Best In Show (2000)' is a 'mockumentary' that doesn't really let its style get in the way of its story - never being about the making of itself in the meta way a lot of examples of the genre are, for instance. It uses its subtle but sure style to keep its colourful cast of sometimes quite absurd characters framed with a consistently realistic lens. The film is remarkably funny, with many more gags landing than falling short. Though some mention has been made of its supposed 'cruel spirit', I feel that it's satirical in a rather endearing way, taking its bumbling but lovable cast and making them be the deliverers of the comedy rather than necessarily the focus of it. This makes for an entertaining, if simple, tale that is never unexpected in its narrative but is often unexpected in its humour, a wonderfully straight-laced and realist interpretation of an absurdist's dream. 7/10",Best in Show

Guest shows that he learned a few things about making mocumentaries from his starring role in ""This is Spinal Tap."" While this is not as funny as that Rob Reiner film, it is a lot of fun.

Well I saw it last weekend on TNT... very amusing as they were doing this ""home makeover"" type thing where they were putting all kinds of stuff in someone's backyard for their dogs, and the people on the program were basically just as fake and lame as anyone in the movie. Anyway, fake and lame describes almost every character in this movie with the exception of Guest's startling performance as Harlan Pepper. I feel like in a lot of ways the people being lampooned were played too heavily, especially the yuppie couple with Parker Posey. Their act was very funny at first but it wore thin much too fast for me. Likewise all the jokes about Catherine O'Hara's character being promiscuous. The first was hilarious but they kept pounding it into the ground.All in all I feel the love for this film is somewhat displaced. I didn't enjoy it as much as ""Waiting for Guffman"" or even the later ""Mighty Wind"". But I've never owned a dog so maybe I'm missing some of the humor.",Best in Show
27,meeza,Best Doggoned Laughs!,9,14 July 2001,"Take out your pomeranian pom-poms and cheer for one of the best comedies of the year `Best In Show'. This boisterously entertaining film is about the world of dog shows and its zany participants (I am referring to the owners not the dogs.) The films stars Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, John Michael Higgins, Catherine O' Hara, Fred Willard, and Michael Mckean. Guest also directed the movie. Guest's films have always satirized and mocked a certain profession or event. And `guest' what? It is no different in `Best In Show'. He not only does a masterful job in directing the film, but also executes one of the most hilarious performances of the year. It will be no surprise if Guest is invited to attend the Oscars as a nominee in the near future. Willard, who plays the dog show commentator, was very comical and sarcastic, and it is the best-doggoned work he has ever done in his career. Higgins, who plays a gay dog owner, unleashes one of the best homosexual performances of all time. His acting was definitely doggie-style! Posey, who is one of the most underrated actresses around, proves again why she is the great acting dane of independent films. So get out of the doghouse and take a bite out of `Best In Show.' ***** Excellent",Best in Show
28,drqshadow-reviews,"Roundly Funny, But Unusually Shallow",6,11 January 2012,"Christopher Guest and his regular cast of improv legends tackle another unsuspecting target in this wild-eyed send up of the competitive dog show circuit. It's a bit more all-audiences than Spinal Tap, while completely skipping the emotional hooks of A Mighty Wind or Waiting For Guffman, but still delivers enough legit snickers to validate a simple retirement as late-night cable network filler. The straight-ahead plot never shows much interest in progressing beyond simple character-driven adventure, and while each member of the cast is good for a smart punchline or two, the roles themselves are universally shallow, narrow caricatures. Fine as a background flick, thrown on to fill the air when your focus will be frequently elsewhere, it will never quite reach the same level as its siblings.",Best in Show
29,slokes,Blue-Ribbon Improvisation,8,3 August 2007,"We open with Meg Swan (Parker Posey) and her husband Hamilton (Michael Hitchcock) as they tell a psychologist about the time Beatrice caught them in the act of making love, ""the Congress of the Cow,"" Meg explains with obvious discomfort. The two fear Beatrice will never forgive them.The camera pulls back to reveal Beatrice is a Weimaraner, lying on her own miniature coach and clearly overwhelmed by something, whether the sight of her two owners having sex or just living with them in general. Thus begins ""Best In Show"", a free-wheeling comedy about dogs and the people who exhibit them at a Westminster-style national competition.While a lot of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Second City""-type comedy actors got their start in improvisational theater, former National Lampoon Lemming Christopher Guest has preserved this early 1970s ""do-it-yourself"" aesthetic on screen while others settle for the comfort of a finished script. What his films lack in plot they make up for in character. ""Best In Show"" can take patience; it's more sneaky-funny than funny-funny, which was the case with the previous improv-comedies Guest was involved in, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and ""Waiting For Guffman."" ""Best In Show"" isn't as great as ""Spinal Tap"" but it may have the most lived-in feeling of any of his films. There's a lot of lines that sound bare in isolation but are comedy gold in context:""He went after her like she was made of ham."" ""What are you, a wizard, a genius?"" ""I woke up, I was so glad."" ""Someone's still a little jealous...How many years ago did he poke me?"" ""She looks like a cocktail waitress on an oil rig."" ""No, that's a bear in a bee costume."" ""We both have so much in common...We both love soup."" ""Getting the smell of cumin and charcoal out of the drapes was a chore onto itself."" ""A little secret of the trade: They all jump.""There are punch lines and outrageous situations, but it's the characterizations that make this film special, even for people who think they know the Guest ideal from his earlier films. Leading the charge is John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean as a gay couple with a prize Shih Tzu they lavish excess love upon. The camp value of the two is high; yet they have so much depth and kookiness you wind up enjoying their company even when Higgins' Scott character isn't cutting up with some outrageous remark about sausage membranes. The other characters present us with various levels of subtlety and outrageousness, but Higgins and McKean give us both.Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara meanwhile give the film much of its heart as a financially-strapped couple who believe their Norwich Terrier can win the big prize, even if they have to live in a janitor's closet to make it happen. Fred Willard is the skunk at the picnic as an ex-baseball-player TV commentator who clearly took too many fastballs to the head. Guest himself ironically plays the least interesting character, a Carolina bloodhound man with a side interest in ventriloquism. But like all the other gifted actors on display, he brings something to the party.A cult film that deserves its cult, ""Best In Show"" is a joy for dog-lovers and film-lovers alike.",Best in Show

A colorful group of characters make the movie even more enjoyable. A moc (doc)umentary about people, their dogs, and the strange, but very funny lives they live. Done with such a small budget and no giant stars attached, it makes you wonder what excuse Gili had when it ""tanked"" at the box office. A great movie no matter who you are. Almost as funny as This Is Spinal Tap, which also starred Christopher Guest. Both films play off the ""real"" feel as a documentary and capture real moments from fake people.",Best in Show
31,Agent10,The frightening truth behind dog shows!,9,30 April 2002,"This film isn't a comedy, its an expose. I've always hated dog shows, considering the ridiculous get-ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them. Hence, the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this film. I get a kick out of something being taken so seriously, even though the gains are small and insignificant. It's like miniature golf, or jump roping championships or the need to set some obscure world record. The acting was much more refined in this film than Waiting for Guffman, and its mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters, who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous. Eugene Levy was great, as was Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, it was the dogs who eventually stole the show.

If I am on my way home, I don't like thinking 'oh, yeah, I saw a movie' - ideally, the movie is still on my mind and not just an after-thought.  This is too slight to make much of a lasting impression.Out of the large cast, the only person who bothered me was Fred Willard, who got tiresome after the first dozen wise-cracks.

After watching the film itself, I was left wondering why some weren't spliced into the finished product, since ""Best"" isn't nearly as good as ""Guffman"" or Christopher Guest's previous foray into 'mockumentaries,' ""This is Spinal Tap."" What we're left with is a fitfully funny, faux behind-the-scenes look at dog competitions with characters that lack the authenticity of the small-town performers in ""Guffman"" and the washed-up metalheads of ""Tap""--these people (down to Eugene Levy's 2 left feet and Parker Posey's braces) smack of artificiality.

35,Spleen,"The more movies there are about dogs, the better",7,12 February 2002,"A hard movie not to like.  I liked it in large part because of the dogs. And I've finally analysed my vague feeling of dissatisfaction: there aren't enough dogs.The camera focuses only on the dogs whose owners we follow; even during the competition itself, we have to strain our eyes to catch a glimpse of any others.  And the central dogs (shih tsu, bloodhound, Weimeraner, Norwich terrier, and one of those enormous white poodles that have somehow been transformed into toys) scarcely have any personality at all.  Bad mistake: the less personality the dogs have, the less their owners have.  It's lucky that at least some of the owners have so much anyway.  (The best of them is Eugene Levy's Fleck - a gauche yet humane man who isn't so much jealous of his wife's former lovers, as sick to death of running into them.)I suppose the jokes could have been zinged up a bit, too - making a film out of improvised humour is probably a mistake, even when the improvisations are this good.It's still funny.

And I really don't know why. I'm a huge fan of clever, understated humor, but I can't get past being mildly entertained by those of Guest's films that I've seen.I will say that I enjoyed Best in Show more than This is Spinal Tap. Mainly because you don't have to know very much about dog shows and owners to enjoy the jokes. Spinal Tap relied heavily on being around during that time period and knowing a bit about the subject matter. That's great if you match those criteria, but not so swell for me.Best in Show benefits from being about something that inherently has a lot of potential for humor. I mean, it's about a DOG SHOW!

37,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Best in Show""- One of the great underrated comedies.",10,20 November 2017,"Director Christopher Guest has spent the past twenty years of his career working on an ever-growing list of comedic ""mockumentary"" features on varying topics. Farcical and amusing misadventures presented as ""real life"" documentaries, starring some of the best minds in comedy working today. This is somewhat appropriate, as the film that arguably made him a star was the fantastic ""This is Spinal Tap"", which he co-starred in, in addition to co-writing. From the amusing and quirky ""Waiting for Guffman"", to the surprisingly heartfelt ""A Might Wind"", Guest's films have been consistently hilarious and have maintained a frankly shocking degree of freshness through the years.While individual tastes vary between fans, and while everyone has their own personal favorite Guest film, I know I'm certainly in no minority to feel that the greatest achievement of his career is the incredible and frankly brilliant 2000 release ""Best in Show."" A film I feel is amongst the most underrated and under-appreciated comedies of all time. Sure, it does have a fan- base, but even still... it's a film that is so unique and so special, that it deserves a far greater audience and far more recognition that it currently receives from its moderate but very dedicated cult audience.It's time again for the annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show, a prestigious dog-breed competition held in Philedelphia. The ""documentary"" follows a varied and very peculiar collection of contestants as they prepare to depart for their show with their beloved canines. Among them are Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara), a friendly and seemingly average middle- class couple who hope their terrier has what it takes; Harlan Pepper (director Guest), a southern man with a pronounced drawl who raises bloodhounds and has some interesting aspirations; Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock)- the most stereotypical upper-class yuppie- hipsters you could ever imagine; camp gay couple Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean) and their Shih Tzu and Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy trophy-wife and two- time winner of the competition.A film made heavily through improvisational comedy and a clever, high-concept hook, ""Best in Show"" is such a wild success thanks to the incredible cast of performers assembled, and the delightfully bizarre characters they cultivate. From the pretentious Swan duo losing their minds over a squeaky toy by the name of ""Busy Bee"", to the delightful interactions between Donlan and Stefan, and certainly to the pure and very relatable giggles the average-seeming Flecks bring about... everyone is at the top of their game creatively, supplying some of the best subtle (and not-so-subtle at times) humor I've ever seen. Director Guest skillfully pulls out non-stop moments of charm and laughs from the amazing cast, and puts together one heck of a show.Though the film's appeal may be lost on those looking for a more general joke-a-minute-riot, ""Best in Show"" encapsulates many of the best instances of clever comedy to emerge in recent memory. It's a film more about delivering smirks and chuckles than out-loud belly- laughs, where quirky characters and oddly personal stakes take center stage and the plot often takes an overt back seat. The great fun of the film is seeing people who feel like they could very well exist, even if they are exaggerated for comedy, in a situation that's just odd enough that the average person would find it fascinating. It's about people first and foremost... it's about the men and women behind the dogs. And how the show is more about them than the canines on display.""Best in Show"" is in my mind one of the greatest comedies of all time. It's clever. It's entertaining. It's enthralling and charming. And it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10. Sit! Stay! And prepare to laugh!",Best in Show

The rest were cookie cutter, the irritating sidekick of the commentator - seemed we all heard those lines in countless other movies before.  The screaming tense couple, I just hate it when a comedy has these irritants, I just cringe everytime they are focussed on. Catherine and Eugene made the best of their roles, the ongoing bit about her being with just about every man she met was very funny.

41,mattymatt4ever,What's so funny???,4,25 May 2001,"Just like ""Waiting for Guffman"" here comes another lamebrained comedy that got big hype, but I'm still not laughing.  It's not that I don't get the jokes, I get the jokes!  There's no subtle humor!  It's just not funny.  I chuckled a few times, but this is one of those films that I have to watch with someone else (who liked the film) to actually see what was so hilarious!I have nothing against improvisation.  As I mentioned before, I'm a huge fan of ""Whose Line is it Anyway.""  But maybe improv just doesn't have a good place in film.  I wasn't a fan of ""This is Spinal Tap"" either, another improvised piece featuring Michael McKean and Christopher Guest.  I've seen films that contained a lot of improvisation, and it worked, but the script still set a fair deal of boundaries.  And thinking back to some of the movies I found the funniest (films by Woody Allen and Albert Brooks) sharp writing can work wonders.Each of the characters had certain quirks.  Few worked, most didn't.  I liked Eugene Levy, and I thought the bit about the two left feet was pretty funny.  Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock as the dueling couple were over-the-top, though I thought their little spoof of the maximization of Starbucks all around the world was quite catchy and funny.  Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins as the gay couple were just plain annoying.  I guess Christopher Guest felt the mere idea that they were gay was funny enough, and there's a bit about lesbianism involving Jennifer Coolidge and her lover that was put in strictly for gimmicks.  But Fred Willard, like always, cracked me up a few times as the commentator at the dog show. Christopher Guest as a hick who can name every nut imaginable (OK, was that supposed to be funny?) was just plain stupid with a hammy performance in which you can tell he's trying to go for a laugh--or have people laugh AT him.  And I think that's a problem with most of the other actors in this movie.""Best in Show"" is original and different.  I can't say any other film covered the dog show circuit.  But that's all it is.  I can't see a damn reason why people are voting this as one of the funniest films of the year and stuff!

42,hall895,A good show. But not the best.,6,25 September 2014,"It's another Christopher Guest mockumentary and with a cast full of certified comic geniuses it's hard to see how Guest could go wrong. Look at who Guest has at his disposal: Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKean, Parker Posey, Fred Willard. Is that enough? No? OK, let's toss in Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Ed Begley, Jr. And of course there's also Guest himself as a key part of the ensemble. These are hilariously funny people. Which makes the fact that this is not a hilariously funny movie a little puzzling. Best in Show is funny but not outrageously so. A funny idea, certainly a funny cast, but not a consistently funny movie. There are a few really funny moments. But the movie ends up producing more wry smiles than big laughs. It leaves you wanting more.The movie takes place in the rather bizarre dog show world. We focus on five dogs, and their inevitably strange owners, as they make the trek to and ultimately compete in the big dog show in Philadelphia. There's a guy who literally has two left feet and whose wife apparently has slept with every man on the planet. There's a campy gay couple and a neurotic yuppie couple. A trophy wife, married to an oblivious elderly man, and her lesbian dog handler. And an aspiring ventriloquist. All in all a weird bunch. At times perhaps a little too weird for the movie's good. A lot of strange things happen to these strange people. Some of these things are funny but there are a bunch of gags and jokes which fall flat. The movie perks up a bit when we finally get to the dog show itself. That is thanks largely to the presence of Willard who plays perhaps the world's worst television color commentator. He's clearly the funniest thing this movie has going for it. All the other performers do reasonably well but there are times where things just seem a bit off. Maybe the story doesn't quite work, maybe the characters aren't really developed properly. With all these great comic stars you expect hilarity and you don't really get that. The stars do the best they can with the material but you feel that the material let them down a bit. They all have their moments. Posey in particular does really well. And even in a film chock-full of performers with such notable reputations there's room for some lesser-known actors, such as Michael Hitchcock and John Michael Higgins, to turn in good work as well. There's just the sense that director Guest didn't quite pull it all together. This is a movie with such a great cast. That cast could have been put to a little bit better use. Best in Show had such great promise. But just as only one dog can win the trophy not every film is destined for greatness. This film falls a little bit short.",Best in Show
43,sharky_55,It was a grande espresso.,9,19 August 2016,"Christopher Guest could point his camera at almost any group and find absurdity within their ranks. In 1984 he was the lead for the rock band Spinal Tap, who though they were leagues better than they actually sounded. In his self-directed Waiting for Guffman, he turned to a group of delusional, small-town hicks who compared themselves to the Kennedys and had aspirations for Broadway. And here he focuses on a niche group that seems so perfectly ripe for comedy it is a wonder that no one has noticed them before. Anyone who has owned a dog will know that we all get a little weird around them. We adopt a baby-style talk, and address them as if they could understand our every word. The owners who enter their darlings into dog shows take this behaviour a step further, with some hilarious results. The film, like Spinal Tap and Guffman, is shot in the mockumentary style, with text on the bottom of the screen to introduce us to our peculiar cast, and a faux-haphazard camera that follows behind their every step. Guest is good enough not to simply let the script dictate the laughs - the first scene is a serious therapy session between two couples, talking about the supposed trauma of one of their kids, and only after holding the tension for as long he can does Guest pan over to the bored-looking Weimaraner in the third chair. The swivel is slow and incredulous, mimicking the audience's own disbelief and effectively pulling off the bait and switch. Later when the Flecks joke about Gerry's lack of coordination, they camera just ever so slightly drifts downwards to reveal his two left feet. It's the sort of joke that is dumb and obvious once you've seen it, but through the format Guest forces laughs out of us that have no business being there, by creating a persona behind the camera that is continually exasperated and shaking its head. The intimacy of the talking head is a huge asset here, because all of the characters are inherently stereotypes. In a conventional film it would be funny enough to observe them from a distance, with all their actions and dialogue pre-planned, but it would eventually be a bit tiring. Guest's format seemingly allows them a chance to defend their reputation, and thus he creates more humour by instead making their attempts collapse into themselves. There is Jennifer Coolidge in her usual blonde bimbo role, as the trophy wife of a near catatonic sugar daddy who can barely even pretend to have similar interests as her husband outside of soup, the outdoors, frozen peas and talking. The Swans are upper-class yuppies, so of course they met in a Starbucks, but they reveal it was actually two different stores across the street from each other (they of course live in a neighbourhood where this is the norm) and are not the slightest bit aware of the ridiculousness of this little detail. One half of the gay couple has already packed six kimonos for a two day trip, so when his partner protests, he realises he may need a few more. And there is Guest himself, lovingly showing off his ventriloquy dummy like a kid on show and tell day. Best in Show never descends into mean-spirited territory because beyond the gags, we recognise that these character's eccentricities are ultimately channeled through a love for their dogs, however unresponsive the dogs themselves may actually be. When the Swans enter the airport, they push their trolley of luggage along, but they also drag Beatrice's dog crate, which is larger than all their own belongings combined. Later when Meg is desperately trying to find a replacement stripy, squeaky bee toy for her, every attempt of logic on the shop owner's part flies hopelessly past her. They have their own crazed logic; Meg shouts at her husband that Beatrice is not listening to him, not because she is a dog, but because she is freaking out about her lost toy, all while the camera focuses once again on her bored face. The Flecks are likewise obsessed. They sing duets about Terriers with harmonies so bad they end on completely different keys, and their reaction to their baby being held hostage up on a shed roof is as if the world is ending. Eugene Levy has the natural ability to be flustered before it is even appropriate; he starts a sentence, talking about the weather on the drive-up, and has not thought on how to end it (A little cloudy coming up through West Virginia. But once we get into Pennsylvania...it's still, uh, still overcast.""). And of course their card is overdrawn - they are every bit the couple to spend more on their dog than themselves, and we chuckle and love them for it.",Best in Show
44,jhclues,"Will The Shih Tzus And The Weimaraner Come Forward, Please...",9,24 October 2000,"Writer/director Christopher Guest takes a look at the relationship between Man and that most loyal of beasts, the dog, in `Best In Show,' a humorous satire presented in the same `mock documentary' style as Rob Reiner's `This Is Spinal Tap.'  It's a keen observation of human nature, as it is much more about the owners and handlers than about the dogs themselves, and much as David Byrne did with `True Stories,' Guest presents a diverse community united by a single, common thread, that being their love for their dogs, and aspirations of winning the blue ribbon in the upcoming competition that will go to the top dog overall, the Best In Show.  Through a series of interviews and memorable scenes, we are introduced to the owners and their beloved canines who will soon square off in the arena at the world class Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia.  We get to know a bit about each of the participants, so we know just who they are and where they come from.  Guest has assembled a terrific ensemble cast, who bring it all to life by creating a rich tapestry of characters culled from a true cross section of Americana: Good ol' boy Harlan Pepper (Guest), with his Bloodhound, `Hubert', from Pine Nut, North Carolina; a somewhat neurotic young couple from Illinois, Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), members of the `Starbucks' set with their Weimaraner, `Beatrice;' Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), a couple who could be anybody's next door neighbors, with their Norwich Terrier, `Winky', from Fern City, Florida;  Leslie and Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw and Jennifer Coolidge) a wealthy couple who have a Standard Poodle, `Rhapsody In White', entrusted to the care of professional handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch); and finally, another couple, Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean), with their precious Shih Tzus, `Miss Agnes.' 	This is a highly entertaining, funny movie, filled with wry, subtle humor that is delivered straight and never played for laughs, which makes it believable and real, and all the more hilarious.  This is quite a group of characters, eclectic to say the least, and they're all real people.  You're bound to run into someone you know among them.  The dialogue is sharp, and rife with dry wit.  And for anyone who's ever watched any kind of sporting event on television, you'll appreciate the parody of the so-called `color commentator,' in this case a guy named Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), that is dead on the money.  His comments during an interview to a nonplused Dr. Millbank (Bob Balaban) about Columbus landing at Plymouth Rock will have you on the floor.  There is so much here you can relate to, and it's all done in such good fun. 	Rounding out the outstanding supporting cast are Don Lake (Graham Chissolm), Jim Piddock (Trevor Beckwith), Ed Begley, Jr. (Hotel manager), Linda Kash (Fay Berman), Larry Miller (Max Berman) and Don S. Davis (Best In Show Judge).  The performances here are good all around, with especially notable turns by O'Hara, Levy, Guest, Lynch and Willard.  Written by Guest and Levy, `Best In Show' works so well because it holds up a mirror and reflects the lives we all lead in one way or another.  As we watch, we realize that even as we are laughing at all of these characters and situations, at the same time we're laughing at ourselves as well; because there's more than a little bit of each one of us in there somewhere.  And it reminds us that when things seem to be getting too serious, it's time to pick up that mirror and take a good look; and thanks to the frame of reference that a movie like this provides, you just may find something to laugh about, and be able to discover the `Best In Show' in your own life.  I rate this one 9/10.",Best in Show
45,PartialMovieViewer,Have Seen Better and Have Seen Worse,1,25 June 2014,"I read Christophe Guest's bio and found a couple of statements to be offensive...intentional or not...they were both terse and quite stupid. Voicing his low opinion of Americans and their comedic viewing habits, slaps the faces of the majority of his drone-like fan-base willing to empty their wallets, just to be bored - once again. Apparently many of his fans either agree with his self-aggrandizing opinion or choose to ignore it, I don't really care. Whether you agree with him or not, usually a person goes to a movie to be solely entertained (granted some depend entirely on movies to feed their brains) - to each his or her own. There are a lot of people in Hollyweird I probably would not even like to share the same oxygen, but I will always appreciate talent. That being said, I am so glad I did not spend money on this twaddle, it was not entertaining and definitely not funny. I know, some people thought this was really funnygreatthat is your opinion. I found it to be a marginal, at best. Not being a Thurston Howell the Third or Lovey, or like any of those 'intelligent' type viewers, I found this low-brow comedy to be - well - more of an un-comedy. Honestly, ""Best in Show"", is not even close to 'Spinal Tap'. To think that this is an example of 'silliness framed in intelligence' and being so much better than that 'stupid American Comedy' – give me a breakthis thing is way off base. Is this movie really a mess – sure it is. Is it weak in the humor (or would that be humor?) department? If there was any humor to speak of - yes. Is the plot lacking - no - it's just missing altogether. in closing, I feel that this movie may be intended for some elite crowd but misses entirely, and gravitates to a more narcissistic element. Not my choice",Best in Show
46,aciessi,Pure Bred.,9,29 December 2017,"No dogs were harmed during the making of this film. In fact, never has there ever been a film where dogs stayed so stoic in the face of a ton of foolishness. Best in Show, while on the surface a Christopher Guest mockumentary about competitive dog owners and over-the-top prestigious dog pageants, makes a particular comment on humans in comparison to animals. The humans make stupid decisions, overreact at things that don't matter, argue, scream and fight tooth and claw to win the blue ribbon, while the Dogs sit peacefully, seemingly unaware, or totally aware and choosing to ignore it.Best in Show is a hilarious movie. The entire time, I had a big smile on my face. Guest has a knack for taking average situations and dissecting every peculiar aspect to poke fun of. He also knows the effortlessly unique qualities of middle Americans and how funny they actually are. Yes, these are seasoned improv comics portraying middle Americans, but in everyday life, you've seen these kind of people before. Take for instance, Harlan Pepper (played by Christopher Guest), a southerner who owns a fishing bait/tackle shop and talks incessantly about what he knows including every kind of nut in existence. Or, how about my personal favorite, the Flecks. Cookie Fleck (played by Catherine O'Hara) is the dutiful wife of Gerry Fleck, whose apparently slept with hundreds of men, quite literally, in fact, every man who comes in contact with her recognizes her. Her husband, Gerry Fleck (played by Eugene Levy) is the perpetual cuckold with two left feet, big bucked teeth and midwestern ""aw-shucks"" sensibility that everyone around him, especially his own wife, takes advantage of. Eugene Levy is the runaway stealer of the entire show. He's laugh-out-loud funny without even trying to be. He's the most natural improv comic in that he's entirely real in his delivery and knows how to react to awkward situation as we all would.Best in Show is less about the dog's competing, as it is about the people. Guest puts them on display for us to decide who receives the blue ribbon. But dog lovers won't be disenfranchised, as the film proudly displays it's affection for these perfect creatures and how they never leave the side of their owners no matter how flawed they might be.",Best in Show
47,gbheron,A Hoot,7,27 October 2002,"Christopher Guest again uses a mock-documentary style to skewer another of America's sub-cultures. This time around, it's the world of professional dog competitions. Guest focuses on about a half-dozen odd characters as they prepare their pampered pets for the big, national dog show. Sometimes Guest employs faux interviews, sprinkled throughout the movie, but mostly we eavesdrop on the owners as they wind their respective ways to Philadelphia and set up for the show. The judging itself is the climax of the movie.Many of the actors are Second City veterans, and the movie has the feel of a manic, elongated and integrated Second City show.  It's hysterical and enjoyable with Parker Posey, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Fred Willard providing excellent comedic performances. Only one factor drags on the movie a little; the subject matter. ""Spinal Tap"", Guest's earlier 'mockumentary', focused on rock and roll, a subject matter with near universal appeal. But not many people are into dog shows, it's a real small sub-culture, and as such may not connect with the public at large. And that's too bad, because ""Best in Show"" is a real hoot.",Best in Show
48,TOMASBBloodhound,"For some reason, I was rooting for the bloodhound.",8,14 March 2010,"Dog shows and the people involved with them would seem like a very inviting target for satire. And this effort by Christopher Guest and pals certainly hits the target, though it isn't quite a bullseye. Best in Show is a ""mockumentary"" about five show dogs and their often eccentric owners competing in what appears to be the Super Bowl of dogs shows in Philadelphia. More often than not it makes you laugh, and it certainly makes you feel sorry for the dogs in these kinds of shows.Director Christopher Guest plays a redneck owner of an enormous bloodhound from North Carolina. This is obviously a lonely guy with maybe a few too many hobbies. We also see him as a ventriloquist, a guy who can name every kind of nut there is, and he even runs a bait shop. After the competition, he even takes a jaunt to Israel to work on one of those collective farms they have. Other contestants are a pampered standard poodle owned by a trophy wife and trained by her lesbian lover, one of a pair of tiny shi-tzus owed by a flamingly gay couple of guys, a shaggy terrier owned by a borderline white trash couple from Florida, and some other odd kind of dog owned by an annoying yuppie couple. The camera just seems to follow these people and their dogs around while the characters spout mostly improvised dialog as if they were really being interviewed instead of acting. Its good for a lot of laughs.The redneck and the gay men get most of the laughs. Guest went to great depths to depict his Harlan Pepper character as a man with just too much going on in his own head and too much time on his hands. Michael McKeon and John Michael Higgins are good as the gay men. Maybe a little too good! Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's mom for those of you American Pie fans) and Jane Lynch have characters that at least keep you guessing for a while about the true meaning of their relationship. I think I recognized the old codger who played Blue in Old School as Coolidge's husband! The film doesn't quite strike gold with the other two dog owning couples, though. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are WAY too over-the-top as the yuppies. They could have been fitfully annoying without the tantrums. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are believable lower income Floridians, but the script overdoes it in ramming the point home about her promiscuity. And their dog seemed the least likely to win. Was this also some kind of joke? 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Best in Show
49,FilmOtaku,Hilarious!,8,27 April 2004,"`Best in Show', Christopher Guest's mockumentary about the dog show industry is, in my opinion, not quite as clever as `A Mighty Wind', but it is still hilarious nonetheless.  There are so many hilarious and subtle touches and jabs, (for whatever reason, the fact that the two insane yuppie dog owners both have braces is comic gold to me) yet there is a heart to the film, and enough of a back story on each character where you actually have something invested in which dog wins, to make the film a little more than just a comic jab.  I had seen `A Mighty Wind' shortly before this film, and marveled at the versatility of the actors that Guest uses in all of his films  generally, the characters they play in each of the films are quite different although the quiet, nervous characters Bob Balaban portrays are usually similar and brilliantly executed.  Fred Willard also plays another blowhard in `Best in Show', this time as the show announcer and host who is inappropriate and ridiculous enough to make his co-host insane.  None of Guest's regular troupe of actors ever really made it in my radar before watching his films; I knew who they were but they were never really in anything I care to see.  I now see that they are immensely talented, and Guest is probably one of the most underrated comedic writers/directors in the business.--Shelly",Best in Show

51,rebeljenn,Not first place,6,13 November 2005,"Best In Show is best described as a comedy and character film centering around owners of dogs who have entered a dog show. The characters are completely different from each other, and the events that lead around them and eventually bring them together are comical. Most of these people are stereotyped, leading to part of the jokes about them and their lifestyle. We have the homosexual men with a cute girlish dog, the sexy grave-robber woman who eventually leaves her old husband for a lesbian, a yuppie couple who visit a psychologist while convinced their dog has issues, a typical mid-western couple who enter their pet because it is something they always wanted to do, and a typical hunter who rambles on and on about his experiences. The stories of these people and why they entered the dog show are the movie's focus, complete with the end of the movie where their reactions to the dog show are observed.

""Best in Show"" is a fairly funny comedy offering originality, imagination and enjoyable characters, but allows style get in the way of reaching its maximum potential. The film is shot in a mock-documentary style similar to ""Waiting for Guffman,"" that was also created by the comic geniuses Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy.  In that film, much of the same cast, including Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, and Michael McKean, was involved in a small town sesquicentennial history pageant. In ""Best in Show"" a variety of well-cast characters are involved with a national dog competition. Guest obviously does not realize that a documentary style can limit the effective material in comedies, which has proved well in this production.""Best in Show"" details the adventures of an assortment of looney characters preparing themselves and their canines for a national dog show. There is Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest), a fly fishing shop owner from North Carolina who has come north to show his beloved bloodhound, Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), who wish to win the show with their Weimaraner, but are worried because their  pet witnessed them engaging in unusual sex. We also meet a clumsy salesperson named Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) who, along with his spouse (Catherine O'Hara) prepares to show his terrier, Winky. There are also two homosexual lovers (Michael McKean and John Michael Higgens), who own a charming Shih Tzu, and an anxious woman named Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge) who works frivolously with her trainer (Jane Lynch), in preparing her champion poodle.The dog show actually just provides a backdrop, or excuse, for the filmmakers to examine a colorful array of eccentric characters. The actual plot, if you can call it that, lacks conflict and needs more focus on the dog show instead of getting into the character's sex lives, psychological problems, family history, and other useless and meaningless points of information. Obviously, much of this material offers some very big laughs, as well as an almost continuous charm throughout the audience, but in-between the hilarious moments, the movie somewhat sags because it has nowhere to fall back on except its bland story-line.""Best In Show"" failed to hold my attention thoroughly and much of its material feels strained and out of place. With a little more zest and verve, we would have had a wickedly funny film here, with some of the most zany characters to hit the big screen in a long time. Instead, however, we receive a bunch of forgettable material laced with occasional amusement and fumes of entertainment. Mockumentary has worked before, and if used with the right material, and be very successful, like in ""The Blair Witch Project.""

55,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: solid but not amazing,6,30 March 2002,"""Best in Show"" is a series of little skits where they take you backstage at a dog show. There's no real protagonist, so it feels a little like watching an extended episode of the Love Boat. Sometimes it's genuinely funny; sometimes there's a subtle humor underneath that's amusing but not laugh-out-loud funny (similar to ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", but not as arty).The one negative comment I'll make is that the movie sets up several quirky characters, and normally we would expect these various characters to play off of one another in a series of mounting chaos, such as ""The Secret of My Success"", or ""A Fish Called Wanda"", or ""American Pie"". No such thing happens -- in fact, the main characters barely meet at all, staying boxed neatly in their own subplots.There are better comedies out there, but if you see yourself perusing the 1980s comedies in the video store, about to take a wild chance on something you've never heard of, get this instead.Who should see this film:-- dog lovers of all types-- comedy movie fans who aren't expecting ""Animal House"" humor-- anyone who wants to see more of Eugene Levy, who played Jim's Dad in the film ""American Pie""I'll give ""Best in Show"" a 6 out of 10.",Best in Show

63,bix171,A Fine Character Study,9,22 February 2015,"There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, but it's the finely observed character studies that make this gentle mockumentary by Christopher Guest so enjoyable. Guest, along with co-writer Eugene Levy, populates the world of dog shows with identifiable people and while they often draw caricatures (particularly a married couple, played by Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey, who project their fears, hostilities and parenting efforts upon their Weimariner; and Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins as an over-the-top gay couple), the ensemble has such affection for the characters you're happy to accept them for who they are. This is because the improvisational aspect of the dialog makes everyone seem real; you feel as if you know and sympathize with them as they struggle to succeed, as in the case of Levy and the sublime Catherine O'Hara, playing a couple who find they can't afford a hotel room and are put up in a utility closet by the well-meaning hotel manager (wonderfully played by Ed Begley, Jr.). Even those meant to be identified as ""villians"" (dog handler Jane Lynch and owner Jennifer Coolidge) understand their characters so well it's impossible not to like them.

70,ryan_kuhn,The Best of Breed--Comedy,8,13 February 2005,"Most comedies these days are about obvious jokes, ones that allow time for audiences to laugh, then catch the next one liner. It's fun to see a movie that is much quieter, with sly jokes that seem more genuine than standard written jokes. Best In Show, directed by This Is Spinal Tap star Christopher Guest, who also directed Waiting for Guffman, is an exercise in improve comedy, and that allows for drier wit and more genuine sounding humor. No one-liners for most of the film, just characters who, yes, they are odd, but are harmless. The movie revolves around a series of dog owners, taking their pride and joy to the national championship of dog shows in Philadelphia. The film is presented as a documentary chronically the movements of the participants, so we get back stories and character studies in these people, many of which have interesting aspects. Take the Eugene Levy character (Levy by the way is a co-writer with Guest, which means he either thought of the dog show premise, or the movie's title), Jerry Fleck. Fleck is a big-and-tall salesman who happens to have two left feet, literally. And he's just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the comic performers have backgrounds in sketch comedy, and it pays off in the free-form movie. The most memorable character, probably the only one with written lines, is Fred Willard's TV reporter character. Those memorable one-liners take on sports play-by-play announcers in a character who got the Mayflower ship and Christopher Columbus mixed up. Who wins the dog show? It doesn't really matter. All that matters is that we see a comedy that is smart, and quiet at the same time.",Best in Show
71,ltlacey,A mockumentary about the world of conformation dog shows during one weekend's specialty show.,9,31 October 2008,"Even if you have no idea what a dog show is, you will find this movie entertaining as each actor portrays a specific character to perfection and there are enough of them to keep this movie going. And that's people who love dogs and are willing to do whatever it takes to get that coveted blue ribbon and ultimately, the gold cup. For those who are familiar with this ""sport,"" and especially those who have participated in showing dogs, this is one of the funniest movies around. Sure, there are a lot of continuity errors, and in fact a few factual errors when showing a dog, such as all small breeds are brought to a table, and when Winky is in the final round he is not brought up to the table, but the rest of the movie is so good one tends to overlook these small things. Then we break it down to specific people and breeds (though some think the 2 are interchangeable or indistinguishable). There are the terrier people, and Cookie (O'Hara) and Gerry (Levy) are perfect as the human ""low-end"" (and I mean no disrespect here) of the dog-show circuit but who manage to have themselves a great dog. Then we have the yuppie couple, played so well by Posey and Hitchcock, whose lives are so wrapped around what their precious dog is thinking they actually make it worse not only for themselves but for the dog. Good acting also by this particular dog to be able to just lie around or stand without looking at all the chaos going on around her (must be an obedience champion as well). Then we have Guest as the owner of a Bloodhound, and his character was right on the money, even down to the way he talks to the hound. You talk differently to different breeds. (Hard to explain, but if you have never been to a dog show, go to one. Just remember that before a dog is shown the handlers and owners are very busy and do not have time to talk, and whatever you do, do not talk to them in front of a ring, or worse, try to pet the dog.) Of course there are the rich owners who hire the very best handlers and hardly even notice their dogs, other than as a means to an end (breeding). And let it be known that Coolidge is probably one of our most under-rated actresses around. That in every scene she is eating is a running gag that works. And of course, no dog show would be complete without the gay couple and how the handler gets all testy when the co-owner/partner is bothering him. What I liked a lot about this movie was that not only was it about a sport I used to participate in, but we got a decent background story on all the characters, dogs included. And the ""color"" commentary done by Willard has to be some of the funniest stuff around. That Piddock could keep a straight face was amazing since I read that there was a lot of ad-libbing going on.

Also, the pacing is much more even than ""Guffman"" -- this movie has no dead spots in it. There are no big gags in the movie, but there is a constant stream of very funny situations and character driven jokes (including one nicely handled running gag). The cast is perfect, and they do uniformly excellent job with the material.

The current IMDB user rating of 7.5 clearly contradicts how passionately film fans love and adore this movie. Christopher Guest is a remarkable film maker, not only as a gifted writer (former SNL) and director (Best In Show, This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting For Guffman, Mighty Wind, Mascots, etc.), but also for his spectacular ability to select and retain the kind of acting talent necessary to pull off fast paced films like this. With only a mere 16 pages of actual script, the bulk of the film is hilariously improvised by some of the best comedic talent in the industry. That's saying quite a lot, given the plethora of versatile actors in the theatrical selection pool. Guest is no slouch himself in the acting and improv departments. His entire appearance and accent changes with each film, from ""Heavy Metal Rock God"" to ""Red Neck Camper."" Sometimes Guest is almost unrecognizable in his own films. Best In Show was edited down from more than 60 hours of filming. The end result is a worthy and extremely funny look at people who breed and competitively ""show"" some of the most pampered and well groomed dogs in the world. The magnificent cast runs wild with line after line of beautifully executed improvisation, and it's difficult to say who makes us laugh (or cringe in some wonderfully awkward scenes) the most often. In any case, the camera rolls on. My only complaint with Mr Guest is that he does not produce more of these. Note to Ms. Jaime Lee Curtis (AKA Mrs.Guest) if you are reading this please ask Chris if he's up for another Mockumentary saga, any subject. I'm certain that no matter what he ultimately decides to write and direct will always be well received by fans and newbies alike.",Best in Show

I should have seen through the ""Spnal Tap"" sequel though and realized that this would be weak also.""Best in Show"" has many funny - even hilarious - bits. But it's mostly just a sledgehammer, pounding you on the head with each joke until there can be no doubt that you'll get it.The O'Hara-Levy couple are the worst. There is a recurring joke about her previous promiscuity that the movie beats to death. Really, would you meet an ex-girlfriend and mention her sexual antics in front of her husband? And the terrier songs - do we need to hear the whole song to get the point?McKean and his partner are equally painful to watch. As is Fred Willard. The Swans (Posey & Hitchcock) and Guest himself do the best work but even those portrayals become too much.Subtlety is what counts in art: art that allows you to think and use your imagination. Something that works to make sure you get it usually seems insulting. This kind of thing is best kept on TV.The beauty of ""Spinal Tap"" is the subtle and graceful presentation. ""Best in Show"" lacks most of that. As Guest can be smooth and careful, I wonder if Levy is driving the heavy-handedness - his work on SCTV was always too much in this vein: a skit would be funny for a minute or two and then say the same thing over and over and over. Much like Steve Martin - the humor is in Steve's head and the viewer doesn't matter much.Net, shame that Guest has veered away from the subtle approach as he once had something to say.

I'm reminded of a different movie's tag-line: It's only a movie, keep saying to yourself, it's only a movie!!!  In this case, the satire has very effectively made its pointed criticism about a particular annual winter USA-Network special presentation of the showy Westminster Dog Show.  At such multi-day judging events all the range of pure breeds of registered dogs are primped and psyched as can be motivated.  All the people who annually produce, direct and compete in that show are unveiled by this movie to be a motley crew of neurotics whose dogs have learned to ignore them for the most part and just go along for the ride.  Such ""extravaganza"" television coverage is generally far from ""reality."" Say to yourself: it's only a pet show movie, it's only a movie ! ! !  This film conveys the message that outward appearances can be so divergent, especially in such a P-C (politically correct) culture.  I did expect some sort of displaying scene like one in 101 DALMATIANS where the owners resemble the chosen breed of dog they pamper but other wildly diverse set-ups make BEST IN SHOW move into a quick flourish of satiric hilarity.  The best performance is the ""fish out of water"" commentator played by Fred Willard; anyone who's tired from Joe Garagialo's year-in year-out retreaded remarks for the two-part Westminster competition on cable TV will catch the film's message.  Do rent this film if you want to laugh at how ""needy"" the affluent and consumer-wannabes truly are.

92,Tom Murray,"When I was not laughing, I was at the edge of laughter.",10,26 April 2006,"Best in Show is a delightful comedy, a pseudo-documentary about dog lovers and their dogs. The characters themselves are delightful, both human and canine. The comedy varies from very subtle to obvious but never becomes ridiculous. Many things will not be noticed on the first viewing. This is one of those films that can be trotted out frequently and still be as funny as ever. The film was written by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy who also star in it; Guest directed it. They and much of the cast were also in Waiting for Guffman. The cast consists predominantly of improv comedians from Second City, National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live. The scene concepts were planned but there were no rehearsals; the actors improvised the dialogue, resulting in very spontaneous interaction between the characters. The actors could plan things that they wanted their characters to say but they might not get the chance to use much of what they planned; it all depended on what the other characters would say. Different takes of the same scene could be completely different. Over sixty hours of film were taken and the editing took about eight months. The film culminates in the big Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. There are two commentators: one, Trevor Beckwith (British actor Jim Piddock, who was required to study everything that he could about dogs and dog shows), is an expert on dogs and the local, Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard, who was instructed to learn nothing about dogs), obviously knows nothing about dogs except, perhaps, that they have four legs and two genders; they interacted with great hilarity. Three of the five dog show judges were actually show dog judges; the other two were actors. Most of the dog handlers in the show were not actors. The film is one of the funniest that I have ever seen; when I was not laughing, I was at the edge of laughter.",Best in Show
93,Wulfstan10,Perfect Parody of Reality,10,16 March 2005,"I like all of the Christopher Guest ""mockumentaries"" like this and Best in Show is quite possibly the best (although This is Spinal Tap is awfully close). One of the beauties of films like this is that, aside from having moments of obvious humour, Guest and all the others do such a great job at recreating a slightly off-balance version of reality while making it all really feel like a documentary instead of a comedy. It's this low-key, dry, rather deadpan humour at which this film excels.Everyone does a beautiful job at creating somewhat odd, off-the-wall characters and events while the whole time appearing totally serious, matter-of-fact, and normal. As usual, they take types of people who tend to be a little different anyway, make them subtly more strange and humorous, and present it as if it were normal reality. This subtle humour is present throughout and is simply brilliant and utterly hilarious. I guess some people who found this dull only latch onto the more obvious humour and fail to realize that the entire film is pretty much constant humour.It takes a lot of skill to do something like this and have it be really funny while carefully avoiding the pitfalls of going over the top and being lame and ruining the sense of reality, or being so dry that it doesn't seem like humour at all.

He's on his own here, and at a guess I'd say that what cruel and edgy humor there was in ""This is Spinal Tap"" can probably be attributed to him.  I found the characterizations in this film to be more often cruel than humorous.  Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey are pitiful neurotics whose lives revolve around coffee and their show dog. Eugene Levy is apparently not funny enough for Guest - he wears buck teeth and has two left feet.  In the process of getting his dog to the show, the character discovers that his wife (Catherine O'Hara) is the regional slut - not exactly a laugh a minute!  Guest himself plays a 'fussy gay' dog owner. I'd recommend this one to people whose sense of humour involves feeling superior to others.",Best in Show

I know, I know, but this one is probably his best, in my humble opinion. The comedy just flows so nicely, the production work put into the dog show itself, the cast of remarkable characters with their own hilarious quirks, and it's an animal movie! I love Eugene Levy's ridiculous character as a bucktoothed, double-left-foot-having, concerned husband through the whole film as he meets past lovers of his wife, Cookie (O'Hara). The dogs matched all of the owners really well, and I loved Parker Posey's meltdowns as her and her yuppie husband try and perform new age healing on their dogs' mental state in every scene that the dog loses it. And Scott & Stefan (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean) were hilarious as a feng shui-obsessed gay couple.There's very little that I don't like about this film. I took off a point because it is, after all, another of Guest's improv comedies, so it's like redoing a past movie or something, replacing the past plot with this one.

When you consider that the majority of the film is improvisational, with the characters given a basic structure from which to work and then allowed to ""go where their creativity takes them"" you get a real appreciation of just what a good ensemble cast can capture/create.This particular outing takes on the world of dog shows and follows the exploits of various dog owners to the Best In Show finals. It is a stitch! There is something here for everybody. Of course the standout is Fred Willard as an obnoxious commentator who really deserved winning the Oscar for supporting actor for which he was nominated. The character study of each dog owner of course sheds infinite light into why they are so obsessed with their dog receiving the top award.The improvisation is top-notch but I would expect nothing less. Catherine O'Hara is generally flawless and here she does not disappoint. She is in RARE form! She and Eugene Levy play off each other quite well. Other cast members that I have seen in ""Waiting for Guffman"" as well as ""A Mighty Wind"" continue to be consistently creative and funny and I welcome their efforts. While ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" pale in comparison, they too reveal flashes of the genius of Mr. Guest and company.A must for your DVD collection and it gets funnier each time you watch.

We humans create a lot of blood,and pain-and joy- simply to create another person-another person-a baby. The actors in this movie simply CREATED a movie. There's the new context. Christopher Guest and Jim Piddock and Jane Lynch and Janet Coolidge and John Michael Higgins and Parkey Posey, et al, created this baby for you and me. It is a great work of acting. It just knocks me straight over. It is not perfect.",Best in Show

I last saw this movie in the early 2000s and I have to say, it gets better with each viewing. The cast is perfect for the roles of each eccentric who throws themselves in the world of Conformation dog showing, form the handlers, to the owners and to the announcers and host.

110,MrWhite2,The Best Mockumentary Ever Made!,10,21 February 2003,"Once again Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy bring us a hit comedy that surprisingly surpasses the marvelous independent feature 'Waiting For Guffman'. This film is not only the best mockumentary ever made, but most likely the best comedy ever made, from two very important aspects = 1) It makes you laugh repeatedly & 2) It has a wonderful idea that no film writer besides Guest and Levy has yet to explore as a comedy. They both do a wonderful job writing the screenplay, and Guest does an excellent job directing. The acting is pure excellence with the comedy talents of such actors as Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Eugene Levy, Christopher Guest, Fred Willard, Michael McKean, John Michael Higgins, Michael Hitchcock, Jennifer Coolidge and Jane Lynch. This is such an excellent film that cannot be praised enough. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a hilarious and well made film about pretentious dog owners and their dogs.Grade: A",Best in Show

I never saw his first film, ""Waiting for Guffman"", I liked his second, ""A Mighty Wind"", but this one didn't really cut it for me. It's not a bad film, I just didn't feel the same depth in the characters to find them that humorous in their antics. Perhaps they were too real, not over-the-top enough. Definitely worth a view if you liked the prior films, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a comedy but who are unfamiliar with Guest's earlier films.",Best in Show
112,littlesb,Guest is the Best!,6,29 October 2000,"Christopher Guest proves himself again in this very funny movie about the premier dog show in the U.S. and the people who are excited by it.  The ensemble of comedians, many of whom Guest worked with  before in ""Spinal Tap"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"" play off each other brilliantly and keep the laughs coming. This is satire of our times at its finest.  Besides the serious belly laughs provided by Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and Eugene Levy, there are the more subtle characters like Ed Begley, as the tolerant hotel manager and Bob Balaban and Don Lake as the self-serious heads of the dogshow, who provide surrealistic views of the actual people who make an event like this happen.And then there are the dogs, each one a real champion in his own way. It truly is hard to pick just one to route for.  I especially liked Hubert, the bloodhound, the shitzu and, of course, little Winky, the terrier.  One charming part of this film is that the love of the owners for their dogs really came through.  Especially poignant was Guest's character, coming from a rural Southern area to the show in Philadelphia, because of pride and belief in his Hubert.  AND, who knew that Guest could do such a brilliant backwoods accent?!",Best in Show

So as far as I am concerned, this movie rates among the best comedy I have watched. It was not so much a mockumentary but a parody of middle and upper middle class America. The idea of creating a show that is built around a dog show is original enough that I wondered why I did not think of it.Watching the movie, I did not know that much of it was actually improvised and was quite impressed with the scriptwriters for writing that kind of dialogue. Knowing now that many in this great cast brought their improv talents to bear just blows me away.

The result is just fantastic, when you're dealing with such talent as Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Eugene Levy, and Christopher Guest.The film follows four ""couples"" (some not in the traditional sense), and another single guy (played by Guest) in their preparation for the annual dog show, a take off of the Westminster show.  Much of it is documentary style, much like Guest's previous film, ""Waiting for Guffman"" was.  Some of the film is over the top and some is much more subtle, but it all works and is sweet natured throughout, especially to the dogs, who are great to watch as well.

The people are as odd as the dogs, and the performances, as usual, are naturalistic to the point of being documentarian. How he gets these actors to be SO natural is a small miracle in a world of overblown fake acting- by this I mean the state of modern film making.In any case, I had to see this movie TWICE, that's how funny it is, and that's how curious it is to be let into this world of ""Dog Shows"".Absolutely worth renting!",Best in Show

Any amateur psychologist would say that an unconditional love and obsession with a pet is a sign of something missing in someone's life, and each of the characters in some way fills this cliche.  There's the former High School Hottie who's now married to a geeky man, the childless, label-obsessed yuppie couple, the solitary outdoorsman, the young wife of a wealthy old codger (along with her short-haired dog trainer), and the gay couple.What makes this film so funny though is the way it portray's these stereotypes in a completely believable way - almost affectionate, in many cases.  Every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says - with their dog as an innocent onlooker - seems like the kind of behaviour you'd totally expect to see at a dog show.The biggest laughs come from the commentary team of an all-american style sports announcer, comparing moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game, and his English, canine academic, foil.The trials of the geeky husband as his blonde wife meets an astonishing number of men from her past is also always good for a chuckle, as is the demented behaviour of the yuppie couple as the pressure builds, while their hound stays completely unflustered.Well worth watching - even if cats are more your bag.",Best in Show
121,Twillhead,Laugh-Out-Loud Hilarity,9,8 December 2001,"The brilliant Christopher Guest (sharing writing credits with Eugene Levy) bestows upon us another comic gift with his 'Best in Show', a hilarious send-up depicting the behind-the-scenes world of professional dog shows, and the goober parade of pet owners who lovingly, if exploitatively, enter their prized pooches in such august spectacles. In an ironically telling touch, the dogs themselves are offered up for what they are--champion animals, first-rate and beautiful. Guest and Levy wisely chose to poke fun not at the canines, majestic animals all, but at their fallible human masters, who are sometimes sweet in their goofiness (like Harlan Pepper, the genial proprietor of a bait-and- tackle-shop and part-time ventriloquist, played with likable sincerity by Guest himself) to downright detestable (Hamilton and Meg Swan, performed with neurotic nastiness by Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey, who project their own hang-ups and frustrations upon the poor creature that is their dog). Other noteworthy performances are given by: Michael McKean--and John Michael Higgins in particular--as an uproarious gay couple, proud owners of Shih Tzus named Agnes and Tyrone and all the frou-frou inherent therein; Jennifer Coolidge as Sherri Ann Cabot and her dog handler Christy (a very straight-forward, hilarious performance by Jane Lynch), and their pride-and-joy poodle named 'Butch'; and most especially by Fred Willard as Buck Laughlin, whose side-splitting running commentary of the dog show is matched only by Jim Piddock as Trevor Beckwith, who proffers one of the most brilliant jobs of straightmanship captured on film in recent memory. This film is not for everyone, especially those weaned on such 'comedy' films as 'American Pie' and 'The Water Boy.' Its pacing is slow and smart, and--apparently one of Christopher Guest's chief loves as a filmmaker--background stories and relationships are provided to help flesh out the characters, and to help us better understand their motivations. 'Best in Show' is just that--a winner.",Best in Show

The humor is built-in because of the concept of satirizing dog shows, and makes you wonder why no one's ever thought of doing it before.  Best in Show brings back just about everyone who was in Waiting for Guffman, and it's fun to spot each actor as they make their appearance to see how they're paired up this time around.  My personal favorite characters are Parker Posey as a perfect yuppie who spends every moment seething through her braces, and Guest, who again renders himself unrecognizable as a sweet, simple man with a rambling southern drawl.  Also notable is Jane Lynch as a supercompetitive lesbian dog handler.  A funny tidbit: you might remember Lynch in a similar role in a Frosted Flakes commercial that was also done up in pseudo documentary style.

I like mockumentary style films, the style wasn't lost on me but the script was pretty boring. I'm not sure why it's rated so highly, are these people dog fanciers?

The main difference between ""Show"" and ""Guffman"" was the characters, or not really in the characters, as some were similar, but more in how they were used. In ""Show"" the characters had little real depth to them, and the tragedy was that they just weren't used in very funny ways. Interesting types of characters, yes, but it's almost like Guest created some interesting people but they didn't do much with what they had. ""Guffman"" had interestingly flawed characters, as does ""Show"" (although the ""Show"" characters are just more obnoxious than anything else), and the moments they created and the world they exhibited seemed more poignant and colored more broadly than in ""Show"". The Catherine O'Hara character was just a lame one-joke thing repeating through the movie, and the other main characters had little more to offer. Fred Ward as the dog show announcer was amusing at times, and obviously the funniest part of the film, but unfortunately that's not saying much, and it wasn't as if it was a real side-splitting kind of thing. Actually, my favorite part of the film was watching Ward's British counterpart react to him, and the two announcers together were a good part of the film. But as a whole, it was pretty weak, crude, and quite a disappointment. I'd still be interested to see the outtakes on the DVD.

And while I like all animals, when my Mom and I lived together after the divorce, I talked her into getting a cat. That led to more cats, and this is probably way more than you need to know about my history with pets. Oh, there's one more thing, I got a full bred Keeshond for my son last year, and the dog is a major irritant in my life right now. I went to Best In Show to laugh at dog people, and all I can say is MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. I happen to think Christopher Guest is a brilliant filmmaker. In Best In Show, he has captured the absurd and oddly compelling pageantry of dog shows. And this is more than just a `dog owners tend to look like their dog breed' chuckle, this is an outrageous lampoon of the people who treat their pets better than people. Best In Show is a mockumentary of a dog show, similar to the Westminster Kennel Club competition that's become must-see-TV in our house every February. In the grandly funny style of This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman, we watch interviews with different dog owners and trainers and see glimpses into their odd little lives. Of course, it all leads up to the dog show, with the requisite gamesmanship, tension and hilarity, as we follow what goes on behind the scenes and also hear the broadcast commentary. My favorite character is Fred Willard's Buck Laughlin, a former pro-athlete (think Joe Garagiola) who provides clueless and irreverent commentary during the ""broadcast."" He goes so far as to suggest the bloodhound should wear as Sherlock Holmes type hat and pipe! Christopher Guest writes, directs and stars (Harlan Pepper, bloodhound owner) in this masterful comedy. His Spinal Tap buddy, Michael McKean (Stefan Vanderhoof), teams up with John Michael Higgins (Scott Donlan) to provide a lot of laughs as a single sex couple in love with their Shih Tzu. They even have a disparaging remark about keeshonds. I was the only one in the theater laughing really hard about that one, but for the most part, a large and widely diverse audience at the cinema on a Sunday night laughed throughout the film. Best in Show is rated PG-13 for language and sex-related material. And, there's a bit more involved with that than a pug humping away on a man's leg, though there's just something funny about that. And, there's a lot that's funny about Best In Show. The laughs come from material that's sophomoric and from material that's sophisticated. The important part is, the laughs keep on coming!

133,jacob rosen,Funny But Insignificant,7,16 August 2001,"Christopher Guest's mockumentary about a national dog show and its participants is very similar in spirit to the groundbreaking `This Is Spinal Tap', of which Guest was a co-creator. It's a very funny picture, albeit not as biting as `This Is Spinal Tap', probably due, in part, to Guest's co-scenarist, Eugene Levy, whose gentleness also comes through in his role as one of the entrants, a shy bumbler--he actually has two left feet.(Guest himself plays another, a mild-mannered good ol' boy.) The bile, such as there is, is reserved for a repressed couple (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock) who channel their frustrations with each other into their pooch. Guest doesn't seem to want to aim for high targets, settling, instead, on providing a pleasant diversion and while his subject is an inspired choice for a comedy, the format probably can't sustain much more than this.

The last time I laughed so much, it had to be Galaxy Quest, but the jokes then were often about Star Trek and other space shows, not just the situation itself. The laughter in the audience was so different, here, though. Much stronger, probably the way Airplane was in the theaters. Made it hard to follow the movie, so many people kept laughing, you missed the next lines. A good reason to see it again.I was a fan of SCTV about 20 years ago, even though the show was uneven, but I loved the way Catherine O'Hara acted, and she's quite good here. So is Eugene Levy.If you don't know the plot, it's about dog show contestants. We follow six couples as they prepare to leave home for the Mayflower dog show in Philadelphia, and then we watch them in the competition. We finally see the winner after the show has long gone, about a year later. The style is mock documentary, even though we never see who's doing the ""documentary"". It's just the style.Wish it had been longer, guess it was about 90 minutes. It never slowed down, even though there are clearly sections where they don't go for sustained laughs, especially for the guy who lives in a town called Pinenut.The film is remarkably kind to strange people, though it uses them for laughs. It nevers flips over the edge into cruelty. For instance, there's a chesty woman who has a lot to do with Anna Nicole Smith, who has married a real, real old geezer for the money. The geezer is hilarious, even though he never says a word. If he'd said any lines, it would have been at the expense of good taste, I expect. Instead, we simply are invited to imagine what he is like.This is the best movie of its kind. Of course, I've never seen a movie about dog shows. I'll go see it again very soon, at least to start finding all the other stuff I didn't hear over the laughter. I don't recall anything anybody in the movie said, though, which means I doubt it will have the influence of Caddyshack or Airplane. Still, the flick is funny on its own terms.By the way, it gets the laughs without making fun of the idea of dog shows. People in the audience loved the dogs, so the jokes didn't alienate them by questioning the validity of the dog show itself.I saw this in a small Berkeley theater.

Spinal Tap was non-stop hilarity, joke after joke whereas Best in Show was had a few more lulls (and by that I mean say 3 minute at MOST where something riotously funny doesn't happen), but the big laughs are even bigger.The casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in, uh movies in general Parker Posey does a fine job. In fact, her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr. and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film.What's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot, simple as it was, around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction. I guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over-the-top. The realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. I actually encounter wierdos like this now and then. If you like Guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own this one.",Best in Show
143,honkus,As good as Spinal Tap,10,2 December 2003,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen.  However, I have laughed harder at plenty of movies.  This is because Best In Show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit.  The improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke, but only until after several jokes build on one another, each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose.It's a well-shot film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting.  I was impressed on my first viewing, but when I watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised, I was amazed.  It was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other, build jokes out of nothing, and completely immerse themselves in their characters.I imagine the golden days of Second City were like this.",Best in Show

I have great respect for the regular players -(in no part. order):  Guest, Levy, O'Hara, Willard, Posey, Balaban and the fine support of all the rest- McKean, Michael-Higgins, Coolidge, Lynch< Begley -- all of 'em -- I just love watching all of them work, improv, collaborate, embody qualities we can all laugh at, etc...To me, this movie is just not as interesting as Guffman or Wind on repeated viewings, although there are some real standout moments.  For this movie to really connect, it needed all of Willard's over-the-top shtick as the clueless ""play-by-play"" guy -- he (of course) delivers and enough laughs keep coming...So, while it did not reach the heights of their other movies for me, it's still so much better than 98% of the other comedies you're likely to see.",Best in Show

153,WesAndersonFan,Comic genius,9,25 June 2003,"As with Christopher Guest's previous film, ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"" is blessed with the gift of comedic genius. Filled with mainly the same cast as ""Guffman"", ""Best in Show"" tells of the quirky characters who participate in the dog show circuit and of their different dogs. The film basically follows, documentary-style, five different groups of people before one of American's oldest dog shows, during the show, and six months after the show. There is a mismatched couple, the elderly Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw) and his 30-something trophy wife Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge), who go to the show along with their trainer, Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), a dominatrix-dressed lesbian. There are two married yuppies, (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey), who are obsessed with their dog Beatrice, and treat her as if she is their daughter. There are a middle-aged couple (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), who are happily married, but throughout the film, they constantly meet into guys she's been with before, and he has to tortorusly hear all of her sexual activities from the past. There is a gay couple (Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins), who are very proud of their two Shih Tzus, and my personal favorite, Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest), a rambling Southerner who travels with only his Beagle and a ventriloquest doll named Lil' Buddy. One of the funneist characters, however, is Fred Willard's Buck Laughin, a portrait of comedic genius. Willard's whole role was filmed in about one day, but his improv is perfect as a confused announcer, who knows nothing about dog shows. Although I don't think ""Best in Show"" is as funny as Guest's ""Waiting for Guffman"", it is still a comic gem with some great performances, some great one-liners, and a very realistic documentary feel. 9/10",Best in Show
154,va3svd,Best in Comedy,8,1 January 2003,"To keep it brief, this movie was very funny, but like ""Waiting for Guffman"" (sp?), it tended to drag in parts.  Perhaps my bias is fuelled by the fact that I was forced to watch every single feature put on the DVD at my friend's place, which was a little much.Catherine O'Hara did an excellent job as the wicked wife of Eugene Levy, who himself was priceless.  The scene of him walking uncomfortably with his dog, trying to stay balanced on his two left feet is not to be missed.  This film, while funny, is best suited for a Canadian sense of humour, which is far more wry than that of Americans.  However, it can be appreciated by the occasional American as well.Overall, see it, but don't watch the DVD features before.  Save those for like, 2 weeks later.",Best in Show

Eugene Levy is funny playing the same character he always does--hey, someone has to be the nerdy Jewish guy, right? In Guffman he was a dentist; here he's a men's clothing salesman. With dorky glasses, of course.Best of all is John Michael Higgins an the funniest guy character you've seen on the screen. Neither a victim nor a fool, he's funny, carefree, out of the closet, and a fearless button-pusher. Not at all a buffoon ala Nathan Lane in ""The Bird Cage"".

159,douglasdidier,Comic genius. One of the funniest movies ever,10,3 January 2005,"This movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history. Its cousins A mighty wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are terrific in their own right but Best in Show takes the cake. A movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively, it's the intricacies of the characters that make it so good. After watching the movie about 75 times I have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. There is very little interaction between any of the ""groups"" of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film. If you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as I am billing it as, watch it again. The first time I saw it I thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious. It is a film that grows on you. Defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently. Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A+ if you get the DVD check out how these characters were ""born"" amazing that these two could hit it so on the head. And to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went. Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: A Cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the Cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half. Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A+ Find me a funnier character than Scott Donalan, I DARE YOU! He will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was very good as well and they interplay here (and a brief appearance with the Gugglemans) goes to show why he is always in these films. A great actor with razor like wit. Harlan Pepper- B+, I don't want it to seem like he isn't funny, he sure is but being the only ""Solo"" act he can't be quite as funny as the others above. He does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him.The rest are all great as well, there is no weak character. See this film at least twice.

From a kid who wants to strap a toy parachuter to the terrier and throw it off the shed, to a man with two left feet, to Buck Laughlin (Lilard) that steals the show with his unknowledge about dogs.

With that said, as a dog and overall animal lover I have seen many dog/animal films throughout my life and ""Best in Show"" is (in my humble opinion) second only to ""Babe.""First of all, the cast is superb. There are some serious comic actors and actresses in this film and they all do an amazing job of portraying a wide array of personalities. In a weird way each character is like a spoof of itself. What they all have in common is their participation in the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. This is apparently THE show to win and when the film opens we are introduced to each dog and their human. The movie takes us through the pre-show preparations right up to the Best in Show announcement. Along the way are short sketch-like segments with each owner and their dogs. Talk about cat fighting!!!(Pardon the pun!) Some of the owners are so neurotic, rude and demanding it's a wonder their dogs are functional. But that's the whole tongue-in-cheek-point.Unlike most animal films the humans steal the show because, as I said earlier, the actors are incredible. I especially loved Fred Willard's portrayal of one of the show's commentators. I laughed out loud at almost every line he delivered. The dogs were all impressive ""actors"" but the best actress Oscar should go to the Standard Poodle who must have had to endure hours and hours of grooming for her close-ups.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, even cat people.

From the opening to the finish I almost wet myself laughing and so did my friends. The comedy is not in your face, but subtly funny, without being too subtle. The actors do a brilliant job of half learnt, half improvised lines. The characters are all believable stereotypes: the yuppies, the millionaire glamour queen, the gays, the hillbilly, Mr and Mrs ordinary with separate pasts, and the dogs are at times even funnier than the actors!

Although the mockumentary setup may seem recycled from Waiting For Guffman and This Is Spinal Tap, it actually lends itself better to this movie than the previous two.  Christopher Guest does a remarkable job directing this cast of misfit characters.  The plot seems rather simple and even childish, but the cream of this film lies in the characters, not the plot.  Each one perfectly contrasts the others and provides his or her own moments of hilarity, which come from clever humor rather than the expected slapstick comedy.  Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara play priceless roles, and Fred Willard leaves the audience in stitches. Best In Show deserves a spot in the winners' circle of comedy.",Best in Show

That would be no fun!"") stole the show! Eugene Levy (""Don't water the plants, they're plastic!"") was hysterical! Christopher Guest (""I used to be able to name every nut that there was."") was great as Harland Pepper. He cracked me up! John Michael Higgins (""I knew a guy who had two members on the same body."") was absolutely hilarious! Jennifer Coolidge (""We could talk, or not talk for hours, and still find things to not talk about""), and Jane Lynch (""It all worked for my family, until my mother committed suicide in 81'."") were so funny!I like to separate this film in into three parts. The first being the introduction of the characters, the parties, and the hotel scenes. This part was HILARIOUS! The opening scene of the movie featuring Parker Posey, and Michael Hitchcock confessing, and apologizing to their dog after seeing them having sex, is unbelievably funny! I couldn't stop laughing! How about the scene in which we meet Sherri Ann Cabot, and Leslie Ward Cabot (""We both like soup, and the outdoors, and snow-peas, and talking, and not talking.""). Or the scene where we get to meet gay couple, Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donlon (""Get me one of the pepperoni sticks, I just want to hold it.""). The scene where we find out about how Cookie, and Gerald meet was funny (""I've got two left feet!"" ""I thought he was kidding."" ""Actually, I was born with two left feet!"")! The whole first part is hilarious. But nothing like the second.The second part, is the actual dog show. This is the funniest part because of Fred Willard's much appreciated, clueless commentating (Too many quotes to pick just one!). Parker Posey, and Michael Hitchcock were still hilarious in this part as well,(""Of course I've looked under the bed! That's were you look when you loose things!"") screaming at each other. and their dog (""Look at me! Don't look at the fatass losers!""). What about John Michael Higgin's character's reaction to Sherri Ann, and Christy Cummings making out! Two many highlights to list out!The third part is also hilarious! Although it is the least funny of the 3 parts, it is funny! I especially loved Christy, and Sherri Ann's scene, which was just hilarious! This movie was non-stop laughs! Hilarious!

193,thomadsen,Christopher Guest finds some more trailer trash to kick around,5,8 January 2003,"At least with ""Spinal Tap"" there was some worthy object of satire. Now Mr. Guest has gone the way of ""American Movie"" and ""Fargo"" by taking a rather unsettling delight in savaging people for no apparent reason other than their sheer simplicity. You'd think Mr. Guest would have at least one friend with enough decency to drag him off these sorry folks before he pummels them to death. I've heard the term ""dark"" comedy tossed around a lot in connection with this emerging sock-it-to-the-little-people genre, something I understand to mean: people are uncomfortable laughing at this stuff. ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" gets dubbed a ""dark"" comedy, though not necessarily because taboos are being broken, or because Larry David has pushed us into un-charted waters, or left us without a laugh-track to explain to us when laughter would be appropriate. As Lee Siegel writes in his dressing down of Mr. David and his comic ""insignificance"" (The New Republic, 1.7.03), satire makes more comic sense when the underlings are taking the piss out of their superiors. When the Davids and Guests of this world are pissing on the little people, it's not really satire so much as sadism. Mr. Guest's signature icy stare is beginning to remind me of the Larry David ""f*** you look"" Siegel finds so ridiculous--because the contempt it registers is usually directed, as he says, at some minimum-wage-earning shop-clerk. Mr. Guest, aka Lord Christopher Haden-Guest, 5th Baron of Saling, is now cutting himself from the same insecure spoiled-brat cloth, asserting his supremacy over rural Americans and torturing them as the Coen brothers tortured those hapless northern Minnesotans, simply for having made a blip on the cultural radar. School plays? Dog shows? Next he'll be attacking cheer-leading contests and bake-offs. Apart from the occasional delusion of grandeur Guest attributes to these country rubes, they seem to know for the most part that they don't have any reason to take much pride in their lives except by the criteria they invent in order to be able to take pride in something. It would be a lot easier to laugh if the C. Guests and L. Davids and Joel and Ethan Coens of this world were a little more clear about identifying themselves with the people, the class and caste of people, they attack with such relish.",Best in Show
194,sofaqueen,"Brilliant, Bright, and Biting Satire.",9,3 June 2014,"The world of dog shows is ripe for the picking, when it comes to mocking your subject and the characters that inhabit it's rings. But that is not really what Christopher Guest has ever done.I watched this to remind myself what I love about this style of film. The characters develop naturally, by shedding layers of pretense when they ""don't know we are watching"" and suddenly pulling themselves together in a vain attempt to convince the viewer that we just caught them at a bad moment. It's a brilliant way to show us the lives of people on a mission. When you allow yourself to forget that you are watching a movie, and plunge into the documentation of these people's lives, you experience the sheer joy of being in on the joke, through the eyes of the camera crew. The behind the scenes workers who toil away on big budget films, and get to see the reality behind the surreal world of personas and personalities. Guest takes us deep into the lives of the ordinary person, who is trying to live an extraordinary life. This time, they do it through the dogs they own, or show.They have dreams, and delusions, but the one thing you feel with Guest, that I appreciate now more than ever, is that he genuinely enjoys the human condition. He likes people. He cares about his audience, and he is in on the joke with us. We are not the butt of the joke, and we are never insulted for loving Dog Shows, Community Theater, or even the Rock Stars in a giant arena. Everybody loves a show, or to be a part of the show. NOT everybody gets to be a big star. To be the winner. To be noticed for what they feel is their unique gift or talent. Rather than exploit that, and ""mock"" it in a cruel and unfunny fashion, Guest reminds us that within our little circle, and in our own ways, we can all feel like stars. And it nobody has to get hurt in the process. I watched this film, in part, to recover from what I felt was an abysmal failure to make a Mockumentary style film about writers. Authors Anonymous. It fails where Guest shines. There are people acting their hearts out in old citrus warehouses, and others are packing up their RV's to head out to another dog show. These life stories, and their sometimes absurd details, make for hopeful films that salute the human spirit. The spirit of competition is a theme Guest tackles with grace, and a divine objective ""everyone can be a star"" sensibility that pays homage to our desire to feel special, and rewards it at times, in the most delightful fashion. The underdog. That is what he brings us time and again, in new forms. This time, with actual dogs in the mix! Mock umentary should mean ""mocking the style of the documentary film"" Not mocking the people who are the subject of the film Even when the film is about insufferable boobs. We learn enough about them to begin to understand what makes them tick, what holds them together, and what causes them to come unglued. We end up caring. Dog Shows are silly, but the people are far more complex. Dog shows are filled with pretentious snobs, in ""real life"" Easy prey. Not so easy to make a movie that works, much less can make us root for these people on any level, but he did it again. And is it ever fun to watch.",Best in Show

There were so few straight up jokes, and almost none of your typical sight gags or physical comedy. The story of these pathetic lives ran deep and by diggin into them you realized how much funnier and truer they were. The best example of this, and where Best at Show departs, is the tense hidden love of Steve, the Pharmacist, for Corky. Eluded to only in passing comments, some exceptional cheering and a quick glance of the eyes, it never really comes out and nails it on the head with a big ""HELLO AUDIENCE - STEVE IS GAY"". But then there is ""Best at Show"" which sets it up with road signs that the rich lady and her trainer (their names escape me) are hiding a little something, and then lets it rip on national television.

205,Fincher-3,"""Best In Show"" indeed",8,12 June 2001,"I'll admit that I've never seen ""Waiting for Guffman"", 1997's critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant. When the advertising for Best in Show had the tagline ""From the Team That Brought You Waiting for Guffman"", a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. For shame, critics, for shame times two!  Any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world, but this is one film that I hope people will experience, now that its video/dvd. ""Best in Show"" is, without a doubt,  the best comedy of 2000.The film begins with a mockumentary style, introducing the main competitors (not to mention screwballs) of the annual Mayflower ""Best In Show"" competition, where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. We have the loveable and gullable Harry Pepper (Guest) with his bloodhound, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) with their terriors, nut-case yuppies Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), the gay dog groomers Scott Dolan & Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), and the airheaded millionare Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) along with her trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch).  They all have their minds on one simple object: The Blue Ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. And...do I have to tell you the rest?Director/writer/star Guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at, and that the idiocy of films like ""American Pie"" or other pointless ""teenage"" flicks won't take over the world after all. His idea is simple: make your comedy not just funny, but SMART funny. But instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like ""Zero Effect"" and ""High Fidelity"", he used a rather unusual approach (and as I understand, he also used this approach for ""Guffman""). Whether you notice or not, a very large part of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script, maybe even not even dreamed of by Guest and co-writer/star Levy. But with a gentle hand from Guest, he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other, less adept actors.  Now that's smart!The cast is, of course, what makes improv work the most. All of them are a (comedic) marvel to behold, especially Guest as Pepper. But the real standout has to be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of...that is, if the announcer was trying to be funny. Williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press. There's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy: have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like ""have a doggie-style of a time"". Its priceless, as is his performance.I hope that people engage in this 90-minute ""dogumentary"". The film deserves so much recognition.

Garrity and Monique Prudhomme (the production designer and costume designer respectively) were integral in the mood of the film as it looked like a documentary (thank you Garrity) and the costumes were comic, but realistic (thank you Prudhomme).One thing that has always bothered me about film was the notion of a continuity error and there is one that I could not overlook in this film. Aside from one major continuity error, the editing was good overall.Now I come to the thing that bothered me most about this film; admittedly, it is something that should not have bothered me: my expectations.  I expected to walk into the movie house and not stop laughing until I came out much like I did when I saw Waiting for Guffman; however, I didn't find it nearly as funny.  Perhaps that is because I work in the theatre, perhaps because I've never owned a dog.  Consider this a warning, though.  Don't go into the theatre expecting to see a ""sequel of Waiting for Guffman,"" as I've read many times, expect to see a movie in a similar style on completely different subject matter with completely different characters.Also bothersome, was the depth (or lack thereof) of most of the characters. I found most of them to be caricatures rather than human beings.  However, I heard the woman behind me say that she liked all of the characters as people, so perhaps it's only because I haven't ever known anyone who has participated in a dog show.In order to not end this review on a down note, I'd like to point out that I do recommend this film to anyone.  Perhaps dog owners will appreciate it more, but it is a film that you should see.",Best in Show

I did not see Waiting for Guffman and perhaps if I had a more enjoyable experience may have been had.  I liked a few of the characters but disliked the majority.

219,skyjude,The cleverest comedy in existence,10,22 January 2003,I'm no dog lover but this film which follows several people's preparations for a major dog show is easily the cleverest comedy I have ever seen. It's a spoof documentary and it comes from the team of Spinal Tap but this is quite honestly far superior thanks mainly to supreme acting from all involved.  If you don't like dogs then it'll be hard to convince you to watch this even though the subject matter is practically irrelevant but if you consider yourself a fan of comedies then you MUST watch this film. Everything about the film is superb - each scene is priceless - but the commentators at the dog show just about steal it with the funniest banter you are ever likely to hear.  Please try this film - it's simply awesome.,Best in Show
220,bobandweave_57,Best movie of 2000,9,27 February 2004,"I really love Best in Show.  Not just because it is a wickedly funny movie, well written, well acted, and well produced, but because it makes fun of one of the most idiotic aspect of our culture, dog shows.  It's not that the dog shows themselves are made fun of in Best in Show, it's the people who's entire lives revolve around preening and training their dogs to be show participants.  The two characters that stand out as exceptional performances are the oafish announcer, and the guy with, well ... two left feet. Literally! The dogs themselves are great, and probably are overlooked in most reviews.  They definitely have personalities of their own, and they seem very normal compared to their handlers - much like the kids who's parents make them endure high profile talent shows.",Best in Show
221,smalling_60626,Don't know much about dog shows? Don't care??,9,12 January 2006,"Doesn't matter. We are not talking ""mocumentary"" here. Christopher Guest remarked after making the first of his many wonderful satires, that if THIS IS SPINAL TAP were nothing but mockery, the film would have been over in fifteen minutes. And he was right. In BEST IN SHOW, Guest (and writing pal Eugene Levy) struck a kind of comic apotheosis; they don't mock AKC-type shows at all, but they have a wonderful time dishing up a fictional set-in-Philadelphia dog show to show the many off-center but All-American type dog owners and their interaction. Fred Willard plays the TV color man, whose every remark strives for wit but bespeaks a deep, deep ignorance of the topic (""The sporting dogs; those are the 'jocks' of the dog world, aren't they?"")Perhaps it's Guest's British origin that gives him the required comic distance to craft a view so wonderfully skewed as in BEST IN SHOW. Certainly his many years in the USA give him great comic insight into the type of people whose foibles ""play"" in a movie. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are the Swans, a couple of shrill perfectionist yuppies from suburban Chicago. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hare are the Flecks, a very typical middle-class couple from Ohio except that he has two left feet and she has round heels (a running joke in the film, as she is forever running across past lovers, to hubby's consternation). The ever-funny Jane Lynch plays a lesbian kennel owner with an eye for a rich man's wife (Jennifer Coolidge). Michael McKeon and John Michael Higgins are gay beauty-salon operators; the McKeon character could pass for straight but when Higgins' flames, he is a holocaust. And best of all, C. Guest himself plays Harlan Pepper (love that name!), a molasses-mouthed, low-key North Carolina hunter.All I can do is sketch the players and open the way to the real treat of this movie: the comic dialog, much of it improvised. I would rather not deal with that here, because the lines and their delivery are the real spoilers and the reason this film transcends mere sketch humor and becomes something of a study in tragi-comic American types. Highly recommended. If you think American movie comedies have gone to the dogs, try this one; it's full of canines but there isn't a ""dog"" to be found anywhere in BEST IN SHOW!",Best in Show

The story basically follows several different owners as they enter a dog show, through to it being won, and then briefly what happens to them after.The problem is, every character is supremely annoying or dull and that was pretty much the only joke in the film. To me that isn't enough, and in fact the movie regularly annoyed me. I think it got about one laugh, and a couple of smiles throughout, and the rest of the time i was in pain.If you think the idea of someone reciting a line, sometimes saying something ever so slightly odd, in a matter of fact and totally deadpan way is enough for a supposed comedy, well, you may like it, but i wouldn't class it as humorous in the slightest when done repeatedly for an entire movie.

If you can't laugh at the faults and foibles of human nature, you won't find anything amusing here.

It takes a lot of talent to perform improv, and they all do it extremely well.  The amazing thing is that you don't have to know a lot about the topics they choose to get the humour in the movie.  If you do know something it makes it ten times funnier.  My two biggest suggestions are to; watch the movie more than once, there is always something that you may miss the first time around because you are laughing too much.  Secondly, get it DVD.

You have to admit that the acting is incredible, and even more so if you know that it's all improvised.  Each character is so perfectly constructed.

Christopher Guest's off-the-wall comments like, ""I used to be able to name every kind of nut,"" are funny every time.  Fred Willard, as the ex-jock dog show sports announcer is the most terrific part of the film, especially when, while commentating at the dog show, he ends his misplaced sports comments by turning to the announcer next to him and saying, ""Let me ask you a question, this may be off the subject, but how much do you think I could bench press?""  Larry Miller is great in his small part as a man whose profession it is to talk down building jumpers, but says to his houseguests, ""Let me let you in on a little secret.  They all jump.""

It's a shame some of them are a little two-dimensional, but that doesn't detract from the overall hilarity of the main players.  They range from quietly funny (sometimes silence and expressions can be funnier than blatant jokes - see the trophy wife in this case) to so strange that you can't help laughing out of sheer ""huh?"" factor.  The cast brings these to life in a perfect manner.  For most of them, I couldn't have picked a better cast (sure, it's the same cast as in all of Guest's movies, but that doesn't matter).The plot is a little disjointed, having been edited down from 60 hours of footage, but holds its own, especially in the latter half of the film at the actual dog show.  I am glad, however, that they kept in some little touches that add to the characters' development.But what makes this movie so legendary is that the characters contained within do exist in society.

You'll enjoy the movie more if you've ever watched the Westminster Kennel Club show; Fred Willard's version of Joe Garagiola's commentary is dead on.",Best in Show
262,sjcates,Not Funny by any stretch,1,1 July 2001,"I love movies, and have a great sense of humor, have even liked some of the actors in previous work, but this is SAD.  Cannot believe it has the rating it does.  Would have given it a ZERO if I could.  Simple, too simple, minded humor ... can't imagine what the rave is about.  It's non-existent on wit, or humorous situations, it relys on situational comedy.  Problem is the situations are extremely predictable and further detracts from any type of comedic value.  Poor, poor, rent it and you will be kicking yourself in the end.",Best in Show
263,bmichael-1,Best of the mocumentary genre yet--great characters,10,19 June 2001,"This is a truly enjoyable movie.  The characters are amazing, and even the smaller roles are executed with imagination.  If you like mocumentaries like Drop Dead Gorgeous, Waiting for Guffman, Fear of the Black Hat, Spinal Tap, etc., you will enjoy this film.",Best in Show
264,zanyrumon,just like the title -,10,19 July 2003,"If this doesn't make you laugh out loud, you are in deep kimshee.  Mr. Guest and the gang play people we've all met and give us a chance to laugh at them and, in that, at ourselves.  Many, many lines to hold on to  -- Still like Guffman better - and Spinal Tap rules, but this is a keeper",Best in Show
265,SCOTT DOUGLAS,Best in genre.,9,10 January 2002,"This is the best mock documentary of a dog show that I have seen in a long time. A very long time. Well lets face it,ever.  Isn't that part of the charm ? The idea of actually going to the trouble to make a movie mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find odd in the first place. Even if there were no big laughs, one would still be smirking at the thought. Any movie that attempts something new scores highly in my proverbial book. I loved the dogs too !",Best in Show
266,movielovinjerseygirl,It keeps getting funnier...,8,14 January 2008,"every time I see it! There are many movies that get better with age, as well as, each viewing, but this one takes the cake. I never get sick of this film. Being able to watch it on satellite this evening after a lackluster day only reinforced that fact. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy have created a cast of eccentric characters that rival any of the Coen brothers' creations. The casting is genius as are the actors' performances. The only thing that 'ruins' this film for me is Fred Willard. His buffoon to Jim Piddock's pained straight man is as sublime a combination as you will see. Fred basically steals the film. I always get angry with myself that I had forgotten to visit the bathroom before getting ensconced to watch and thereby have to waste time later. I could go on and analyze each character and their performance, but I am sure that has been done to death...yadda, yadda, yadda. In short, if you like offbeat, quirky comedies (sorry for the cliché!), watch this film AFTER you go to the bathroom.",Best in Show
267,krushgr0ove,One of the funniest movies ever,10,22 March 2002,"The first time you watch this movie you may hate it, but the 2nd time you see this movie I guarantee laughs all around.  The owners of the dogs are so ecclectic that you can't help but look at them and laugh.  From the littlest toy poodle to the announcer, everything will make you laugh.  And you may learn every single nut there is!",Best in Show
268,wordbrd,Excellent docu-comedy,8,23 December 2002,"This is worth seeing on DVD, since I thought the funniest bit was Christopher Guest's monologue in the bonus out-takes. He's driving Hubert to the show and discussing how people from other counties talk differently. I laughed till I cried.",Best in Show
269,glennabarkan,"Dog Show antics, almost real!",9,16 February 2010,"I have loved this movie for a long time! I laugh at Fred Willard until I get tears in my eyes! The dogs and their owners and handlers are such a match! Especially Parker Posey and her maniacal rants which teach her dog to bite the judge! It's clever dialog and characterizations are priceless. Fred Willard is so good - of course, the writer of his lines is a genius, too. I hope to see Waiting for Guffman again soon, too. I;m trying to recall where I have seen Catherine O'Hara before. I will have to Google her and refresh my memory. She is wonderful. It was funny tonight, as I eschewed watching the actual Dog Show in favor of watching Best in Show.(Feb. 16, 2010.)",Best in Show
270,Genna25777,Loved it from beginning to end,8,15 June 2003,"Maybe I was just in the ""right"" mood for a film like this, but I can't remember when I've ever enjoyed a comedy as much as I enjoyed ""Best of Show"".  Although I don't think it's the type of humor everyone can appreciate, it's definitely worth watching.  I think what impressed me most is that it was a good ""spoof"" of everyday people without making them too unbelievable.  Christopher Guest, of course, was great as Harlan Pepper... as real and believable as they come, right down to the ""naming nuts"" story. That's talent, folks.  When you can find actors and actresses to make these zany people come alive, you've got... well, not just a winner, but, of course, the Best in Show.",Best in Show
271,sltmjones-858-466161,Fun movie about owners of dogs.,9,10 July 2016,"If you want good comedy and a chance to see the funny interaction of people and their dogs, you must watch this. The portrayal of the owners is so cliché as it matches the idea some people may have already established about how far people will go in their treatment of their pet. Of course, the dogs are portrayed as ""normal"" while the personality of the owners is on the borderline of obsessed. Very entertaining and a great movie for the whole family. It will bring a smile to your face!Besides being a movie about dogs at a dog show, it focuses on the personality of the owners and their crazy lives, which are embellished to the point of comic ridiculous.Great for the whole family.",Best in Show
272,baleslynnwood,Not very funny and and not very good.,2,15 July 2005,"One of my women cousins won the Lab event in New York a few years ago. I admired the dogs. The announcer was more stupid than funny. Came off as a jerk. The actors did their parts very well. Five dogs and their owners. The ventriloquist was pretty good, but came off as rather pathetic. I know that the ratios were not supposed to reflect the population, but gays are only 2.5% at the most-not 20%. And lesbians are only 1.5% at the most-not 20%. And the show poked fun at an old man in a wheel chair. One of the two heterosexual couples came off as rather pathetic also. One nice touch the most pathetic couple won. But ""two left feet?"" My wife fell asleep during part of our viewing of the DVD. But that is not that remarkable. She is a good sleeper. I'm glad we didn't pay $15 to view this show. We got the DVD at our library for free. That was about the right amount to pay for it. I did enjoy the dog show and the dogs though, although we are not particularly fond of dogs. We don't one and haven't for many years since the children grew up.",Best in Show
273,RoninBoxers,"Very funny to the average person, completely hilarious if you show dogs!",9,30 November 2005,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, its unlike any other I have seen. I have shown dogs for several years and know people EXACTLY like every character in this movie!! The similarity is uncanny and makes it even more funny knowing what the show world is really like.The actors do a great job showing the dogs and are very convincing (this impressed me, it takes a lot of work to learn) the dogs are also true show quality which is nice. I believe the canine stars are all proved in the real-world show ring and most of them are Champions. In some scenes canine ""extras"" are shown by their real life owners/handlers.An oddly accurate glimpse of the dog showing world. Anyone could enjoy this movie, even if they have no have no interest in dogs!",Best in Show
