0,TheLittleSongbird,"Definitely not a terrible movie, but it is flawed",6,21 June 2010,"There are a few reasons why I wanted to see The Book of Eli. One was Denzel Washington, who I consider a very compelling actor. The second was Gary Oldman, who I consider excellent and underrated, and I loved his performances in Dracula and Immortal Beloved especially. Finally, the concept really intrigued me. These three components had all the ingredients for an above decent movie. So did I like The Book of Eli? Yes I did like it in some ways, but parts disappointed me.The Book of Eli is great visually, the cinematography, editing and scenery are top drawer, and the action sequences are violent, gory, well choreographed and quite brief. The story is an intriguing one, there were one or two scenes that didn't quite work for me, but I liked the first 15 minutes or so, I found them atmospheric and brooding. And in terms of supporting performances/cameos I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Gambon and Frances DeLa Tour here, while Gary Oldman is a charismatic and ambitious villain. I did feel that he struggled slightly with the accent at first, but as the film went on he was fine. The direction was pretty good too.However, despite these good things I was disappointed in some aspects, and no it has nothing to do with it being religious propaganda. The pacing I found very sluggish, so some scenes felt rather ponderous, and it wasn't until twenty five minutes or so in until we were given any backbone to the story or any other major characters. The score I also found somewhat generic and repetitive, and while there were some good moments the script was lacking. I was also disappointed in Denzel Washington, he looked really charismatic and brooding, but there were times when he spoke constantly in a very monotonic level, though I am not sure whether that was the intention or not. Also I feel his performances in Cry Freedom and Remember the Titans were better. As the naive Solara, Mila Kunis is eye candy if little else. Then came a very odd and abrupt ending, the whole film just felt unfinished.Overall, a flawed film but I think it is watchable. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Book of Eli
1,Leofwine_draca,More overly familiar post-apocalypse shenanigans,5,15 December 2012,"THE BOOK OF ELI loses points purely for being way too familiar. It's a film that sees Denzel Washington traversing a post-apocalyptic landscape, encountering violent ambushes and ruthless thugs as he continually searches for something kept from the viewer until the end.It's a dull, downbeat, often depressing movie, painted in shades of grey and brown just like in THE ROAD. There are a couple of decent action scenes thrown into the mix to keep things moving along, but MAD MAX this isn't; the story is predictable, and the bad guys even more so, despite Gary Oldman making a welcome return to his psychotic roots.There are highlights amid the mundanity: a run-in with a bizarre couple (Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour, both fine although underutilised) plays out expertly, and as usual these days with Hollywood productions, the calibre of the special effects is something to behold. But the story is slimline in the extreme and come the end, you'll be thinking 'is that it?' instead of feeling genuinely awed...",The Book of Eli
2,SnoopyStyle,Interesting ideas with a twist ending,7,28 July 2014,"In a post-apocalyptic desolate world, Eli (Denzel Washington) is traveling west in the bandit-filled wastelands with his book. Water is scarce. He arrives at a town run by the ruthless Carnegie (Gary Oldman). He sends his men out to find books. He's looking for a particular book and he burns the rest. Eli impresses Carnegie after he takes on his gang. Carnegie sends Solara (Mila Kunis) to entice him to stay. She sees Eli's book and Carnegie finds out. It's the book that Carnegie has been looking for all these years.The world is compelling but it's a little unreal. Realism isn't really the point. It's a cross between a western, a biker gang movie, and Mad Max. The Hughes Brothers bring a violent graphic novel style to this. It's a lot of dust. Denzel Washington is solid as usual in his intensity. Mila Kunis is OK. Gary Oldman is a great bad buy. The central point of the movie is interesting but it doesn't work completely. The ending has an extra layer of shocking twist more than 'Fahrenheit 451' ending. It turns the movie upside down and makes it an even more interesting proposition.",The Book of Eli
3,claudio_carvalho,"Mad Max, Fahrenheit 451 and Blind Fury Together",6,12 June 2010,"In a violent post-apocalyptic society, the drifter Eli (Denzel Washington) has been wandering to west across North America for the last thirty years reading a unique book that he brings with him. He survives hunting small animals and seeking goods in destroyed houses and vehicles to trade in villages for water and supplies. When he reaches the village ruled by the powerful mobster Carnegie (Gary Oldman), the man offers a job to Eli to join his gang. Carnegie presses his blind lover Claudia (Jennifer Beals) to send her daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) to convince Eli spending the night with him. The girl sees the book of Eli, and when Carnegie beats up on Claudia, she reveals that Eli has the sought book. Carnegie sends his gang to take the book from Eli, but the man is up for protecting the book with his life. ""The Book of Eli"" is an adventure film post-apocalyptic fiction that blends the environment of ""Mad Max"" with the concept of memorializing a book of ""Fahrenheit 451 and a blind hero that recalls Hutger Hauer in ""Blind Fury"". The story is entertaining, but there are many flaws like, for example, Solara can not read but is skilled to drive a car in a world without cars; Eli is shot in the stomach but is able to walk and row a boat to Alcatraz. Denzel Washington is always excellent but Gary Oldman has a disappointing histrionic performance. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Livro de Eli"" (""The Book of Eli"")",The Book of Eli
4,kosmasp,"Did you ""see"" it?",9,9 September 2010,"It's a tough movie to sell. It lives by it's mood and the central performances (by Denzel and Gary). The ending will definitely leave people either bewildered for all the wrong or all the right reasons. You could say that they lean out of their comfort zone quite a bit. And you could be excused if you'd thought they would try to come back with something a little safer.But while the raw power of ""Menace II Society"" might have gone AWOL, they still are able to tell a strong story. It's in the eye of the Beholder whether he/she likes it or not. This is not average Blockbuster fare. The first minutes might bore quite a few people. Others might think the movie itself is too violent. Or has an ""overall theme"" they can't tolerate. But in the end, it's just a movie (even if it is one with a message, you don't have to agree on)",The Book of Eli
5,classicsoncall,"""Do for others more than you do for yourself"".",7,19 January 2020,"It was evident early on that the Book of Eli was actually The Bible, the one single book that outlaw Carnegie (Gary Oldman) desired to help him gain control over his desolate community and then extend his range to the outer territories. One must realize that Carnegie was probably uneducated, because if he was, he would have known that the Bible has caused more in the way of division and strife in the world than uniting people to a specific doctrine. The fact that the bible Eli possessed was written in braille might have been a hint that Eli (Denzel Washington) himself was blind, with perhaps a God given sight that he had been able to master after 'The Flash', presumably a nuclear war that destroyed most of mankind. I got a kick out of the characters George and Martha (Michael Gambon, Frances de la Tour), calling to mind America's first president and his wife. That fed into the myth of 'the world before' the Flash, one which most of the current survivors knew nothing about. ""The Book of Eli"" is a competently told post-apocalyptic tale, with echoes of ""Mad Max"", and occasional spasms of violence. That first one will knock your socks off.",The Book of Eli
6,jboothmillard,The Book of Eli,5,26 July 2014,"I had heard bits and pieces about this film, and I knew the leading actor of it, I was certainly hoping all the positive and interesting discussion about it would be accurate, from directors The Hughes Brothers (From Hell). Basically thirty years in the future the world has been devastated by a nuclear apocalypse, leaving behind an ash covered landscape and a society fighting for resources, and a lone drifter called Eli (Denzel Washington) has been travelling on foot westward across North America to reach the former United States. To survive he hunts the surviving small animals, and seeks out goods from houses and vehicles along the way to trade for food, water and supplies, and when opposed he displays an ability of impressive fighting skills, but his main purpose to reach his destination lies in what he carries with him, and guards closely, a precious and valuable book, one unique to this post-apocalyptic world. On his journey Eli reaches a village ruled by the powerful mobster Carnegie (Gary Oldman), the leader sees his skills of fighting, and intrigued by him offers him a place to stay, and he gets his blind lover Claudia (Flashdance's Jennifer Beals) to send her daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) to offer herself to him, he gently declines her advances, but allows to stay in the room. While there Solara sees the book Eli is keeping, he tells a little about the night with him ti Carnegie, and about this book, the leader becomes violent, threatening Claudia so he will be told what she saw, she tells that the book had a cross on the cover, and Carnegie realises what this book is. Eli gets away from the village, but Carnegie sends his gang to follow the drifter into the wastelands to get the book back, and meanwhile Solara catches up to Eli and convinces him to let her stay and help him protect the book, which he explains is the last remaining copy in the world, all other copies were destroyed, he is taking it to a place where it can be kept safe and read by those who need it. Hiding in an isolated house with residents Martha (Frances De La Tour) and George (Sir Michael Gambon), who are cannibals, but before leaving a posse arrive and a shootout breaks out, Eli is mortally wounded, Carnegie manages to steal the book from him, but he is devastated to find it is written in Braille. In the end Eli and Solara reach Alcatraz, the book is recited from memory by Eli, who is discovered to blind, to be written word for word by group leader Lombardi (Malcolm McDowell), until Eli dies, but the book is completed and finished in the printing press, titled the New King James Version of the Bible, and Solara chooses to return home. Also starring Ray Stevenson as Redridge, Tom Waits as Engineer, Evan Jones as Martz and Chris Browning as Hijack Leader. Washington is a cool and iconic character with his tattered coat and sunglasses as he roams the dusty and sand covered scenery and defends himself against the marauders, Oldman does well as a nasty villain, and Kunis is a good choice as the innocent girl trailing along. I can see what critics mean with the film mixing in plot ideas from Mad Max, but it is done in an original enough way, you never hear the word ""Bible"" in the film, but it is blatantly obvious that this is the book of the title, it slows a little in places, but there are just enough violent and engaging fight and chase sequences to keep you going, as post-apocalypse films go this is a pretty good futuristic action drama. Worth watching!",The Book of Eli
7,Woodyanders,A post-apocalyptic movie with a refreshing difference,8,18 January 2017,"Determined drifter Eli (a strong and credible performance by Denzel Washington) fights his way across a harsh and hostile post-apocalyptic world to protect a book that could save mankind from complete ruination. Eli faces fierce opposition in the form of ruthless mobster Carnegie (ably played to the wicked hilt by Gary Oldman).Directors Albert and Allen Hughes relate the arresting story at a measured pace, vividly depict an incredibly dark, grim, and godforsaken landscape rife with peril and despair, maintain a grim solemn tone throughout, bring a soulful humanity to the compelling premise, and stage the thrilling action set pieces with ferocious flair and skill. Gary Whitta's thoughtful script not only intelligently explores the central themes of faith and redemption, but also makes a potent and provocative point on how religious beliefs can be used for either good or bad depending on their specific implementation. Washington and Oldman both do sterling work in their roles, with sturdy support from Mila Kunis as the naive Solara, Ray Stevenson as shifty lackey Redridge, Jennifer Beals as Solara's sweet and vulnerable blind mother Claudia, Evan Jones as the antagonistic Martz, Tom Waits as a jittery engineer, and Joe Pingue as the doltish Hoyt. France de la Tour and Michael Gambon are total hoots as a dotty old cannibal couple. The haunting and moody score by Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross, and Claudia Sarne further enhances the brooding atmosphere. The stunning widescreen cinematography by Don Burgess provides a beautifully bleak bleached-out look. A nice change of pace survivalist sci-fi outing.",The Book of Eli
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Hey, I'm Just The Messenger",7,20 July 2010,"It was nice to see a rarity in the film world - a movie which respected the Bible - but overall this is a typical post-apocalyptic film, set mostly in the West, and most of it is dreary and sordid.Denzel Washington is riveting, as usual, in the lead as ""Eli,"" a man on a mission. He doesn't know why he is to deliver the Bible through miles of hostile terrain to the West Coast but that's the assignment God has given him, and he is a faithful servant. Thus, we witness all the trials and tribulations of trying to make it thousands of miles with hostile people everywhere you look and a particular villain (""Carnegie,"" played by the also-riveting Gary Oldman) bent on owning that Bible. ""Carnegie"" is the Al Capone of his territory and he figures with the knowledge of the Bible, he can own a lot more than he does.Basically, that's it. The photography is good, at least on Blu-Ray, but mostly brown and very bleak. The action scenes are good. The characters are all sordid bad-guys and girls, with one possible female exception and Eli, although a righteous believer, is not averse to slicing or shooting people. He'll do whatever it takes to deliver the Good Book.Overall, worth seeing and a movie with a good message but a little too sordid to watch twice.",The Book of Eli
9,Tweekums,Denzel Washington: The Man with The Book,7,22 October 2012,"In an apocalyptic world Eli is a man with a self given mission; he is heading west with the last known copy of a book that is so important to him that he won't let anybody else look at it and will kill to protect it. It isn't an easy journey; food and water are difficult to acquire and there are roaming gangs that will try to steal your possessions if you are lucky or try to eat you if you are unlucky. If that wasn't bad enough, a man called Carnegie is desperate to get the book as he believes that the words it contains give the reader power over those that here him read the words. Chance brings the two together although Carnegie doesn't learn that Eli has the book until he has moved on along with a young woman named Solara. Carnegie and his men give chase and when they meet blood is inevitable spilt.This film contained quite a few clichés of the genre; we have to mysterious traveller, the roaming bandits, cannibals and a villain who controls the town. That said it wasn't a bad film; Denzel Washington does a fine job as the mysterious Eli and is ably supported by Gary Oldman and Mila Kunis as Carnegie and Solara; there are also a handful of well known actors hidden away in minor roles, The plot is good enough although I don't imagine many viewers will have failed to guess that The Book is in fact a bible. This fact could make some viewers find this an overtly pro-Christian film although it is clear that the creators believe that the religious text could be dangerous in the wrong hands... which is why Carnegie wants it so badly. There were a few twists along the way and I certainly had no idea about the final one until it was revealed even though there were clues along the way for those looking for them. I thought the way the film was shot; with the colour almost burnt out of every shot nicely gave us a feeling of the world Eli inhabits. The action is also well shot; in a way that isn't too disturbing despite the fact that quite a few people lose limbs! All this adds up to a pretty good film; it isn't essential viewing but you could do a lot worse.",The Book of Eli

11,paul_haakonsen,A Christian Fallout...,5,27 December 2015,"I was recommended to watch ""The Book of Eli"" because of the wasteland and apocalyptic atmosphere that permeated the movie. And I will say that it was one of the best aspects of the movie. And if you enjoy the setting of the ""Fallout"" games then you will find some enjoyment in the setting in ""The Book of Eli"" as well.The acting in the movie was quite good, but of course with Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman at the helm you know that you are in for top notch acting performances. Mila Kunis also did a great job out of her usual comedy element.However, the Christian element of the movie didn't go well with me, and it is the reason for ""The Book of Eli"" scoring a mediocre five out of ten stars rating from me. And the ludicrous last 15 minutes of the movie was also a factor resulting in mediocrity.""The Book of Eli"" is the type of movie that you watch a single time, then bag and tag it. It just didn't have enough leverage of contents to sustain multiple viewings.All in all, a movie that had potential, but was ultimately dragged down by its religious theme and a lousy 15 minutes last part of the movie.",The Book of Eli
12,Quinoa1984,"exciting, captivating performances for most of the way...",6,16 January 2010,"The Hughes brothers, Allan and Albert, return after a nine-year hiatus from feature directing with this violent post-apocalypse western, a kind of unofficial brother or cousin to last year's The Road, with a lot of skill and a visual palette that works really well. And it's a got Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman starring as the hero and villain respectively, which is really hard to screw up as practically anybody who loves movies loves what they can do in the right material. And for fans of samurai movies (yes, samurai and/or ninja or ronin) and westerns it provides the goods by having a character fight with a big damn machete blade (trained in the movie by Bruce Lee's mentor by the way), and its dusty veneer and ragged clothes bring back memories of the Mad Max era of movies. There's even potential with its premise about a man, Eli (Washington), going west to some place he doesn't know as a voice has told him to hold on to a very crucial book, the ""good"" book as it were, at all costs, which includes Oldman's power-hungry king of a small town getting a hold of it as a 'weapon' to control people. Duh.And the Hughes deliver just fine in this first half of the movie. Maybe even longer than that, going up to scenes where Eli and Oldman's character's daughter, Solara (very good if too nicely dressed Mila Kunis), wander onto a nice old cannibal couple's farm. They transform this story of a man's quest into something exciting and, possibly, unpredictable to an extent - that is the extent of which Eli will kill anyone in his way to protect the book. Even just on a base level watching the action scenes here is very worthwhile as just pure super-bloody fight scenes and, later, a gunning down of a house. I even bought in to Eli's quest, albeit on a level that he was really hearing voices, as opposed to 'God Told Me To"" kind of deal. It's shot with lots of care and fun, and it features a who's who of cool casting choices in supporting roles, from Tom Waits (reunion of Dracula with Oldman!), Jennifer Beales, Ray Stevenson, and Michael Gambon.Where the film runs into trouble, big trouble, is later in the film, as we see things start to reach a (mostly) happy conclusion. This can really only be talked about in spoilers, so warning given: at a certain point, Eli gets shot, though is able somehow to make it a little more west with Solara to Alcatraz prison (fine so far), wherein he find a printing press that is looking for the bible. The first part of the twist is expected, since Eli had to give up the bible in a previous scene, and it being in braille is kind of clever. But then the next part of the twist- that Eli has been blind for what we're meant to believe is the ENTIRE FILM- is just ridiculous. Perhaps the Hughes brothers and the writer felt that it wasn't enough that Eli was a samurai on a quest by some voices in his head, but that it had to be even more of a religious statement (either that or the black Zatoichi), but it hammers it home in a way that makes one have to look back on everything that happened in the film. It's an M. Night Shyamalan turn of the plot that is just completely unnecessary and, in fact, insulting to the audience.But, to focus on the positive, The Book of Eli is a film of some merit. It's got a point of view that it sticks to, which is that words have power in a world where people can't read and thoughts and the past and things can be controlled, or just sustained (albeit one has to take a leap of faith, no pun intended, that all the bibles in the world have been destroyed except for this one). It's first two-thirds aren't perfect, but it makes for a fun, interesting viewing. And then it takes its sharp turn that it can never recover from. Luckily by that point the movie just about ends, though not without some ponderous closing narration from a dying Eli. Good Lord.",The Book of Eli

15,hitchcockthelegend,This road is no place for you.,7,29 August 2011,"The Book of Eli is directed by The Hughes Brothers and written by Gary Whitta. It stars Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, Ray Stevenson and Jennifer Beales. Music is by Atticus Ross and photography by Don Burgess. Story is set thirty years after a nuclear war and finds Washington as Eli, who is travelling on foot across the desolated landscape to the West of the United States to deliver a sacred book. It's a journey fraught with danger, more so when a stopover in what remains of a town brings him into contact with self appointed town leader Carnegie (Oldman). For Carnegie seeks the book that Eli is guarding with his lifePost apocalypse movies have had a good run over the years, it's a theme that holds a morbid interest to film makers and film watchers alike. The Hughes Brothers have attempted to give this particular strand some new life by blending the sombre tone of something like Viggo Mortensen starrer, The Road, with Mad Max violence. A blend, it has to be said, that doesn't come totally off as Eli is in turns a God fearing man of few words, then the next a Kali martial artist laying waste to apocalyptic rapists and thieves. Further problems arise with the miscasting of Kunis. A good actress who looks yummy supreme here, but that's half the problem, she just doesn't look right in this apocalyptic set-up, while some of the daftness that comes with her character arc is barely palatable. However, if accepting it on its two fold terms, it's great as a mood piece and fun as an actioner! Washington is such a watchable star, someone who can lift an average film to better heights. Although this is not one of those average films, he has a commitment to the role of Eli that gives it a believability factor that few modern day actors in the same age group can. Having Oldman on bad guy duties is invariably a good thing, and he duly delivers another memorable one to file in the cabinet, while there's an amusing couple of cameos from Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour as a husband and wife duo with issues. The look and sound of the film is also impressive, with Ross (co-soundtrack collaborator The Social Network) and the Hughes' scoring it industrial like, and Burgess (Forrest Gump/Cast Away/Source Code) capturing a graphic novel like beauty from the back drop of devastation. With a couple of genuine surprises up its sleeve, film can't be faulted for lacking ideas, the Brothers to be applauded for not delivering the same old same old post apocalyptic based picture. But it's difficult to accept a bleak message movie (sermon) when the action is so outrageously fun. I liked it very much, but not in the way I had originally hoped. Pays your money and takes your chance, besides, Denz and Gaz are worth the punt anyway. 7/10",The Book of Eli
16,Theo Robertson,Marx Would Hate This Movie . So Will Anyone Else With A Brain,6,13 February 2013,"This is a film that starts with one of the most strikingly beautiful scenes I've seen in a long time . Credit to the Hughes Brothers for directing it and most especially a big thank you to cinematographer Don Burgess for shooting a scene that instantly draws you in to the movie . One does feel slight apprehension that the film can't sustain this opening and you're going to be watching a film that is style over substance . Guess what ? You're going to be watching a film that is not only style over substance but is quite illogical and even insulting in its storytelling The film follows Eli who treks through a post apocalyptic American landscape . To compare it to MAD MAX 2 is wrong because the wonderful technical merits of the movie keep you hooked but then the film quickly and continually shoots itself in the foot by having a scenario that throws logic out the window not only after you've watched the film but while you're watching it too . It's explained there's been a war almost certainly a thermo nuclear war . It's not said when this has happened but characters in their late teens early twenties have no knowledge of life before this war . So now people are reduced to cannibalism and yet 20 years after this holocaust people have access to petrol to drive vehicles ! I know Americans love their cars but this is too much to believe . The film contains several instances of this lack of thought going in to the screenplay The plot revolves bad guy Gary Oldman trying to get his hands on "" a book for the weak and desperate "" so you're able to guess it's not written by Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens . This also leads to another lapse in logic . Are we to believe that in an evangelical protestant country like the United States no one has a Bible at hand . Indeed what makes this even more bizarre is that for some reason no one seems to have any conception of Christianity . Eli quotes the Bible to his companion Solara who is intrigued by his words . I know the God Channel won't be broadcast after world war three but isn't the whole idea of religion to appeal to people who have nothing ? You don't have to say Marx is right but the thinking behind this film is entirely wrong There is also something that seems to have confused the audience and that is Eli is blind . He isn't . He might carry a Bible written in braille that doesn't mean he's blind . Nowhere is it stated on screen that he is blind and in many scenes Eli looks at objects such as a man hanging from rafters or a house in the distance . There's no sound emanating from this objects and yet Eli looks straight at them . One wonders reading the trivia section if this site has been the victim of an internet hoax ? One would also like to see someone contribute to the trivia section explaining why Eli is bulletproof I really wanted to like this movie . As I stated it is an impressive film from a technical viewpoint but as so many films prove if you've got a bad screenplay then unfortunately great directing and camera workcant rescue a bad screenplay . Worse than that because you'll find yourself becoming frustrated at the way a film that could have been excellent ends up on your mediocre list",The Book of Eli
17,Scarecrow-88,The Book of Eli,7,15 April 2011,"Eli is a ""walker"", carrying a special book across a post apocalyptic America, decimated by the usual man-made destruction, to ""the west"", a mission it seems that God has encouraged him, through a spoken voice, to take, running into cruel Carnegie (Gary Oldman), operating a lowly town containing impoverished citizenry, who sends out vicious minions to find a certain Bible which he believes will provide him with the necessary guidance in furthering his rule. Carnegie will do whatever it takes to secure the book, while Eli will defend it until his last dying breath, truly believing that he will not only finish his journey, but deliver the book to the rightful place where God is sending him. Mila Kunis (stunningly beautiful, despite the less-than-desirable habitat/environs she currently inhabits) will join Eli's quest, the daughter of Carnegie and blind—and often abused—mother Claudia (Jennifer Beals). Ray Stevenson is Carnegie's enforcer, who leads his pack of hyenas as they use violence and brute force to get what they want, going through anyone in order to do so. It is a return to form for Oldman who has spent some time stepping away from those parts which offer delicious villainy. Denzel Washington, not a surprise, exudes a quiet strength and dignity, very cherubic, as Eli, just a man—who is quite an impressive marksman with handgun or crossbow—on a journey to a specific destination, interrupted by a sadistic psychopath who so desperately desires the book in Eli's possession that he will kill or harm whoever gets in his way. While Tom Waits has an amusing part as an antique store owner with skills at building—and unlocking—things, Michael Gambon (as an old timer holing up with Frances de la Tour in an ancient two story house Carnegie and his goons obliterate with machine guns and a Gatling gun) is sadly wasted in a small supporting role with little weight except he grumbles and brags on the cemetery in his back yard filled with the corpses of trespassers who attempted to harm him. The Hughes Bros (From Hell) drain the film of so much color, THE BOOK OF ELI could almost pass as a B&W film. As we Post-Apoc fans are accustomed to seeing, THE BOOK OF ELI features plenty of startling images of bridges, buildings, vehicles, entire cities, in ruin, not to mention, lots of barren landscapes scorching under a hot sun. Poverty and a general lack of all necessities are also highlighted in great detail as THE BOOK OF ELI could work as a warning against mankind's treatment of each other and the earth itself. Of course the movie also works as an ultra-violent actioner with lots of shootouts—despite a lack of water and food, ammunition and weapons are in great supply, that in itself is ironic (one could look at this and say that nothing has changed even after man destroyed themselves; we are still savages, with Eli and Kunis the few examples of what little humanity has survived). While not a huge part, Malcolm McDowell has a memorable cameo at the very end as it pertains to the titular book Carnegie wants to get his hands on. There's a great twist regarding the book and Eli himself, ultimately satisfying in how it denies Carnegie his master plan.",The Book of Eli

Along the way he runs into Gary Oldman who runs a town and who is looking for a certain book....(and yes its a bible) End of the world tale both behaves as you think it will and more often then not, not.Yes there is a point when the story sort of goes wonky and predictable, but at the same time its not that bad. certainly how it all ends makes up for it its one end of the world film that mostly works.Its a great performance by Washington as a really bad ass sort of fellow with a quiet inner strength. Oldman is almost his match in a role that is a bit too loud and maniacal. The cameos from Michael Gambon, Tom Waits and Malcolm McDowell are good.What sells the film is the look and feel of it. This is an end of the world place. The wasteland is bleak. The road dangerous. Washington's hero is a guy who we know will kick everyone's ass. I like the twists and turns in the film. Dad and I both felt that some of them kept the film from ever completely going into the realm of cliché.Certainly the film does occasionally take a well worn path, and the world should probably be more run down, but thats okay (I think the 30 years after the war is too long) the film still works.

21,zardoz-13,Sheer Trudgery,4,17 January 2010,"Denzel Washington appears to be poaching on Will Smith territory in this post-apocalyptic yawner about a peripatetic loner hoofing his way westward through a vast wasteland on a special mission. This is the kind of high-octane, futuristic thriller that Will Smith makes. Indeed, we haven't seen Denzel as trigger-happy as this since ""Training Day."" Sure, Denzel is the hero, but he also kills with extreme prejudice. ""Menace II Society"" co-directors Albert & Allen Hughes make their monosyllabic hero humble enough to elicit our sympathy but skilled enough in close-quarters combat, like Steven Seagal caught between a rock and a hard place, to vanquish the villains without flinching. The problem with ""The Book of Eli"" is it takes itself far too seriously so it is no fun. Humor is strictly peripheral. The Brothers Hughes and freshman scenarist Gary Whitta have not made a post-apocalyptic thriller in the tradition of the ""Mad Max"" movies. Mind you, ""Eli"" and ""Max"" were similar in that each occurred in arid terrain and both heroes survived outside of society. The villain that Denzel squares off against simply lacks audacity. Instead, the filmmakers appear to be channeling Randolph Scott and the westerns that he starred in for director Budd Boetticher in the 1950s. Usually, these oaters found Scott taking time off from the trail to tangle with his adversaries. As for our hero, Denzel tangles with the boys, but he wants nothing to do with girls. He struggles to mind his own business. Good post-apocalyptic thrillers are typically outlandish, over-the-top actioneers. The violence is brief and bloody, but Denzel doesn't dispatch his opponents with a clever line. Despite its R rating, ""The Book of Eli"" eschews both nudity and sexuality.The world lies in ruins after a nuclear war has devastated the planet. Two kinds of people exist in the aftermath: those who can read and those who cannot read. Eli--as we learn when we see a name tag in his bag--seems virtually indestructible. Hideously evil bad guys surround him, but he puts them down with the Seagal-like efficiency. He doesn't spare the knife nor spoil his vicious adversaries. Basically, Eli prefers to mind his own business, leave others alone, and keep himself supplied with water. When scavengers and murderers try to interfere with him, he slices them to ribbons with a large machete and/or drops them with an automatic pistol or a pump-action shotgun. He is really good in a crisis until he meets the treacherous likes of Carnegie (Gary Oldman of ""True Romance"") who is desperately searching for the Bible. He wants the book for the power that comes with it that he plans to exploit for his own selfish gain. He has been sending amoral ruffians out to scour the earth for a Bible. Ironically, the very book--the Bible--that Eli has been led to preserve for posterity was burned. He tells us in one scene that many people blamed the Bible for the destruction of society. Nothing remains of a once affluent society that had too much for its own good and obliterated it because it could not come to terms with religion. The survivors of the war destroyed Bibles because they felt that religion triggered the catastrophe. When Carnegie discovers Eli has the Bible, he resolves to take it away from him. Earlier, Carnegie watched Eli defend himself in a bar against a number of thugs. Carnegie invites Eli to join him, but our hero tells him that he has other plans. Carnegie has a blind woman, Claudia (Jennifer Beals of ""Devil in a Blue Dress""), and her daughter, Solara (Mila Kunis of ""Max Payne""), works for Carnegie. Carnegie tries to use Solara to entice Eli to stick around. Eli wants nothing to do with Solara. He escapes from Carnegie and his henchmen after a street shoot out. Predictably, Carnegie rounds up his hooligans and they pursue Solara and our hero.Unfortunately, despite seasoned performances, ""The Book of Eli"" wears out its welcome long before its 118-minutes elapses. Although its action scenes are riveting, this lackluster saga seems long, drawn-out, and broods more often than bristles with excitement. The Hughes Brothers and Whitta never dwell on humor. What little humor there is remains ephemeral. For example, Eli washes himself with moisture packets from KFC. They play everything straight down the line, but they also pull a couple of things that remain unconvincing. Denzel lets the gray show in his hair and he does not make any moves on the comely Kunis. . Denzel delivers a solemn, low-key performance as the protagonist and he acquits himself splendidly in the action scenes. Sadly, Gary Oldman is saddled with one of his least villainous roles. Jennifer Beals doesn't have enough screen time to make an impression. Meanwhile, the Hughes Brothers come up short here with this dreary, threadbare road trip about a Christian drifter, but neither they nor their hero proselytize to anybody. ""Forrest Gump"" cinematographer Don Burgess provides ""The Book of Eli"" with a desolate burned-out look with his subdued lensing that emphasizes the sheer nothingness that engulfs everybody. The ending bundles up three surprises. Two defy credibility while the third is tragic. After all is said and done, ""The Book of Eli"" is dreary melodrama.",The Book of Eli

24,neil-476,Good but flawed,7,28 January 2010,"I like post-apocalyptic stories. This one tells the relatively simple tale of of a man's quest to take a book (which, you figure out fairly early on, is the last surviving copy of The Bible) to a particular place where it will be of most use. Of course, as this is a post-apocalyptic scenario, there is no law and order, so nearly everyone he meets is preying on everyone else and, in particular, villainous Gary Oldman wants the book so that he can use it to build up a power base.That's it in terms of plot. Denzel Washington is our protagonist and, fortunately for him, he is sudden death on two legs in any of many different ways. Gary Oldman is suitably villainous (I love the way that Oldman's villains are all different - he never plays the same villain twice) and Mila Kunis plays a morally compromised young woman who sorts herself out through the agency of Washington's mysterious nomad.All the acting is first rate, as one might expect, with the possible exception of Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour who appear to be having a bit too much fun with their couple of eccentrics and are not so much over the top as right at the bottom on the other side. The action sequences are very well done.I do have some reservations, though, despite the fact that I enjoyed the movie. There were times, particularly early on, when I had a strong sense of ""get on with it!"" - it was a little too leisurely in its early stages. I disliked the music. I wondered how come all the gasoline hadn't evaporated during 20 or more years in the desert. And I wondered what kind of war it had been that didn't so much blast the landscape into desert (because the end of the film made it clear that this was probably a desert-y area to start with) as suck all the colour out of everything: I found the bleached, sepia-based palette quite trying after a while. And, worst of all, the film is terribly earnest. It takes itself very seriously, and I got the impression that it thought it was a great deal more important than I thought it was.But I enjoyed it nonetheless. And I loved the twist, and I didn't see it coming.",The Book of Eli
25,ferguson-6,"Eli's Coming, Hide Your ...",5,17 January 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness.Yet another in a string of post-apocalyptic films showing Hollywood has little hope for our future.The Hughes Brothers (Menace II Society) deliver a western/samurai tale of a man (Denzel Washington) walking west because voices in his head told him to. Those voices also told him to protect the book he is carrying (a King James Bible) and go full out Bruce Lee on anyone who tries to stop him (OK, I made that part up ... but he sure does). Oh, and the man (Eli) has been walking west for THIRTY-ONE years! The real point seems to be Gary Oldman's character (Carnegie) controls one shabby little town, but dreams of real power. The kind of power that the book can bring. Ding Ding! Religious power! He wants to be a post-apocalyptic tele-evangelist, sans TV. He just knows he can control the masses with the message of the bible. I don't think I am giving anything away here. Good vs Evil. Just like all the great westerns.The Hughes brothers assemble a nice supporting cast with Mila Kunis, Jennifer Beals (her mom in the film), Tom Waits, Michael Gambon and Malcom McDowell. Kunis has by far the most screen time and the final shot of her is really the only humor I found in the film ... though, not even sure it was supposed to be funny.We get a pretty bleak, yet coherent, film for the first 65%. Then it just turns unbelievable. The Shyamalan twist is downright ridiculous due to what we have been watching for the previous 90 minutes. And as much as it pains me to say, Oldman's character is just too low rent to provide a real worthy adversary for Eli.

Set in the future after the last war made the earth into a wasteland. Denzel Washington drifts into town possessing a book that is sought for by villains but he must protect it. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes use very effective tinted colour to give it a wasteland futuristic appeal. While the violence is brutal and too reoccurring the ending is spellbinding with a tremendous theme regarding how God uses people for greater things. Washington faces adversary like a true disciple only with defences added. Mila Kunis appears at a bar under the ruling of her nasty stepfather. She ends up accompanying Washington much to his reluctance but she is schooled in the violent society and prepared to carry on his work. Gary Oldman plays her evil stepfather who is in hot pursuit of the book. Much of his scenes are standard chase but his defeat is one great pleasure when his face reveals disappointment with regards of what he thought he had in his possession. Jennifer Beals is also featured as Kunis's blind mother who sends her off but will ultimately enjoy a heavy victory when her disability becomes the enemy's defeat. Ray Stevenson is featured as one of the gang villains who eyes Kunis as his sought after prize. Very violent but extremely well crafted futuristic film with Christian themes encouraging those who have ever read the great book. Score: 8 / 10",The Book of Eli

28,Wuchakk,"""(Faith) means that you know something even if you don't know something""",6,3 November 2016,"Released in 2010 and directed by the Hughes brothers, ""The Book of Eli"" is a post-apocalyptic thriller/drama about a man, Eli (Denzel Washington), who possesses a valuable book and is determined to go West. He comes across a desert town ruled by Carnegie (Gary Oldman) where he meets Solara (Mila Kunis) and her blind mother (Jennifer Beals). Carnegie wants the book at all costs whereas Solara wants to escape the town with Eli. Ray Stevenson plays Carnegie's main heavy while cutie Lora Martinez-Cunningham has a small role.""The Book of Eli"" plays out like a Western mixed with the Mad Max flicks, but without the latter's goofiness. The New Mexican locations and colorless photography really capture the ambiance of a bleak post-apocalyptic world. Aside from the action and drama, the movie's basically a mystery. What is the book in Eli's possession? What makes it so powerful? Why do two people diametrically opposite in morality want it? Where is Eli taking the book and why? Why was Eli ""chosen"" for this mission?While you'll easily guess some of the answers, the ending sheds additional light and will surprise you in some ways. Unfortunately, as the story unravels its flaws emerge. The script needed polished and some parts don't flow well. I share a couple of plot problems below, but here's an obvious one (no spoilers): Two travelers come across a house in the desert that has an ""Absolutely No Trespassing"" sign on the property. What good would such a sign do in a world where 95% of its inhabitants can't read?Although the movie's burdened by such flaws, it's thought-provoking and there's enough good to marginally recommend it if you favor the cast and the genre. The film runs 118 minutes and was shot in New Mexico and San Francisco Bay. GRADE: B-***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie).One critic suggested that BOTH Carnegie and Eli are evil, obsessed with the possession of the book that destroyed society, but this is inaccurate. The movie goes out of its way to show that Eli is a noble individual -- not perfect, by any means, but goodhearted (Luke 6:45). Notice how he treats people respectfully unless threatened, he never molests Solara, etc. And Eli wasn't obsessed with the possession of the book; he was simply determined to fulfill his mission, which required him to protect it until he brings it to the proper destination (""West""). He perceived his mission to be from God via the voice he heard that accurately led him to the surviving book. Why did God speak to Eli and not someone else? Because (1.) as noted above, Eli wasn't corrupt; and (2.) being blind he was more sensitive to blocking out noisy distractions to hear the ""still small voice."" The movie also goes out of its way to illustrate that humanity without a religious book of any kind is WORSE THAN EVER -- preying upon each other like savage animals. So the book itself didn't destroy society, but rather the corrupt intentions of the heart of evil people, like Carnegie (Oldman), who arrogantly wanted to use the book to CONTROL PEOPLE. He didn't care about the treasures of wisdom contained in the book, like Eli did (in view of his quotes from it, e.g. ""Do unto others...,"" ""live by faith, not by sight,"" etc.); Carnegie just wanted to use it to manipulate others. So two people wanted the book, but one wanted it for wrong reasons and one wanted it for right reasons.But there are obvious problems with the idea of God sanctioning the King James Version of the Bible as the lone representation of the Holy Bible on earth: It's a TRANSLATION of the original Hebrew & Greek Scriptures and, while a solid translation for its time period (the early 17th century), it's hardly a perfect translation and, furthermore, it's language is archaic to modern English-speakers, how much more so to people decades after the apocalypse?",The Book of Eli
29,trashgang,post apocalyptic flick like in the eighties,8,3 October 2011,"Albert Hughes, also known as The Hughes Brothers is a director I already came across with the outstanding From Hell. But here I didn't knew anything about this flick. I picked it up a lot and still put it back on the shelves. But after a while I picked it up for good and I must say, I didn't regret it. If you like flicks like I Am Legend or The Road then you surely will love this one. But I rather would refer to those old Cannon exploitation flicks, those about the post-apocalyptic world. Back in the eighties they were really famous. This could easily fit into that genre but what a great flick it was. I was in it from the first minute until minute 32, then it falls a bit down, you think, but it picks up immediately until the end. There's a bit of mad max in it but what a great performance from Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman. It was great to see that Gary still had it, after Dracula for me he was a bit out of the picture, I didn't liked him in the Batman saga but here he is really back. There are a bit of brutal scene's but no gore is attached. There isn't even that much red stuff in it but as I said it's the story itself that is believable. Religion is the main reason for the war, face it, it was always religion that led to wars. And the fact that the sun killed humanity is real too, just think about the global problems concerning the sun and earth.

30,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Book of Eli,9,14 March 2010,"You might be jaded already with a number of big budgeted science fiction films that are set after some apocalyptic disaster that wiped out most of humankind, and having the protagonist become some sole, lonely survivor up against others who have banded together for worse, and without law and order and faced with severely limited resources to survive, cannibalism in a wild wild west environment becomes the order of the day, with those having weapons commanding over those who don't, and a clean bed, warm food, women and clean water are precious, tradable commodities.I assure you that The Book of Eli, despite what so many others have said, remain refreshing, with Denzel Washington in a charismatic starring role opposite Gary Oldman back to his villainous best, both being top draws in the film. Written by Gary Whitta who had fused key religious elements into science fiction, his effort triumphs against recent others such as Legion, and gets a better execution by the Hughes Brothers Albert and Allen who are sorely missed since their last film From Hell some 9 years ago, a film I enjoyed (despite the butchery here), bringing back their signature way of telling a tale through dark, brooding atmospheres. The first few minutes of the film which introduces Washington's Eli, is nothing short of brilliance relying solely on his enigmatic, silent presence, clearly surpassing that of Will Smith's turn in I Am Legend.Washington's Eli is what carries the film, a man fixated in his sole mission for some 30 years already, doing so based on one word - faith and a vision and instruction given unto him. He's the modern day missionary, executing his god-given task without question, believing that he fulfills his calling with as little fuss as possible. He truly believes that he's being protected from harm, and of course that also meant through the use of a shotgun, pistol and one hack of a machete (pardon the pun and intentional misspelling), dispatching bandits like spreading butter on warm toast. As such he's indestructible almost, giving himself some reputation into a small town he wanders into, especially when he has in him a possession of the titular book that seems to hold the hope to mankind's salvation.And Gary Oldman's Carnegie is the anti-thesis to Eli the messenger. For Carnegie, possession of the book is key for his power consolidation, because being able to influence the weak, the desperate and those in despair, would translate to loyal obedience. And in some ways this is quite true, in the way the power and influence religion has over the masses. In fact, Carnegie's explanation to Eli on the need for the book, is something which you'll find hard to dispute about, because even if one aspires to be a false prophet, one will require firstly the scriptures from which to twist from, since groping verses from the air just doesn't cut it even to the simple minded.As seen in films like There Will Be Blood, false prophets are abound, and this is one of the stronger aspects of the film blatantly made so explicit. You cannot help but to think about the same concept in today's context, where one's perceived knowledge and ability would bring about tremendous power and followers because of the seeding of hope and salvation in one's mind, and top marks given if one can influentially enslave the mindsets of desperate others through faith, something which Eli also has problems trying to explain to his new follower of sorts, Solara (Mila Kunis).For action junkies, you'll not be left out by the handful of battle sequences, where the hand to hand combat scenes have Washington showing off what he had learnt from a student of Bruce Lee, and reportedly doing so without the use of a stunt double. And if slicing and dicing opponents in close quarter combat is not your cup of team, there are also those which are laden with gun fights that just rip everything apart in their way, although I prefer the more elegant alternative of the use of the bow and arrows, with the Hughes Brothers knowing a thing or two about shooting proper action sequences that you can actually follow comfortably.Testosterone-laden action aside, In some ways the film also touches upon the importance of culture, without which we're reduced to nothing but savages, knowledge being buried in books and encyclopedias that no longer exist save for those still in collective memory. The final act, together with its sucker punch makes it all the more satisfying and poignant even, giving you compelling reason to want to watch this a second time with that little bit of background knowledge to observe performance and nuances that had probably gone unnoticed. That said, there are still a minor loophole here and there, but as Eli puts it, it's accredited to nothing more than faith. Highly recommended!",The Book of Eli
31,Mr-Fusion,"I liked the message, ambiguous though it might be",5,20 May 2015,"""The Book of Eli"" isn't one of Denzel's better movies (despite a strong performance from the man), and I'm not sure if that's due to Mila Kunis' miscasting, the somewhat generic post-apocalyptic setting or the languid pacing (an action movie whose violence happens in seldom-but-brief fits); probably some combination thereof. Not even Gary Oldman hamming it up could liven this thing. Although Malcolm McDowell came close (something about that voice of his).But one thing I did find interesting is the movie's perceived spiritual bent. I remember when this came out that the buzzwords ""God"" and ""faith"" were thrown around, so I can understand why. But it seems to be more about the power of the written word than anything, even if the coveted object is the Holy Bible. Oldman only wanted the book to control the commoners, after all. The quoted scriptures in the movie seem to be just surface matter. But with the ending scene especially, that printing press gave me a distinct Fahrenheit 451 vibe. I dunno, maybe I'm misreading things.Unfortunately, such debate gets lost in the movie's overall blandness.5/10",The Book of Eli

Girls go wild and psychotic bad men go mad.Unfortunately for this film, that is all there is to it. Lovely Mila Kunis is almost not sexy in this movie, Denzel plays very well a role that is pretty much cardboard Christian zealot and Gary Oldman is his usual evil bad-ass, only older. The sets are OK, but considering it has all been done to hell, from all the westerns up to movies like Mad Max, I didn't expect less.Bottom line: A combination of the worst parts of Kevin Costner's Mailman and Mel Gibson's Mad Max 3.

Sure, it packs in tremendous visuals and good performances, but, the film lacks in the most important part -- it's screenplay.The story revolves around Eli, a nomad in a post-apocalyptic world, who is charged with delivering his copy of a book, the very last remaining King James Version of the Bible, to a safe location on the West Coast of the United States. The history of the post-war world is explained along the way as is the importance of Eli's task.

Cindy Mollo's editing is zilch.Nothing can rise above a tepid script, yet, the performances in here are worth mentioning. Gary Oldman is fantastic as the evil-head. He steals the show! Denzel Washington is quite good. Mila Kunis looks stunning and does a fair job.'The Book Of Eli' is a body beautiful of minus soul. From this writer, A Thumbs Down!",The Book of Eli
34,StevePulaski,Visuals Make Up for the Cliché Story,8,3 July 2010,"The Book of Eli is such an intense action film you can't finish Elijah's full name before stopping in shock. This movie was filled with ass-kicking and plays like a video game with it's fight scenes. Not to much thought put into the plot, though satisfying actors playing fitting protagonists. Mila Kunis and Denzel Washington, though out of place, make a great duo and have a semi-happy relationship in the film.Denzel Washington is at the height of his looks with this film. The scruffy and sharp looking beard is a nice addition to his character and further cementing the title of ""a bad-ass character"". There's also a surprising twist on his character revealed later in the film. Mila Kunis is another sharp character. Shes not one of those one-dimensional female protagonists that just goes along to assist the main man. She helps out and its strangely intriguing to watch a sexy young actress handle a gun.The film takes place thirty years after supposedly a post-apocalyptic event. Eli (Washington) has been walking for years and has basically came across nothing. After stumbling upon a town, Eli finds a girl by the name of Solara (Kunis) who is innocent, though after a request from town-leader Carnegie (Oldman) to seduce Eli. Though the offer is rejected by Eli and Solara still travels on foot with him.The main jist is the town-leader Carnegie wants Eli's book, but we know Eli wouldn't give up his book without a fight. After all, its a book we're talking about! So the film doesn't tend to bore itself, many action scenes are thrown at it, but they give explanations and descriptions to it so people aren't getting beat for enjoyment. This is another way to determine if an action film is worth seeing or not. Does it throw out of place, stupid action scenes like curve balls at the audience. Or does it give reasoning behind the action? The Book of Eli is overall interesting. But basically, to me, winds up sandwiched between better movies of the year 2010 like Shutter Island and Alice in Wonderland. Also, the film came out relatively early in the year which would also contribute to the fact that this film is overlooked by me. Though, I wont forget it, but this is a movie that should come out in the middle of a year so it would be remembered more. Though regardless, I wont forget The Book of Eli anytime soon.Starring: Denzel Washington, Mila Kunis, Gary Oldman, and Tom Waits. Directed by: Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes.",The Book of Eli
35,KineticSeoul,Mainly atheist would bash on this film the most,8,15 February 2010,"This is basically a post-apocalyptic western style of a movie with some samurai elements thrown in. This isn't anything knew though and movie veterans would have scene this types of stuff in other films as well, but that doesn't make it a bad film, in fact I was entertained. Although it lacks the humanity elements from ""The Road"" this is way more action packed. Okay so Denzel Washington's character is on a journey west with a book in hand and a group of bandit run by Carnegie(Gary Oldman) is trying to take the book away from him and use it for his own benefit. Mila Kunis soon gets thrown in the film as well and too my surprise she wasn't bad, and played the role just fine. She basically plays a character named Solara and is someone Denzel's character becomes a mentor for. Anyways this was a fun film, a movie with Christian elements with a bad A Denzel Washington kicking butt with Gary Oldman being the nemesis, I enjoyed it.8.2/10",The Book of Eli
36,sddavis63,The Word Of Our God Shall Stand For Ever,8,11 March 2011,"In the words of the New King James Version of the Bible, which is the version Eli has in his possession, Isaiah 40:8 says, ""the grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever."" In some respects you might consider this movie to be a reflection on that verse, since in ""The Book Of Eli"" the grass has definitely withered and the flowers have definitely faded and the word of God is definitely still standing - it being the central dynamic which pushes this movie forward.Set in a fairly standard portrayal of a nightmarish post-apocalyptic world (references to ""the war"" and ""the flash"" make clear that a nuclear war was fought, apparently 30 years in the past) Eli is the central character. Eli is a ""walker"" - a man who after the war heard a voice leading him to ""the book"" (for the longest time that's how the book is referred to but there's really no mystery about the fact that ""the book"" is the Bible) and then, after finding it, the voice tells him to go west, which he spends the next 30 years doing, protected by the source of the voice that called him - or, at least, being given the power to protect himself, as he does quite effectively in a number of confrontations with the unsavoury elements left alive. Stumbling into a small town, Eli is confronted by the ruthless ruler of the town, who wants to get ""the book"" from him, believing it an be used as a means of further controlling the local population.This was a good reflection on how the Bible (and religion in general) can be used for both positive and negative purposes. While it's noted that many people blame the book for the war, for Eli, clearly the book was a source of strength and wisdom, inspiring him to take on an apparently God-given mission and to continue on in that mission no matter how long it takes, and how long the odds against succeeding seem to be. Denzel Washington did a great job with this role - a charismatic figure totally convinced of the truth behind the voice he heard and the importance of his mission. Gary Oldman was a convincing opponent for him as Carnegie - the ruler of the town who wants the book for himself, because he realizes that he can abuse it to make the citizens of the town even more submissive to his control. Those two performances are what make the first three quarters of the movie worth watching. The story for that period is fairly standard, as Eli walks with the book and Carnegie pursues him for the book. The real mystery is why Eli has to walk west. What's to be gained? What's the destination? That gets explained in the last part of the movie.Reaching the Pacific Coast, Eli and his travelling companion Solara (Mila Kunis) discover a colony of survivors at Alcatraz which has devoted itself to preserving some vestige of human culture - including the sacred books of the various religions. Eli - who by this time no longer has the book, but after 30 years has it memorized verse by verse, begins to recite it, as Lombardi (played in an uncredited role by Malcolm McDowell) - the leader of this colony - writes it down. A printing press having been put back into working order, the final scene of the movie has the Bible once again printed and placed on a shelf among other sacred books.With the good performances from Washington and Oldman at the centre, this is also an interesting reflection on the power and influence of the Bible, and how it can be used for good or evil, depending on who's making use of it.",The Book of Eli
37,thesar-2,Get booked and break a few eggs,8,27 June 2010,"The journey of Eli and his book was hard for me to follow. No, not intellectually, it was just plain boring for the most part. But, be the one person out there to take my advice: stay on Eli's journey through the end. It's worth the trip.The Book of Eli is one of those movies that grows on you, despite the depressing and redundant opening of ""a man on a barren, Post-Apocalyptic road to nowhere."" The one thing that made this stand out from all the Kevin Costner and Mel Gibsons of the world was how incredibly brutal the ""new world"" was.Firstly, I'm not big on the ""Boy and his Dog"" sci-fi/desert films. Heck, I've never seen one Mad Max film. And making it incredibly realistic, bloody, depressing and desolate didn't brighten my skies (in fact, they were dishearteningly orange here) though it did perk my interest in how incredibly real they made this film.Staying with the movie will do you justice as, despite the clichés and predictable characters and their stereotypical actions, the more revealed, the more refreshing the movie becomes. I even found myself questioning why Denzel would want to step into Eli's shoes for 2 minutes, let alone 2 hours..but, he had the pleasure of reading the whole script prior to signing on.Wanderer Eli, (Washington) carries with him an important message found in an important book for nearly 30 years. Things don't look good for him, all around, as people living in a post-apocalyptic world haven't bothered to rebuild for a few decades. This doesn't deter Eli from headingwest.He's a messenger and a warrior. If anyone knows me, or reads my reviews, they know I love super-human characters, and Eli's one of them; he's even better than Jason Voorhees with a machete. So, those scenes of him fighting impossible odds amongst Hills-having-Eye's survivors did perk my interest.Unfortunately, my attention went up and down with the few action sequences and the clichéd and normal hierocracy characters (enter Oldman in one of his least interesting characters to date and Kunis trying to break free of (or forget) both Sarah Marshall and Meg Griffin) until more and more of the screenplay revealed itself and Eli's true stance and motivation.I was brought up Christian. And believe it or not, this was a refreshing movie to watch – if you watch it through to the end and that's no spoiler – any person with an above 15 IQ can detect the religious context of the movie's title. My first reaction following the credits, however, was that this was far too violent for a ""Christian"" or any religious audience and that's too bad that it might not be viewed by more people. But, then again, if you think about itthe Bible's pretty – no, make that enormously – violent in some spots. I think I remember the old Psalm that spoke about ""you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs."" Ohmaybe that wasn't Psalms, but you get the drift.",The Book of Eli

39,Robert_duder,"Solid action flick, bleak and twisted, well worth seeing!",8,6 February 2010,"I sort of anticipated Book of Eli potentially being a solid 9 or 10 for me. I suppose high expectations are dangerous. Still Book of Eli was a hell of a good time!! It just wasn't quite as epic feeling as I expected. It was more mainstream action than I expected. I sort of had an idea of it being like a post-apocalyptic western feel and it really doesn't. Instead of it being about the post-apocalyptic world, its all about Eli and his book. The post-apocalyptic world is simply matter-of-fact. Its been that way for thirty years or more. I think the mark of a great film (or at least extremely entertaining) is that it makes you want to see it again IMMEDIATELY. This can be done, and usually is with a terrific end twist like The Sixth Sense, or The Others and now Book of Eli. The twist at the end is really fascinating and makes you think well now I have to see the whole thing again to see how they pulled that off and although I haven't watched it again I think they kept it going throughout very well. The action in the movie was downright stunning. Washington's outright kick ass moves in the film (or his stunt doubles) are flawless and just get your adrenaline pumping.Denzel Washington and I have a love/hate relationship. Sometimes I just find his performances shallow and egotistical. Like the whole time he's showing off that he IS Denzel Washington. However sometimes, in fact most of the time his movies are just really cool and fun to watch despite him. I even really enjoyed the critically panned Taking of Pelham 123. The Book of Eli he is truly excellent in as Eli. His quiet, dark, moody character fits the story perfectly and he really proves why he is a leading star. Mila Kunis seems to be a very good actor however I didn't feel she was right for this role. She does good in the part and her and Washington have good chemistry and play off each other well but she just looks too perfect to be a post apocalyptic world. Still she pulls it off and I wouldn't be disappointed to see her, in her character come back for a sequel. Gary Oldman is an absolute master of character acting. That's why I was a little surprised and disappointed in his performance as the lead villain. I just found his role as Carnegie a little laid back and didn't really show off any teeth. He was kind of a half asleep mob boss. He could have and should have been cut throat and downright evil but wasn't. Jennifer Beals should be mentioned not because of her role which was very small and hardly important but she looked incredible!! At 45 she looked as good as she did 25 years ago.The Book of Eli is really the perfect mainstream powerhouse film. It'll likely make most of its money on DVD and Blu Ray but still has all the makings of a great hit movie. You won't be disappointed for a minute and you'll be thoroughly entertained. The plot is very simple and straightforward but interesting enough to keep you hooked. The Hughes Brothers haven't done a film in nearly a decade but they seem to really go for the throat when it comes to mainstream entertainment. My only complaint with the movie is that I wanted more...I wanted more about the world, more about the apocalypse and the villages and the people and even Eli himself. Maybe its something to be explored in sequels but I have the feeling we won't see a sequel to the film. Instead its like they cut out all the real meat and left in just the really entertaining stuff. But that doesn't make a bad movie, in fact it makes a terrifically entertaining movie. Treat yourself to a great action sci-fi film that is a million miles from an epic like Avatar but right on par with other great films like I Am Legend. 8/10",The Book of Eli
40,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Dreary entry into the sci-fi action genre even Denzel can't save,4,20 June 2010,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning It's your typical post apocalyptic, Mad Max esquire setting for this type of film and in a San Francisco torn apart by God knows what, a lone warrior named Eli (Denzel Washington) wonders with a mysterious book that has some mystical powers. When he wonders into a lawless ghost town run by the villainous Carnegie (Gary Oldman), he has a few run ins with his henchmen that result in him being pursued relentlessly, along with a young girl named Solara (Mila Kunis), desperate to escape, unaware of the road the books power will take them down.According to an interview with Empire Magazine, Denzel Washington chose the script to The Book of Eli on the advice of his son, who also recommended American Gangster and Training Day. On the basis of this, his son certainly prefers him to be in more violent films, and on this score he's been spot on again...sadly, his penchant for recommending quality scripts has failed him on this occasion.Opening in this ravaged futuristic landscape, we're served no introduction into how this world came about (as is supposed to be the norm in these type of films?!?) and are just ushered straight into this dull, humourless tale, with dreary cinematography set against bleak backdrops from The Hughes Brothers. From here on in, it just plays out strictly by the numbers, with a predictable script and wooden dialogue that just serve to make it even more dreary. Performances wise, Oldman simply goes through the motions as the villain while Denzel just feels miscast, respectfully maybe a little too past it for a role like this. It's just a carbon copy Mad Max knock off, with a creepy element of subconscious Bible bashing when the ending finally trots on by. **",The Book of Eli
41,bowmanblue,"Enjoyable, if predictable",7,12 August 2021,"I know that a lot of people absolutely love this film and find it hard to say anything negative about it and I'm certainly not intended to slate it beyond all reason. However, I've watched it a few time (so it can't be that bad, right?) and always been left with a feeling that, although it's certainly good, judging by the heavyweights in the cast and overall budget, it just could have been much better still.The ever-excellent Denzil Washington plays a loner who's surviving in one of those 'post apocalyptic worlds' that seem to be common in film and TV shows these days (think the desert-like setting from the 'Mad Max' movies). He's your typical no-nonsense badass who's been charged with the task of transporting the last copy of a book to a specific location (I'm not sure whether the exact book is supposed to be some sort of secret or not, therefore I won't mention it in case it's technically a 'spoiler,' but when I first watched it, I guessed what the book was pretty quickly). There is another 'plot point' that I certainly won't mention, as I definitely didn't see it coming - and, just for the record, found it a little 'implausible!'However, life on the road is fraught with dangers - not just the random thugs wanting to either steal his weapons and water, but a local governor of a town (Gary Oldman) who knows about the book and wants it for himself in order to increase his power.There's very little I can say about the film that's bad. Obviously, with Washington and Oldman as the leads you know you're in for some good performances. However, it just seemed like both actors could do so much better. Everyone's seen them give numerous great performances, but here they just seem like they're 'phoning it in' a bit. However, even an average performance from either of them still elevates the film from just another sci-fi survival film to something at least worth a bit of your time.There are other good names on the cast list - everyone from Mila Kunis to Malcolm McDowell pop up and are all perfectly functional for their role. I guess that's a word I'd use to describe 'The Book of Eli' - functional. Despite it's stellar cast list and epic setting, it just comes across to me as another 'Mad Max-esque' movie. It's certainly not bad and if you're interested in that type of film then I'm sure most people won't feel that they've wasted their time watching it.",The Book of Eli
42,dromasca,watchable but superficial,4,22 January 2011,"Post-apocalyptic movies are by no means unexplored territory. 'The Book of Eli' has a very strong idea which gave it the premises to be different. To a large extent it failed.As '2012' happens to have been the previous film that I had seen I can say that to a certain extent 'The Book of Eli' happens a few decades after '2012' ends. it is just that nobody prepared big ships to save mankind, and the survivors seem to be in their greatest majority the strong and the mean. Worst than this, society lost its memory, including most of the technology and social skills and above all morality. Books are forgotten, reading is not taught any longer to the younger generations, and above all religious books and especially The Bible were destroyed, as they were perceived as the root of the evil that almost destroyed the planet. All Bibles but one.The motive of the film would have allowed a deep introspection into the dichotomy of religion as savior and molder of the moral fiber of humanity, and as factor of destruction and fanaticism. Unfortunately this is not the film that 'The Book of Eli' is on screens. There are two reasons for this. One is that the Hughes brothers (whose previous 'From Hell' is maybe the best jack Ripper film made ever) chose to focus on the spectacular aspects of the post-apocalyptic world vision rather than on the psychological aspects. Solving such a deep dilemma with the tools of the good guys vs. bad guys tools is cheap, even if a lot of talent was invested in building the vision. Second the moralistic approach is dogmatic and the ultimate result seems dogmatic. Believers will be satisfied by the approach. Skeptics will not be convinced. I am a skeptic.We are so left with a film which is much better than the usual post-apocalyptic stuff, but much less than it could have been. I liked the exquisite camera work. I enjoyed acting, Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman are very well cast and fit the vision of the directors. I liked much less the details of the loss of memory of mankind - these are not very original or credible. Despite the very interesting premises we are left in 'The Book of Eli' only with a well filmed and well acted and very watchable version of humanity in rags and with a religious predicament that many of us could have skipped.",The Book of Eli

It just turned into a guy trying to avoid dumb bad guys, save the girl, and save a book. The turns out to be a bible that is the last remaining copy. All other bibles have been burned when society was destroyed. Even shampoo is very valuable in this new world.The movie mentions cannibalism, but it's never really shown. They could have done that to have some good gore. Instead we see 2 old people with the shakes.As I mentioned, the chase between the bad guys and the good guys(Eli and Solara) was very boring, nothing new and nothing cool.

But Carnegie is bent on taking that book so he can display his evil across what's left of the remaining world.The acting is brilliant. I already said things abut Denzel. Gary Oldman is perhaps the best villain around. His recent films such as Harry Potter and Batman had him playing good guys. But, it was nice to see him return to his Air Force One and Lost In Space roots.Also, this film is not religious propaganda. I can't believe how many people think that is.

I loved the way it looked, I adored the set-pieces, and I especially loved Denzel Washington's bad ass performance. This seriously echoed Mad Max in a lot of ways, but in my opinion it did it just as good. I loved the storyline of Eli wanting to be the only person to touch his sacred bible, it really made for thrilling times. Despite what the trailers lead you to believe, this isn't fully action orientated. It is filled with breath-taking action sequences, as one would expect, but it has a lot of mystery to it as well. Gary Whitta|The Writer| does an excellent job of keeping Eli's character not only mysterious, but keeping continuous interest in the character as well. I thought the ending was very fitting for this movie, and I loved how it was all done. My only complaint about this movie is that it lagged in the middle for a brief time.Performances. Denzel Washington is a certified bad ass here. Just the way he acts, the way he moves was purely awesome. He's not just a regular hero either, he was an anti-hero. It was one of his best performances without a doubt. Gary Oldman is the perfect villainy foe here. He doesn't go OTT like he has in the past, and did it with menace and convincing here. I loved every moment he was on-screen. Mila Kunis is great as Solara. Not only great eye-candy, but she delivered a solid performance as well. Jennifer Beals is good as the blind-mom, and we are able to feel sympathy for her. Malcolm McDowell has a great cameo at the end.Bottom line. This was highly entertaining stuff.

Apparently this is a movie, and not just a bunch of sentences and paragraphs written in high-definition.In a post-apocalyptic America, an enigmatic wanderer, Eli (Denzel Washington), heads towards the San Francisco Bay where he hopes to deliver the last copy of the Holy Bible to a group of antiquarians. Unfortunately, while resting in a roadside community, he and his propensity to preach scripture attracts the attention of Carnegie (Gary Oldman), an ambitious tyrant who desires the good book to beguile people and secure an authoritative position. Unwilling to relinquish his property or fail in his mission, Eli and his new ward (Mila Kunis) continue on with their pilgrimage, with Carnegie in hot pursuit.Though it's set against a cookie-cutter wasteland, The Book of Eli manages to blend break- neck violence with biblical verse, creating a rousing, slightly optimistic interpretation of life after Armageddon.And while stopping Eli is unlikely, you could stall him by means of lengthy theological debate by introducing him to the guy carrying around the last copy of the Qur'an.

What and why does Eli looking into the car? Oh...it's answered in the few scenes. Contrast devastated highway scene to the one in Constantine (2005). Nice use of having a bottle just in case to catch any drop of water, even though there isn't likely to be any. There is good use of a silhouette early on. The dried out and devoid, washout landscape and scenery is both fascinating and sloppy looking at the same time. It doesn't appear genuine but it still has a compelling color design sense. There is an almost animated, surrealistic feel to this look of this movie yet as the same time it is compellingly dreamlike without breaking the tone or mood of the movie as artificial, like a great artwork of painting.There are small details that are usually missed in most post-apocalyptic movies that this movie has incorporated - such as the discovery of a small bottle of shampoo, that provide another layered authenticity into this movie, a more dense, rich setting and compelling environment in which these actors perform, much in the way Bladerunner (1982) and Alien (1979) were multi-layered. As in Waterworld, there is a careful attention to bartering and the skeptical attention to a ritual of suspicion in every act, a matter of trust, mistrust and survival. There are elements in one scene 30 minutes into the movie of Kill Bill No. 1 (2003) but in a more underplayed way that appears more stylistic, controlled, almost a artful ballet. Gary Oldman is in sharp contrast from his role in The Fifth Element (1997), The Dark Knight (2008) and plays it much more close to the chest in a much more refined role of evil in a way that's more subtle than Tim Thomerson as Lester portrays in Cherry 2000 (1987).The acting is much less over the top and focused, crisp without the Mad Max: The Road Warrior (1981) heroics or antics. Blind, she's blind? But to what purpose? There's not enough back story nor might it even be possible to have had one incorporated into the movie, unless there had been a substantial re-write. What's with ""two"" women anyway? Oh...again...that's why. There is also a deeper sense of the spiritual, unlike that of Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) and in some ways a retro-sci fi movie in that it incorporates elements or at least values of an older contemporary time and eventually seems to descend into a post-modern western, including to its slight detriment an idealistic shootout that might have been better shoot using some of the elements from Bourne Identity (2002) instead.There is a style of death in this movie that is distinguished and more potent in its delivery than most action adventure movies as well as a distinctive twist to the traditional storyline in terms of timing and denouement. There is a balanced element to this movie, a movie that doesn't depend on continuous action or philosophizing or stylish pretentiousness. In sum, much like 1408 (2007) distinguished itself as the new horror genre movie, The Book of Eli (2010) has much the same elements and tones, colors, in addition to a lavish devastated landscape and careful attention to detail in developing a new level of post-apocalyptic movies, or perhaps post-Road Warrior.",The Book of Eli

Gary Oldman is in sharp contrast from his role in The Fifth Element (1997), The Dark Knight (2008) and plays it much more close to the chest in a much more refined role of evil in a way that's more subtle than Tim Thomerson as Lester portrays in Cherry 2000 (1987).The acting is much less over the top and focused, crisp without the Mad Max: The Road Warrior (1981) heroics or antics. Blind, she's blind? But to what purpose? There's not enough back story nor might it even be possible to have had one incorporated into the movie, unless there had been a substantial re-write. What's with ""two"" women anyway? Oh...again...that's why. There is also a deeper sense of the spiritual, unlike that of Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) and in some ways a retro-sci fi movie in that it incorporates elements or at least values of an older contemporary time and eventually seems to descend into a post-modern western, including to its slight detriment an idealistic shootout that might have been better shoot using some of the elements from Bourne Identity (2002) instead.There is a style of death in this movie that is distinguished and more potent in its delivery than most action adventure movies as well as a distinctive twist to the traditional storyline in terms of timing and denouement. There is a balanced element to this movie, a movie that doesn't depend on continuous action or philosophizing or stylish pretentiousness. In sum, much like 1408 (2007) distinguished itself as the new horror genre movie, The Book of Eli (2010) has much the same elements and tones, colors, in addition to a lavish devastated landscape and careful attention to detail in developing a new level of post-apocalyptic movies, or perhaps post-Road Warrior.",The Book of Eli
53,The-Sarkologist,One of the Best Post-Apocalyptic Films I have seen in a long time,8,12 January 2013,"This is one of the best post-apocalyptic movies that I have ever seen and in a way I am surprised that it was ever made because it is all about one man's quest to save the bible. In fact, it is about one man's quest to make sure that the bible does not disappear from human history and knowledge and that future generations have a chance to hear the message of salvation that the bible offers. Mind you, ironically, when you actually see the end of the film you will note that a copy of the Torah and other Jewish writings have also been preserved, and I also wonder whether the Injil (the Arabic translation of the New Testament) is also on that shelf (the Koran is), but that is beside the point. Also, throw in some awesome fight scenes, and Gary Oldman as the villain, and you have a brilliant movie (not to mention that Eli does not actually kill the villain, but rather the villain brings his destruction upon himself because of his obsession with getting his hands on a bible, not for good, but for evil).Basically the world has been destroyed, and what it sounds like is that the nuclear war caused the ozone layer to collapsed resulting in the Earth pretty much burning up, however people managed to survive underground. After about a year, they returned to the surface, and the first thing they did was pretty much destroy all of the bibles they could find (believing that this one book was the cause of the collapse of civilisation). However Eli has a vision, is led to the remaining copy of the bible and the begins a thirty year trek to get the bible to the place that it has to get to. Mind you, the thirty year journey (and they probably should have made it forty to keep with the biblical imagery) had another purpose, as you will see in the film. I suspect that the writers were actually quite clever in this, in that God never actually does things by halves, and when he sends you on a journey that lasts thirty (or forty) years which may only take three years, there is a purpose, and it is clear that this purpose comes out in this film.One of the things that I did not realise about this movie, which is interesting because this was not raised in Mad Max, and that is cannibalism. You will note that when Eli enters an establishment he has to show his hands, and this is because the lack of tremors in his hands (and when you know this you will realise something about somebody later on in the movie) shows that he is not a cannibal. Apparently if you eat human meat then you develop what is in effect Mad Cow Disease (and the reason that it is called that is because ground beef was making its way into the feed lots of cattle). I suspect the whole trembling hand issues was not known back when Mad Max was made which is probably why it was not shown, but then on the other hand, while homosexuality was implied amongst the gangs, cannibalism was not.One of the other things I noted about this film was the whole idea of water being a commodity, and the main reason that Carnigie had such power was because he had access to clean, fresh, drinking water. In a post apocalyptic world, water is going to be far more important than petrol (though it seemed that Carnigie also had access to petrol as well as food).I guess the other thing that I loved about this film was the way that it ended. Many films end with the good guy triumphing and the bad guy losing, and that is the case with this film, however it does not simply come down to the good guy killing the bad guy. In more ways Eli recognises that while he is on what is effect a holy quest, he himself is not the most holiest of men. In fact he acknowledges that he is as flawed as the next person, it is just that he is a flawed man who has been chosen by God to perform a task, and it is not an easy task. It is something that many of us can take away from this film. We may be flawed, and we may not be perfect, but God can and still does use us. In fact, not only does God know that we are capable of performing the task at had, but he will even give us assistance (as he does Eli) it completing it.",The Book of Eli
54,zkonedog,"Finally, A Religiously-Oriented Film That Doesn't Pander/Preach",7,12 March 2017,"When it comes to films with religious trappings, one of two things usually happens: It either bashes all other religions in favor of the one being espoused, or gets a little too preachy and fawns all over itself. Book of Eli does neither of those things; instead letting the viewer decide the importance/meaning of the religious undertones.For a basic plot summary, Book of Eli focuses on a lone traveler (Denzel Washington) trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic America. When one day he wanders into a rebuilding community, he is harassed by a man (Gary Oldman) who desires a powerful book that the traveler has in his possession.The plot of this film is okay, though at times predictable and/or slow. However, there are three areas in which the film really excels:-Acting: Denzel and Oldman both give strong, professional performances, while Mila Kunis proves more than just a pretty face as well.-Imagery: The depiction of a completely desolate, war-torn nation is very powerful and interesting. You never know what sort of crazy character you might meet next.-Religious Themes: The concept of religion is central to the entire film, but is shown as a potential force for good or evil.Thus, although Book of Eli isn't a masterpiece, it is easily interesting enough to entertain fans of Washington, thriller/action, and heavy thematic material.",The Book of Eli
55,Floated2,Unique and Interesting take,7,7 January 2017,"The Book of Eli (2010) is an intriguing and post-apocalyptic thriller from the Hughes Brothers (Dead Presidents) which teeters on the edge of the preposterous but is pulled back from the brink by a still, masterful performance from star Denzel Washington as the sage on a religious odyssey. The action, may be far and in between though is very gritty and well directed with the help of its stunning visuals. Though, the Book of Eli is not your usual post-apocalyptic fare. Even if it does get a bit daft towards the end (thanks, Malcolm McDowell) this is superior action fare, neatly shot and whip-dashingly edited.

58,digitalbeachbum,Has some good individual scenes but overall is unrealistic.,1,5 May 2019,"The Book of Eli is an interesting story but lacks any realism to it. This ""book"" or bible is supposed to be the last one in existence. I find that hard to believe considering that the bible holds the record for the most printed book in the history of mankind. It can't be the last book and he certainly wouldn't know it.I think the creation of this script started out with an idea, ""what if the last version of the bible was in braille?"", then they went off and created a story around this idea. While this was a good plan, it was poorly executed and not realistic.There are countless scenes where the setting is ruined by unrealistic action, decision making and script. There are too many errors which break the concentration of the logic and flow of the movie. I couldn't help myself but to think, ""no, that wouldn't happen"" or ""that's stupid because what logical person would do this?""So, when he arrives at the destination he meets a guy who is telling him that they are going to teach everyone what they lost, and they are going to rebuild the world. Obviously, a scientist given the collection of items around him wouldn't be concerned about religious books. Yet, the final scene shows the bible being put on the shelf with other holy books. They also print more than one copy of the book, which they wouldn't do that at all.Science doesn't need the bible, nor does it need any other holy books. I would suspect that they would destroy all version of them to keep them out of the hands of stupid people.This is a terrible movie. Poorly executed. Terrible acting. Terrible action. Terrible script. Terrible direction.",The Book of Eli
59,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Post-apocalyptic ""Eli"" covers up weak plot with solid development and action",7,19 January 2010,"Everybody's talking about what happens after the apocalypse these days.  ""The Book of Eli"" is sort of the boiling point of this science-fiction  concept, a combination of last year's ""The Road"" and George Miller's  ""The Road Warrior."" America is a post-apocalyptic wasteland and Denzel  Washington is the only self-sufficient badass. So originality is not  exactly ""Eli's"" calling card, but it clearly establishes its ruinous  world and the Hughes brothers (""From Hell"") take good care of its  characters while supplying top-notch action.  Washington stars as our stolid protagonist, Eli, journeying westward  with his canteen, a large machete, a couple guns and a special  leather-bound book. He lives on an Earth that was fried 30 years before  by the sun because of a war that ripped a hole through the ozone layer.  Sun-goggled bikers run amok pillaging, killing and raping passers-by,  yet Eli is morally sound and focused on keeping his book safe no matter  what so he can deliver it somewhere out west.  Although written by a first-time screenwriter and former PC Gamer  editor, Gary Whitta, ""Eli"" impressively creates its world between the  sunglasses/goggles due to the sun's power, trading of goods because  money's obsolete and the constant examining of hands to determine if  someone is jittery from eating too much human flesh. Whitta also places  Eli squarely in the story. He's a good but dangerous man who's not  afraid to kill, and as he sits idly by as a couple gets attacked, it's  abundantly clear that this is a world where compassion is secondary to  survival and self-interest.  Where the plot comes in is ""Eli's"" weak link. It doesn't try too hard  to hide just what exactly the book is and that sort of dissolves some  of the film's mystique. The plot is essentially Eli wants to protect it  and take it west and he has a run in with Carnegie (Gary Oldman), an  older man who runs a small town and desires it for selfish  power-related reasons. Along the way, anyone who threatens to lay a  hand on Eli gets sliced up or shot. In the two or three fight scenes  where he takes down numerous guys at once, you can't help but wonder  why after he kills the first few guys, the others don't run the hell  away, especially considering people are otherwise in self-preservation  mode living in a wasteland (and they know nothing of the book).  The Hughes brothers make those scenes worthwhile, however. There's a  style and grace to their action scenes -- they create a sort of a  moving tableau in some scenes and execute a wide range of tempos in the  action sequences to make them more intense. When Carnegie's men  encounter Eli and the young woman (Mila Kunis) that he inspires who  follows him at the home of some old folks (cameos by famous Brits  Frances De La Tour and Michael Gambon), they place the camera in the  middle of the action and sweep along with the gunfire (part- digitally)  from one side to the other. It's very cool and is an example of one way  the Hugheses keep the focus away from the plot's shaky skeleton. I only  have beef with their excessive slow-motion walking-toward-the-camera  shots and showing a bit too much of the cloudy green-gray sky.  Some people are going to be more surprised and impressed with the  film's big reveal than others, but anyone with a love of action and  that post-apocalyptic context will find something to make ""Eli"" a  worthwhile watch regardless of plot weakness. Washington is slightly  under-utilized but he's an ideal fit. He brings an intensity in his  demeanor that makes him an intriguing character and the film does a  good job of making his character more central than anything else.  ~Steven C",The Book of Eli
60,imseeg,"This movie wants to be tough looking, but it aint. It wants to be dark, but it aint. It is merely a SOFT action hero movie, trying to be something it isnt:cool.",5,11 September 2019,"Denzel Washington is a lonesome tough criminal, who has to protect the most precious book on earth, which could save mankind's future. Will he succeed in protecting it?I really value Denzel Washington as an actor. Gary Oldman as well. But they both have to star in a story that just isnt credible, because it wants to be tough looking and menacing, but it aint. I mean, come on, I just cant believe in this character of a supposedly tough killer (Denzel Washington), when he is listening to Al Green on his Ipod, wearing designer sunglasses, mumbling some airheaded, supposedly deep oneliners. I like Mila Kunis as well as an actress, but her role is as airheaded and flat as possible as well. Great actors, crippled by a boring, overly serious, NOT credible story.This is one of those movies that tries so hard to look tough and cool, that it gets tedious. It is best suited for those who love stereotypical action hero figures, who always win every fight, can evade any bullet storm by 10 other gangsters and get to take home the prettiest girl in the end. Boring and predictable and without any jokes, but there is certainly a market for these kind of ""wannabe cool"" movies ...",The Book of Eli
61,Vartiainen,Stylish post-apocalyptic western,7,4 August 2015,"The world has fallen and to walk outside is to be constantly blinded by glaring sun, howling wind and the vast emptiness of the realm of man. And in this emptiness a man walks towards west, the Pacific Ocean as his goal. With him he carries a book.And yeah, don't get your hopes up, you know which book it is. No surprises there. But, that's not the point of the film. It's not about which book it is, but rather how far people are willing to go for a book like it. It's about how much power there is in words written just right.It's a fascinating idea and it gives the movie more depth. On the surface The Book of Eli is nothing more than another post-apocalyptic survival action film with stylized western look, but Denzel Washington and The Hughes Brothers give it a more thoughtful tone through Washington's character Eli. He's a stone cold badass, more than capable of meeting any threat he faces head on, but he carries himself more like a pilgrim. This is most apparent when he speaks with Mila Kunis's character Solara.The story is also excellently paced, with enough room given for both action and more quiet scenes where the world building and the exploration of the movie's themes happen. Very much goldilocks as far as the balance goes. Plus, all the characters and the actors that play them are interesting, with Kunis and Washington being the main focus, while Gary Oldman once again plays the crazed suave bad guy that he does so well.What ultimately keeps The Book of Eli from being a masterpiece is the predictability. There is a twist near the end of the film which I did not see coming, but the identity of the book was very clichéd as were the characters to some extent. And I do like the characters, but they were pretty much textbook archetypes.Nevertheless, it's more than worth checking out if you like post-apocalyptic films, especially ones with something to say.",The Book of Eli
62,Turfseer,Attention all Atheists and disbelievers: 'The Book of Eli' begins with the letter 'B',5,19 March 2011,"For those who were unable to suspend their disbelief (or more importantly, their common sense) regarding the many implausible moments in 'The Book of Eli', let me say unequivocally that I am with you! However, let me explain why I gave this film a 5 out of 10 (or a '3' out of '5' on Amazon) despite finding the whole thing quite hokey. First of all, there are many films that are far worse than this one; secondly, I thought that the cgi effects and set design were actually quite good, especially the way in which the filmmakers created their 'equivalent' wild west post-apocalyptic town; and finally, the film actually has engendered a great deal of internet postings defending the many absurd, implausible ideas and scenes utilizing all kinds of tortured reasoning, which I found quite enjoyable to read! The Hughes Brothers have come a long way since their urban crime drama, Menace II Society. They have proved they can proffer up a post-apocalyptic shoot-em-up as good as any mainstream director. Taking a cue from M. Night Shyamalyn's 'Sixth Sense', not only do they know how to dispatch (i.e. 'off') the bad guys in a multitude of creative ways (hands chopped off, cross-bow shootings, one gunshot take downs, etc.), they also can throw in all kinds of clues, pointing to the fact (SPOILERS AHEAD—DON'T READ IF YOU WANT THE TWIST ENDING SPOILED FOR YOU) that Denzel Washington (Eli) has been blind all along. How exactly is Eli able to kill all those biker dudes (first with a knife and later with a gun) without being able to see them? The answer, of course, is in the 'book' itself. Wouldn't you know it, but the Book of Eli begins with a 'B'; yep, shock of all shocks, it's THE BIBLE!!! Channeling 'Ben Hur', the Hughes Brothers make the argument that miracles can be found even in a post-apocalyptic world! Like the Apostle Paul, Eli's 'faith' allows him to miraculously survive multiple onslaughts, including a bullet direct to the gut by bad guy Carnegie.The warmed-over Christian shibboleth that miracles occur due to 'belief in faith alone' is just another canard where we must suspend our disbelief in order to enjoy this film. But there's one small problem. Eli has been carrying one copy of the Bible that he's been trying to memorize for years, and it's in Braille!!! Since the Bible in Braille would consist of many heavy volumes, this is one plot point which even some of the most fanatical defenders of the film, have trouble explaining away.There are other moments in 'Eli' which I still had a lot of trouble explaining away myself. What about Eli walking around for days after having stocked up with only a canteen of water? All the copies of the Christian Bible have been burned but copies of the Jewish Bible and Koran end up on the library shelf at Alcatraz? And how exactly did he escape from the room when Carnegie and his thugs lock him up? I guess Eli finds a 'way' because all those who believe in God, manage to do so.Perhaps one of the most weakest ideas in 'Eli' is Carnegie's belief that obtaining the Bible will enable him to extend his power. Since he and Eli are only a few of the people who actually have heard of The Bible, why does he assume that introducing it to the post-apocalyptic survivors will enable him to bring them under his fold? Since the majority of people in the new world have little or no knowledge of prior literature, Carnegie could have wrote his own book which he could have used to sway the masses. Of course, somehow the Bible is supposed to have some kind of a mystical, intrinsic power (perhaps rays emanating from the book itself) which leads Carnegie to believe he can use it as a brainwashing tool. Since it's never demonstrated how Carnegie could become more powerful by getting hold of The Bible, the stakes are never high enough for us to care whether Carnegie gets the book or not. Now if Eli knew the location of a nuclear bomb, that's a Macguffin that I could believe Carnegie would want to get his hands on! There seems little doubt that the most completely miscast actor in 'The Book of Eli' is Mila Kunis. She seems so out of place in this film that her performance actually drags the film down a notch or two. USA Today film critic Claudia Puig couldn't have said it better about Kunis in her film review: ""Vacuous and far too glam, she looks as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial."" Didn't anyone find it a bit ridiculous how Solara (Kunis) suddenly acquires Eli's amazing martial arts-like skills and takes down most of Carnegie's henchmen in one of the final scenes? Denzel also has become painfully one-note in many of his recent film roles as a middle-aged actor.Finally, I'd like to chime in on the controversy as to whether Eli has converted to Islam when he arrives on 'Alcatraz Island'. A Muslim is not allowed to read any religious book except the Koran, so when Eli dresses up in a white robe as he translates the Bible, I think the Hughes Brothers were suggesting that all along he was some kind of post-apocalyptic Essene. Just my interpretation! I would like to thank all the faith-based defenders of 'The Book of Eli' along with all those who employ tortured reasoning to explain all the ridiculous goings-on in this film. Without you, I would never have enjoyed this film as much as I did and given it a passable rating.",The Book of Eli
63,Chris Knipp,The keeper of The Book,6,17 January 2010,"The Book of Eli (by the Hughes brothers, who directed Menace II Society and Dead Presidents) is a bleached-out apocalyptic tale like The Road, but more of just a Hollywood movie. That's not to say it's without merit. Its monochrome imagery is occasionally stunning. Its hero played by Denzel Washington is mysterious and noble and the story has an O.Henry-style ending that may catch you off guard. That title itself is a key to the puzzle that makes sense only when all the other pieces are in place.It's instructive to compare The Book of Eli with The Road. The latter may seem drab to those looking for slam-bang adventure, but it has the lion's share of humanity and sense. Both movies concern men wandering across ravaged landscapes at a desperate future time when most of the planet has been scorched. The man in The Road is with his little boy, and the one in Eli picks up a pretty woman. That's a big, important difference. The Road's Man (Viggo Mortensen) is pitiful and vulnerable and touchingly caring, protective, and afraid for his son and for himself. In The Book of Eli Denzel Washington has a solitary dignity, but he has to care about nobody, only the special Book he carries. He is a superhero; in frequent encounters, he is invincible. Using a brace of weaponry he keeps secreted on his person, he wipes out bands of brigands and bad guys in seconds; in a Kung Fu movie this wouldn't be interesting because he doesn't seem challenged, though the long ringing blade he wields links him with Kung Fu heroes. The Road is really concerned with what it would be like for ordinary folk to live in the world with everything gone. The Book of Eli is just telling a snappy story of heroes and villains and sexy babes. This difference is why the one is so much more emotionally affecting than the other, though I admit I had been set up to identify and weep with Man and Boy because I had read Cormac McCarthy's very sad, beautiful, and ultimately strangely hopeful novel.Anyway, both films share a beached-out look but their superficially similar images are themselves different in a key way. The Book of Eli's bleach-and-tint has an obviously lab-polished look. The Road's scenes are grayed-out too, but in a way that's more pale and natural and seems part of the landscape itself, which is depressing rather than stylized. Apart from the sci-fi element it shares with any future tale, The Road is a more realistic story, stripped of all frills. McCarthy just took everything away and set down two desperate, fearful souls upon a barren land where the few other remaining humans were as desperate and afraid as the Man and the Boy but more violent. They're scavenging and surviving, not doing battle against all comers.The world of The Book of Eli isn't so stripped-down, after all. The people, who in spots are numerous, have water sources, battery electric power, and old cars and trucks that run on fossil fuel, though only for the kingpin who controls them. This is a narrative full of violent encounters, and its look is processed, sepia-tented and stylized, like a music video -- it's elegant, but not real. The sources are obvious as soon as you see all the scruffy bad guys in motorcycle outfits and thick WWI-looking goggles, and then we come to a frontier town with a saloon and a presiding villain: Road Warrior is a major influence in populating the Hughes' world, as well as Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns and Zatoichi.The presences of Denzel Washongton as the mysterious heroic wanderer (who carries the planet's sole remaining copy of the Bible) and Gary Oldman as Carnegie, the saloon's presiding strongman boss, call to mind all Denzel's past heroic roles and all Gary's bad movies wherein he's the cackling nasty (his laughter doesn't convince, nor does his set of perfect white teeth befit a world that's lacked amenities for thirty years). Both Denzel and Gary have been around the movie block a few too many times by now. Having Jennifer Beal and Mila Kunis on hand doesn't raise the tone much. If this didn't look like a commercial movie already, they'd clinch that. On the other hand relatively minor characters gain tone by having Tom Waits, Michael Gambon, and Frances de la Tour to play them. The Hughes brothers have plenty of talent, and this is a well-made movie.The writer, Gary Whitta, is ingenious, though his language is pedestrian compared to McCarthy's, and he has provided more details about the origin of his apocalypse only to reveal his concept's incoherence. One can only wonder about how the Bible is going to restore a world that's already blown itself up fighting over religion. If you sit through to the end, however, you will get to see a nice set of tableaux of post-Doomsday San Francisco, beginning with a beat-up Golden Gate Bridge littered with wrecked cars, and then a beautifully jumbled San Francisco skyline like a city turning into a melting sand castle. A colony of survivors welcome Denzel on Alcatraz, ready to repopulate the world with books. Carnegie was an ardent reader, but he only wanted to have the Bible to use it to manipulate people. Sounds vaguely familiar...",The Book of Eli
64,Bezenby,The Book of 'Eh?',5,25 July 2014,"This film starts off fairly well, but so many ridiculous things happen in its second half you'll either be laughing your head off (like we were), or you'll be kicking your television screen in. Things so daft I'm going to have to put a 'spoiler' warning on here in order to talk about them.Denzel Washington is a lone drifter, wandering a burned out land full of outlaws some thirty years after a war has destroyed Earth, scavenging for food and water while slicing up would be bandits. So far so good, eh? I've got to admit, I'm a sucker for post-nuke films, and this one starts out rather atmospherically.Denzel's heading west for some unknown reason, and he's a book in his bag that he protects and stuff. Trouble begins when he ends up at some settlement to get his MP3 player recharged (by shopkeeper Tom Waits, who has a post-nuke face if ever I've seen one). Denzel goes and gets himself into a bar fight while waiting and kills about six hundred bandits before meeting Gary Oldman (who this time seems to be playing a mix of Eric Morcombe, Jack Nicholson and Zorg from Fifth Elementcomplete with a limp later in the film) and his right hand man Titus Pullo from TV series Rome (with random American accent). Gary's in charge of the town due to knowing where fresh water is and surprisingly is looking for some book of some kind. He also wants Denzel to stay, but Denzel's not all about that.As usual, Gary uses some girl to get to Denzel and she finds that he's got some sort of book and lets slip to Garyand (sigh) it's a bible, apparently the only one left in the world (somehow after the war they managed to destroy every single extant bible). This is what Gary's after, as he's going to use it to control people blah blah blah.This leads to a chase (after a gunfight) across the desert landscape (luckily Denzel told Gary he was heading West and just heads that way anyway) which eventually leads to a house where cannibals Francis De La Tour and Michael Gambon live (neither of which do a convincing American accent). This lead to another gunfight, Denzel getting shot, and Titus getting impaled on a sword. Gary does get his book, however, and heads back to town leaving Denzel lying with a single gun shot wound when he could have had a bunch of guys machine gun him to pieces.Bookless, Denzel, with the help of the girl, manages to get to his destination, which turns out to be Alcatraz, which as you might have expected holds the last of civilization who are compiling all books and stuff from the pre-war times, run by Malcolm McDowell, who for some reason has been made up to look like Albert Einstien. This is also where things get really, really stupid (and where major spoilers happen).Turns out that the book was inside Denzel's head all this time, and that the book he had was indeed a bible, but it was in Braille, because Denzel has been blind all this time. Eh? Also, he asks Malcolm McDowell to fetch a pen and start writing down THE ENTIRE BIBLE. With a pen? I hope Malcolm had some ibuprofen handy after that because his wrist is going to knack.It wasn't terrible, believe me, it was okay, but those plots twists were kind of beyond daft.

But I was entertained, I understood what it was trying to say, trying to be different from being just another Mad Max type of film. Denzel Washington gives quite a memorable performance, so does Mila Kunis, now I can tell at first she had trouble holding her own with Denzel, But she gets better with that has it goes on. And some action scenes are good when they come. And there is a surprise twist at the end,which I will not giveaway. But I was entertained.",The Book of Eli
67,freemantle_uk,The Post-Apocalyptic Western,7,19 January 2010,"In a very short space of time two post-apocalyptic films have been release, the brilliant The Road which is aiming for Oscar glory, and the action packed The Book of Eli which is appealing for the mass audience.30 years after a massive war which blow a hole in the sky, possibly a nuclear war, Eli (Denzel Washington) is a lone traveller heading to the West Coast of America. He is a skilled martial artist, armed with guns, a long knife and a bow and is carrying the last King James Bible. On the way he has to avoid and kill hijackers and cannibals. On his travel Eli has to stop off in a ramshackle of a town to buy water and recharge his gear. The town itself run on a barter economy. The leader of the town, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), was impressed by Eli's skill and even more impressed when he found out he can read. Carnegie offer's the traveller a place in his gang. But when Carnegie finds out Eli has the Bible he ends up searching for Eli. The Bible would give Carnegie the ideological based to strengthen his position and expand his power base. Eli goes on the run, hoping to go West and is joined by a young girl Solara (Mila Kunis). He teaches Solara about the Bible and religion and why it is important he goes west.The best thing about the film is the action. It was slick, stylist, well-edited and at times a fine long fixed shots. There are brilliant moments with the way the camera goes through buildings, and follows the action. The Hughes Brothers have good style as action directors, better then say Michael Bay or McG who throw everything at the camera.The story is not that original, there are elements of likes like Mad Max 2 and 3, The Road and the Man With No Name trilogy. But there are interesting ideas, the use of religion as political ideology, the use of religion as political control and showing both the good and bad sides of faith. Most films only show one side of the other: but this does both and I can praise it for that. I think given a bit of fine tuning then this could have been a really good script.As mentioned, the Hughes brothers have style as action directors, but they also filmed in a slightly washed out look, giving the film a more given a gritty, earthy feel. It doesn't camp it up like the third Max Mad film did. They pacing was good for the most part and allow you to get to the character as well as seeing the action. However some moments did drag the film and could have been sped up. Others just didn't fit, like the slightly comical scene with an elderly couple played by Frances de la Tour and Michael Gambon. 10 to 15 minutes could have been cut.Denzel Washington is possibly one of the coolest actors in the world. He was well cast as the protagonist, and since the character is a bit older then usual action hero Washington was the right age for the film. Gary Oldman does his use villainous role he is normally good at, look at his roles in True Romance, Leon, the Fifth Element and Air Force One. He gives his character a young Jack Nicholoson quality, though my brother said he reminded him of Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York. He was good as he normally is. However whilst Mila Kunis is easy on the eye, her performance was weak and wooden. She wasn't believable as a young girl looking for a way out and able to grow as a character. At least she has Family Guy to fall back on. Other smaller roles were also not as convincing as the lead roles.This was a decent film, but there was room for improvement.",The Book of Eli
68,dee.reid,"""The Book of Eli"" and the power of words",8,18 January 2010,"""The Book of Eli"" is a good movie. Not bad, not spectacular, just good, and that's really all that matters for me. Coincidentally, I had high expectations for this movie, and was kind of let down. That reason for the high expectations of course was because it was directed by the Hughes Brothers (twins Allen and Albert) - ""The Book of Eli"" marked their first feature-film since ""From Hell"" in 2001 - and the movie stars Denzel Washington as a Mad Max-/Man With No Name-style lone warrior/savior named Eli, who holds in his possession a book that many men would kill for, and that he would give his life to protect.What redeems the film in the end, ultimately, is its uplifting message about hope and faith, and a twist at the end regarding Eli's true nature and how powerful the book is that is in his possession - thanks largely to Gary Whitta's flawed but enjoyable script. While anyone who paid attention in Sunday school will be able to figure out in two seconds what the Book of Eli actually is, it kind of ruins the movie's credibility in the big pay-off department.""The Book of Eli"" is set some time in the post-apocalyptic future in North America, and Eli (Washington) has spent the last 30 years heading out West to deliver the prized book that is in his possession to a legendary sanctuary out there. Also searching for the book, is the warlord-real estate developer Carnegie (Gary Oldman, doing his usual sadistic psychopath thing), who has been out searching for the book for several years himself so that he can add it to his collection, and has his band of illiterate hired goons scouring the barren landscape for it, raping, pillaging, and killing wherever they see fit. Along the way, Eli also finds some unlikely companionship in Solara (Mila Kunis), a young girl who wishes to break free of Carnegie's totalitarian grasp.This is the first movie I've seen in the theater this year; I can say that it was worth it, thanks greatly to the cool-man performance of Denzel Washington and the direction of the Hughes Brothers. The movie looks great, with its grainy, washed-out cinematography that really makes the desert landscape and all the tiny details of the scenery stand out, especially all the blood & guts. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie from the Hughes Brothers, probably my favorite pair of co-directors working in film. ""Menace II Society"" (1993) was their big break-out hit in the early 1990s, and is one of my top-10 favorite films of all time (#10, to be exact). They don't have too many movies to their credit, but this one was another worthy entry into their catalog.I have to say their direction is what brought me into the theater in the first place. True to their past films, ""The Book of Eli"" is gritty, feels gritty, and is extremely bloody - effectively mixing the post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie, the wild west movie, the samurai movie, and the message movie all into one. The movie takes a while to get going and true to the Hughes Brothers' past films, they've never made a bad movie - but the star-power and the overall look and feel of everything keeps you watching, especially up until the ""big twist"" ending.""The Book of Eli"" is a flawed but enjoyable movie, once you've seen the film's ending and understand the meaning of everything that you've just seen. Trust me, it'll really get you thinking about ""The Book of Eli"" and the power of its words...8/10",The Book of Eli
69,MBunge,A cross between Christian storytelling and post-apocalyptic action,6,25 August 2011,"The Book of Eli is an R rated story about faith that's much more Old Testament than New. It's direct, harsh and mostly unrelenting, looking like a big budget action movie but feeling like a Christian proselytizing film crossed with a low budget 1970s horror flick like The Hills Have Eyes. It's a truly unusual mix which may not be to everyone's taste.Set 30 years something very much like a nuclear war destroyed civilization, Eli (Denzel Washington) is a man walking across what used to be the United States with the last known King James Bible in existence. He's following an inner voice that told him to take the book west, to a place it would be needed and protected. Almost at the end of his journey, Eli encounters a man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman) who desperately wants a Bible of his own. Carnegie wants to use the long forgotten Word as a weapon of religious influence to expand his little empire and is willing to kill to get it. Eli escapes with the Bible and a young girl named Solara (Mila Kunis) who insists on tagging along. Carnegie and his band of armed raiders set off in pursuit, but the deadly chase doesn't turn out the way either the man of the world or the man of God expect.This is a very stark looking movie with some of the most compelling images of ruin and decay you'll ever see. It's not exactly beautiful, but you can't look away from the barren expanse of this devastated place. There are also explosions of violence that are almost poetic and moments when you can really sense the resolve of Eli battling against the hopelessness of his situation.Now, this movie is very slow and solemn and has a brutally simplistic plot. Mila Kunis looks as out-of-place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland as Rush Limbaugh would be at the annual convention of the NAACP. It appears that directors the Hughes brothers have never walked anywhere in their entire lives. The ending also teeters right on the line between clever and ridiculous. I could easily understand someone not enjoying The Book of Eli.However, I like it. I appreciate its parable-like structure, its willingness to not satisfy expectations and the way it takes Christianity seriously in both positive and negative ways. I can recommend it as a serious film about a serious subject told in a serious way, so don't come to it with a frivolous mindset.",The Book of Eli
70,lukem-52760,A REALLY BAD RELIGIOUS & RIDICULOUS MAD MAX,1,27 April 2020,"Denzel Washington is one of the greatest actors in cinema history & i love the guy & most of his films too but this one is ridiculous because the revelation at the end is totally & absolutely ridiculous & makes everything that happened before very stupid & questionable!!!
The look of this post Apocalyptic thriller is excellent & Denzel is excellent in his performance it's just sad the silly outcome of his secret of the character & even more stupid is what he can remember!!!Gary oldman is an excellent actor is great here & the sets look great but it was all pointless because of the stupid end, such a waste",The Book of Eli
71,dworldeater,B movie apocalyptic scfi action with A list cast and budget,7,12 November 2016,"The Book Of Eli is for the genre, a pretty standard post apocalyptic scfi/action flick. The film borrows much from classic westerns and samurai movies. However, this film has a budget and comes off less campy then its predecessors. The film looks awesome and exhibits excellent visual flair and camera-work. While not much about this picture is too original, it is a high quality production and as such delivers as an entertaining action piece. Denzel Washington is great here and plays our strong and mostly silent hero Eli. He gives a very appropriate performance here and does not overact. Denzel does give the character some depth and emotional content that leading actors in this sort of film normally don't bring. Gary Oldman is equally effective as the villain in this piece and brings some complexities to his character as well. The religious/Christian themes to the film are interesting, but do little to set this apart from similar stuff. This was directed by The Hughes Brothers, who are best known for Menace To Society. I think this is a pretty well made film overall, but it is not anything viewers have not seen before.",The Book of Eli
72,Jonny_Numb,Don't Stop Believin',8,25 February 2010,"Religions. There are many of them, and many people who believe in one (or more) of them. And even more who use them as a way to segregate and demonize under the guise of ""uniting."" The stark, post-apocalyptic world of ""The Book of Eli"" is appropriately bleak, with colors so bleached the film is nearly black-and-white (another clever allusion to the divisiveness of spiritual interpretation); but it is also mesmerizing and frequently awe-inspiring. The plot is relatively simple: in the wake of a horrific war, the sun has scorched the earth and blinded the surviving few, all while a black prophet (Denzel Washington) wanders West with a King James Bible en tow, only to attract the attention of the ruler of a shanty town (Gary Oldman), who wants the text to increase his power and manipulate others. As directed by the Hughes Brothers, ""The Book of Eli"" contains moments of striking beauty, tenderness, and horror, without venturing far out into hypocritical action-movie terrain; the barren world is oppressive and populated by sun-baked degenerates, but also portends the hope of something better, even at such a dire point. As Eli, Washington turns in a finely nuanced performance that often relies more on body language than the spoken word; Oldman is his equal as the murderously fanatical (yet chillingly articulate) town authority; and Mila Kunis (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") is impressive as an eager, resilient follower of the reluctantly accepting Eli. The Hughes's capture the desperation of humanity in countless close-ups of cooking asphalt speeding by, long shots of landscapes turned desert-dry by radiation, and probing images of frightened, anxious faces in the grip of desperation; through this, they convey the feeling of a world that has lost nearly everything, and, in turn, everything is at stake. In its final moments, ""The Book of Eli"" opts not for a confrontational showdown between Hero and Villain, but an affirmation of the human spirit that manages to be even more cathartic.7.5 out of 10",The Book of Eli
73,questl-18592,Eli Eli Oh!,8,10 October 2019,"The Book of Eli, to me, is all about the world building. The acting is on point, the action is fun, but I'll keep going back to it for the post-apocalyptic world it's created, a world where water is a highly valued commodity and the sun is apparently the enemy.The unfortunate flip side is that it tends to lay the metaphors and religion on pretty thick. Take that heavy handed approach away and replace it with something more subtle and this would be a phenomenal film but even so, I think I might love this one.",The Book of Eli
74,truemythmedia,I Liked This Better the First Time,6,11 September 2019,"My first thought as I watched was that the opening scene was well done, atmospheric, and told the bleak story of the world the film would take place in. I also noticed the score which has been sampled about a billion times over the years. (I had no idea this was from ""Book of Eli"")***SPOILER ALERT***My next thought was that they hadn't really done too much in the way of making it the sort of movie you could watch twice and say, ""Ooohhh, that's crazy that I didn't notice he was blind before now."" In fact it's like they took the opposite approach ow Twistmaster General Shyamalan in ""The Sixth Sense.""If you re-watch ""Sixth Sense,"" you get treated to all the ways that the film is subtly nudging you that Bruce Willis is dead but you never noticed because you were so wrapped up in the story the first time through.If only the same was true of ""Book of Eli."" On my second go round with this movie it was clear that the directors had no intention of making sure that Eli behaved as a blind man through out the film. This problem is only further emphasized by the introduction of a blind character who DOES act like a blind person.So then I took a step back and tried to re-center myself. Usually this means that I am finding myself slipping into one of my least favorite tendencies: Analysis Nerdism. I want to focus on the themes of a film and this film is trying to be a sort of retelling of Blind Swordsman tales.Granted it doesn't succeed on the same level but I have a hard time imaging the same people who complain about the sighted issue in ""Book of Eli,"" feeling the same way about ""Zatoichi.""So, I try to put the fact that Eli is supposed to be blind out of my mind and enjoy the themes of the film which I found to be pretty solid. Some of them are as subtle as Christmas but others, whether intentional or not, were pretty subtle commentary on religion, Christianity, and gender roles.In fact, if it weren't for how violent and crass this film is at times, I would recommend it for church groups to watch. It has a lot to be discussed within it's two hours about scripture and its role in a person's and broader society's life.It's really unfortunate that this is the main value I found in the film. I mean, the production design is great but there not much top see here that you can't see in any episode of the walking dead. The cinematography is downright washed out and ugly. The writing seems insightful at times but it also feels like it was written by someone with only a casual American acquaintance with the Bible and religion. (I know that complaint is a little Analysis Nerdismy too, though)I guess I'm just a bit harder to please than I used to be. I expect that if a movie is going to cost millions of dollars to make with two of the best actors in the world, I should finish the film satisfied. I shouldn't finish thinking that they should have explored the themes more or given their actors better moments to shine in and work through any challenges they were having.",The Book of Eli
75,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Book of Eli (2010),5,31 December 2011,"End of world fluff that brings along too much baggage as it tries to connect with religion. The idea is nice, of using religion for control vs. faith. But the 1 bible storyline pushes the level of preposterousness. Washington and Oldman are very reliable, and the action scenes are quite stunning. They flow with a fluent style, without seeming too choreographed or without threat. However, once it stretches the scenarios logic, just so we can have an iPod product placement, you kind of feel a bit cheated. To look at is grand, to get the adrenaline pumping, it's successful. Unfortunately, unlike Washington's character, it fails to avoid a preachy and patronizing delivery of it's themes and message.",The Book of Eli
76,Matt_Layden,A Well Done Post Apocalyptic Thriller,7,1 February 2010,"The Book Of Eli tells the story of one man, Washington, who must cross the United States and head west to an unknown location, all while protecting a book, with his very life. Along the way he enters a small town, run by a not so nice Gary Oldman. Oldman is looking for a book, one that will give him the power over people. It just so happens that Washington is carrying the one book that he seeks. Thrilling cat and mouse sequence ensues.I think it's safe to say, that with all the religious marketing the film has been doing that revealing what the book is, is not a spoiler. The book is obviously the bible. According to Eli (Washington) they live in a world that is a result of some kind of nuclear fallout. It is never fully stated, but bits and pieces are thrown out there for the viewer to fill in the rest. Many people thought this happened because of the bible and religion. So every known copy of the bible was burned. Every known copy except for the one Eli has. So he walks west with it in his bag, for 30 years no less.The Hughes brothers paint their film in dull burnt grays and browns. It fits the apocalypse feel that the movie if obviously trying to go for. The earth is scorched, the characters search for water and trade boring things as if it were currency. It's a very Mad Max/Road Warrior/Fallout 3 vibe. The only other Hughes brother film I have seen was the underrated From Hell. Both films feature great aesthetics. The attention to detail in the set design, costumes and overall atmosphere in both films are great. They also never let their stars overpower the film. I give them, and the leading actors credit to this.Washington does fine in this role. He's getting up their in age and seems to be able to do martial arts with the best of them. This is his first role in which he has to be physically a bad-ass mofo, who wields a machete like weapon and bow & arrow. His performance is nowhere near the likes of Rubin Carter from the Hurricane or Alonzo from Training Day. Yet he still holds the film confidently. In the supporting roles are Gary Oldman, who returns to his true form as the bad guy, and Mila Kunis, who seems to be showing people she actually has acting chops. Oldman doesn't overact in his usual villainous way (The Professional). Here he seems restrained, yet still eerily creepy. The more I think about the film, the more I like it in hindsight. When the credits first started to roll, I was a bit upset with what the Hughes were offering us. But upon further reflection and reading up on what other people's thoughts on the ending were, I've come to appreciate it more. It's definitely a film that I want to visit again and pick up on things I missed the first time. If a film makes me want to watch it again, I guess that gets a thumbs up on my part. Though the last bit of the film does seem to drag on a bit much, the film as a whole works. You are set in this world with them and understand it completely. Of course some people will be scratching their heads in confusion over some things in the film, but for me they worked. The film doesn't really push many religious overtones on you either, which is a bit surprising. Considering all the religious marketing this film has, I was expecting it to play a bigger hand in the film. Check out The Book of Eli, even with it's obvious apocalypse movie clichés, it's a good flick.",The Book of Eli

Anything featuring zombies, Keira Knightley, or associated with Quentin Tarantino, just starts out higher on my rating scale than the average movie does. Post-apocalyptic films do, too. And when they're as well-done and as interesting as The Book of Eli, I'm basically in heaven.Denzel absolutely kills this role. He handles both the bad-ass gravitas of the character and the action aspects perfectly. He was perfectly complimented by Oldman (in a role that compares favorably to his work in The Professional), Kunis (who continues her recent streak of movies that I've greatly enjoyed her in), and Jennifer Beals (who does a lot with a role that could have been easy to ignore). No complaints from me, as far as casting goes.Another thing that should be mentioned is the beautiful cinematography and camera work. The movie is set in a world where the UV layer has been damaged, and as a result, everything looks washed out and over-exposed. It's a stark contrast to the gray and darkness of The Road, and it works great. The camera angles, on the other hand, were better than great. Every other shot was from some interesting angle or framed the actors in a way that made me notice and pay attention to the camera. The skilled camera work really added to the overall film experience, in my opinion.The Book of Eli exceeded my expectations greatly. It's the best post-apocalyptic movie that I've seen in quite a while. The story was good, the actors were great, and it's as good of an action movie as you could hope for.

79,intelearts,My 399th Review: Very much your average post-apocalyptic film,6,5 April 2011,"The Book of Eli is fine in a Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome sort of way - the costuming and filming are right for a post-apocalyptic world,and the theme that any book is worth dying for is one to be applauded in a Western world that is rapidly becoming illiterate or unliterate. No-reads anymore and I suspect this might be a serious subtext in the film; not what or which book it is, but the fact that books (all books) have value as they survive us is not a bad subtext.Denzel Washington plays the eponymous Eli, a man on a mission to go as far West as possible. He is doing well until he meets Gary Oldman, boss of an Old West style frontier town.There's action aplenty, most of it pretty gruesome, and some philosophizing but I, for one, was not really caught up in the film. It has the Mad Max action sequences, some neat lines etc; but it's just feels like you've seen it mostly all before. When you think how influential the Mad Max series has been this is thin gruel indeed. Here was a chance to reinvent the genre, with two excellent actors, one an A-list superstar, the other a superbly villainous character actor, and to opt for a linear plotted action film was, in this reviewer's opinion, a cop out. It's watchable, but in no way is it as great as it could have been.",The Book of Eli
80,MartianOctocretr5,Post Apocolyptic adventure laced with a novel concept,8,24 January 2010,"Book of Eli is not just yet another World War III ""post-Apocalypse"" type story. Its told in that fashion, but it dusts off this oft-used story line with a unique approach and message.We follow the battle for survival among the survivors of a bleak, blast-effect, wind swept wasteland. All around are remnants and ruins of a destroyed past world, where the survivors are reduced to scavenging ghouls, marauding bands of pirate bandits, and survivalist barbarians. The hero (Denzel Washington) is overtly just one more of these barbarians, but he holds a much larger personal secret and quest to accomplish. Washington's portrayal successfully illustrates this man's understated power and willful self-control as a force to be reckoned with. His seemingly complex nature is in reality very straightforward, as is the goal he wishes to accomplish.Allegory is the usual approach for this type of story, and Eli is no exception. Characters and events are mostly metaphors that construct the ultimate moral. His chief nemesis, a gang kingpin running a thriving town, sees the book as a pearl of great price treasure, just as Eli does. However, his twisted belief system results in his complete misjudgement of its true meaning and power. He wants to get his hands on the book for all the wrong reasons. How all the remaining characters interact with these two principals is the mainstay of the movie's conflict and plot. Mila Kunis plays the seeker Solara with a myriad of emotions, each appropriate. It's nice to see how much she's improved her acting skills over the years.The movie's utilization of the apocalyptic story line is quite original, and even finds some starkly thought provoking twists that are brilliant in their simplicity. Points it gets across are never strained, and the pacing keeps the story's secrets unfolding with well conceived precision. Interesting visuals and stark color cinematography establish the somber mood. Just a few minor criticisms of note: the writer couldn't resist some post-apoc movie staples: there's a mad militia couple who belong in a hokey horror film. Also, everybody's fashion statement is leather, and there's some corny product placement used. Most of these aren't too hard to overlook, since they even have some purpose in the action.A mostly original and thought provoking film. Recommended.",The Book of Eli
81,Howlin Wolf,Now I know my ABC's...,6,9 April 2012,"The fact that the film is so devout isn't a problem, at least not directly. Every film has an agenda, a perspective that it pushes, and given that faith is much discussed and lived by in the real world, it makes sense to discuss it in a dramatic context... The trouble is, by doing so, the film will become inherently one dimensional, and therefore rather boring.In order for anything that happens to have significance, the viewer has to pick a side, so as a storyteller you have to find yourself falling into one of two positions. You're either preaching to the converted, or else you're trying to persuade people who have no use for intangibles. To make use of conviction either way is essential, if you want your audience to invest in the story. In order for faith to be interesting, you have to tip a nod of the hat in the direction of doubt, and none of the characters in this story has any doubt; they're either using what they believe as a tool for good, or evil.It's that whole 'You're with us or against us' thing; the film follows simplistic lines of good and evil, and if you're looking for nuance then you have the wrong film, because its very purpose is to be didactic.",The Book of Eli

What happened to simply, ""The Near Future"" and letting our imaginations extrapolate on what blasted the hell out of Middle America? (Could it have been those religious fanatics with the Weapons of Mass Destruction - you know, the American government?) So in THE BOOK OF ELI, striding down the heat-blasted, Middle American - ahem - ""post-apocalyptic"" highway comes Eli (strapping, sexy-55 Denzel Washington), looking like A BOY AND HIS DOG - without the dog; looking like THE POSTMAN - without the mail; looking like BEYOND THUNDERDOME - without the mullet. He's handy with a gun, and a knife, and his fists, and a bow and arrow, and quoting from the Bible - probably the most dangerous weapon of all.He carries with him the last of those weapons. The last copy on Earth. The King James version. He is heading west, on some quest to deliver it unto... even he is not sure himself. And any thugs who accidentally wander in from THE ROAD WARRIOR costuming department and try to mug him for food and water are dispatched efficiently by Eli's arm-sized knife and effortless Denzel Kwon Do.Eli encounters a blasted township, meets a grizzled Tom Waits (excuse me - that's tautologous), and an ominous Gary Oldman (once again - tautology) who runs the town like Tina Turner.Oldman is bibliophile Carnegie (who once again scares us deliciously without chewing scenery), whose thugs scour the highways, raping and pillaging for One Particular Book. Yes fans, the Book that Eli carries. Dipping into his boundless bag of accents, Oldman gives us the unlikely Regis-Philbin-as-a-Despot accent. He is reading about Mussolini when we meet him.And he wants that Bible. For the original intended purpose those high priests penned it thousands of years ago and pretended it was The Word of God: ""It is a weapon aimed at the hearts and minds of the weak!""; to emplace himself as the Keeper of The Word and enforce it as he sees fit, selectively recalling passages as the circumstances denote and ignoring others. As people have been doing for centuries. As people are doing right now.In a surprising display of controlled storytelling by Gary Whitta, THE BOOK OF ELI is about religion - but it ain't religious.Thank God.In some ways it can be regarded as the triumph of intelligence over organized religion - for only the two learned men, Eli and Carnegie, understand the potency and implications of wielding a Bible. In this story's context the Bible is merely a McGuffin. The intelligent men battle over possession of it because they both know how to wield it to their own ends - one for peace, one for domination. (Peace and domination - the unspoken dichotomy of every organized religion since civilization's roots.) And when we see it in this context, we realize The Book is irrelevant, moot, unimportant, and it is PEOPLE who make the policy all along - good people will make good policy; evil people, evil policy.Eli even ponders, ""Some people said it caused the war in the first place."" I'll bet a kajillion dollars it did. So at times we cannot understand how an intelligent, skilled warrior like Eli would be so intent on dusting off the radiation and giving it another go.THE BOOK OF ELI is beautiful to behold; charred dustbowls, ochre craters, seared red-tinted highways and heat-whitened bone-dry riverbeds. It's like a black and white Photoshop image with the Color Balance tool turned up slightly on the Red. Add Noise. Sharpen. Sit under a scorching salmon desert sky without undies.Can you feel me now?  In Eli's room at Carnegie's den, there is a wrecked poster on the wall for A BOY AND HIS DOG, the classic 1975 post-apoc film, penned by master fantasist Harlan Ellison. When Carnegie's henchies throw a pile of books on the table for his review, The Da Vinci Code is among them. When Eli is shot in the stomach, he reaches for the gaff tape to bandage the wound - as any musician will attest, gaff is better than medicines, doctors, stitches, antiseptics - it's The Universal Solvent.Heavy Leone influences drive the film's gutshock action. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes love the stinking, sweat-driven closeup; the gathering of assailants before the Eastwood-ian avenger takes them all down; the hero wavering in the desert haze - like Eastwood's HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER (which Clint copped from Leone). It's a western. About a guy heading west.Jennifer Beals is Carnegie's blind wife. Ray Stevenson is Redridge, Carnegie's right-hand man (who keeps whistling the pan flute theme from ONCE UPON A TIME IN America - reason unknown). Mila (mini-Jolie) Kunis is Carnegie's step-daughter, who joins Eli on his quest - more like attaches herself to him like a wild leech which forces the film to give her character some kind of resolution and waste our time.Eli tells her he heard a ""voice calling him"" which led him to The Book buried under some rubble... You sure that's a Bible and not the Golden Plates of Mormon that the angel Moroni buried? It's a giant TALES OF THE UNEXPECTED episode. One of those movies that - in its last few minutes - starts you thinking back on the whole film and the hero's actions. The last ten minutes are brilliantly unveiled. Take that, M. Night! When Carnegie sleazily entreats Eli, ""The Bible is meant to be shared,"" he's right. Isn't he, Christians? Shouldn't Eli be staying where the Bible is needed most - in this den of thieves and harlots?Like the bracelet says, What Would Frank Do?",The Book of Eli
84,blumdeluxe,Religious Action,5,12 February 2017,"""The book of Eli"" is what I imagine happens when the pope, a CEO of a major company and Michael Bay sit together to create a movie. It tells us the story of Eli, a lonesome wanderer, who tries to protect the Holy Bible from disappearance in a post-apocalyptic world of dust.First of all, let me state, that this is in fact a solid action film. The acting is well done, there are several fighting scenes and you're never really at risk of getting bored. A thing that bothered me a bit were the very one-dimensional characters. There are good people and bad people, there's barely anything grey in this world of black and white.Furthermore some of the post-apocalyptic details seem a bit over-exaggerated.According to the movie we're still pretty much in the first generation of what lead to all this, yet grown up adults don't remember TVs or managed to save more than one exemplar of the bible, which is pretty effective destruction. More general, it is a quite religious point of view to think that you could only manipulate or save people through religion or more precisely the bible.All in all it's not a bad movie, pretty easy in plot and message but enjoyable in action and relief.",The Book of Eli
85,oneguyrambling,Classic B movie that thinks it's smarter than it is... and barely lives to tell about it.,7,14 November 2010,"It's actually a pretty entertaining flick despite the obvious Mad Max background and formulaic storyline. Denzel is a loner in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, scavenging through the ruins and surviving against the odds through sheer force of will while civilization crumbles around him.In the early scenes we see the lengths that Denzel must go to, to simply survive, nothing is too scungy to eat or too worn out to wear or use.Early on he kills a cat and much like the Native American Indians nothing goes to waste, he even feeds some of the carcass to a mouse in a reverse animal pecking order situation, or maybe he is just a dog person. Strangely enough shortly after in the same run down building he finds a human carcass, largely untouched. I guess the mouse must have had a discerning palate.(I actually like what the filmmakers didn't do here as much as what they did. There is no cheesy Terminator style voice-over saying things like ""In the years following the apocalypse it was more than simply existing, it was survival"", and similarly melodramatic crap, nor did they rely on synth heavy doomsday music, it is simply a guy going about what he does on the day to day.) Denzel's (he doesn't have a name yet), only luxury is an ipod that he carries around so that it might act as his personal soundtrack. Now it is apparently 31 years after the great battle so Apple must have finally fixed those recharge problems that plagued early versions, or there are ipod docks strategically placed around the barren landscape for mercenaries and loners to use? Denzel proves that he ain't just a handsome face that makes ladies (and some guys) of all ages, backgrounds and race go ""Mmmm-hmmmm! by coolly butchering about half a dozen hijackers in classic B movie style. (""I told him twice not to touch me, so I cut off his arm"") At this point I might mention that the fight scenes are actually really good in this, the action is suitably violent and you can actually see what is happening, as they chose to film the melees from far enough away and didn't settle for lazy quick edits. The first half of the film in particular has a couple of worthwhile fights that I fully intend to rewatch on DVD.So after all that Denzel finds a small town that is lawless and post-apocalyptic enough to suit his needs and further his story, so he enters. After Denzel barters with shopkeepers using ""relics from the past"" (read: present day stuff) he heads to the bar for a cool refreshing drink of water, pure water being a particularly scarce, and therefore valuable commodity.Of course not all goes smoothly and after another fight scene reminiscent of early Jackie Chan films, (and stab. And turn. And you punch. And I duck. And chop. And turn. etc Thanks for lining up and waiting guys!) he gets to meet the town crime boss Carnegie, played by Gary Oldman, who seems to be channeling Jack Palance in City Slickers for his performance.Having witnessed the butchering of his minions firsthand, Carnegie appreciates Denzel's skillset and says he has a job for him, to which Denzel says thanks but no. Carnegie insists he think it over and comps him a room for the night, so that he might offer various bribes of food, water and women, specifically a young girl named Solara, (Mila Kunis) the daughter of Carnegie's personal wench.Carnegie exerts his influence over Solara through bullying her Mum, and decides a little luvin might be just what Denzel needs, or at least will let Solara uncover information about what Denzel is up to.So we finally get to the essence of the story: Denzel has special book which he is taking to an unspecified ""East"", Carnegie wants the special book.(What the book contains is largely irrelevant and adds nothing of value to the story, it does seem to be a talking point for some though, I can't see why myself.) So when two opposing forces don't agree and won't veer a collision is inevitable, and the final third of the film degenerates into a well worn path replete with a million clichés, each more well worn and cliché-ey than the last.Especially when Solara wants to tag along for no plausible reason aside from getting herself in danger so that Denzel might save her. It's very much like a father having a conversation with his young child who wants to tag along somewhere that they aren't ready for: ""I wanna come!"" ""No"" ""But I wanna!"" ""I said NO!"" ""Well I'm coming anyway Oh SAVE MEEEEE!"" ""I bloody told your Mother this would happen!"" Despite this I quite liked The Book of Eli all the way to end, where instead of the hero walking off into the matte painting background distance as with most 80s B movies they decided to flip the script and tack on an inane and stupid twist that made no sense. (Didn't ruin the movie for me though, just knocked some IQ points off it.) The Book of Eli takes a straightforward story and some familiar characters and does the best it can with them, it has some inventive fight scenes, doesn't outstay its welcome and thankfully doesn't go too heavy on the CGI.Final Rating – 7 / 10. I don't mind if you rip Mad Max if you do it well, and I think that this is the best that they could do given what they had.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",The Book of Eli
86,Sirus_the_Virus,"The Best film of the year. Funny, I have only seen one movie this year.",10,15 January 2010,"The Hughes Brothers return with their newest film. They have only done three. Their last film, From hell, was made nearly ten years ago. Now they return with The Book of Eli, and trust me, it was worth the wait.This is a very creative film. It has so much going on, so many spectacular action sequences, some laughs, some good performances, and by the end of the movie, there is a good message. For some reason I was not expecting the film to be Biblical, but in the end I was actually quite pleased that it was.The film takes place in the future in an apocalypse type period. Carnagie(played by Gary Oldman)runs a town and has had people search for a book that he can not find anywhere. That book is The Bible. People believe that the Bible was what started their apocalypse so they were forced to burn every one. Carnagie is looking for it so then he can have control over mankind.They have such a hard time finding The Bible. Until a stranger named Eli(played by Denzel Washington) stumbles into the bar that he runs and chops up everybody. Carnagie believes that he holds The bible. So he tries to convince Eli to stay at the bar.Carnagie sends his somewhat lover's daughter(played by the hot Mila Kunis)to try and see if he has the book. Well, of course he does. And eventually, Eli goes to extreme lengths to protect The Bible. Eventually, Eli and Mila Kunis' character go on the run from Carnagie.The Book of Eli has some laughs. But it focuses on plot a bit more than anything. There is a good twist at the end of the movie. The Hughes brothers have returned with a bang. Literally, cause there are a lot of awesome action sequences. It's a lot of fun to watch Denzel Washington of all people slice off heads. This is a very entertaining film. The 2010 film season is off to a great start. I hope it continues.",The Book of Eli
87,Angelus2,Expected better from Denzel Washington,1,17 May 2011,"Denzel Washington plays a man who journeys across the land to reach some distant place, however he must deal with anarchy that comes with a apocalyptic world...The storyline in my opinion is not the greatest, it lacks that twist that makes you sit through it. I found the film to be very dull and could barely hear Denzel's whispering. The script in my opinion is the main problem, the dialogue is not very strong. Storyline we never get any sort of information straight away and after fifteen minutes of being bored senseless, I tuned off.The action sequences are supposed to be 'amazing' but most of the opening fights are done in the shadows and it is a little disappointing seeing as this is Denzel's entrance into the action genre with such terribly choreographed fight scenes.Expected better from Denzel Washington.",The Book of Eli
88,antoniotierno,disappointing,6,26 February 2010,"This post-apocalyptic thriller starts out well and strangely gets less interesting and complex while going along. The setting is OK, consisting of many dead cities and dusty landscapes, with an upright man trying to survive (reminds somehow the novel ""The Road""). The story looks great at the beginning and Denzel Washington is terrific but after the involving opening scenes everything turns fast a bit silly. The thing is that a standard movie structure comes out after the very first sequences (as soon as Eli meets Carnegie). The numerous scenes of grim violence keep the audience on edge but (and this makes the film less believable) the tone is too comical given the context the plot develops in. So the script isn't appropriate, with some references to environmental catastrophes, regimes and holy wars. There are also some decent elements in the movie but some interesting characters and situations end up disappearing into too many stereotypes.",The Book of Eli
89,brchthethird,A solid post-apocalyptic film,7,3 April 2016,"THE BOOK OF ELI is yet another entry in the well-populated post-apocalyptic genre and, to be honest, doesn't do a lot to distinguish itself from its brethren. What makes it an interesting watch are the stylistic choices, well-executed action, and committed performances from a stellar cast. The plot concerns Eli (mentioned by name only once), who is headed west with the last copy of the Bible (in the US, at least). On his journey he meets a warlord (Gary Oldman) who has been looking for the book and wants to use it for his own purposes. From a narrative standpoint, THE BOOK OF ELI keeps things very simple, and even the characters aren't too well-defined, being more archetypes than anything else. Of course, this is mostly fine as the film has higher ideas on its mind than just providing a cool story. There was some passing mention of what caused the world to be the way it is, and attempts at fleshing out the finer details of the world in the film, but nothing on the level of what George Miller did with the MAD MAX franchise. What holds the film together is Denzel Washington, who has made a career out of playing men of action (and, occasionally, few words). He plays Eli with the cool detachment required, but also imbues him with a sense of humor and humanity that makes him a little more relatable. Gary Oldman also does fine as the villain, but his motivations (as well as Eli's ultimate goal) remain unfortunately broad and vague. Mila Kunis is the weak spot in the cast, and she can't quite hold her own against such heavyweights. Outside of Denzel, where the film really shines is the style and action. Although the film has the same de-saturated color palette common in the genre, it contributed positively to the lived-in feeling of the world it depicted. Everything (and everyone) was appropriately grimy and dirty, as it should be when the world has suffered from nuclear war. I also thought there was creative work in the action sequences, particularly the first one in which Eli takes on a group of hijackers. It took place mostly in silhouette, which gave it a comic book feel. In fact, this film would make an excellent graphic novel. Still, the film is not without its problems. The biggest one is the pacing, which stays a little on the slow side. Granted, there are necessary moments where the characters can interact, but the combination of dour visuals and a slow pace didn't really mesh well. Also, as indicated earlier, the vagueness with which character motivation is treated was a bit disappointing. What saves the film from mediocrity is a great payoff in the last 20-25 minutes. I won't spoil anything here, but I will say that it makes a lot of sense if you know your Bible stories. Ultimately, THE BOOK OF ELI is a solid, if unspectacular, entry in its genre, but Denzel Washington's performance, inventive action sequences, and examination of religion's societal role make it worth your time.",The Book of Eli

91,MrGKB,Faux-Christian apocalyptic quest fails to convince...,6,27 December 2010,"...despite admirable production values, mostly decent acting and attentive direction. The ultimate failure, of course, rests with a conclusively improbable (and otherwise mundane) script by newcomer Gary Whitta, in which the ostensible hero (Denzel ""I am the Law"" Washington) treks resolutely westward through a post-apocalyptic America to deliver a not-so-mysterious Book---its identity made apparent by the end of Act One---at the behest of a voice he's listened to for upwards of three decades in the wilderness. After smiting mightily a flea-bitten band of brigands, he meets up with an Adversary (Gary ""I am the Bad Guy"" Oldman) who covets the Book for the sake of power. Our champion, through demonstrations of great physical, mental, and spiritual prowess (""I walk by faith, not by sight"") inevitably completes his quest, and quicker than you can say ""hopeful franchise,"" and after several staggeringly incongruous revelations, passes the torch of intrepid determination on to the younger generation. It's neat, pat, very formulaic, and ultimately fails despite (or perhaps because of) its best intentions.Horrendous spoilers follow; abandon surprise all who continue here: The conceit that some guy might actually possess the sole remaining copy (pun intended) of what is likely the most-published religious scripture in the world is hard enough to buy, never mind the glib explanation provided by the screenwriter, but that's almost the least of any discriminating audience's difficulties. Does it really take thirty years to cross the United States, even if the traveler happens to be blind? Rutger Hauer movies to the side, can a sightless man really function as amazingly well as Eli does? And are we supposed to really and truly believe that this man is God incarnate? How else to explain his superhuman powers, including memorization of an ancient tome that is, in part, one of the most boring reads in literary history.I'll leave it at that. ""The Book of Eli"" isn't a terrible film, or even a terribly misconceived one. Washington may not always convince, and Oldman does his share of trademark scenery-chewing, but overall, one could do much worse. Still, for genuine humanity and depth of insight, I'd just as soon watch ""The Road"" again. Or, for that matter, ""The Road Warrior.""",The Book of Eli

Then we see Eli(played by veteran actor Denzel Washington), who is seeking to deliver God's Word to all who have lost faith in him. Carnegie and Eli soon come face-to-face. Eli quickly understands Carnegie's motives in acquiring a Bible, and he quickly escapes from his clutches.Thrown into all of this chaos is a young woman Solara(Mila Kunis), who becomes a friend to Eli.The film shows the post-apocalyptic days of Earth, which has reduced humanity into scavengers. The meager resources of food and water are highly prized and worth killing for. A few towns exist, among which Carnegie's is the focus of this film. Eli is on a journey to the West, which he believes is his mission. The film is about all the obstacles he faces. Verdict: the action scenes in the film are well executed - there is never a dull moment in the film. The cast is superb with Oldman and Washington as the key players of the film. We also have Ray Stevens, Mila Kunis in supporting roles, and veteran actor Malcolm McDowell in an uncredited role.

95,ajs-10,Pretty good stuff from the Hughes Brothers...,7,15 January 2011,"I saw this when it came out in the cinema and quite liked it. Now it has come round on TV I thought it might be worth a second viewing. This film is about the quest of one man to get a book to the place it's supposed to be, to use his words. Now, I'm not a religious man but I can see the value this book might have in a world torn apart by war. It is a post-apocalyptic world, thirty years after it was destroyed. Those that were not killed scratch a living out of what's left, and many have turned to cannibalism. Many were blinded by the flashes in the sky but survived. As stated in the film, after the war people destroyed the bible blaming it for what happened, but Eli has the last remaining copy. Now you know the set-up, here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters please don't touch Eli not if you want to keep your hands that is and wait here while I write the next paragraph).Always moving west, Eli is a loner on the road. Like everyone out there he knows it's a very dangerous place. He kills animals for food and gets clean water where he can. When set upon by hijackers but Eli is a ferocious fighter and thus far has come out on top. One day he wanders into a small town run by Carnegie, a determined man who has been sending out men in search of a particular book, the very one Eli has in his possession. Carnegie has a mother and daughter, Claudia and Solara in his entourage, Claudia was blind from birth, but Solara is sighted. In trying to persuade Eli to stay, as he can see the value of a man who can fight like him, he sends Solara to his room and she discovers the book. Carnegie finds out about the book and sends his henchman, Redridge to get it but Eli has already gone. Eli starts heading west again only to find Solara following him. Redridge wants Solara and makes a deal with Carnegie to get the book in exchange for her. And now the chase is on, will Eli and Solara escape or will they be caught? I think that's enough for now This film was shot in a similar way to 300 (2006) with a kind of washed out comic book feel to it and, for me, it looked a bit too artificial in places. A lot of the landscapes were CGI which didn't come over too well on TV. Great performances from all of the leading cast, Denzel Washington as Eli, Gary Oldman as Carnegie, Mila Kunis as Solara, Ray Stevenson as Redridge and Jennifer Beals as Claudia. Honourable mentions also go to Frances de la Tour and Michael Gambon as Martha and George, a mad old couple who Eli and Solara find on their travels.Although it's a fairly straightforward story I found it a very entertaining and compelling film to watch, the 107 minutes went by pretty quickly, which is always a good sign. It did get a bit bogged down in the middle, but redeemed itself with a totally unexpected twist at the end. Don't worry; I'm not going give that away here. Also a haunting soundtrack backs up the visuals to great effect. Over all, although it's not been well received everywhere and although not perfect, it's a good effort Recommended.My score: 7.3/10",The Book of Eli
96,lopezpatricia-06139,The non religious won't like this,5,21 November 2020,It says in the film that it was the bible that caused the war/ apocalypse and that the remaining humans have burnt the last bible. But here comes Washington as a prophet from god with the last one in existence in order to bring peace back to the world. So as with all religion it is one huge contradiction! And fairly annoying to anyone with a logical brain.However Denzel Washington and Mila Kunis and Gary Oldman gave 100% performances with the rest of the cast doing the same.

97,CountZero313,Religious warrior on the march,6,3 July 2013,"A warrior-monk figure traverses a post-apocalyptic landscape protecting a book he, and less moral others, believe holds great power.Eli could easily become quaint and ironically comic in our cynical, postmodern times. But animated by Denzel Washington, he is charismatic and credible. Eli is driven by a voice that told him to head west and deliver the book. While other movies would play on this madman-or-prophet conundrum as an active question, The Book of Eli wears its evangelical colours on its sleeve - at no point do we doubt that a Higher Power is on this man's side. Even when he is shot and left for dead, we do not doubt that the Higher Power's great plan is working itself out. That the film is watchable and indeed enjoyable despite this overt preachiness (a sin in any film, religious themes notwithstanding) is its main achievement. That, and an ending that makes you want to go back and watch it again just to see if the filmmakers are mad geniuses or simply taking almighty liberties with our suspension of disbelief. I admired their gall, while not being totally convinced that they had earned that 'reveal.' The post-apocalyptic world is well-depicted, but could have been more clearly differentiated from The Road. Water is scarce, cannibalism widespread, and a new generation knows not of our world, except that Mila Kunis looks like she stepped out of a hair conditioner commercial, and clearly dentists and good nutrition are abundant in Mila's post-apocalypse. Gary Oldman reprises his mad alpha male act from Leon and Romeo is Bleeding to great effect.Very entertaining, highly watchable, and with more than a dash of theology that will keep Internet hotheads busy for a while without bothering the Jesuits too much.

98,griffolyon12,Post-Apocalyptic Western,9,6 July 2010,"There was a war a few decades back, a nuclear holocaust that ruptured the ozone and caused the sun to scorch the Earth. The few surviving humans, covered in burn scars, scavenge to survive like nomads. Very often it's refreshing to see a movie that's original. While The Book of Eli is a post-apocalyptic thriller about a man named Eli who has the last King James Bible, presumably in the whole world, it's a movie that ultimately has more to it than what you see.The Book of Eli is sort of an odd, post-apocalyptic western, similar to the Clint Eastwood, Man-With-No-Name movies. The movie is dense, littered with clues and never really spells any of the minute details out for the audience. There is a ton of action, and all of the action is highly choreographed and the directors, the Hughes Brothers, direct them in long, uninterrupted takes in medium shots and long shots, actually allowing you to see the wonderful choreography, and dare I say, blood spatter. The acting is all spot on, while Denzel Washington is very reserved as Eli, Mila Kunis shines as his young sidekick, Solara, and Gary Oldman is the modern day Claude Raines, adding Texas draw to his list of magnificent accents, as Carnegie the villain of this story who wishes to find the bible and use its words to prey upon the hopelessness of the people.As it is, the movie is a bit tough to watch. PETA must not be happy at all of the animal slaughter in the movie for food, not to mention human slaughter, where a great many of humans in this post-apocalyptic future have become cannibals to survive. Even through all of this, The Book of Eli manages to be about something. It's a wonderful movie about faith and belief in the bible. Even though Eli carries the bible, trying to get it to a safe place, his own religious beliefs are shaky at best, but throughout the film his own faith is strengthened and he manages to convert his sidekick Solara (Kunis). What you can't see, can often be the most affirming.So as I sit here, I simply have to say see The Book of Eli. There aren't many movies that will handle such subject matter in a big, Hollywood studio production, and for that this is a genuinely daring film.

The action is consistence and the best part part was they did managed to make it with style, though pretty graphic they managed to make it watchable – that good cause I hate movie with too brutally graphic. I like the story (despite nothing much going on) and the twist but the pace of the movie drop a bit in the middle and can make you lost interest a bit. The casting, for me was the saving grace for this movie. Without Denzel and Gary this movie wouldn't have been this famous and watchable. They were awesome, Mila was hot too. It was a really good perfectly fitted cast and they managed to give a very decent performance and excellent action sequences.I like how the director shoot in certain shot which was imaginative and I also like the fact that he managed to make the film that film in the desert look somewhat watchable. Most movie can't pull this off. The music also fit well.Overall I do enjoy the movie, but it is not the kind of movie that you will go and watch it again or watch it anytime soon.

102,dfa120374,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Post-Apocalyptic Action/Thriller,7,26 August 2015,"OK firstly I'll start off by saying that The Book of Eli is NOT a post-apocalyptic film that is along the same lines as Mad Max, as in its not a relentless action film, so if you're expecting nothing but action then you'll be disappointed here. There is action in this movie, but it's not continuous like a Mad Max movie.Secondly, The Book of Eli is a definite must-see movie. Like I said above, it's not a full out action film, but that doesn't stop it from being a really enjoyable movie with a great story, a really good cast, and amazing cinematography.I'm not going to get into the whole religious context of the film either, or the whole nonsense of ""atheists hate this film because it deals with religion"" or that it's ""religious propaganda"", because I'm atheist yet I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I'm sure millions of other atheists enjoyed it as well and couldn't care if religion was involved or not. For me, the film was more about the mission itself in a man being entrusted to take a book to a certain place, following his own faith to guide him, and overcoming obstacles (big & small) to see that humanity prevails. People will see this as a ""religious movie"" but for me, the religious aspect was an addendum to the main story.The story (religious theme or not) is an engrossing one and it is very well written and acted out, with superb performances from Denzel Washington as Eli and Gary Oldman as Carnegie. I sometimes find Oldman to be a touch over-the-top with some of his performances, but he completely nailed it here. Mila Kunis also done a decent job in her supporting role as Solara.Along with the story & cast, the action & cinematography are excellent too with the top notch choreography for the action/fight scenes making them flow so smoothly. The cinematography, however, was simply stunning, and the way the scenes were filmed & captured really was a visual feast.Religious theme or not, The Book of Eli is well worth watching and to miss it would be a sin.",The Book of Eli
103,the-movie-guy,The Book is the only hope for humanity,7,15 January 2010,"(Synopsis) Eli (Denzel Washington) has been on a journey for 30 years, walking west across America after a cataclysmic war that turned the earth into a total wasteland. The world has become a lawless civilization where people must kill or be killed. The barren roads belong to gangs of cutthroats who rob and kill for water, a pair of shoes, a lighter, or just for fun. Eli is a peaceful man who only acts in self defense, and becomes a warrior with unbelievable killing skills when he is challenged. After the war and the ""Big Flash"", Eli was guided by a higher power to a hidden book and given the task of protecting the book and taking it to its final destination. Eli guards the book with his life, because he knows that the book is the only hope that humanity has for its future.(My Comment) The movie starts off with Eli walking down a road when he confronts a gang of thieves wanting what he has, and of course, he must protect himself and the book. We see that he has some ninja killing skills that have carried him all these years. Anarchy now rules with murder and rape as routine events. Eli walks into a small town where he encounters Carnegie (Gary Oldman), the boss of a gang of thieves and gunmen. Carnegie wants the book and Eli doesn't want to give it up and the battle begins. The movie has the theme of good against evil, and we know that Eli is the good guy and someone you can root for. I think Denzel did a very good job of getting the audience involved and on his side, because when he prevailed against the bad guys, some of the audience yelled and clapped. Gary Oldman and his henchmen were very good bad guys and deserved what that got. You may think from the trailers that this is an action-packed movie from beginning to end, which is only partially true. But there is enough action to keep your attention. There is a twist at the end that you will not see coming. Overall, it was a good movie, but don't take the plot too seriously. (Warner Bros., Run Time 1:58, Rated R)(7/10)",The Book of Eli
104,LazySod,"Slow, bland and refusing to take a stand",4,9 February 2010,"Set in a post-apocalyptic time this film tells the tale of one man and his mission. A mission to make the world, now a hostile territory filled with ruins and memories of a better day a better place once more.It starts as the lead character fights to live another day, this time by searching for something to eat, it then continues on and lets the audience experience the way he travels the world - and the people he encounters on his path. It starts slowly, and while this isn't bad at all it could have done a bit faster and still told all it had to tell. Then about a third into the film the pace picks up and keeps rolling on until the end of the film.As a post-apocalyptic film it reminds of a lot of other films with the same theme. The comparisons coming up most would be Mad Max (1979) for the scenery and Equilibrium (2002) for the fighting scenes. Personally I was also thinking I was watching a film version of the computer game Fallout 3, with even the color scheme being much the same as well as the scenery. Still, it's better to steal well than to create bad so I can forgive this folly.What I had more trouble was the fact that the film wanders into an all too standard script with all too standard characters -- good is good, bad is bad, and no one ever changes. And that makes the total for the film a negative one - it's boring.4 out of 10 lost souls wandering the scorched Earth",The Book of Eli

107,saadanathan,The book of average 5/10,5,6 July 2020,"""The Book Of Eli"" is nothing more than an average post apocalyptic movie. Seeing another movie that happens in an apocalyptic world was not on my schedule today and I was expecting a more complex story. I am happy though that this time there were no aliens attacking humans and that this is a story that can be related to reality. Who knows? Maybe one day the world will look just like in the movie and so it feels like reality. On the other hand I wasn't expecting much: what disappointed me the most was that the creators pumped this whole mystery about the book too much until it's revealed what is the book all about. I wasn't surprised to discover that the whole thing was about the bible😐. Like seriously? That's the best the creators could have come up with??? A bible is the key to salvation? To me it felt like lazy writing and I was expecting a more smarter focus on the script. Half way through the movie and I wasn't getting even more impressed. At least the actors did a good job: Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman are the finest actors alive and have great chemistry together on screen. The rest are fine. Overall I wasn't expecting much from the beginning based on the movie being average as possible, I was expecting though for a better writing and complexity.

Along the way he met a girl who seemed interested in his jaunt across the large wasteland of California. The wasteland it seemed was because of possible wars which lead to the failure of the O-zone layer. Indications of clues leading to his blindness was odd things that a person could point out. Such as his character saying, do you hear that? or can you smell that? Or another clue is his feeling a flame on a lighter to see if it works. But most of the audience couldn't tell if he was blind until the very end where the bad guy realizes the version he had was a bible, but a bible for blind people. Unique off take I say. To others who commented about his blindness, the reason he could shoot with such accuracy, is because when a person is blind, all other senses are off the charts, smell, taste, hearing, touch, even vibrations through the earth. He could tell where they stand or walk to in a few seconds to determine the range and the wind changes of how that person walks. Simply put, he was a over sensed radar.

The Book Of Eli features yet another captivating performance by Denzel Washington in a rare action role.
Set in a post apocalyptic world where a man travels across country in a quest to protect a sacred book that holds the secret to saving humankind.Gary Oldman once again takes on the roll as the villain with such mastery as only he can.
There's strong support from Mila Kunis and Ray Stevenson but it is the bold visuals that are the true star of this show.
A bleak colour palette is utilised which evokes a sense of dispair and decay.
The Hughes brothers convey the harsh hot environment and the blinding sun with some vibrant contrast levels and use of stark colour.
This is a bold and unique looking movie. Think 'Mad Max' but with the colour on your TV turned way down.Sound is also very effective. A pleasurable surround sound experience.
The gun fight in the town and the shoot up at the house being very intense.
Bullets whiz from speaker to speaker and the scene with the Gatling gun offers some really impactful LFE.
'The Book Of Eli' is a great movie to showcase a decent Home theatre set up.I had a good time with this movie. It is both visually and aurally impressive with a good script, fine direction and cinematography.

I didn't judge the film by the religious element or what it had to say about religion and man-kind.Now, some people may say criticize the fact that I excuse the religious portion and use the film purely as entertainment and that's true. And ultimately isn't that what the film was made for? Perhaps there was a vague desire to deliver a message but really, the film is entertainment.The photography is beautiful.

The roads belong to gangs that would murder a man for his shoes, an ounce of water... or for nothing at all.But they're no match for this traveler.A warrior not by choice but necessity, Eli (Denzel Washington) seeks only peace but, if challenged, will cut his attackers down before they realize their fatal mistake. It's not his life he guards so fiercely but his hope for the future; a hope he has carried and protected for 30 years and is determined to realize. Driven by this commitment and guided by his belief in something greater than himself, Eli does what he must to survive—and continue.Only one other man in this ruined world understands the power Eli holds, and is determined to make it his own: Carnegie (Gary Oldman), the self-appointed despot of a makeshift town of thieves and gunmen. Meanwhile, Carnegie's adopted daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) is fascinated by Eli for another reason: the glimpse he offers of what may exist beyond her stepfather's domain.But neither will find it easy to deter him.

Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for us. For out of the ground we were taken, for the dust we are... and to the dust we shall return.""Today movie review is the science-fiction post-apocalyptic flick The Book of Eli (2010) starring my man Denzel Washington who plays a lone traveller wandering the wasteland of America that may be result of a nuclear war years earlier. We are introduced to a bleak, plain and glaring landscape with a few abandoned cars, broken highways, a chaotic society where food and water are scarce which can be purchased through trade of whatever you may carry - for example wet wipes. The lone character is heading west and is on a mission. He is seeking the fulfilment of his mission given to him by God by protecting the only surviving King James Bible.The lone man comes across a town where it is run by a power hungry man, Carnegie, played by Gary Oldman, who rules the town with the use of fear and rationing the drinkable water. Carnegie is determined to rise above everyone and expand his authority, however he needs a useful instrument or in this case a book. When he finds out the lone man has the book he will do anything to take the book for his own personal use.The lone man's name is unknown until the very end, hence using the word lone man. This movie has heaps of biblical references, not including quoting scripture and teaching the new generation on how to pray and how he heard the voice of God. The story of a lone man's difficult journey must rely on his faith in order to protect the words of God through the Bible seemed farfetched however the movie exceeded in the storytelling by making it entertaining and simple with the main theme of this movie is even though in a world where compassion is secondary to survival and self-interest, one man's journey and mission overcomes these challengers due to having faith and believing in one's self. Even amidst a bleak life, one can rise and accomplish anything. The Kali style fight sequences, where the lone man has quick hands with literally his hands, knifes and machete are awesome, in particular the fight scene in the tunnel and in the bar where it may be dark however the illuminated backdrop gives the scene a visual striking - just feels like it's from a comic book. The movie literally gripped my attention from the lone man listening to old school jams through the use of his iPod, to the old cannibal couple towards the end playing ""Ring My Bell"" by using a phonograph and how the filmmakers used a Western style in the movie; where a lone man comes into town and confront the local badass.Great performance by Washington who carries the film as the man who is fixed in his sole mission from God and the idea that without knowledge and culture we are reduced to nothing but savages. The middle part of the movie did drain a little, not sure what happened but the pace felt it paused until crossing path with the old mad couple. The final 10 minutes of the film blew me away, an awesome twist which I did not see coming, it felt like a sucker punch and was like woahhhhhh whattttt!!! Any movie that provide that level of entertainment is definitely worth the watch, overall 7.5/10.",The Book of Eli
117,benoit-3,A generic post-apocalyptic film that is itself the product of a post-literate society,6,15 June 2010,"This film postulates a post-apocalyptic society where the survivors have become conscience-less killers solely bent on survival. This new society is illiterate (except for the characters payed by British actors, for some mysterious reason). A wanderer through it (Denzel Washington) holds on to the last copy of the Bible, which he uses for his personal moral betterment. All such books were understandably burned by the survivors because the nuclear holocaust itself was caused by a war of religions. A local evil crime-boss (Gary Oldman) wants to get hold of a copy of the Good Book at all cost, because he sees in it the best way to further enslave and exploit the desperate, the poor and the ignorant he longs to control. God knows it's worked before The problem with this film is that it is itself the product of a post-literate society. Every element of the script has been borrowed – not from books or novels – but from other films and even comic books too numerous to mention. Its art direction, like that of countless other recent productions, is entirely derived from the comics of French artist Jean Giraud, creator of the ""Lieutenant Blueberry"" series. Every plot point is conceived in visual terms, i.e. how it will look on the screen. This logic leads to multiple scenes of violent carnage (often perpetrated by the ""Christian"" hero) with machetes, guns, axes, crowbars, chain-saws and explosives, like any other B-grade action or horror film, or, more precisely, like any post-apocalyptic-themed video game offering an extreme violence content. ""The Book of Eli"" is actually just another comic book for Americans who are too illiterate to read a comic book.The cinematography uses filter manipulations that make it veer into a blue-green nightmare (like countless other recent productions) verging towards monochromatic ochre through much of its running time and finally giving us a glimpse of colour towards the end. This happens to be the cheapest way to give a film's art direction unity (not to mention making your movie look like it was directly lifted from the pages of graphic novel). I insist on noting here that when Jean-Pierre Jeunet used colour manipulation in a film like ""Amélie"" (2001), he did it in a playful and whimsical manner, an attitude that is miles removed from that of the makers.Its ""music"", except for a few final bars borrowed from the religious repertoire, is really electronically manipulated noise putting the accent on the lowest, stomach-churning frequencies the human ear can endure. This is known as ""fear music"", the kind that plays round the clock on the History channel (the ""H"" stands for ""hignorance"") during its never-ending post-apocalyptic-themed pseudo-documentaries.The film itself lacks logic in many ways. Questions such as ""How did Eli survive the gunshot?"", ""Where do the thugs get their gas?"", ""Doesn't the most compact Braille version of the King James Bible come in 17 over-sized and unwieldy volumes?"", ""Given the film is made by morons for morons, isn't is safe to suppose that an awful lot of them will assume that Eli is himself blind if he carries a Braille Bible (even if he is never seen actually reading from it)?"", ""Why does the final printed Bible come with footnotes?"" and ""Why should Denzel Washington entrust his career to such a gimmicky premise?"" are never answered. The film also overstays its welcome by a good thirty minutes during which it has ample time to choke on its own sanctimonious pretensions and doubly underline the painfully obvious. This is sad because its cast includes many fine actors chosen either for their talent (Washinton, Oldman, Frances de la Tour, Michael Gambon, Tom Waits), their photogenic qualities (Mila Kunis) or their resemblance to comic book characters (Ray Stevenson, Evan Jones and a host of other murderous thugs).The script is so badly written, more than one interpretation of Elis' ""blindness"" is possible, namely (among many others): (1) Eli has been blinded by the flash but has miraculously learned to read the miraculously-compacted Braille book he miraculously found and miraculously can go through all the motions of a seeing person, like miraculously hunting a cat and miraculously feeding a mouse; (2) Eli is not blind, has never learned how to read Braille or any other language (he is illiterate, like the writers) and he is totally guided by faith, having learned the Bible by heart through either his ""voice"" or a mentor; (3) Eli is blind but can see during the main part of the film, from the moment he wakes up in the cabin until his eyes ""glaze over"" (according to some) towards the end; (4) Denzel Washington is himself blind. He had to blindly rely on his agent to commit to this disastrous project and never really read the script. Any film whose moral seems to be: ""See, boys and girls, if you believe hard enough in the Bible, you too will be able to kick ass and decapitate bad guys on sight with a machete, just like a real blind Ninja in a real video game or a real Muslim terrorist in a real life situation"" deserves nothing but contempt. In a society where films like this one have become the main form of entertainment, it is to be expected that people will indeed become illiterate, blind, deaf, dumb, leprous, conscience-less and murderous. No nuclear holocaust needed.The fact that the book which caused all this mayhem survives at the end is by far the most chilling aspect of this film. It makes you wonder what happened to the comic books...",The Book of Eli
118,srdjan_veljkovic,It has its moments but is way too silly religious,4,2 September 2018,"Just a hint of religion would be OK. But, this is way too much, it feels like a sermon. Eli is blind? Ain't no way he could do many of the things he did, like, say, see he's at the end of a broken bridge/overpass. You can't _hear_ that, unless you're Marvel's Daredevil. Yes it does explain some things, like, how it takes it 30 years to go from (presumably) one coast of US to the other, but, it makes a lot of other things really silly, comic-book style.If you take that out, though it's a big part of the movie as-is, what's left has a few interesting moments, even some funny ones. But, even then, it's too little to make some impact.Acting isn't all that good either. Denzel is not in his comfort zone here, Mila Kunis needs much more make up to look good and can't act anyways. Jennifer Beals is just about the only one doing a good job (and looking great).So, yeah, with some significant changes in story and a different cast, there's a good story&movie hiding in there. As is, it just seems like a bad, religious, rip-off of Mad Max (the good ones, with Mel Gibson).",The Book of Eli

120,D_Burke,This Movie Blew Me Away,10,24 January 2010,"I had some expectations going in to see ""The Book of Eli"". I expected it would be good, because there isn't a movie that I know of that Denzel Washington stars in that is terrible. ""Mo' Better Blues"" wasn't great, but it had its moments and was the closest thing I can think of to a terrible movie that Washington has done so far. There's no doubt that Washington has his pick of movies, and he has rarely (maybe never) chosen a God-awful movie to do. I also expected the post-apocalyptic backdrop that had been done before in the ""Mad Max"" movies and ""I Am Legend"", only with a lot more violence.This movie certainly met those expectations. However, it was so much more than just an action film, and did so many more things right than other recent action films of the same nature. ""The Book of Eli"", in my opinion, is flawless in its cinematography, its storytelling, and its character development. It's greatest appeal is that it's a film made for an intelligent audience, and does not once break the Golden Rule of storytelling: Show, Don't Tell. Many action films fall into that trap of not letting the audience figure out things for themselves.This film also benefits from a smart ad campaign that doesn't give too much away in the previews. As the film progresses, you find that Eli is the name of Denzel Washington's character, and the book he has in his possession is the Holy Bible (King James version). The other copies of the book had apparently been destroyed in the nuclear war that had occurred over 30 years prior, and cost the lives of most of the population. Most of the Earth's remaining inhabitants are unable to read, and don't see the value of books that renegade leader Carnegie (Gary Oldman) does.Carnegie believes that having possession of the book will give him power over those nuclear holocaust survivors who are looking for hope, thereby making him a Jim Jones-like character with ruthlessness like Darth Vader. Once Eli comes into town with the book, Carnegie tries to get the book by all means necessary.So why does Eli have the book, and what is he going to do with it? That's where the story becomes interesting, and eventually reveals a twist ending that really had me surprised at how unexpected and original it all was. I'm even afraid to give away what he says as the motivation behind why he has the book, for there are subtle clues as the movie progresses.Washington takes the character of Eli and adds depth to him that few other actors probably could. He's not just tough as nails, although that aspect of him makes for some great fight scenes. Oldman makes a great bad guy as always, and is interesting because he knows how knowledge can be power, yet uses violent means to gain that knowledge. Such a character creates a fascinating paradox.In addition to Washington and Oldman, the film had other surprises in terms of acting. I haven't seen Jennifer Beals in a while, but she's great in a role that is probably much darker and deeper than other films she has done so far. Mila Kunis also loses the whiny voice that made her famous in ""That 70's Show"" and ""Family Guy"", and goes for gold as a supporting player who is not just a damsel in distress, a naive sidekick, or a comic relief character. There are elements of each of these archetypes in her role, but she's convincing as someone who wants to help Eli, but doesn't know what's in store for her. Perhaps her best scenes are when she fights for herself, because any now-cliché ""Matrix"" moves or any kind of melodramatic slow motion tricks are wisely left out.Kunis' character is a lot like the film itself: not just an action film, an epic, a western, a post-apocalyptic thriller, or a Christian allegory. It's a combination of all the right elements of those genres or sub-genres. It's also safe to say that this is the Hughes brothers' best film to date. They've had three previous feature films that were good (""Menace II Society"" (1992), ""Dead Presidents"" (1995), and ""From Hell"" (2000)), but it's clear to see how far they've come as filmmakers with this movie. They tell an original story here that seems like a cliché movie at first, but immediately and unexpectedly changes course when you least expect it. The ending, therefore, was original and unexpected, not to mention all the more poignant. All those elements added to some exceptional cinematography (especially the first fight scene completely in silhouette) made this movie a modern masterpiece in my book.Even though I am an amateur film critic, I am very conservative when it comes to how many stars I give a film on this website. I only give 10 stars to films that are not only good, but move me in some way. They have to be memorable, and making you think helps too. That's why I highly recommend ""The Book of Eli"". Some moviegoers may be turned off by the violence, but it constitutes a shorter percentage of the film than the trailers make you believe.",The Book of Eli
121,tburke85,The Book Of Eli Is A Decent Apocalyptic Action Thriller,7,19 June 2010,"The Book Of Eli is a decent apocalyptic action thriller with some flaws which I'll get into later but I felt the good outweighed the bad. The Hughes brothers are admirable in making this film giving audiences a gritty apocalyptic world where nearly everything is destroyed and ash rains down from the sky. The Book of Eli reminded me a bit of The Road with Viggo Mortenssen. It seemed like both films were made in a similar way and besides for some exceptions is CG free. They used for the most part real locations and atmosphere to create hostile wastelands. Denzel Washington is good as always as the mysterious traveler Eli who holds in his possession a precious book that he will do whatever is necessary to protect from getting into the wrong hands. Washington's Eli is a driven and soft spoken drifter traveling West across a scorched earth. Oh and did I mention he just happens to be highly skilled martial artist too. Washington is convincing and believable as the character especially in the action/fight sequences. If Training Day didn't prove that he could kick some serious ass when he wants to, you definitely wouldn't want to mess with him after seeing this film I can tell you that much. Well done. Gary Oldman is solid as the villain Carnegie a powerful psychotic mobster type figure who runs one of the last remaining villages on the planet. Oldman doesn't exactly have a whole lot to do but he's effective as Carnegie none the less. He's a violent man who uses knowledge as power over others. Oldman's Carnegie remembers the world ""before the war"" who wants the same book and he's willing to do just about anything even sacrifice his own henchmen to get it. The supporting cast are also good including Mila Kunis as Solara who's taken under the wing by Eli, Ray Stevenson as Carnegies number one right hand man Redridge, Jennifer Beals as Solara's blind mother Claudia, and Michael Gambon in a brief role. They turn in decent performances along with the rest of the relatively unknown cast. The action/fight sequences are well executed and paced especially the first one with Eli taking on a gang of cannibals who get whats coming to them. The pacing of the movie is a little slow at times but it was good for the most part. The film lacked development for some characters and the catastrophe like The Road isn't entirely explained except for a few explanations given by Eli one of them being, ""The war tore a hole in the sky, the sun came down burned everything and everyone."" A more defined explanation would've been better so we know what happened which I guess it worked for the film though. Overall I can't think of too much I didn't enjoy about this movie. If you're a big fan of apocalyptic films than chances are you'll enjoy this one as well. I liked it more than 2012 which wasn't that bad but it relied heavily on CGI and was a bit overlong compared to this one. The Book of Eli has a similar but interesting story, action, drama, and solid performances by the cast (especially Washington and Oldman) who make this apocalyptic thriller worth the time to watch.",The Book of Eli
122,darkreignn,"Gorgeously helmed action, a powerful leading performance, and an intriguing plot",7,16 February 2021,"The year is 2010, and I'm in middle school. ""The Book of Eli"" just released, and my friends all get their parents to buy tickets for them so they can enter into the R-rated movie without getting yelled at by cinema employees. My mother, one who was particularly over-protective of me at that age, did not allow me to join my friends, damning me instead to a week of ridicule, where my friends told me how much they enjoyed the movie, and how badass it was to see someone's arm get cut off. Yes, those were simpler times, and as time fades all things, their excitement for the movie faded, as did my desire to see it. Enter Valentine's Day, 2021.HBO Max announced that they added ""The Book of Eli"" to their streaming portfolio, so I decided to fix myself a martini and give it a watch. And you know what? I can see why my friends loved it back in the day. ""The Book of Eli"" offers marvelous world building, a restrained but purposeful performance from Denzel Washington, and a plethora of gorgeously shot and choreographed action scenes, all of which combine wonderfully to offer a damn fine film.Denzel plays Eli, a survivor of a sort of cataclysmic war that ravaged the earth, leaving a large majority of its population blind. Only heading one way, west, and armed with a small arsenal of swords, firepower, and a book, Eli is a lone traveler, always on the move toward a nameless destination. It won't be a surprise for you to hear that Denzel owns this role; he's one of the best actors alive, and he commits to his performance here - every word out of his mouth feels powerful, every action purposeful. And when he finds himself engaged in conflict, you believe that he was the strength, willpower, and knowledge necessary to hold his own. Denzel is a joy to watch on screen, and if you're a fan of his, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch.As I mentioned earlier, the action sequences are handled with skill and professionalism. Gorgeous wides, longs, and one-shot takes grace the screen, enabling viewers to clearly witness everything that's happening - it's beautiful, it's impactful, and most importantly, it's exciting. From a silhouetted fight under a bridge to a one-shot-take showdown featuring a Gatling gun and a house in the middle of nowhere, every action scene is crafted with a real sense of audience-centricity - the directors clearly want viewers to feel engaged by witnessing the carnage in all of its cinematic glory.From a plot perspective, the movie can feel heavy handed, especially with certain lines of dialogue from Gary Oldman, who plays the villain. While I understand and agree with the overall message of the film, it can feel like the writers didn't think very highly of their audience, and so added in lines of clear exposition to make parallels that any attentive audience member would've picked up on anyway. That said, the story as a whole was interesting, with its message in particular very resonant, especially to those who are religious or have been raised in a religious upbringing.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, and will definitely be watching it again in the future. It's not perfect - some of the acting, especially from Mila Kunis, felt mildly out of place, and the story feels a bit too on the nose at points, but the intriguing plot, visceral, artistic action, and especially the fantastic performance by Denzel will keep you strapped in for the entire running time.",The Book of Eli
123,higherall7,The Last Survivor of Fahrenheit 451 is a Black Man!,8,5 March 2012,"Hard to believe all this hyper-violence started with The Man with No Name and Bruce Lee! 'THE BOOK OF ELI' is a moody, atmospheric thriller with the depth and the complexity of a graphic novel, which is about half a step up from a comic book. Its antecedents are more to be found in juvenile sci-fi than in works like FAHRENHEIT 451 by Bradbury, ODD JOHN by Olaf Stapelton, or STAND ON ZANZIBAR by John Brunner. However, there are several features of interest that stand out independently from the narrative that make it an entertaining piece of pop-culture fiction.When taken for what it really is, and met on its own terms, 'THE BOOK OF ELI' succeeds admirably in this post-blaxsploitation period where the lead character, being an African American, has '-a plan to sock it to the Man-'. Uh, in this case make it 'Mankind' and in the end in a positive way, if you buy what The Hughes Brothers and Gary Whitta have been cooking.Because it is this hodgepodge of pop-culture references, I found it oddly agreeable to my sensibilities. All breadth and no depth, it is a comment on our culture and society in ways it did not mean to be with assertions it didn't intend to make.The truth is it seems quite novel to see a Science Fiction protagonist listen to an electronic rendition of Al Green singing ""How Do You Mend a Broken Heart' before drifting off to sleep in the remains of the Apocalypse. He may not be able to invent anything, but he can sure lip-synch Soul Music! He is a man without a past, wandering the American Wasteland '-with no direction home, like a-'-well, you know the rest. Since he has no past, except in the 'TWILIGHT ZONE', he need answer to no one about anything. There is no need to explain his exceptional fighting skills since he is a newly minted graduate espousing the Gospel of Clint Eastwood and Kato and Samurai Jack.The grizzly fight scenes are well done poetic ballets, but let's face it, it is always good to see a Black Man throw down and take no-well, you know the rest. Some of the viewers were really shocked and disappointed and somewhat disgusted to find out what the book was Eli was protecting. But when you consider the ethnicity of the directors and how adroitly African Americans have used the principles of Christianity to sincerely attain new freedoms for themselves on an evolving basis and create in the Black Church the only real institution that they actually control, what other book did you expect the brother to take on his journey? No, you better believe Christ Jesus was going to get his props and bump what you think and say! The Lord came through when you wouldn't do nothing for me!The Bible actually represents of course the spiritual values that enabled Black People to retain their humanity throughout the oppression and exploitation of slavery, although I am sure the Hughes brothers meant to convey this message in a larger context. The problem of course is since Washington is busy playing the Invincible Black Samurai of the West, he seems more the disciple of Kurosawa that anyone or anything he has internalized out of the Bible! It is a difficult balancing act to play the baddest man on the planet one moment and the Lamb of God the next. Strange to say, that the Hughes brothers nearly pull it off anyway!I like the fact that when bad guy Gary Oldman finally gets his grubby mitts on the King James Version of the Bible, the only person qualified to decipher its message is the blind Jennifer Beals. It is suggestive of the spiritual power and moral high ground women at times seem to assume over men by simply not being the initiators of war, rape and pillage. That somehow, the Good Book now gives power to a brutalized woman instead of the man who lusted and killed for such power is an interesting twist, no matter how inexpertly stated.Anyone who has really researched or understands the primary importance of the Oral Tradition in African Society will find that the ending particularly will resonate with them as it did with me. The idea of gleaning wisdom from a printed page rather than from face to face human contact did not sit too well with Socrates. He felt that the movement from the Oral to the Written Tradition would be a regression rather than an advance in human understanding. But to see Denzel Washington's character in the greatest extremity depend upon the Oral Tradition rather the Written Tradition for final success seems uniquely African. It is, as well, an inversion of the final scene between the young boy and the dying grandfather in 'FAHRENHEIT 451'.I would have to say that 'THE BOOK OF ELI', in its war between derivative superficiality and what true values endure in the end, turns out to have a peculiar something going for it. Even when its reach exceeds, as it often does, its grasp.",The Book of Eli
124,fimimix,....don't know exactly how to take this movie....,6,27 January 2011,"...""Dick Steel"" wrote such an intelligent/unbiased review, it's hard to beat it - look for it.....By now, EVERYONE knows the story of this movie, so I shall only give my opinion (which are usually quite long, but this time quite short) - I really didn't understand this film while I was watching it: I had not heard anything about it, so was watching it by suggestion from another person, and had no idea what it was about. I must admit I coudn't tell one actor from the other........from reading a good many of the other reviews, I am convinced most of them were written by males......who else would be so disappointed, almost insulted that such a film had been released? I was rather shocked by the number of people who were insulted by a religious film - one reviewer reminded everyone that the big ones, some years ago (like ""Ben Hur"") were box-office hits. I think the reason for most of those who truly disliked this film were overly macho and truly know (or care) about any religious teachings....I respect their opinions.......read them to justify the making of this film.From the first scene, it was apparent to me this was a post-armageaden film - the ""coloring"" of it was so ghastly. I could not grasp why ""Eli"" (Denzel Washington) was so violent.....I had no idea his mission in life was to protect ANY object; I, for one, don't mind being educated by other viewers about things in a movie, while I'm watching. I was not aware he was playing a blind character. I didn't realize there was no edible food (nor water) and people were busy eating one another; although it was apparent everyone was quite crazed and violent, I didn't know why. I thought the action-shots were very good, but didn't know the reason for their necessity. So, although I enjoyed the film, I didn't know it's real plot until I read many of these reviews. Unlike many, the twist at the end did not insult me, nor did I care where they found all the paper to print it - I also feel justified in disliking ""Carnegie"" (Gary Oldman) because he had such a craze to own ""The Book"", and was delighted he was shocked to discover it was written in braille.....Ha !!! I, too, was surprised that Alcatraz was the chosen place ""Eli"" had to reach, and didn't understand how he got there with a life-threatenting wound WITHOUT THE BOOK !!! I do believe that God works miracles to protect good people from harm, especially when they are doing His work. Re-publishing The Bible, I feel, would fall in that category. I DID understand the point of placing it between ""The Quran"" and ""The Torah"". Good place for it......Actually, my only reason for writing this review is not to praise nor demean the film, but to assure whoever cares - I do NOT want to live in such a horrid world this film so eloquently displays. Let me be right under ""the bomb"" or ""the hole in the sky"" - to exist in such a dreadful world is not for me. However, I could watch it again.......",The Book of Eli
125,basrutten,Deliver us from drivel,3,23 April 2010,"The one nice thing that can be said about this movie is that it is nicely shot (even though the repetitive shots of people against a sky of moving clouds get old fast). Everything else is pure drivel.If you want to watch to watch this for the action, you'll probably end up feeling cheated. There are only a couple of action sequences and they are all a dime a dozen. If you want some postapocalyptic action, check out Mad Max, Doomsday, or, god forbid, Waterworld. All are a lot more enjoyable.If we strip away the meager action, then we are left with an overly dramatic and rather nonsensic story. The movie takes itself Very Seriously but nobody bothered to actually check if it makes any sense. It doesn't. It's very poorly veiled religious propaganda full op plot holes (e.g. where does he find all those weapons) that ends up disproving its own points.The movie makes a big point about the mysterious book our hero is carrying, but it's painfully obvious within 5 minutes that it's a Bible. What's worse is that the hero is presented as well, a hero, even though he's semi-invulnerable and stands idly by as a woman is raped, because he ""is on a mission"". Nice message. Next, the movie claims that you pretty much need a Bible to become civlized; he passes by all kinds of people that could have actually benefited from it and takes it to the one place that has done perfectly well without a Bible for all these years. Nice way to shoot yourself in the foot...I could go on and on about this, but the case in point is that it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.The Bible is a nice book that contains a lot of very useful things, but as long as you don't practice what you preach it's useless. This movie does exactly the opposite, elevating a bunch of words to something semi-magically (dare I say an idol?) instead of focusing what religion should be about: helping people.3 out of 10.",The Book of Eli
126,torstensonjohn,Prophetic Telling Of One Man,7,13 July 2018,"The Book of Eli has an interesting ring to it that makes the viewer think one thing when the meaning is something else entirely. The Book of Eli is a 2010 American post-apocalyptic film with a very neo-Western, action, dram ties to it. Directed by the Hughes brothers, written by Gary Whitta, and starring Denzel Washington (Eli), Gary Oldman (Carnegie), Mila Kunis (Solara), Ray Stevenson (Redridge), and Jennifer Beals (Claudia). The story itself is creative and resonates around Eli, a nomad in world ripped apart by nuclear war. We come to find out he travels because he feels it is his destiny and a voice says a path will be laid out for him to deliver a book. The history of the post-war world is explained along the way, as is the importance of Eli's task. 
He is a warrior, a voice of the voiceless and will stop at nothing along the way to bring the book to where he feels it belongs. Tremendous performances from Denzel and Gary Oldman. The editing was a little choppy in places but does not take away from the story. The film relishes in it's pivotal message as to do more for others than you do for yourself. 
All in all a good film for it's length and pace. I give it a solid 7 out of 10",The Book of Eli
127,monkeysgalore,One of the Greatest Creative Visions Put to Film,10,7 April 2020,"What an awesome movie. I mean come on. Denzel Washington carries the Bible across a post-apocalyptic America and is forced into conflict with a local town owner and bully, who wants the book for himself. How is that not a winner?Some, no, many will disregard this as ""religious propaganda"", and your opinion on this film entirely depends on your view of religion, and your ability to objectively enjoy something. I am a Christian, so obviously this movie catered to me, but I'm gonna review this objectively as a normal film and not Christian high art, so please don't just dismiss me.Denzel is such a bad dude in this movie. He's just too cool. He is as likable and charismatic as usual, if not more so, though he's effectively restrained, and he revels in his blank-faced stoicism as a calm and often silent badass. He's awesome. Gary Oldman is as good a villain as ever, and is every bit Denzel's equal as the sadistic and power-hungry villain. Mika Kunis is also unexpectedly good, and manages to not look horrible while working alongside heavyweights like Denzel and Oldman.The action sequences are amazing. The silhouette fight scene under the bridge is beautifully shot and viscerally violent. The bar fight is glorious and the street shootout is quite done. After a bit of a slow stretch where the film carefully develops its characters and the central situation, then the house shootout and car scenes come. All these sequences are high-impact and very masterfully-done.The Hughes Brothers are masters of their craft, and they helm the project skillfully and wonderfully. This is a weird movie to do with their track record, but they really proved themselves. The movie is beautifully shot too, with some great visuals and stunning cinematography, complete with a pale, sort of washed-out look that makes this film much more atmospheric and gripping. The editing pulls it all together, with perfect cuts and and obvious care which accentuates the movie's style.Awesome fight scenes, Denzel decapitating some dudes in a bar along with lots of other graphic violence and some darkly disturbing moments, a cannibalistic elderly couple, and inspiring religious imagery and symbolism. All these are ingredients to this truly amazing dystopian action spectacle. Tom Waite is even in it. It's one of Denzel's best I think. Please watch this movie.",The Book of Eli
128,Dragonsouls,"A old fashioned film, which was refreshing to see!",8,18 January 2010,"I have just returned from the theater feeling very satisfied after watching the Book of Eli. I didn't have high hopes for it since the reviews have been spotty but how could I pass up a film with two of my favorite actors in it? Denzel was as good as you could be for a role like Eli's. He didn't have to speak much, but talked with his eyes; he had as much presence as Clint Eastwood had in his old westerns. And the great Gary Oldman was as inspired as ever in his role as perhaps the world's last and first gangster. The script was well written even though it was short on plot driven elements, with no twists or shocking endings; eh...not really a shocking ending, but the end of this film surprises with a metaphorical revelation.Besides Westerns, the movie also had Eastern cinematic overtones as well reminding me of Kurosawa flicks as well as Sergio Leone. The actors are silent during showdowns, saying very little. Electronica music in the background adds to the tension. I love the Hughes brothers and the work they did with ""From Hell"" I could always expect old fashioned film-making, long shots, just a few cameras per scene and great set design. The sets in this film are wonderful, and it also has plenty of CGI to go with it too. The film is dark and it shows. At first glance, you'd think the film was Black and White. The water shortage on earth shows with gray skies, fast moving clouds that make the setting feel like its on another planet. I immediately thought of the video game- ""Fallout 3"" in some scenes, and the atmosphere was awesome in this film, something the Hughes brothers do very, very well; and that's creating atmosphere.As for the writing and plot, it's been seen before but this time the main subject is the book. It's like a character itself, and a lot of the dialog is centered around what the book is, what it caused, and what it could be used for and how. What the film does well is show how barbaric and down people have become and how important the most basic philosophies could help a young person realize good from bad. Most of the characters think all the killing and raping they see around them everyday is normal, and it is nice to see why religion is important today, where it is overlooked, and in a world we take for granted; as Denzel explains in the film- (Minor Spoilers) ""We used to throw away things in the trash that we have to kill for today"" The film is very thought provoking, depressing at times, and inspiring too.I rate the film an 8/10, very good solid acting and directing, even though there were some out of place comedic scenes in it, and the film could have been rated PG-13. I also think the action fighting scenes looked too choreographed. Denzel isn't Jackie Chan yet, maybe with a bit more training! But go see the film, one of those films that you think about long after leaving the theater.",The Book of Eli
129,mrcibubur,I saw the Road and this is no Road!,5,1 February 2010,"I wont say I did not enjoy this movie but this is a poor mans 'The Road' with all its apocalyptic overtones from the beginning till the end. Good acting by Denzel Washington absolutely but this is overcome a slow and perhaps drab film and there is no real drama of excitement in it, let alone humour. the religious reference to the 'Bible Book' is at times vague and it is some 30 or 40 minutes before it is mentioned with any substance. I must concur with the apprehension that it would not take 30 years to walk cross America heading west from any given place. Often I wanted something to happen and it didn't and I felt disappointed. this is one apocalyptic movie too many for me and will soon be forgotten. Not much else to commend it but I did watch until the end, certainly don't need intelligence to watch this movie.",The Book of Eli

This is Washingtons worst role to date and a thorough let down on all sides technically. The Book of Eli was stupid as well as idiotic in that nothing made sense. The action, dialogue and casting was absolutely out of place and didn't serve any meaning or emotional response from me. It had this tone of being an MTV style movie that looked tacky and out place. And why did Gary Oldman want to take part in this gruelling and underly layered flop? I mean, he starred in The Dark Knight so surely seeing the quality of that compared to this he should have easily said no. But obviously not.",The Book of Eli
131,Ric-7,Unnecessary extra ending to good film,7,21 January 2010,"If you have not seen this film, please do not read this comment, because there are spoilers.I don't consider this film a masterpiece, but I did enjoy it and I was never bored. In retrospect, there were several very improbable facts, not the least of which is why there was only one remaining copy. The film also does not attempt to explain very deeply the realities of daily life. Such as where does the food come from? Do canned goods have a shelf life of decades? And why there were no surviving dogs. Only cats. (Maybe dogs tasted better.) The film is a parable, or a fantasy. Not science-fiction. The point of the film is a matter of faith rather than fact.The ending is muddled and in my opinion, very anti-climactic. I think the film should have ended with the extreme close-up of Eli's eyes, about ten minutes before the film actually ended. Everything that occurs after that close-up is unnecessary and some of it actually undercuts the point of the film.For example, all of the plot developments before Eli's close-up suggest that his survival, his mission, his near-supernatural abilities, have a divine origin. There might be other explanations, but the film furnishes no basis for any alternate scenarios. We are led to believe that It Was Meant To Be, rather than just random good luck for 30 years.The close-up scene near the end gives the pay-off for what the film was apparently building up to. And then . . . total anti-climax.Do we need to see Gary Oldman punished for his transgressions? That's not the point of the film. I think a quick shot of him opening a book that proves useless to him would have been more than sufficient. (And didn't that book look different from the one we earlier saw?) And did we need to see Solara setting out at the end, in the opposite direction, armed with the knife but not the book? What could be the point of that? Worst of all, the apparently tacked-on ending had the book being fitted on the shelf of a library, among other similar books (so as to offend no one), rather than being turned over to some group who would treasure it for more than its Jacobean prose. Eli walked cross-country for 30 years just to make a donation to the Alcatraz library? If any addition is needed past the close-up where Eli begins, it might be a dissolve to him reciting the very last verse of the KJV Old Testament, which would be a fitting comment for the desolation shown in the movie. The verse speaks of the coming of Elijah:""And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.""",The Book of Eli
132,krzysiektom,abhorrent vehicle for creationism,3,1 February 2010,"Well there we go again, the creationist camp strikes again via Hollywood. Just like the TV series ""Supernatural"" and a few other productions, this one is basically a trick to covertly sell as ""sexy"" and appealing the following ideas: 1. Bible is a special and very powerful book. 2. Bible is the true word of God. 3. God created the world. (In the case of ""Supernatural"" it was also: guns are useful, should be owned by everybody, the colt built America.) When u think about it and watch the film again it will become clear. Too bad the film as such is mediocre and we have seen it all before, and better. The entire premise is quite ridiculous: all the copies of Bible in the entire USA have been destroyed??? Really? Which book is currently no 1 in the USA in terms of print? The Bible. In almost every room of every hotel, motel, inn, roadhouse, in almost every school, u name it. Must be millions. Add to that the ocean of copies owned privately by tens of thousands of families or single persons. So after the blast all of them gave their copies of this so dear and sacred book away for destruction??? I repeat: ridiculous. The ""only"" remaining copy - in Eli's possession, seems in a very good shape, considering it is apparently 30 years later. And in this time he apparently studies it, so that he is able to memorize it. By Braille? He can read Braille? Or maybe the producers on purpose indicate he could not, so then at the end when he dictates it, it is not from memory, but inspired by God, as a prophet or an apostle? Which would suggest it is a clearly, precisely a word of God himself. Hence the happiness of the conservative, Christian, creationist camp to finance this average post-apocalypter.

136,blacklist-1,Don't read this book! It's utter trash!,1,8 April 2010,"Considered for me so far out of the twelve films I have seen at the cinema in 2010. The Book of Eli is the worst and probably will remain that for the rest of the year. I was looking forward to this movie but it was a pile of rubbish.Denzel Washington (at his worst) plays the character of Eli who travels across post-apocalyptic America (which is desolate) blind whilst carrying a bible, which he quotes out of. He has astonishing fighting skills with guns, swords and hand to hand combat. He comes across Gary Oldman (who acts just as bad) who plays the principal villain Carnegie. He wants Eli's book as he believes it will help him control the world. At the same time a young woman Solara played by the pretty Mila Kunis who is being terrorised by Carnegie joins Eli.This movie is crap, the plot is ridiculous with gaping plot holes like we don't find out why America's become a desolate wasteland and there is no back story to Eli's life, which makes him an uninteresting character. Eli talks sanctimonious babble about religion and preserving life, which he dosen't do. In one scene he lets an elderly couple get raped and beaten to death and says to himself he can't help them as he ""has to complete his mission"" He's meant to be the hero but I didn't like him. He also goes over the top in killing people like one scene in a bar he pushed a man's cat off the bar counter and then when the guy and his friends start on him he slices them to pieces. How pathetic. The action was not exciting as it happens too fast.The ending as well was completely implausible though I like what happens to Eli as he actually dies! The only things I liked about this film was a cameo from an odd old couple the man played by Micheal Gambon and whose time in the film was unfortunately too brief was entertaining and Mila Kunis was pretty and had some redeeming acting quality, but even that couldn't save this movie.

Coming into a small town of survivors, he encounters a man called Carnegie, who wants the book for himself.The Hughes Brothers, directors of From Hell and Menace II Society among others, have created an interesting and thoughtful action movie, that also carries a message of faith and hope. The action set-pieces are well handled, and the photography of the movie, is very well done. While the setting itself isn't particularly new, along similar lines to Mad Max and other movies of this kind, they still get some pretty impressive visuals.They are also helped by having two of the best actors around in this movie. Denzel Washington carries the movie easily and is also very convincing in the action sequences. Gary Oldman as Carnegie gives a performance more in line with some earlier work, such as Leon than some recent performances but he is always worth watching. The rest of the cast, led by Mila Kunis all give good support.If I have a concern for the movie, it's about the final moments of the movie, where a final twist happens. Without giving it away, I'm not completely sure it works within the movie.But it's a minor issue.

His travels soon take him to a small town controlled by a psychopath who is on a single-minded search for the world's most important book. Hmmm....and what book might that be?

The movie's comic-book-like fantasy story, combined with interesting visuals, keep one's interest to a point. The supporting cast is also strong. No doubt that's more than enough for many reviewers here, but the ending was in some ways both predictable and slightly odd, yet very unsatisfying.

They're all the same. The weakened rabble of humanity scraping through bits of dirt and dust for scraps of food. A lone traveler wandering the blasted countryside, single-handedly fighting thugs, rapists and murderers, inspiring the peasantry as he passes. The traveler carries the special secret that will save humanity, and will collect an assortment of ill-fitting allies who will help him on his way to an unknown destination.Yawn.Perhaps in the old days, apocalyptic movies were interesting. When times are good, a post- apocalyptic thriller is tense, thrilling, scary, and exciting. Today, in a world with suicide bombers, religious warriors, right-wing zealots, oppressive governments, and failed economies, I'm kinda looking forward to the apocalypse. Hell, when it comes, I'll grab a lawn chair and a 6-pack and sit on the roof and watch it coming. It's hard to be afraid of an apocalypse when humanity certainly doesn't seem worth saving.Without fear as an element in a post-apocalyptic film, all that's left is the ridiculous. And ""Eli"" has plenty of that. You've seen it all before. The lone traveler is an uber-fighter of spectacular prowess, able to defeat masses of scruffy, overweight thugs with barely a scratch. How can people in a post-apocalyptic nightmare be obese anyway? There will be beautifully-coifed women to entice the scruffy traveler. Nice to know salons stay in business after the end of the world. There will be strange old people with a mysterious arsenal of weapons. I had no idea grenades would work after 30 years, and their firing mechanisms would still be so accurate to enable precision throwing at moving vehicle. In all these ways, and more, ""Eli"" is ridiculous.But there is something special buried in the middle of ""Eli"". The hero is escorting the last copy of the Bible to some unknown destination. This sounds incredibly weak. ""Oh, the Bible is the only thing that can save us!"" Pardon me while I lose my cookies in the lobby. But ""Eli"" does something unexpected: it actually manages to weave some very interesting socio- religious commentary in there. At times, it is very pro-Christian message, how the Bible can bring hope to the masses. At other times, it points out how religion can be used by the shady to control the ignorant masses. This shift weaves in and out of the screenplay, especially in the second half. It's often obvious and forced, but it's occasionally subtle and sublime. And then something very interesting happens at the end: the Bible, that supposed savior of mankind, is neatly bound and shelved in a museum in a fortress on a island. Is this the final commentary of the filmmakers, that the Bible (like the Torah and the Quran and other religious texts) is, in the end, as useful to helping people in need as a glass-cased artifact in a museum? And that it's up to strong willed people willing to wade back into the sloppy fray and help? You can read more or less into ""Eli"" than I did. Some folks, I'm sure, will read it one way, others will read it another. Some won't care about any ""message"", there are plenty of explosions and fights and ass-kicking for those folks. Others will see this as a pure pro- religion message (I could see busloads of Christians coming to see the film a la ""Passion of the Christ""). Others will revel in the film's anti-religious message, seeing it as a tool for control and the destined cause of the earth's destruction. I guess that's an endearing part of ""Eli"", you can probably make your interpretations, or even none at all.Giving it a 7 out of 10. It would be a 5 if it weren't for these interesting socio-religious facets of the script.",The Book of Eli
140,deacon_blues-3,"The more I think about it, the less I like it (at least the message).",8,9 February 2010,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the acting, cinematography, and character development of this film. But what at first glance seems to be a pro-Bible, or pro-Christian story, upon further reflection seems to me by this point merely another liberal slam against those who have genuine faith in the Bible as the Word of God. As a Christian myself, I did not at first interpret the Carnegie character as a caricature of Bible-believing evangelicalism, since he is so foreign to my experience of my fellow Christians. But upon reflection, I believe the film's intent was to portray those who truly believe in the exclusive, absolute authority of the Scriptures as a bunch of corrupt, power-mad, deluders of the masses. Of course, Carnegie is all that, and he is rightfully denied access to the Bible by Eli. But who deserves to have the Bible? Well, those who see it as just another good book among many others, those who take its contents, not as the inerrant Word of God, but with a grain of salt and a reminder to the audience that ""It ain't necessarily so!"" At the end, the Bible is merely shelved along with other ""holy"" books as one of the many needed foundations for human culture. It is interesting to note that the other religious tomes are in professionally published editions; implying that those books were not seen by the post-apocalyptic peoples as being responsible for the holocaust, but only the Bible was. Also implying perhaps that those religions are more peaceful than those based on the Bible, or that their representative deities are better at preserving their religious books than the God of Scripture is. I find it very doubtful and inconsistent that anyone who would discipline himself to memorize the entire BIble and also defend it with his very life would have such a mundane opinion of the Book itself. Either Eli didn't really believe the Bible was God's Word, or he was misled in giving to to people who didn't believe it had the same value that he believed it had. Some have observed (rather shallowly, I suspect) that Eli was actually a Muslim, because he shaves his head and dons a white robe in preparation for death. Although I do not see this as the actual intent of that scene, it would not be incongruous with the consistent message of the film, namely that the BIble is just another good book that helps us along the road of life along side the other religious writings of the world, and anyone who gives it a superior status over other schools of religion is merely a Carnegie-like tyrant who has no valid faith in the Bible, but only wises to use it as a tool to control the lives of the ignorant masses for his own greedy ends. One other incongruity in the film is that Eli's edition of the Bible, which Carnegie does finally get hold of, is in braille format, with the only blind person who reads braille unwilling to read it to him. But anyone who has ever seen a braille Bible knows that it would take several volumes of the size that Eli was carrying to hold one. As a final note, I personally am not, how shall I put it?, a ""big fan"" of the KJV. I consider it a fine translation for its day, but that its day is long past. In my experience the KJV may as well be in Latin for all its relevance to modern English-speaking peoples. Most preachers who use it are forced to spend a majority of their sermons translating it from 17th Century English so that their congregations can even feebly understand it. All-in-all, this is a superior film in terms of acting, directing, cinematography, and set design. It's not-so-subtle ax-to-grind against Bible-believing Christians is quite unfair and offensive, however. But since we of the cross are used to having calumny heaped upon us by the world around us, I can shrug off the intended offense, forgive, pray for their repentance and salvation, and appreciate the film for the high artistic achievement that it is. But, for a post-apocalyptic film with real heart-rending emotion, consistency of message, and near perfect greatness, I more highly recommend the film version of Cormac MacCarthy's ""The Road!""",The Book of Eli

The film is a simple tale of a man who is processes a book and with this book, he must head west to put it in good use. But there also another chap who wants to get his hands on the book and so we have this film in which we watch Eli makes his way to his destination while being hunted by rebels.The opening act does what it was set out to do and that's grabbing you in to this dreary, gritty world. Surprisingly the film only takes you too one key location in it opening hour. The film is never slow and the plot keeps jotting. This leads me to the negatives. The story was extremely weak and while you follow along with it, you can'y help but think how it going to end. I was hoping for a surprising ending, something that would catch me off guard but instead it was extremely weak.The action scenes were executed well and the characters were engaging but overall if you fancy a post apocalyptic film which isn't too heavy on it subject then this film i recommend",The Book of Eli

Well not this film, it looked good, great apocalyptic scenery, good music score, solid acting and not a bad story line. Sure it does not take much to work out where the story goes, but than again not much that comes from Hollywood is that original any more. It has a few slow parts in it, but enough action to make this a good solid film.

143,craig-hopton,Post-Apocalyptic Tale,7,6 June 2014,"This is a post-Apocalyptic tale which is an action movie at heart but with the feel of a religious epic. It's a curious mix that actually works really well and feels fresh and different.Eli, played by Denzel Washington, is a solitary man trying to take the world's last copy of the bible to a place of safe-keeping. He comes under attack from men trying to get hold of the book for their own nefarious ends, but it helped by Mila Kunis's character Solaris.Where the movie succeeds most of all is as a straightforward action hero flick ""one against many"" with Eli wielding almost supernatural strength and fighting ability to battle his way through.Where it could have been better is as a morality tale. There are themes for example like the power of words/the Word, and whether you should deviate from your purpose to help others in distress, that are touched on at times but could have been strengthened and explored more.Overall though I really enjoyed it.",The Book of Eli
144,Simon_Says_Movies,An enjoyable gritty action film but a mixed bag,7,13 March 2010,"Having now starred in movies for more than twenty years, Denzel Washington now carries the sort of movie-star prestige that dates back to the Hollywood golden ages of Bogart and Grant. His dedication to each role, even in instance where the material fails him, is admirable. Whether playing soulful characters or a gung-slinging badass, Washington is a commanding screen presence and with The Book of Eli he continues to impress and is the single greatest reason to see this mixed bag of post- apocalyptic film-making. Washington stars (not surprisingly) as Eli a wondering soul amidst a world decimated by a tragic event. This end-of-days style catastrophe is never discussed in detail, only alluding to 'burns' and 'the flash' and judging by the widespread devastation has some origins in a war or massive explosion of some kind. But the how is not as important as the now, and the grey, desaturated landscapes are mesmerizingly realized. This is not a happy movie. Eli's only remaining purpose in life is to deliver a mysterious book (spoiler!!! (not really) it's the bible) to safety. As he dices his way through ruthless gangs, his trek takes him to a town controlled by a ruthless but cultured leader by the name of Carnegie, played by Gary Oldman. When Carnegie learns of the books existence he tried to reason with Eli to turn over ownership. When he of course refuses, hell is let loose and Eli flees the town with hostiles in hot pursuit. He is joined by a young girl named Solara (Mila Kunis) who was born after the event who feels a both a bond with him and the lost words of the bible.The Book of Eli is an enjoyable gritty action film, with its religious overtones kept subtle and tolerable for the majority of the running length. That is until the ending of course, where along with a ludicrous twist, much of the nuance and refinement is all but erased. I admire the attempt, but scold the outcome. Thankfully the portions I enjoyed trumped the ill-conceived finale so it is still worth a look. There will no doubt be some for which the ending will work, and they will find a quality film with Eli.Aside from Washington, the set pieces and art direction are the biggest assets at play. The film evokes part 3:10 to Yuma, part Children of Men and part Road Warrior and successfully at that. The action sequences are brash and bloody; always with a palpable tension and sense of impending doom. Eli is a damaged man and he is played with empathy and hardness. Nobody can play deep and deadly like Denzel and he plays it with the nuance and charm that makes him a star.",The Book of Eli

And there'll be plenty of dull, listless, inactive posing by Denzel Washington in super cool dark glasses that Joe Biden might envy. Denzel is better with a gun than Clint Eastwood, better with a sword than Toshiro Mifune, better with bow and arrow than Errol Flynn and here's the best part: he's unkillable. Even sinister, sadistic Gary Oldman and a small army of skinheads can't do anything with him. Denzel spurns every harlot and temptress as he pursues the mission that God has given him. The dialogue is mostly whispering and mumbling because it's of no importance; only the sepia toned cinematography matters.

Look, don't have our hero wandering around shooting arrows at people, cats and birds...hitting them every time... when he's blind! Of course we can't figure it out when he responds to all situations likes he sees. What, this is some sort of radar? How does he know he's in a shadow if he can't see? The whole thing is just designed to fool us and of course it does because it's not plausible. Could have fooled us also by in the end taking off his pants to show he's actually a giant snail and that's why it's taken 30 years to walk from the Midwest or wherever to the West Coast.

It's incredibly monotonous.Sure, there is a nice fight under a bridge but that's about it. The other violence in the film was just boring.We have a cameo from Tom Waits......not sure why, I love the guy as an artist but he's just wasted in this film. Pointless cameo. It's like they are trying to entice you to keep watching it because he we've got Tom Waits in the movie guys!!! Same with Gary Oldman. He's utterly wasted in this.The film doesn't even make a bit of sense.The world/society/mankind was decimated years before thanks to religion so all books of religion, or just the bible, (because this is a preachy Christian movie) were destroyed.But one idiot called Eli has acquired the only existing last copy of the bible, and some voice in his head tells him to 'go West' with the book which is, by the way, the Bible.Gee, how vague. So, er...'god' picks a BLIND guy out of all people as well.....LMAO...ridiculous.And he's been walking for 30 years, eventually reaches his destination, does what he's supposed to, which is getting the bible published into many more copies (WHY???) then dies at the end of the movie. Thanks god! And let me point out the the lead actress in this was completely unnecessary and incredibly annoying.I hated her guts in The 70's Show and she does the voice of Meg in Family Guy.

In thiz post apocalyptic future, Eli (Denzel Washington) has a mission to protect a book by walking to the west, somewhere he believes that the book will be preserved eternally. That mysterious book is so important that holds the destiny of all human who are still alive. Actually the story is smoothly told by Allen and Albert Hughes who also directed ""From Hell"" in 2001. The story starts slowly in the beginning. And later, it successfully makes us stay in our seat by holding up the curiosity about what happens next. The book which is the core of thiz movie, in my opinion it is not supposed to be revealed so early and obvious. I think we will comprehend by itself through all the conversations and dialogue all over the movie. If the story doesn't mention about what book is that, it will creates more successful mysterious elements. The twist ending sparks a little bit by revealing why the book cannot read by anybody except Eli. Denzel Washington has shown another side of his acting. Thiz modern ""Sidney Poitier"" always amazes us. On the other side, once again Gary Oldman has shown us what he does best by playing a convincing villain. And finally, Mila Kunis performance can be replaced by anyone. The movie reminds me of other dark post apocalyptic movies like the trilogy of ""Mad Max"" (1979-1985) or ""Waterworld"" (1995). But in thiz movie, the settings are too simple. There are no big scenes we could remember, even it looks like a classic cowboy movies. There are a few fresh scenes that involve an elderly couple. One of them is played by Michael ""Dumbledore""Gambon. There are so many post apocalyptic movies have been made. Thiz time is about the last shampoo on earth.

151,piratecannon,Accelerated Reader,6,26 December 2012,"The Book of Eli is a movie about faith. That's as it should be, because the concluding moments of the film require a lot—a whole lot—of faith on the part of moviegoers. Though the Hughes brothers manage to do a lot of things right in this moody tale of apocalypse that's equal parts Mad Max and There Will Be Blood, that darn ending persists—and it threatens to derail the whole thing.Here's the skinny: a lone traveler named Eli (Washington) is moving west across a desolate United States. Apparently some sort of war occurred that scorched the earth, and those who survived find themselves smack dab in the middle of an ""every man for himself"" scenario that's as hellish as you'd imagine. People eat each other, and stumbling across ruthless highway robbers/murderers is the norm. Echoes of Cormac McCarthy's The Road persist, but the scenario is handled here with an even more washed out, uber-stylistic flair. Honestly, I half expected the Wachowski brothers to come dropping in with long leather jackets and a chorus of ""Woah""s.Don't get me wrong: all-in-all, I liked The Book of Eli. It's a competently told story that's complimented by the always powerful acting of Washington and Goldman; on top of that, the sense of urgency associated with Eli and his quest feels very real (which, it seems, is divinely sanctioned—Eli claims that God actually spoke to him and decreed that he had been hand picked to protect the last known copy of the Bible on the planet). Religious symbolism, of course, abounds. If the movie has a weakness—besides its entirely preposterous final revelation—it's that the narrative is often blatant and explanatory when a little more mystique could've given the audience the grand honor of coming to their own conclusions about Eli's uncanny ability to survive no-win situations and continue pressing on.Even with its abundance of self-explanatory dialogue, there's just something about Eli and his mission that will draw you in. Full disclosure here: I'm a Christian, and that no doubt played a role in my especially enthusiastic support of this particular protagonist. Make no mistake about it, though; for a man of the Word, Eli engages in some very hypocritical behavior. He isn't above hacking off a few limbs if it means protecting the Bible, and be-headings abound.Here's his theology in a nutshell: talk is weak. Give me a machete, and let's get down to business.That's the world Eli lives in, though; if you hesitate, you're dead. Because of this, the ultra-violence on display feels as if it's justified.But then you have the ending. It's a sort of mixed blessing (pun intended), as it's simultaneously brilliant and, when you really stop to analyze everything that comes before it, virtually impossible. In fact, it's almost insulting. For many it'll likely be a deal-breaker, but that wasn't the case for me.Since I think I'm on the verge of spilling the proverbial beans, I'll wrap this up by saying that The Book of Eli is worth your time. Just be prepared for an ""Are you serious!?"" moment that really pushes the envelope of believability (and, perhaps, sends it straight through the shredder).",The Book of Eli
152,drpakmanrains,Great Actor Doth Not A Great Movie Make,1,13 October 2012,"This will be a very brief review, as there have already been over 500 as I write this. Denzel Washington, who I usually really like to watch, is unable to do much for this absolutely awful excuse for a movie. Not only is every word about at a third grade level, but it is so pretentious and self important as to be laughable. The scenes of violence are so incredibly impossible, they make the old Kung-Fu battles seem realistic by comparison. We are supposed to believe that one man can kill or subdue a dozen or more armed killers with only a knife or a gun. And of course he does, more than once. But that's because God is looking out for him, I guess, since after killing about 100 people, he is the chosen vehicle to save mankind and Christianity for the soon to be reborn future. Long, ugly, repellent, and corny. If you think this is some great film, in my opinion, you are a very non-demanding viewer. They don't get much worse than this. If this were a low budget indie, or entertaining like ""The Road Warrior"", I could forgive it some. But as a big budget mainstream movie, it is an embarrassment.",The Book of Eli
153,Qanqor,Odd movie,5,17 January 2010,"I've just come back from seeing this movie, and I'm still not sure what to make of it. Hence the 5/10 star rating.I guess I'm not sure what to make of it, because I'm really not sure just what *happened*. And reading the other reviews here hasn't convinced me that anybody else does either. Let's put some pieces together and see what we get. WARNING: from here on is all major spoilers.So what do we have? Eli is blind. Eli claims to have heard a voice which directed him to find the bible, and then directed him to head to Renaissance Central on Alcatraz. Normally, when a character claims to hear voices, there's some metaphysical wiggle room: the audience can make up its own mind whether the voices are real or the character is deluded. But not so here, since Eli could not have found the book without the voice's guidance (*especially* once we know he's blind). Moreover, blind Eli is able to do amazing things for a blind man, such as shoot distant cats with a bow and arrow, or just walk into a room he's never been in and be able to effortlessly find his way right up to the bar. It's hard to reach any other conclusion than that Eli is able to do all this because God is leading him around by the nose. So apparently, God is a real character in this story. And certainly the believer types among the reviewers seize on this point. And if that's what the story is meant to be, then so be it (however little enthusiasm that generates from me, an unbeliever).But the problem is, this all rather falls apart at the very end, when we see the fate of the bible itself. The way it ends up stuck up on a shelf, with the tanach and the koran, as if it has only equal standing with these, and that all religions are of interest in this place merely to document the previous civilization, and that none represents any particular revelation; the way that that scene, putting the book on the shelf, is so reminiscent of the ending of Raiders of the Lost Ark where the ark gets filed away and presumably forgotten about, such that we expect more or less the same fate for this bible; the whole way that the head guy at the Renaissance Central talks about it, as someone eager to have the book *in order to complete his collection*, rather than as someone who finds deep meaning in it, or considers it the essential thing in order to bring civilization back to life; all of this points to the essential *failure* of the mission: God's word is not going to be especially heard or heeded. So this leaves us with a deep problem of characterization, as far as the unseen character of God: *why* has he sent Eli on this grueling mecca to deliver the book just so that it can be kept as a dusty collectors item? This doesn't sound like any God that *I've* ever heard of, it's certainly not going to set mankind on the right road! The result is that in the end, even the theological theme of the movie is undermined by the ending. I think that both theists and atheists alike who see this movie as a very pro-Christian movie have not examined this point enough.So in the end, I can't really figure out just *what* this movie's take on religion is supposed to be. And therefore I don't know what to make of the movie at all. Oh well.

Despite much appreciated acting on all counts, the continued darkness and fighting became distasteful and not artfully so. However, after the halfway point, the message made its appearance.

Various individuals will stand in his way but in the end .... well you know the cliché..Given the above I was looking forward to this movie. It made it all the disappointing when I saw this one. It was so clichéd but slightly more up beat than the dour Road. In the future world is doom and gloom a bit like the first Gears of War.Its also very slow, if you want to see a dour post apocalyptic movie watch The Road",The Book of Eli
160,Adorable,Reads great,8,20 March 2010,"The post apocalyptic parable helmed by the Hughes brothers and penned by iconic 80's and 90's gaming journo Gary Whitta manages to excel in spite of itself. To begin with, it's too short. It's one thing to leave people wanting more, another to tell an impressive story and hamper it by opting for a short runtime. Book of Eli (BoE) could have used a good added hour to work its magic, and it hurts that it didn't get it.Then there's the setting, which is a sort of cross between recent The Road and Mad Max. This is an intelligent end of the world story, replete with little tips of the hat and clues, but the setting could have done with so much more depth. Too bad we didn't get to review more of Eli's world.The titular character is a walker, heading west in a devastated world, ruined by ""the war"". Eli is on a mission, and his purpose stems from a book he's carrying, a powerful tome that's the last of its kind on earth, presumably. If the movie had any illusions that audiences would be unable to guess as to the nature of this book, of course it was way off. And here's another reason BoE succeeds despite itself – it's an altogether religious affair, but it's never preachy. The story promotes faith and the place of goodness in humanity, the role of the chosen few facing hordes of mindless, disposable, well, scum for lack of a better word. So while it's too hasty and dabbles in the taboo of religious persuasion, BoE is still a good motion picture worth the time and mind power it'll take to properly appreciate it.Eli is played by Denzel Washington, who's always good, but shines as the humble and reclusive wasteland walker. As Eli traverses a destroyed America, he encounters bandits and ruffians, so we learn that the man is pretty handy in combat of all sorts. He also packs an iPod, has a backpack with one of those ""Hello my name is"" stickers in it, and carries a locked copy of the most important book in the movie's reality.Eli tries to balance his desire to protect the good people who've survived the cataclysm with his need to be on his way, which presents dilemmas time and again, until he reaches a small town controlled by boss Bill Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie is a character, driven by power lust and a vision of reclaiming the world – and so he needs some inspiration for the slobbering illiterates he oversees. Eli's book seems a logical choice, and so Carnegie's demand that the volume be handed over puts the two into a position of conflict.There are no easy fixes in BoE, this isn't a cut and paste action job, so don't expect a happy ending. And while the cinematography is gorgeous and the soundtrack by Atticus Ross is a moving work of brilliant verve and emotive impact, what really wins us over about this film are the numerous anecdotal insights into what or who Eli really is. The movie keeps toying with viewers, suggesting all manner of mutually exclusive ideas about the lead character, and it's delightful. It's also shy about telling us what happened to the world, which is always pleasant titillation in a genre piece like this. There are no info dumps per se in BoE – something we applaud.Back to the acting, Eli's main ally, Solara (done by Mila Kunis) is a huge disappointment. She either doesn't get the canvass she needs to grow, or perhaps the entire character was flat from the outset. Either way, we didn't warm up to her at all, but Oldman's rendition of the main antagonist is interesting, suggesting a complex person who warrants further investigation. There's also a wonderful supporting role by Ray Stevenson (Punisher War Zone and Rome), who does Carnegie's chief enforcer in a decidedly multi-dimensional manner. Kudos to him and to Jennifer Beals, portraying Carnegie's woman with considerable skill.Go into Book of Eli expecting to be intrigued, and you'll be rewarded. It's a tale that forces you to think about it, but at the same time it isn't epic. This last issue has more to do with the limited span and time allotted to the adventure, but it's nonetheless the way things panned out. BoE doesn't mask its religious agenda one bit, which for some odd reason feels very right because it's never hamfisted or cheesy like other movies that try to integrate faith into proceedings. However, it could have done with more room to fully develop and explain to us just why we need to listen.As for the possibility of a sequel, since only Mila Kunis' character seems to have made it, we say, please no, no sequel. But a prequel would be great.Overall recommended for intelligent storytelling, some great acting and a superb presentation.",The Book of Eli
161,TheGreatMarkukini,Unexpectedly good journey towards an unexpected ending,8,18 February 2020,"I consider it a highly enjoyable movie. It is not a rare sight to have an extremely accomplished survivor roaming deserted lands, but Denzel Washington does a good job depicting a weathered wanderer on the mission. Which goal he pursues? You will be surprised to say the least.Cannot say that the views are mesmerising as they have the look of all the post apocalyptic lands we have seen before. However, the peculiar change of locations gives a nice touch and provides us with countless encounters for the hero to show what he has in storage.The religious part is strong in the film but it hasn't spilled over the rims. It does although give a literal Deus ex machina moments, but the progress of the story doesn't leave you time to complain about it.With all certainty I can say that the end of the movie is really worth waiting, but it is not just waiting. The whole build up is intriguing and fascinating to watch, gorgeous fight scenes add a kick to already good meal. If it was a restaurant I would ask for more.",The Book of Eli
162,eve_dolluk,Post apocalyptic nonsense,5,26 January 2010,"The premise for the film is not a bad one, Man journeys across the country ( USA ) carrying a bible wanting to protect it at all costs. This man Eli is versatile in martial arts and marksmanship as well as archery. So the main premise for the film is Action, It feels like a western for most of the time but with motorbikes and cars in a Mad Max kind of way. The action in the film is actually not bad so if that is what you are looking for you may rate it higher than I have done. The performances are not bad either, Denzel Washington is good as the lead role, Gary Oldman supports in his usual psychotic manner as a power hungry leader intent on stealing the book from Eli. The cinematography was good as was the location sets, it felt bleak although the lack of colour in the film sometimes made it almost a black and white film at times. The biggest problem with the film was it made no sense so for me and the message became lost. If a man journeys for 30 years non stop with an idea from the start where he is going he would find the place he is looking for after a year or so. America is a big place but not that big there was also cars and bikes that he could have used to make his journey quicker. That was just one flaw, and there were lots. Eli's sole intention was to preserve the word of god as it is written in the bible, now there is only one bible in America. The most published book in America has just one copy left and it is in Braille. Now even if people set out to destroy the bible the chances of them destroying all of them would be ridiculous. Of course the bible that Eli carries is in braille so thats why it survived, it still had the cross on it so if all the others are gone why not this one. On his arrival in San Francisco there seems to be a more civilised place than you would ever have imagined based on the previous story telling. What happened to all the bibles here, if they destroyed them all why all of a sudden did they want one. Eli talks about blind faith yet he needed to hear a voice for him to carry out his journey, this isn't blind faith. Its a series of flaws after flaws, It could have been way better. In the end it becomes a dumb Hollywood movie with plenty of action and a few one liners. If you want to see a very good post apocalyptic film then please go and see The Road, If you want a bit of mindless action then this is the film for you. Leave your brain at home.",The Book of Eli
163,toll-8,"The second act brought it down, the final act made it bad!",4,19 December 2012,"From 2009 to 2010 Denzel Washington stared in The Taking Of Pelham 123 and Unstoppable either side of making The Book Of Eli. In those films he gained weight in order to play an everyday man and one who works closely to trains. The Book Of Eli must have been a welcome break then as he had to shed the weight to play a loner walking the post apocalyptic world without a train in sight. We are used to seeing Washington in a variety of lead roles but here we manage to see a different side to him; he's quiet, he's lonely, and he's hard as nails. It opens then with Washington trawling the post-apocalyptic land alone. He shoots a cat for food later and hides out, listening to his IPod, in an abandoned house. In the morning he sets off again on his journey where he is ambushed by a group of hijackers who want his possessions. This is the first moment in the film where dialogue is really spoken, some eight minutes in. He manages to defeat this group with ease and continues on his way, arriving at a small town run by Gary Oldman's Carnegie. When Washington (his name in the film as of yet unknown) enters a bar he argues with one of the locals and again manages to defeat a large group of people who intimidate him. Witnessing this Carnegie asks to see him and offers him a chance to join his mob, throwing in his hot step daughter Solara (Kunis) as a sweetener. Washington however still rejects and the following morning heads back on his way but his short stay in the town has brought to Carnegie's attention that Washington is in possession of a book that he has been searching for since the apocalypse. When Carnegie's men fail to stop him, Washington goes on the run with Solara trying to keep this good book that has guided him through the apocalypse. Whilst on the run we learn Washington's name is Eli and that faith has lead him this far. This book he possesses could start wars and makes people God-like which is why he believes he has to protect it. This book is the Bible.In my eyes the plot is very thin. All of this in search of a book so that people can become the 'Messiah'. Being an Atheist I fail to really understand the importance of all this but I suppose if it is in your belief system you will get it. The film seems to be religious propaganda and trying to remind people that religion is not a bad thing. This is overly stated in the end which gives off a clear message of 'to have faith'. I will come back to the end in a minute as I do think it is a big talking point of the film but first I want to continue with the plot. It opens strongly but it is something we have seen before. Washington shines in these opening few minutes and his presence made it all feel different. However when he reaches the town it all seems to go downhill and becomes a shoot out in a post apocalyptic world. This wouldn't be so bad if it was done well but it takes so long to set up that all the shoot outs feel rather rushed and the pace changes drastically. Character motivations are also highly flawed especially with Solara. Why would she leave her blind Mother in the hands of an evil gangster to run off with a loner? She reckons she will be safer but how wrong that turned out to be. Oldman's Carnegie, although performed very well by Oldman, doesn't feel mean enough to really be hated. All he wants is a book and that motivation just doesn't seem enough, but that is probably my thoughts regarding the importance of the book. The ending then was God-awful. It took me a while to grasp it as I worked out the twist and then decided that it can't be right because the rest of the film would make little to no sense. Turns out I had got it right meaning the film became implausible. I took to forums to see what other people's interpretations were and saw that people had devised theories to how it is plausible but I'm sorry, watch it again and you will see that it just doesn't work.The ending is not the only thing that brought this movie down; there were many issues I had throughout. The shots and visuals were too much like a music video and it was very distracting, the plot was weak, characters had unbelievable relationships and the music started well but become repetitive. Oh and Mila Kunis' Sarah Connor impression at the end really didn't work. It was a film that just lost me after about thirty minutes and it just got worse until it hit that poor ending. Washington and Oldman are the respectable entries of this film. Everything else may as well just accept defeat. Washington brings a feel of isolation to the role, he may not be the most likable character, but we really believe he is a loner whose only hope is this book. Oldman brings a sense of menace to a badly drawn character and in a lesser actor's hands the villain would have been worse. I had been looking forward to this film for a while but it had too much religious propaganda for my liking and some fairly flat action sequences meaning that despite some decent performances this is one left unwatched, unless of course you want your own view on that ending.2 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",The Book of Eli
164,TheAnimalMother,"Aimless, Mostly Boring, and Quite Frankly - Silly!",4,16 January 2010,"Well now I see why there is such a huge ad campaign behind this film, because word of mouth is certainly not going to make it much money at all. When I first saw the preview, and heard that Denzel and Gary Oldman were in the starring roles, I thought, how can you lose? Well, I left the theatre thinking it nearly was a total loss. Don't get me wrong. There are a few good scenes in this film. However, the few good scenes really are too few to make this film anything special. Gary Oldman gives his usual strong performance, but the character simply isn't that interesting. I would hate to see how bad the character would be if played by a marginal actor. The film from the very start is badly paced. Not that I'm just looking for a shoot em up, but it fails to move with any sort of meaningful feel. The music selection and score also did absolutely nothing to enhance the scenes in my estimation, and helped to make the film seem longer than it actually is. The biggest highlight for me was the small role by Tom Waits, who has impressed me yet again with creating something special out of a bit part. He is perhaps the finest musician turned actor that there has ever been in terms of his pure acting ability. The man is simply a true artist. He just exudes unique creativity. Besides the old couple in the house, the Tom Waits bits, and the first fight scene; The rest of the film is basically a write off. Though I did kind of enjoy the way the dialogue gave us the three common views of The Bible; The igniter of hate & war, the brainwashing control masterpiece, and the comforting word of God. Other than that, the script simply wasn't engaging enough to care much about. The film failed to capture the real depth it seemed to be looking for. It also asks the viewer to believe some pretty senseless things. They only seem like senseless things because the writing behind the Eli character simply doesn't seem fully committed to his guided by God status. Something else that simply does deserve mention in my estimation...Mila Kunis. Who is obviously known more for her comedic roles, (Most notably T.V.'s That 70's Show) did hold her own in certainly a more serious part than most of us are use to seeing her in.I think I heard somewhere that this is the first film the Hughes twins have written & directed in a decade. Well, they can retire for all I care.4/10",The Book of Eli
165,cmoyton,Post apocalyptic spaghetti western pantomime,2,26 June 2010,Following on the heels of the depressingly awful The Road comes another post apocalyptic flop. This one starts promisingly enough but quickly deteriorates into clichéd farce. The original aspect of the movie is the book itself - the bible - of which Washingtons character has possession. In a world in which most people cannot read it is presented as potential power to those who own it.Other good aspects of the movie are the visuals with a decent rendering of the destruction displayed and the moody film score. The twist regarding the book itself is nice and Washingtons mysterious character presents more questions than answers.Now for the bad bits. Leaving the religious facets and Denzils indestructible character aside as irritants the movie itself is all over the place veering from Mad Max wannabe to spaghetti western to road movie to comedy. Presented are the comic book villain played by Oldman (like a Mason Verger without the prosthetics) with his army of incompetent goons and his eye candy babe who then teams up with Denzil. Oldman wants the book for its power to rule but he already controls the flea pit town he resides in. The shootout scene at the old codgers shack had me cringing and as for the lamentable ending. Aren't you glad someones keeping a library on the Weat coast at the end of the world? No! Thought not.,The Book of Eli
166,kdavies-69347,A Post-Apoc Christian Story with Violence.,6,10 January 2016,"Somehow this film slipped past my radar back in 2010. It's been about 5 years since it came out and I was surprised I hadn't heard of it. Albert and Allen Hughes of 'Dead Presidents' fame (1995) join up with Denzel Washington as the titular character Eli, in this post apocalyptic story.The end of the world has come and the remaining survivors are struggling in an environment that has been devastated by drought and what is known as ""The Flash."" One has to assume that the end of the world was a long and devastating war. Enter Eli who is a man on a mission from what we have to assume is God. He travels the wastelands and is an exceptionally skilled fighter.The plot is a linear story and at most times a little predictable, but I was impressed with the dialogue and mostly with the actors. Denzel Washington has few scenes with Gary Oldman together, but both of them played well of each other. At times I thought the survivors were a little... well fat to be honest. People seemed to still be in the same relatively physical condition despite the lack of food and water. We get a few hints at the events that led up to the end of the world, and there is a lot of Biblical allusions in Eli's journey. Overall it was enjoyable. Actress Mila Kunis sticks out like a sore thumb in terms of her beauty at the end of the world, but her acting is solid enough.If you don't mind the religious rhetoric and obvious Christian hypocrisy (with all the violence in the film), then you'll love this flick.6/10",The Book of Eli
167,terrible2,A New Approach To An Old Theme,7,13 April 2011,"A far better film then I'd first anticipated. The trailers showed a post-apocalyptic renegade (Washington) fighting for some unknown reason against the forces of evil. We've seen it before, and will most likely see it again. The difference here, is the star power they've assembled for this type of piece. Not since Mel Gibson donned his ""Thunderdome"" wig, have we seen Hollywood give this sub-genre such attention, but in the context of the subject matter, it just sorta makes sense. ""The Book of Eli"" is a slow-paced story, however it subconsciously packs a lot in. Through beautiful cinematography and a well thought out plot, it manages to gradually pull the viewer into this man's world. Portrayed flawlessly by Denzel Washington, we are routing for our anti-hero to complete his reckoning as the story unfolds in bits and pieces. The cast is solid, with Gary Oldman doing the ""Baddie"" role, like only he knows how. Secondary characters like Jennifer Beals hold their own, with the weakest link being Kunis, but this doesn't take away from the experience in any major way. The fight scenes were quite cheesy and far beyond believable, but again it didn't seem to matter to me, as I was caught up in all other aspects. Some dialog could have benefited from another draft but alas, the point made it's way across. Besides it's slower moments and Kung Fu fight scenes, ""The Book of Eli"" gives the viewer a fresh storyline, and well thought out twists that should make M. Night mad that he didn't think of it himself As long as a ""Part 2"" is never conceived or made, this film should stand the test of time.",The Book of Eli
168,Joejoesan,One of the most stupid movies I've ever seen,4,22 May 2010,"Yes, I love post-apocalyptic movies. The Omega Man, I am Legend, The Quiet Earth... When people walk around in a deserted world I can't stop watching... most of the times. Too bad that's not the case with this piece of crap called The Book of Eli. I thought this story was never gonna end! About 30 years after the so called Flash the USA has turned into a desolate, deserted and cruel world in which only one thing counts: the survival of the fittest. Enter Denzel Washington, always a pleasure to watch. He's this lone warrior who beats up everybody in order to protect a sacred book. At the same time it's his mission to take the book from the east side to the west side of the USA. Unluckily, he's not a fast walker. Therefore he's been wandering around this very earth for more than 30 years! Talk about sightseeing. Our story begins when he arrives in a town owned by baddie Gary Oldman. It seems that he's been searching for the same book as well. Who gets it in the end?When I watched The book of Eli I couldn't help but wonder: what's the big deal? Washington is obviously protecting a copy of the Holy Bible, but why is it a bad idea to spread the story of Jesus, his disciples and the knowledge of the Old Testament? How can Gary Oldman turn the book into a weapon? What bad things will Oldman do when he actually gets it?But wait. Just wait. More incredible things happen. Like this old couple who survived robbery and murder alone in the desert. People driving motorcycles - but where the hell do they get their fuel? As a 'piece de resistance' the filmmakers have one more surprise for us in the end. Because when Oldman finally gets the book and he opens it, he realizes that it's all written in XXXXXXX. And that means that our hero, Denzel Washington, hasn't been able to XXX the whole time through the movie! Which is pretty unbelievable, seeing how he's able to powerfully eliminate his opponents.With actors like Denzel Washington - who also produced, Gary Oldman and Malcolm McDowell and with the big budget they got, The Book of Eli can only be regarded as a big failure. If you make a post-apocalyptic movie, please don't pretend that you're making Oscar winning material. Call George Miller and cast a new Mad Max. Or be sure that at least the setting is right and seal off New York to film I am legend. But don't make an arty farty black and whitish so called Biblical tale like this one. The Book of Eli is a major disappointment by any standard. Avoid it at any cost! 4/10",The Book of Eli

170,xherridea,Interesting concept,6,9 May 2020,"The visual style and cinematography of the film are of a good quality. I think the colours used and how you can't see the sun is a very interesting choice.
The plot is odd, I wouldn't say it was amazing but it's certainly not bad, the twist at the end and how it makes the audience reflect on the main character is cool, although I would have appreciated a little more foreshadowing personally.
I could see how some people would find the religious themes a bit overbearing but I found it interesting how the book had different meanings and effects to different characters and that it drove them to do different things. I think the various characters takes on the book is why I wasn't annoyed at the heavy Christian themes as others are. I would recommend it as something to discuss amongst a large group of people.

Thirty years from now the world is a barren, desolate wasteland filled with the charred remains of a civilization that destroyed itself through war. In this bleak future a lone man wanders west (Denzel Washington), guided by nothing more than faith, to deliver the last remaining copy of a book that changed the world, and will do so again. While Washington seeks to deliver the book to those who would do good with it, a local warlord (Gary Oldman), an erudite student of Mussolini, wants to possess the book so he can use the words to sway the masses and become a powerful dictator. The characters are very well acted, the action is fluid and well choreographed, and the setting seeps into your skin, immersing the viewer in a world devoid of faith but in desperate need of salvation. The final plot twist is creative, unexpected, and poetically just. The Book of Eli should shoot to the top of your Netflix queue.",The Book of Eli

Post-apocalyptic world were only some surviving area where robbers rule . I don't like some boring and bloody thrillers but it wasn't this . There is no matter that plot is very poor . It seems that leading roles made very good movie . Atmosphere on movie was really exciting and you don't know what is next movement of Eli . I still don't know why everyone is talking that movie is too boring. I really like these fights because everything was full of some action and it isn't uniform . Adventure moments mixed with thriller scenes and thrilling escapes . Something is still strange and that is way how director imagined the end . I didn't understand some parts of the end because everything was so confusing . But I liked that Denzel had more one great starring . Supporting characters were maybe inadequate to Eli but I still believe that popularity will grow up and that quality will be seen .

174,98nurdinm-1,False Prophets,6,25 January 2010,"In the growing popularity of post-Armageddon films to come from Hollywood, there has to be a gimmick, a twist to the tale to make another version seem more original. In the case of ""The Book Of Eli"", this gimmick is certainly a clever, if slightly predictable one. Sadly the rest of the film, save for one or two moments of potential brilliance, does not live up to the expectations that you may have after watching the trailer or seeing the cast list.Eli (Denzel Washington) walks the land of ruined America, armed only with a very large machete and a backpack containing, among other things, the only surviving copy of the King James Bible. He is heading west; a voice has told him he will find the place for the book there. Along the dangerous path, he walks through a town ruled by Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a cruel dictator type who, like Eli, knows of the power of the words in his book and wants then for himself...There's no denying the anticipation one feels about a film starring Washington and Oldman, two heavyweight actors - sadly, it feels for a lot of the time that they're sleepwalking the parts, that this is just another day job for them. Substantially better is Mila Kunis in the role of Solara, the young girl who joins Eli on his journey. Having only heard Kunis in ""Family Guy"" as the put-upon Meg, and seen her in ""That 70s Show"", it is probably going a little too far to describe her performance as a revelation (no pun intended), but it is still more impressive than the two leading men. The film is also enlightened by brief but hilariously strange cameos from Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour as two deranged survivors living on a farmhouse packed to the brim with automatic weapons.When the action happens it is fast but far between. The scenes are played out well, with plenty of gunfire and explosions and even in a couple of cases decapitations to keep an action buff happy. But the scenes are sandwiched in to a script that relies heavily on deep, meaningful, and often somewhat preachy dialogue about the nature of the Bible and words. Though there are a couple of rather excellent twists towards the end, it is marred by a rather strange final ending which seems to want to evoke the final scenes of the excellent Aronofsky film ""The Fountain"" (2006), but fail sadly.There will probably be many people who go to see this film and are surprised at just how religious it actually is. Perhaps that was not the true intention of the film's directors, the Hughes brothers, whose last film was (ironically) the adaptation of the graphic novel ""From Hell"" (2001); perhaps what they are trying to do is to look at what we look to for hope when there seems to be absolutely none left, and how powerful inspirational words can be. Unfortuatley, their reliance on the Bible squashes these intentions, and I think a lot of people will leave the film very disappointed.6/10",The Book of Eli
175,d_art,Movie Review: Book of Eli is not the usual Hollywood stuff.,8,23 February 2010,"Book of Eli takes place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, barren, desert-like, rusty, and practically uninhabitable. There are marauders, cannibals, almost no water, no law, and very few books (and few people who can read them). Denzel Washington plays Eli, a lone traveler who carries the last copy of the book that he protects with his life until he fulfills the mission to take it to its final destination in the west. Along the way he meets Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a leader of a gang, determined to steal the book and use it for his own power. Mila Kunis plays Solara, who accompanies Eli.Eli, although he spends much of the time walking, is a master swordsman and fighter—there are plenty of moments punctuated by quick violence and flying limbs and gunfights. Denzel Washington's role is quite different here than his usual dramatic work, and it's also quite physical. He's not very talkative here, but much of his character is revealed through quiet moments. Sure, it may be a role that Will Smith could've pulled off, but Denzel's age gives it more edge. He also brings a lot of sincerity and intensity to the role of Eli, a man of faith who heard a voice that gave him the mission he is on. And, Gary Oldman, he is always great as a villain, and it's no different here. Oldman's Carnegie, a baddie who loves books, certainly smarter than the gang he controls, has lots of fun lines that he delivers with gusto and humor.When I first heard about this movie, I was expecting something like the game Fallout 3. The directors, the Hughes Brothers (Menace II Society, From Hell), bring a discolored future that is very drab, with lots of dust, but some occasional visual surprises. Unlike Fallout though, there aren't mutants and monsters, although there are cannibals. Many of the inhabitants fight for water, wear goggles, and will kill for anything. The look of the film may turn people off as this world is not particularly pleasant to look at—water is very scarce and there's virtually no vegetation—but fans of the genre will see some familiar designs.The action scenes come pretty quickly and much of it involve Eli. They're fun to watch, with some interesting angles, and while I could see there were some budget issues, most of it work well. The film feels more like a Western than let's say, Mad Max.There are religious overtones in this movie, especially given the content of the book Eli is carrying. Eli is like a future-day prophet with a sword. In the end, it is ultimately an action movie. Some will have a hard time getting over the premise of the story, but it can also be read as a metaphor. Could Eli be a metaphor for the Jews carrying holy text? While one will wonder if Carnegie's plan of world domination due to possession of sacred text is even plausible, I suppose one can point out instances in Catholic history where very few had access to religious text, or could even read (before the invention of the printing press, which the film touches a little on, that contributed to Protestant reform).It was hard to gage what to expect from this film going in, but as things got revealed, little details were added, and little twists later, I found the story pretty intriguing. I also liked how the premise is so far from anything I'd expect from Hollywood. Denzel's acting brought a lot of empathy to his role and the plight of the world he lives in. One can't help but walk out appreciating this little thing called ""civilization.""

176,montera_iulian,Pretty good but not awesome...,7,15 February 2010,"Okay so ... this is my first real review in 2010.I went to my local theater to see this because I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington. I recently done my rankings based on some important points for a movie to be great like the storyline, the acting in general, the directing and art direction, the cinematography used in the movie and the score or the music chosen to fill the blanks in a movie. I'll continue doing that kind of reviewing but not just fill ranks but also comment on each aspect. So here it is... the first for Book of Eli.The storyline is pretty much interesting. It covers the basic line of ""good religion vs. bad religion"", or should I say better... religion as fate and weapon. The story is about a black guy named Eli, which we don't know very much at the beginning and may I say neither at the end except for the fact that he dies (LOL), that found an old book, the last of it's type, A Bible. He somehow gets some higher guidance to travel across the land and take the book to the west were good people will know how to make it useful for the people. His nemesis is an pretty old white self-installed ruler over a little town built by him entirely which knows the power of the words that hide in the bible. Here on, a competition between these two guys, some fight scenes very good executed, chases and we can't jump over the fact that we still have great good-looking women in action movies like Mila Kunis. So nice! What I loved is the approach that the movie took on the bible like... it's part good thing part bad thing. It can be used to cure but also to manipulate and destroy, and it's pretty much what I think of the bible, that first it was made to built a world around it, after that, greedy people take it, change it, and made it perfectly to manipulate the masses which these days are pretty much dumber than ever in the meanings of religion and faith.The acting overall was quite good. Denzel does his usual stuff (he dies again), same cinematographic takings of him entering the city, slow-walking and all that old-denzel stuff, but what was new about him were the fight scenes where he did it in a Steven Segal way. Sort of... Anyway I liked very much Gary Oldman... such a difference from Gordon no?... So yea... acting wasn't bad even for Mila Kunis... she managed it pretty good.The directing was good but the cinematography disappoint. I mean you got these scenes in the boat where the movie looks shitty like some 60's. And there were a lot of things like this where cinematography looked pretty bad which made me say a big ""Hell Naw"". The score/music was pretty dope but the worst thing about the movie behind the awful cinematography at times it's simply the ending which was something like WTF?... I mean common man I've watched an hour and half this movie to have this shitty ending?.... He got shot he walks like 1 billion miles on foot he takes on the boat half way the distance to the shore he has nothing, he translates and delivers from his memory all the bible and RIGHT after THAT he dies like that? I mean... you know... I know Denzel it's supposed to die in every movie but... not like that man...Anyway the movie was pretty okay I guess....and my final rankings are...Storyline: 7,5/10.Acting: 8/10.Art Direction: 8/10.Cinematography: 6/10.Score: 8/10.=============== Overall: 7,5",The Book of Eli
177,Cinema_Love,"A beautiful film, Denzel Washington is Oscar worthy again !",9,21 January 2010,"''The Book of Eli'' is the new post-apocalyptic action-drama movie directed by the Hughes brothers. Thoses who give us the very violent ''Menace II Society'' or recently, ''From Hell'' starring Johnny Depp ! In this movie, Denzel Washington stars as Eli, a lone man fights his way across America in order to protect a sacred book that holds the secrets to saving humankind. When you read the storyline, you are like, wow, is this something new or not ? In fact, you can compared this to something like Mad Max Vs I am Legend, with more plot than I Am Legend thought ! This is a very violent film but very beautiful at the same time. Eli is an ordinary man who receive such an amazing power and faith. It's religious, i don't have a problem with that, the fact is that they carry the subject with a lot of class. In this world, every bible have been put in fire and there's only one left... that's what one of the other characters in the movie, Gary Oldman, want ! He want to start this world all over again, but to find this book, he used a lot of violence and abuse power.That's what I found that was great about this movie, you see that the evil will always ruin/rules the world, it was the case in the 90s, now and in the future, so it's a great story, not much of a science-fiction but a red alert that our world is truly in need of a new beginning !",The Book of Eli
178,scifiactionfan,boring as h*ll,3,9 May 2010,"The main problem is the whole premise.Saving a book that represents a religion when religions caused the nuclear war is totally illogical.This movie lacks common sense except the villain does recognize that religion is a good tool for exercising control so that has some sense and logic.I would hope that I didn't enjoy the movie because I'm not religious and it might seem like a good film to a religious person.I guess it might make a good rental but if you have a choice between this and and a movie you know you want to see, pick the other movie.",The Book of Eli
179,FilmFanatic03,"A film which needed that extra ""thing"" to blow me away",6,26 March 2011,"So basically we see Denzel Washington quoting the Bible and preaching to others life lessons like praying before a meal and caring about others....and yet he goes around killing people (i guess he skipped that bit out when he was reading the 10 commandments) To be honest it's quite a good film. Denzel was really good, as always, in his role and i thought Mila Kunis was brilliant. They both matched very well together. Gary Oldman played the villain very well, except without him 3/4 of the swearing would have been cut out and that would have been better...but he was villainous and fitted the role perfectly. Overall, i felt that the emphasis was not so strong in how important this book really is. If more people were after it or is some war occurred because of it to get it back then that would have conveyed how important and powerful the book is and then we would know why Gary Oldman is acting crazy and willing to kill for it. The conflict was shown but the book (Bible) should have been given more focus. But not a bad watch, the language is pretty ripe (mainly ""F"" words, more so from Gary Oldman) the endings pretty good as well but i found quite unbelievable...that's all i'm saying. More action than ""The Road"" (2009) but not the impact i expected.",The Book of Eli
180,robertasmith,Totally derivative tosh,5,20 July 2010,"This film has nothing new to add to any argument and tries to achieve gravitas by the director getting the cast to talk slowly but still manage to mumble.I was very disappointed with some of the performances and do wonder why Malcolm McDowell was uncredited. Perhaps he saw a preview and asked for his name to be removed. I can only assume that Michael Gambon and Frances De La Tour needed the money, as I can't understand why two such fine thespians would appear in such rubbish.The film is badly lit, has poor dialogue which is mumbled, has no pace and no surprises. The writer and director have just taken ideas from any number of other films starting with Mad Max, adding a touch of blind fury and allowing Christian fundamentalists to add to the mix.Absolute rubbish and as I type this, I'm not sure why I have scored it as high as 5!",The Book of Eli

The film stars Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, and Jennifer Beals. The movie received mixed reviews from critics, but better reception by audiences. I saw it mostly due to the fact that Washington was in it. I've never watched a bad movie with him involved. No, wait, he is just able to make bad movies tolerable. He's just good that way. I'd go on, but this is a film review, not a biopic. This a decent film, for the genre. Not at the level of Mad Max, but still fairly good.

185,jjnoahjames,"Amazing Movie. Really done right. ""The Road"" on steroids.",9,18 July 2010,"What's great about this movie? #1. The acting. Come on it's Denzel and he doesn't suck. He makes this ""end of the world"" movie twice as believable. Therefore if you're the kind of person who hates these movies because they seem pretentious this is for you. Unless you would prefer the boringness of The Road.#2. The script. It's actually more interesting and less over the top than you think. This story has more merit than other similar stories. There are a lot of important parts that make it come together and make you think, and seem like they had to be in the movie or with out them it would be incomplete.#3. Action. The action is great.

187,because-of-him,Watch once; then throw it away....,1,5 July 2010,"I won't give away the ending of this movie or spoil the content. It is worth seeing one time, for the twist at the end and for the specials effects and storyline, but just like the movie Sixth Sense, in which when you see the astonishing ending, you actually lose any interest in seeing the movie again...because you will then know why the actor does everything he does. Thus, in the Book of Eli, the ending is astonishing and spoils any desire to see the movie again. My reason for giving it a ""one"" rating is because the movie concludes with a defense of terrorists teachings. You will see many killings...see previews...throughout the movie which is actually justified because it is always done in self defense. But, I was very disappointed with the ending because here was an opportunity, though a fantasy, to reduce considerably the teaching of terrorism and direct hatred towards certain religions and peoples. Instead, the movie equates all major religions as being peaceful and necessary - a fallacy. If you compare the religions today...please don't build straw men by citing religious offenses over 100 years old...and see the movie, you too will see the stupidity of the ending and why some of us were left with an empty feeling. The only reason for the foul promotion of a certain book at the very end is that Hollywood is liberal, stupid and blind.",The Book of Eli
188,MVictorPjinsiste,Haunting Vision,6,31 December 2020,"This is some kind of post-apocalyptic western; On the good side, it is a movie with a great vision, rendered with the right tones, grain and atmospere, and acted by remarkeable, well-directed people. There's a bit of déja vu, of course, probably from some older classics like Mad Max etc, but it is rather pleasant as an experience.The plot, simple enough, has few twists, and seems more to follow a serie-like beat than a single feature film's. I feel nothing too special happened, just the final part of a long journey. An encounter with an odd couple hinted at what this movie could have been - more alive, more ""special"" - but otherwise it stays conventional and rather short on humor.Actions scenes and realism is about on the level of superhero movies, and one could feel little suspense in it even when the hero faced impossible odds. Another thing I didn't quite get was the 'miracle' that started the hero's journey, as it felt out of place in such a grim setting, furthermore that the film is effectively not religious at all in terms of philosophy and imagery. It isn't an 'enlightement' movie - it's essentially an action flick.On this subject, I couldn't help but wonder how such a book, in good part made out of fairy tales, tales that helped start about half the wars we ever had, one that condones slavery, genocide and racial division (among others), could help such a society, but then I remembered that hope, even when false, can make a lot of thing easier.So there's a bit of lost potential, but I wished I had more of the imagery and universe - we barely learn what happened here. But it's kind of cool to look at nonetheless.",The Book of Eli
189,Henry-klein,Non-religious rating,6,6 July 2019,"For a post apocalyptic adventure movie this is good but certainly not great. The cinematography, landscape and filters are spot on.

This probably would make for a better Netflix series now than the original movie.",The Book of Eli
190,rpvanderlinden,Lost in Space,8,29 December 2010,"Those who think that ""The Book of Eli"" is religious (Christian) propaganda should have been around in the 1950's and '60's when Biblical epics ruled the box-office. They'd be clawing at the walls and screaming for the nearest exit. In that era what was on movie screens was indicative of North American racial homogeneity and a Christian mindset. I'm as skeptical as I need to be when confronted by dogma from any source, but I do own a copy of the 1959 movie ""Ben-Hur"". Why? Because it's a beautifully crafted tale of revenge and redemption - a theme that resonates, I'm sure, in religions around the world. So what if there are scenes of Christ offering water to the weary? Those scenes have a reason for being there and I find them very moving. Besides, that movie wasn't made by Christian evangelists, but by Hollywood money-men, who know a good thing when they see it. By definition propaganda is systemic, widespread, deliberate indoctrination or propagation of ideas, doctrines and practices. ""Ben-Hur"" is the expression of a time and place and is no more Christian propaganda than ""The Book of Eli"", which is simply a road movie about a man walking across a wasteland once known as America carrying a book to an unknown destination.After all, what's in a book, right? According to this movie, plenty. Both the hero, Eli (Denzel Washington), and the villain, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), see the same thing in the book (which I guessed, early on, was the Bible), and that thing is power. Carnegie, ruling over a decrepit town full of raggedy survivors, fancies himself as a future demagogue with the Bible as his tool. Ring a bell, anyone? Eli subscribes to a different kind of power, and that is the power of faith. That's it. That's the movie. A movie about faith. Hardly Propaganda Central. The film ""Knowing"" is about the same thing, only cloaked in science fiction garb. The knowing that the title refers to is the ""knowledge"" that faith brings. I don't think that it's coincidence that movies, our most popular art form in this secular age, are discussing such things, sometimes with a certain urgency. It seems to me that, as a society, we've misdirected our faith and some of us get all panicky when a movie with a - gasp! - Christian hero arrives on the scene. Why is that? Would it help if the hero were Catholic? Are ""The Godfather"" movies religious propaganda? After all, they were made by an Italian Roman Catholic and show religious practices. Is giving thanks to ""God"" for one's blessings somehow subversive? Since when is it offensive for a film-maker to speak from his heart or his experience? ""The Book of Eli"", by Albert and Allen Hughes, is a pseudo western and a more than passable action movie, but between the bursts of violence is a tranquil and affecting parable about finding one's way in the world. That the world is an arid desert pock-marked by huge bomb craters under a searing sun hardly seems to matter. Eli has the gift of serenity, and the movie allows actor Denzel Washington, who has a quiet, charismatic presence here, to fully inhabit the spaces, both visual and temporal, on the screen. His character has room to breathe. And what spaces! The film looks absolutely magnificent! Cinematographer Don Burgess has drained almost all of the colour out of the images and what remains sometimes looks remarkably like a monochromatic silent movie that reminded me, in part, of the desert scenes in ""Greed"". After the climactic set-piece at the farmhouse the film moves deliberately toward its conclusion, but for once the ending did not disappoint me. There are a couple of wonderful twists, as well as the presence, in the story, of a certain invention which changed human history and which will kindle the re-birth of human knowledge (there are no computers in this film - it's back to basics for mankind). It exists in a kind of post-apocalyptic monastery located, ironically, where society's rejects were once housed. And there is no evangelical hallelujah chorus in these final minutes.",The Book of Eli

If you are a believer, you will love it.This movie is about faith and belief. It is about having a calling and following it with faith. The action, fight, chase and special effects scenes are there just as in every other movie of this type. One complaint would be that the movie is a little long and repetitious but it was interesting enough to keep your attention. There have been a lot of movies based on the post apocalyptic theme. This one just takes a different spin than most of the others. Obviously, from reading the reviews, it has offended some people. Well, live with it. Almost every movie seems to offend someone.

He's just a good actor and a good man...so I respect him and love to see him in movies.I figured this would be an exciting and good movie but what I didn't figure on is how poignant it was going to be. My eyes misted up at some of the lessons of this film. No, it's not preachy, but it's thought provoking. I was (and love to be) surprised at the premise of this film. The acting was good, very good and this is one of those movies that I think is a must-see on the big screen. The landscape is too big for a TV, well unless you have one of those HUGE TVs people have nowadays. But I love the big screen for this type of movie. It may be ""rough"" for some folks, but it's actually pretty mild compared to a lot of what's out there and to me, there was no gratuitous violence. I can really see this happening - it's not so far-fetched as to be ridiculous.Yes, I was impressed, entertained and moved by this film.

194,Jona1988,They went way to far with the religious stuff,4,11 February 2011,"I was looking forward to this. A post-apocalyptic thriller like the great The Road. I'm not a big fan of Denzel Washington thinking he plays the same guy way to much but then again many actors do that. The film starts kind of promising with this dystopian theme and really dark atmosphere. Not much happens for quite some time, just walking, slow motion effects and some actually pretty good action scenes. But even tough the technical aspects are kind of OK the rest is mostly weak. Soon it starts to drag, because unlike The Road which is a long walk movie one gets the feeling something more will happen in The Book of Eli. The acting is not bad but it feels just stale and the characters are just completely uninteresting. Gary Oldman is the one that does the best performance but that doesn't mean much sadly. I guess one should blame the directing and script. Which brings me to the story, the part that one thinks would have something to give but is just so bland and dumb. It doesn't take long to get what kind of plot concept this i building on. But the point that is to come is one that any viewer has guessed ages ago, like shortly after it starts. The Book of Eli is a movie with dull characters, uninteresting story, plot twist that doesn't surprise and some dumb attempt at sending a message. Now to come to the message, which really killed this movie for me, wtf religious propaganda? Religious propaganda hidden under dark action movie is just a stupid idea and works even worse than it sounds. If that is what they tried to do with this film the did not succeed well because I was just like this is ridiculous. It is one thing to have an religious tone and OK to give a positive view of faith if you wish, just like it's OK to be critic of it. But in this film they go to far. Thankfully one won't get that irritated by this propaganda crap because it's just so silly. Still I hate this movie! The Book of Eli is just rubbish, can't think of one reason for seeing is actually. Well the technical stuff like the action is kind of nice but not nearly enough to keep this crap afloat. Maybe see it to an pleasant outflow of laughter over this dumb attempt of sending a hidden message, and a really stupid message that is. 4/10 This sucks!",The Book of Eli
195,kuciak,Should Catholics Be Angry,7,27 July 2010,"First off, I enjoyed Book Of Eli. I could not help think of the Mad Max films, which the film pays homage to, and Akira Kurrosawa' Yojimbo, especially when Eli (Denzel Washington) walks away from the camera after a battle, and he reminds me with his walk of Toshiro Mifune. Without giving anything away, even though I have warned of a spoiler, another Japanese character comes to mind. Throw in also Sergio Leone, with one of the characters whistling music from Once Upon a Time In America.The character of Carnegie (Gary Oldman) is seen reading a book on Musollini when we are introduced to him. He is looking for a certain book. His leading sidekick, while a villain a little bit more sympathetic than he, reminds one a little of Mussolini with his bald head. the book that Carnegie is looking for we will learn is the Bible, with it, he feels he can rule more than just the small barren town that he holds sway over. ""People will come from all over"" he says, 'and do what I say"". I could not help but think of Mussolini in Rome, and the Catholic Church in Vatican City, which if I am not correct is also in Rome.Are the Hughes brothers suggesting that the Catholic Church hijacked Christianity as I have heard some other Christians say. Perhaps. But I also would suggest that they are also going against such people as Pat Robertson and the late Jerry Falwell. that Eli, a black man is protecting this book against a white man, I think also maybe suggests that he is protecting the book so that Europeans don't hijack Christianity again, as the film may be subtly be suggesting. I however, will not say that the film is racist, or that the Hughes Brothers are showing prejudice.That the film ends in San Francisco, which even though the world has gone through a dreadful Apocalypse, is still shown as beautiful, and maybe an Eden of sorts, is a further condemnation of the Religious Right by the brothers, as San Francisco is often seen by the right as far from God as one can be.truth be told, as many have argued here, the film should have ended with Eli dictating to Malcom McDowell. the ending becomes a little pretentious, though perhaps, with the lead female character heading back to where she came from, and possibly going to kick some butt, the Hughes brothers are suggesting the oppression that women have suffered under religion as well.",The Book of Eli
196,Targe,A thoughtful twist on Mad Max marred by heavy Christian message,8,16 December 2011,"Overall, if you are a fan of the post-apocalypse, Mad Max Road Warrior type movies, you will not be disappointed by this piece, which has Denzel Washington as a kind of modern blind swordsman wandering his way to the coast to deliver a precious book (THE book btw) to a secret base that is trying to preserve culture and knowledge.The movie is marred by some problems these type have. Denzel is like a demi-god, unstoppable, unlike the grizzled Mel Gibson in Road Warrior, who has already been ran over by a motorbike in the previous movie and endures further slings and arrows in the series. Mel is human, painfully so, and we grimace and share every broken bone, every festering bullet wound, every lump on his forehead. Denzel otoh, appears to be super-human, moving far faster than everyone else around him, and taking bullets like they were paintballs. There is never any explanation how this supposedly blind (OH YEAH HE'S BLIND TOO!!!!) fellow is supposedly so over the top skilled. We also don't find out the reason for the fall of humanity either until midway through. I prefer the beginning of movie voice-over so your not muttering WTF??? through the whole movie. This was done well in the Mad Max mythos and there was no reason to change it.Another point is that they never explain why everyone in the world decided to burn their bible. Hell, there's a million of them alone in Las Vegas if you go into every hotel room. Very improbable. That the Christian bible is going to be the savior of humanity or it's enslaver, depending on who it ends up with, is also a rather grandiose statement in itself. Not being a devout Christian I found that rather uncomfortable, but I guess they had to pick one book, and Accounting for Dummies would not have worked as well.As is often the problem with these movies, the villain just doesn't measure up to a god-like knife wielding archangel mo'fo from heaven, and he is forgettable and should have died much earlier than he does in the movie.All that being said, this movie is definitely original, combining elements of Road Warrior, Fahrenheit 451, and Omega Man and Blind Swordsman in a well written and tightly acted job that get's fair marks.",The Book of Eli
197,achmoye,Poetic and handles religion smoothly.,7,29 July 2017,"I was just curious about his movie, I had no idea what it was except the apocalyptic theme. It's been a good surprise for me. You could expect a lot of violence from post-apocalyptic movies, and there is some, but it's very moderate and beautifully choreographed. The story is about Eli, who carries the last Bible, and walks faithfully towards his destiny. I know it sounds really boring for non-religious but it's not. I am not a believer myself, and I would say it's more poetic than religious. The story is just beautiful.The pace is slow and contemplative, with some action scenes as I said, so it's a very nice twist from your typical end-of-the-world action movie.Visually, there is way too much emphasis on lighting, it looks too artificial. It does gives a special atmosphere, though. But the artistic photography is well-directed and coherent. Eli might be a little too bad-ass sometimes, but really not as much as the typical strong apocalyptic scavenger. I appreciated this movie, it's a nice poetic twist from the stereotypes of the genre. Denzel Washinton is quite good at painting this mysterious character.",The Book of Eli
198,toofancorp,Equal parts awesome and stupid,7,17 May 2019,"The heavy handed bible stuff is a main part of the story, so if you are religious or not (I'm not at all) you should know what your getting into. It could make you cringe if it's not your schtick.The action, the post apocalyptic stuff, the acting, directing, visuals...are all pretty great. Gary Oldman just makes every scene perfect with his ridiculousness.The dialogue and certain cheese moments keep this movie from greatness.

199,archiecm,The ending nullified the film,3,20 October 2011,"This review does have spoilers, since it is predicated on what the ending does to the audience and to the rest of the film.The end reveals that the knife-slashing, sharp-shooting Christian Soldier Eli, is on a mission but has been completely blind throughout the whole story. That's kind of like a movie where a character is asleep and all the action you witnessed was just a dream--there s/he is lying in bed and nothing happened after all. I think it's bad art to ""revoke"" the entire story. To me it renders it meaningless. And if every word and deed of Eli is really just God and Eli is merely a chess piece than it's not a story about Eli at all.Also, if Eli was blind then the fifty-odd men he expertly cut down or shot were all done in by God spotting the targets and guiding the knife and gun. My first question: Why did God only wound Carnegie (Gary Oldman) in the leg? The rest were killed unequivocally. So did God get distracted or what? Of all the villains to eliminate Carnegie should top the list--he actually wants to derail the Bible's journey from it's rightful mission. Carnegie went on to hurt and murder many more people (something presumably God wouldn't condone.) The movie is presenting two conflicting statements about the Bible. Carnegie wants it for the purpose of controlling the people so that he can dominate and take advantage of them. That's a pretty cynical view. In Carnegie's view the loving and empathetic examples in the Bible are for the people who have no power. His thinking is that in the former society, Christianity and specifically, the Bible, were ineffective in the task of making people free--that the Bible was instrumental in their failure to create a gentle loving society. With his only copy he supposedly will keep the masses obedient and ignorant. (In that case wouldn't he need to give the people hundreds of Bibles so they could learn to be docile?) I think his theory is flawed but I agree that our society is rife with injustice and inequality, and greed. The greedy buy the politicians who are, therefore, prostitutes. Is this caused by the Bible? Is the Bible a recipe for dictatorship? I think the cause is deeper, more basic. Humans have a dark side. Dictatorships and despotism have preceded and succeeded Jesus, and have come from lots of other religions.I don't think the principles of Jesus trump our other instincts. We have war, selfishness, and suffering that the men in power ignore. I guess the filmmaker disagrees and thinks things were fine in the twentieth century or perhaps he thinks that we'll do better if we get another chance. Good luck with that.I was sorry to see the Bible survive. I think many parts of it are seriously outdated--scientifically and morally.",The Book of Eli

201,spencerthetracy,A decent Denzel vehicle with a spiritual element.,7,15 January 2010,"It appears that the older Denzel gets the more spiritual his movies and his characters become. He becomes a post-nuclear Kwai Chaing Cane here playing a drifter with a purpose. He carries in his possession a book that seems to hold great power, and one which many are willing to yearn, die and kill for.He has been traveling for 30 years (since the sky opened) in order to deliver this book, The Book of Eli, to its ultimate purpose. He has killed many on his way because the voice that he heard decades ago told him he would be protected.The sun never shines in this movie, as it didn't in Terminator Salvation, as it never does in any post-apocalyptic film. And the torn, ragged creatures he meets are as worn as you've seen in Water World or any movie like it. Denzel's physicality really stands out. Its outstanding. He dispatches more than a few 'bad guys' sent on raids to look for the Book.The plot carries what at first seems to be MacGuffin. We really don't know what this book is, and why its so important.At the end though its revealed to us. And we wonder why this is the only copy of this book left. Who destroyed them and why is never revealed to us, though I guess we can surmise.There is little doubt though, the sale of this book in the real world will be huge.I give this movie 7 out of 10 stars because of the less than stellar plot revelation and the slight miscasting of Mila Kunis.

202,bobzmcishl,Interesting plot twists,5,21 December 2010,"Denzel Washington held up his end of the acting gig, but the rest of the cast was sort of miscast. There were some interesting twists to this movie which made is sort of worth watching, at least on HBO or Netflix. Would not have wanted to pay theater prices to see this movie. Like most apocalyptic movies there are too may lose ends about how the world came to this point, but one could surmise that human beings finally atom bombed themselves into oblivion and some survived by being in caves our far underground at the time.I guess the producer wanted the audience to use their own imagination which is sometimes appropriate. This movie qualifies at not bad but not good either which is why I grade it a solid ""5"". Interesting how many movies of this type feature the Golden Gate Bridge as an emphatic point on how badly the Earth was destroyed. Denzel Washington makes this movie worth watching.

205,Netscape_Navigator,"A shallow, pseudo-action movie protected by the guise of religious pretense",3,20 January 2010,"(i.e., just like when one of those criminally ignorant athletes makes the ridiculous proclamation of having ""god"" on their side that day, that enabled him to score the winning goal unit for his team).Yup, I began my review as a footnote to the subject line.I had no knowledge of this movie beforehand, but I did have a couple of expectations based on what I saw of the commercials, and what a friend of mine told me.1) I expected an epic, post-apocalyptic tale that completely engages you, and draws you into its gritty, dark world.2) A friend of mine said he's never seen a crowd that quiet after the show. I took that to be a positive thing.Only one of the two items listed above turned out to be true.Let me cut straight to the chase- you take the religious aspect out of this movie and you're left with an average flick with bad pacing, ZERO character development, and poor directing.What does it matter if it's The Bible or not? It's about a dude carrying a book and headed West because that's what god wants him to do. That's the story right there. And then you've got Meg from Family Guy teaming up with him, who rivals Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns as far as epic miscastings go.**Usually in a movie where you're following one central character in a huge, lonely world, you really get engrossed with that character and really care about what happens next. Here they forgot about character development so nothing really mattered. We're just watching Denzel with glasses and a beard.**While the fighting scenes were flashy, I don't like their choice of how they shot it, or how they portrayed his character. It's definitely fun to see Denzel as a total badass on-screen, but I don't get how his fighting skills are up to the level of being able to dispatch enemies in seemingly mere nano-seconds with absolutely RAZOR SHARP precision and accuracy, with NO MISTAKES. With or without the spoiler, that still doesn't explain it. This portrayal took away from the realism and made him seem like some superhero, or invincible. Was there any explanation given as to why he's able to operate in this manner? Was it because god was protecting him? That's a cop out answer. Is god the answer to anything that can't be explained with rational logic? Oh wait..**Denzel and Meg from Family Guy had no chemistry in this movie. She plays the cookie cutter 'young, attractive girl fascinated by mysterious older man' role to a tee.**How is it that a no name wannabe movie critic can see a a movie and easily point out the number of unnecessary (and embarrassing) slow motion shots in a movie, yet professional movie makers can't, and in fact, readily DOUSES the movie in it.**My reviews aren't complete until I whine and moan about a character's decisions and illogical actions in a movie. Well we're at that point. The morning after Meg from Family Guy leaves Denzel's cell and goes to see her mother and Gary Oldman, she gets questioned by Gary Oldman about whether or not Denzel had a book. Just look at this scene, she could've EASILY just lied and said no. But instead, here she is cowering like a mindless retard, even as her mother gets threatened, she's standing there as if she's trying hard to hold in a secret, when in fact, all she had to do was adamantly state that THERE WAS NO BOOK and she has no idea what he's talking about. The kind of actions seen here would be the kind where some powerful mind reading overlord has someone captured, and that captured person knows that the overlord can easily see past his lies due to his supernatural abilities, so when questioned, he's very hesitant to lie because he knows the repercussions of lying, and so is more or less paralyzed with fear, not knowing whether lying or telling the truth would be the better choice. THAT SCENARIO DIDN'T APPLY HERE WITH MEG GRIFFIN AND GARY OLDMAN.Hughes Brothers, lol. These clowns should've stayed retired.",The Book of Eli
206,mistabobdobolina,"Sweet Jesus, this is bad.",2,30 July 2010,"And it's not just bad because it's a religious movie per se. I'm not religious, but will happily concede that religious movies can be perfectly decent and even great: Elmer Gantry, Becket, A Man for All Seasons, The Last Temptation of Christ and Ben Hur are all deservedly regarded as classics. Heck, I can even watch Disney's The Prince of Egypt with some enjoyment. Unfortunately, though, the Book of Eli belongs to the other side of Christian culture from those movies: it's thoughtless, slapdash and absurd instead of thoughtful, well-crafted and involving.The action sequences are solid and sometimes impressive, which is all that salvages this film a rating above one star. And the acting is competent. But nothing else works: the post-apocalyptic setting is clichéd and poorly-produced, the script is disastrously clumsy in its over-the-top preachiness, the final ""twist"" seemingly meant to imply that Eli was blind all along makes no sense (and is 180 degrees from how he's portrayed in the rest of the movie)... all of which has been covered by other reviewers.The Book of Eli's worst sin, though, is that its premise shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the core mythology and self-image of the very religion it's pushing.The foundational allure of the Gospel is *not* that evil men will do anything to possess it, but that it survives and thrives despite all attempts to suppress or dismiss it. Whether or not you're a Christian, that's a narrative that makes sense as propaganda; it's easy to see what makes it compelling, and why Christianity's most enduring self-concept (justified or otherwise) is as a faith of martyrs and underdogs persevering against the tyranny of prideful and immoral men. But the Book of Eli is a film that doesn't understand this most basic of facts about Christianity. The purported motivation of its villain is not just palpably ludicrous by the standards of realistic psychology -- a personality like Carnegie in real life would never be the least bit hesitant about making up his own scripture, something dictators are often EAGER to do, and surely would not waste his time and his army chasing around a wasteland in search of someone else's words -- but is also perfectly pointless and incoherent even as a vehicle for the kind of religious propaganda this movie desperately wants to be.Dreadful stuff.",The Book of Eli
207,iNickR,A Good Telling of Another Post-Apocalyptic-Type Story,9,4 December 2017,"I have this obsession with post-apocalyptic stories, and IMO, this is one of the better-told ones. I have no idea why I'm fascinated with doomsday (POTUS, I'm looking in your direction) I just am, so I'll watch any movie that has that theme (one of the lowest-rated movies on IMDb is an apocalypse-type film and it's on my Watchlist!)I loved this movie, nearly everything about it in fact. It's not quite in my Top 10, but it is watchable more than once. I've seen it five times already and I can watch it another five time. Gary Oldman is great as the bad guy who thinks he's JC reincarnate (or dare I say 'God'). It took me three viewings before I was able to 'get' the ending but after I saw the movie again with that understanding, it made for a much better viewing spotting all the cues. Well done.

208,Jinn,"And Humanity Saw the Destruction caused in the name of God and said: ""Enough""",2,16 October 2010,"Glad to see I'm not the only one who shot an arrow through this turkey. I anticipated the violence, blood and body parts that come with this sort of flick, though I would have expected more substance. At first I thought the Book of Eli was some sort of lost scroll. What a disappointment - the book, the plot, the movie. And this movie was blatantly sexist. The women in it, did nothing but shy away, scream, get hurt, raped, captured and whine - if they lived in such a world, it would stand to reason that they would have learned to defend themselves and whup-ass. Okay to Solara became a warrior, however if she had grown up in such a world -- she would have already been one.So Religious wars destroyed the world? Figures. And so true the, Church used the bible as a weapon preying on the lost and forlorn, giving them a false sense of 'hope'  True the bible (and other religious texts) have some wonderful messages, though those brainwashed by religion (any of them) were forbidden to really think for themselves and were conned into believing their religion had all the answers - in truth none of them do - the truth is within you - It always has been, no organised religion wants you to know your own personal and beautiful power, your sense of self worth that you are a beautiful sovereign being that should answer to no one. This world this Universe created itself not to be worshipped, but to expand, explore, live and learn and live in peace.So no wonder Oldman's character wanted it for the same reason. So why did Denzel's character save a book that has been used to brainwash billions?I did however love the library scene at the end - at least some culture was saved. And how the bible was in Braille was interesting (and Eli was Blind) - let us hope that the new world will use books like the bible to *actually* bring hope - and never be used for domination and control as they have been in our past.I guess making movies like this are supposed to drum some sense into humans to forgo their petty disputes, wars, dogma and give humans a sense of what it might be like of they don't put aside their differences.So in that sense perhaps the movie had some purpose as to say: ""Look humanity, if you don't straighten yourselves out, your race will become nothing but a stupid, idiotic plot less, pointless movie!""Humanity's cry, ""NOOOOO!!!! Anything but that!! Let us do something to prevent this godawful travesty!""A pity the travesty in the form of movies like these are needed (or worldwide disasters to shake humanity up) Wake up people!!! Perhaps movies like these will motivate them to let go, if, en-masse, they have the intelligence. If not, too bad, so sad. The ones who are making a difference will ascend to higher light realms and those who are not will become nothing but extras in a sh!tty B grade movie, spiraling themselves to self destruction.Think about it.

209,Chris_Mac_25,Great apocalypse tale,10,28 June 2020,"Denzel is typically in good form here, playing the faithful guardian of the last remaining bible.

210,vesil_vesalier,Non-spoiler review for Eli and his book,3,1 November 2018,"Threes, on my ratings scale, are the movies I really hate the most. Twos aren't as bad, because I never get any real investment in them because of how broken they are. Ones aren't as bad at all, because they're usually so horrifyingly boring that I already have lost any interest in them at all, and with no interest there is no investment.Fours are movies that fall apart. My basic Four is THE HUNGER GAMES, a strange example for a Four, because I actually enjoy the movie, pretty much. The third act falls apart, and enough mistakes are made throughout the film to support it getting a Four, in spite of it being rather enjoyable.Fives are right in the middle, movies I can't hate or love, and have enough problems and good parts to put them right in the middle. Sixes are fun to watch but really don't have any kind of core mechanic or heart to hold on to. Sevens are thematically impressive, but have plot troubles or inconsistencies that make it difficult to stick with the film.Eights are like bronze stars, really good films that have minor flaws. Nines are like silver medals, excellent films with nagging issues that keep them just shy of the grand prize. And Tens, even though more than one of my Tens is by far a perfect picture, BLOW ME AWAY. Anything that I see that can affect me for days, weeks, even YEARS down the road deserves a Ten, simply by the impact that the art has had on me.But the Threes are left for those movies that had wasted potential. Movies that had grand, even wonderful ideas and totally shat all over them, either for the sake of Hollywood, for the sake of the actors, or for some other dumb reason that befuddles me as I painfully think of how great a film COULD be, if only it would get the hell out of its own way and allow itself to be wonderful.A Three very directly explains the breadth of Tyler Perry's entire career.THE BOOK OF ELI stars Denzel Washington as Eli, and he is the very best of this film, which is why it is such a terrible shame that everything around it is little more than a set of confused jokes and terrible choices. Eli wanders the post-""Flash"" landscape, below green skies, through grey rubble, and over brown dirt. While the shots give you the idea of just how #$%^ed the world around Eli is, they're more bland than inspiring, more blah than horrifying.He's carrying a precious artifact with the presumed power to save all of Mankind (what's left of it), and there's some real power in the tale that's being told considering this Maguffin, but I won't spoil it for you here.Chasing him as the predatory heavy is the always wonderful Gary Oldman as Carnegie, a man desperately searching for a particular book that he eventually figures out Eli might be carrying. Thus, the plot of the movie (sort of) ensues. Gary wants the book, Eli's probably got the book, so go, cronies, and get the book.The extras in the film bring the movie down. Jennifer Beals plays Claudia, mother of Mila Kunis' character Solara. While Jennifer doesn't really take anything away or add anything to the story (minus a lovely up-yours near the end of the film), Mila is completely miscast for this role.Or maybe it's mis-written.Her actions are the definition of naive, she brings no real sense of command to the role that she's been given, which is at best somebody for Eli to talk to as he traverses the nowhere of the world, protecting his book. She wanders when she's told not to, brings no weapons into the outworld which makes no sense considering the lovely array of what passes for human beings that come through her hometown on a near-regular basis, she's humorless, and pointless at best.Don't get me wrong--I've seen Mila act. I know she can. But the role she's been given here doesn't fit her in the least, and everything she does brings you more irritation than plot as you watch her fumble around in Denzel's shadow.There's a scene involving the wonderful Michael Gambon that's anything but wonderful, in which one of the only left standing houses in existence is inhabited by him and his loving wife (played by Frances de la Tour), aptly named George and Martha as an attempt to bring humor into this humorless film. It fails.I don't want to spoil anything, so I have to stop. I have to write a spoiler-laden review after this, just because I want to.Bottom line, this is a film that defines wasted potential. Where they could have had art, they went Hollywood. Where they could have had Wow, they went Meh, instead. If only somebody could fix this disaster, and maybe re-work it into a better film, I'd be all in favor of it. Of course somehow you'd have to try and preserve the surprise near the end (I told you I won't spoil it).Watch this film if you are interested in filling in the places that are terrible with better notions in your head. Watch this film if you are studying film direction, and want to learn what NOT to do with your plot. Watch this film if you're drunk and just don't care what you're looking at, because you won't remember it the next day anyway.Otherwise, DON'T.",The Book of Eli
211,vesil_vesalier,Spoiler review for Eli and his book,3,1 November 2018,"Heeeere's Spoilers!!There are many amazing moments in BOOK OF ELI. The book itself being the Bible, the fact that it's written in Braille (giving Gary Oldman the ultimate comeuppance as he slowly dies from his injuries), the fact that Eli is BLIND (which makes all of the shots more impressive. Go watch it again if you don't believe me, though I recommend a lot of alcohol ingestion first). His sword with its curious number of holes in it (sound related, I think? Adding to the Wow of the previous moment if I'm right).But there are also many WTF moments in BOOK OF ELI. Mila's decision to leave town without weapons, armor, food, water, or intelligence. The strained level of jokes that do nothing for the movie, from the layout of magazines and books on Gary Oldman's table (ranging from National Geographic (I think) to Oprah Magazine, in much better condition than they should be, considering the post-""Flash"" surroundings we find ourselves in) to George and Martha playing Britney Spear's ""Toxic"" on a turntable. George and Martha (a joke in itself, though I can't remember why) themselves have a WTF moment, when Denzel rings the doorbell of their house (a standalone structure amidst stretching desert and tumbleweeds, bereft of crops or reasonable food sources, hint hint wink wink) only to fall into their trapdoor-on-the-porch, into their hole for presumably preparing their newly captured prey for future dinner ensembles, only to help them out and treat them to conversation and Britney Spears' lovely, long-dead voice on their record player. Don't really know why. I guess they want to get to really know the people they eat. You are what you eat, isn't that what they say?The drab, green-brown-grey of the world bleeds away into the blue-skied paradise of the Preservation of Humanity, on what appears to be, film-wise, the other side of the world. It does this so dramatically that it feels less like a transition from one location to the next, as it does Dorothy opening the door into Oz, going from sepia to rainbow in one turn of the knob.It does this so quickly that, combined with Eli's inability to die (because he needs to serve his purpose before that, which believe it or not I did buy and have no real problems with), you start to wonder about which parts of the film are supposed to be realistic and which ones are not.And that's the real crux of the very biggest problem with this movie: it tries to balance realism with absurdity, and miserably fails. The realism soars, while the absurdity drains. It makes the entire film feel terribly uneven, shattering the suspension of disbelief that it desperately, DESPERATELY needs to make the film work.Eli is BLIND. He is fighting with ""God""s literal commandment. He's surviving on the skills of a SWORDSMAN without SIGHT. Mila Kunis is supposed to be his AIDE (I guess). He can't be KILLED. He's carrying the freaking BIBLE. The BIBLE is the key to restoring civilization and the future of HUMANITY. There's a whole lot this film is trying to get you to swallow, and the worst part is that, if you take away all the other problems, it WORKS.But you are also constantly reminded you're watching a Hollywood movie. Shiny books and magazines that you would have found on a grocery store shelf the year this film was made. Mila's character being brainlessly stupid as she tags along with Eli, only to become the new Sword-wielder at the end (without training, blindness, or ""God""'s support BTW). George and Martha playing ""Toxic"" while they make chitter-chatter with their evening dinner. A color shift from post-apocalyptic death to a sunny day in California. On and on and on.The BOOK OF ELI is a film that could have been one of my Tens, and I'm not religious in any sense of the word.

213,dukevega,"Weak, Very Weak",3,31 January 2010,"On the whole, I have not been impressed with Denzel's body of work since he won his second Oscar for ""Training Day"", and this film does nothing to reverse that trend.In this, he plays a lone warrior wandering a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but unlike most other protagonists in films like this, he actually has a place to go and something to do. I won't say where he's going or why, but he's been doing it for over 30 years, which quite possibly makes him the hero with the worst sense of direction ever (has he ever heard of a map and compass?). But I digress.It starts interestingly enough, establishing his character in some ways you don't usually see. Of course he is a good fighter, as you have to be in a world like this, but then he unheroically leaves a couple of fellow wanderers to the untender mercies of some roaming bikers after dealing with a larger group of bandits. What, now he's afraid to fight? I suppose that, given his purpose, that can be excused, but that's still a bit hard to swallow.Anyway, he comes across a small town ruled by the iron fist of Gary Oldman, whose great power is that he can...read. That's not a typo, he can read, and that is apparently all the power he needs. We never once see him do anything that shows his evil nature, unless you count him raising his voice against a couple of women and pulling on the hair of a blind Jennifer Beals. Come on, this is Gary Oldman, the King of Psychotic Villains, and this is the best you can do with him?I could go on with other problems, such as there being no final showdown in the third act or Denzel's ability to survive a gut shot long after he should have been dead, but frankly I can't go any further. The more I type, the more I realize exactly how much this movie sucked and the less chance I have of forgetting that I saw it.

216,Mash-the-stampede,Mad Eli,7,8 July 2010,"At first glance - 'The Book of Eli' may look like another typical post-apocalyptic film in the style of such classics as the 'Mad Max' saga and the excellent anime feature ""Fist of the North star"" and in some ways it is similar in nature. The deserted open desert style landscapes, the leather-clad fashion accessories and lack of technology/resources are all present - but what really sets 'The Book of Eli' apart from those other films is it's story.If you have not yet seen this film, I suggest you stop reading this review right now as i am about to go into plot details and touch on the ""twist"" so uh; ""SPOILER ALERT"":'The Book of Eli' is essentially about a blind (that's the ""twist"" part) man who wonders the plains of a post-apocalyptic (possible result of a nuclear war as briefly mentioned in the film) landscape by himself with a single book in his possession. The ""book"" of Eli turns out to be none other than The Good Book - as in 'The Bible'. Not only is it 'The Bible', it also happens to be the very last 'Bible' on earth!Eli's 'mission' given to him direct from the voice of God is to take the book West, so the film focus's on Eli's journey and the characters he meets/confronts throughout.Denzel is good in the title role and brings enough overall substance to his character to make him believable and never over does or over acts any of his lines. I've also read he did all his own stunts and fight scenes for the film which scores extra points in my book!Gary Oldman plays the lead villain role and his purpose is to take the book (Bible) from Eli and use it for his own personal methods of control. Gary is born to play villains so you can imagine that he is also superbly cast in his role.Mila Kunis provides eye-candy and gives a very testosterone fueled film a very much needed female injection. I must say for someone who doesn't bathe (with soap at least) or wear any make-up in this post-apocalyptic future - she looks pretty fine to me!!!Overall the films pace plays out well and there is enough plot, dialogue and action sequences to please most people who would bother seeing a film such as this one.Now as for the ""twist"": So it turns out Eli is blind and the Bible is written in brail. This is only revealed to the viewer at the end of the film. However, there are many hints to Eli's blindness scattered throughout the film and off the top of my head - having seen this film only once, I can think of the following:* When Eli first encounters the bandits at the start of the film, he lures them into the shadows to fight them indicating that he does not need sight to take out his opponents and that they will be at a dis-advantage in the dark. * Eli's sense of smell and hearing is re-remarkably good and obviously heightened as he smells the bandits when they are hiding and often sounds are louder in particular scenes indicating that this is how he hears things. * Though Eli wears sunglasses through the majority of the film, the bright desert sunlight does not seem to effect him as in one scene - he walks out of a darkened area into the sunlight and does not put his glasses on straight away. * Eli is mistaken for being asleep by Solara (Kunis) when he in fact he is not.I'm sure there are more clues than that which will be easily identified on a second viewing when the viewer is looking for them.All up, a very entertaining film with a decent plot and solid acting from the cast.A must-see for fans of post-apocalyptic films!",The Book of Eli

219,talkymeat,Just Another Post Apocalyptic Thriller.,3,19 June 2010,"Eli is a post apocalyptic drifter who wanders into a town run by an extremely cruel man named Carnegie. Carnegie wants him to join his gang up until he finds out that Eli possesses the last bible on earth and he will stop at nothing to obtain it.The Book of Eli is much like the dozen or so other identical Road Warrior knockoffs. The only real difference is that this time they included a most disgusting kicker: flimsy and transparent religious messages. The Bible is the only saving grace of humanity apparently and it acts as some sort of guardian angel over Eli's life throughout the film. Also, A voice LITERALLY told Eli where to find the bible and that he should take it West. No metaphors here, these messages are loud and clear. Without this obvious attempt at promoting religion this would just be a fairly benign and extremely boring outing, instead of borderline offensive.The plot is about as predictable and full of holes as most of these movies are. Questions are continually raised throughout the movie, specifically how could this many people be alive after 30 YEARS! That's right, I couldn't believe my ears when I heard them say it in the movie. This is 30 years after most of the human race was wiped out. Yet, there are still towns with pretty large population numbers; especially considering how many henchman Eli wipes out.Speaking of plot holes and Eli wiping out henchmen; that leads me to the mother of all plot holes when it is revealed that Eli has been completely BLIND the entire movie. During the course of the movie Eli: murdered several men at once with his machete, shot men and animals from far distances, and wandered the countryside for 30 years managing to find food all without any being able to see anything. I guess this was supposed to be another bit of help from upstairs, but come on. Couldn't God at least have spared some of these henchmen; not only did Eli behead several of them but he busted one man's face on the bar for simply talking mean to him. That doesn't sound like a warrior of God to me.Then after this A-bomb is dropped on the audience we find out that on Alcatraz Island, after the apocalypse, there is some sort of society of men doing their best to preserve history by printing up books and distributing them to nobody. I don't know what these guys are eating or where their getting paper, but I do know one thing: they like printing up books and then just setting them on a shelf. After Eli recites the King James bible to them, which he has memorized, they print one up and set it next to their one copy of the Kuran and then I guess they just leave it their in case someone wants to check it out.Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, and even Mila Kunis are slumming it Big Time in this amazingly dull movie, and they are all acting way below their ability. So avoid Book of Eli at costs, unless of course you are someone who is very religious yet still enjoys watching people being brutally murdered for no apparent reason.",The Book of Eli
220,illegal_alien51,"Oh Lord, deliver us from Eli!",1,25 August 2010,"Unbelievably stupid scenes added together make for quite a time waster of a movie. I too would want the world to adapt so that I can always be in danger, but in what ever situation fate has in store for me somehow come out the winner! Had this been real, Eli would have died probably 10-15 times within those two hours, which would have actually made for a lot more entertainment than the actual movie.The only person getting anything right here is Oldman's character. He tells us viewers in no uncertain terms that it's the Bible that has created all this devastation (""That's why they burned them all after the war!"") and that if only he got a hold of it and started preaching, everybody would start mindlessly gathering around him and do as he says. I have to ask... who is the bad guy here again? It certainly doesn't seem to be Oldman's character, as that guy lives in a town with rules, shops, bars and so on and seems to be an overall relatively easy guy to get along with as long as you're not acting up too much. He's even very honest, and a guy who has got the truth pretty much nailed down. And in the red corner we have Eli, a misanthropic loner who in most cases seems to be the one instigating the violence. He could have just dropped that bag as that actually pretty nice robber asked him to (to be honest, had I been the robber I would have just shot Eli as soon as he came around the corner, no need to make things more dangerous or complicated than necessary). But no, he seems to want to let Eli live, so he only asks for the bag. Eli chops the guy's hand off and kills his mates. Good job Eli! Acting like a true Christian. Besides... people with bibles are bullet proof. We all know that! But if you really take your time analysing what happens, thinking about the dialogues, you realize soon enough that the movie isn't really about the book but it's about keeping Eli alive as long as possible, saving him for the ""grand"" finale.One final thought: Does this movie make sense? The bibles were burnt after the war, for good reason. If it's such a commodity after 30 years, if it's something virtually unique, there must have been good reason to destroy all the billions bibles, and as Oldman's character practically says straight out - the war was because of the message, because of the book. So why would the ending of the movie come down to the saving of the book, the reprinting of the book if it is what destroyed the world in the first place? Does this mean that Eli in reality represents Satan, working to destroy even the remainder of civilisation? A reasonable conclusion, if I may say so myself.Right... Next!",The Book of Eli
221,tennismenace,"I loved it, and here's why",9,14 July 2010,"I've noticed many negative reviews are based on the fact that this movie has a religious uplifting message, which to many is not uplifting, especially if Christian. Oh well, we all have to deal with our insecurities and biases, don't we? Admittedly, this is not one of my insecurities because I am a believer in Yeshua (Jesus) and I try to follow His teachings as promulgated in the Holy Bible. Thus, this movie both encouraged me and even convicted me to start reading my Bible more often.Spoilers in here: I know some will find it hard to believe that a blind man could travel 3,000 miles in 30 years across the country, or that he could even do the things he did while being blind. So what? Accept that and move on. Look deeper my friend! There was also a very subtle message that everyone can appreciate - reading the good book is not the end all, but rather following the good book is! When Eli was faced with a decision - protect the book or save a life, Eli chose wisely after much thought. Don't you wish all religious people would follow their teachings more and judge people less? Imagine all that love going around - ""love your neighbor as yourself"" and ""love even your enemy...""This was not an easy movie to watch because of all the violence, but this movie is about post nuclear war, so you have to expect the environment to be harsh and the people living to be paranoid and desperate. I loved the black and white effect until they reached the ocean. Needless to say, Denzell is the man, and gives an awesome performance again. The supporting cast were great too, especially Solara. This movie isn't for all, but if you keep an open mind and put away your dislike for judgmental Christians, you mind find a diamond in the rough here. Cheers, peace, and love.",The Book of Eli

225,raiderhayseed,"For Eli Read Elijah, For Carnegie Read Constantine and so much more",9,19 April 2010,"David Stratton, the venerable co-host of Australia's ABC TV what's on AT THE MOVIES show has suggested that ""Book of Eli"" has been influenced by two films – Kurasawa's ""Yojimbo"" (and it's American re-make ""A Fistful of Dollars"") and John Hillcoat's adaptation of Cormack McCarthy's novel, ""The Road"". He's half right. The narrative of ""Book of Eli"" certainly bears a striking resemblance to that of the ""The Road"". Survivor of apocalyptic events guides a young companion on a west-ward journey, avoiding the company of strangers, seeking refuge then escaping from a peaceful looking farmhouse inhabited by cannibals before arriving at the Pacific (peaceful?) Ocean. But ""Book of Eli"" has more in common with Truffaut's ""Fahrenheit 451"" than any Samurai adventure or spaghetti Western. Survivors of world changing events memorise the literary canon to pass on the culture it describes to subsequent generations.""It's the risible writing and the self important, self righteous tone that ultimately prevents this odyssey from becoming the classic action film to which it aspires"" (David Stratton) Wrong again, Dave! It is not aspiring to be an action film. What it is succeeding in doing is making allegorical use of the bible and the prophet Elijah to raise some hefty question about religion, it sources, and the way it is practiced. It is that achievement that gives it a forceful authority that is lacking in most films of this genre. The bible uses the figure of Elijah as a type-symbol-metaphor for all the prophets referred to within its covers. These prophets set themselves the task of interpreting the Law of Moses (the first five books of the bible) in such a way as to upset the people who ran the church and the state of their day. In fact Jesus in his sermon on the mount said he had not come to destroy the Law and the Prophets, but rather to fulfil them. The prophet Elijah was particularly adept at upsetting King Ahab, The kicker is that Ahab respected the power and godly authority of the otherwise, seemingly destitute prophet Elijah. In ""Book of Eli"", Carnegie, the post apocalypse version of Ahab, has a similar respect for the bible and the power it seems to possess. Both Elijahs refuse to compromise with the ruler. 1.The biblical Elijah is told by God to pronounce the onset of a lengthy drought 2. God breaks the drought after a contest with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel by sending down fire from heaven then a rain storm 3. Elijah suffers what we would probably call today a nervous breakdown and flees westward to Mount Horeb – or Sinai 4 God speaks to him in a gentle whisper of God. So much for the biblical Elijah – not for Eli. After being shot and rescued by his young companion, Eli has a moment of clarity similar to his earlier revelation that convinced him that he should take the bible west-wards. The inner voice reveals to him what the scriptures are all about. All the words he has been memorising can be summed up in the idea, ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" But the story of Elijah does not stop on Mount Horeb with the still small voice of God. The prophet Malachi foretold his return to earth in the Last Days (that idea so beloved by evangelicals such as Sara Palin) before the Day of the Lord (that idea that God will intervene in human history by sending a Messiah to rescue the people of Israel, which permeates just about all the Hebrew prophets).. Jesus suggested that John the Baptist (his cousin) was the re-incarnated Elijah. Both Moses (the Law) and Elijah (the Prophets) were seen discussing weighty matters with Jesus just before he was killed That most apocalyptic of all the apocalyptic books in the Christian bible – Revelation – talks about two witnesses who defend themselves with plagues (think Moses) and fire from heaven (think Elijah) in what seems to be the Last Days. They are killed and for a short period, they lie dead in the street (the voice of the Law and the Prophets is killed off) but then they are taken up into heaven See the connection? By the time Eli wanders into town very few people can read anything at all, let alone the bible. Carnegie wants the power that the words of the bible will give him over other people. Or, as David Stratton puts it, ""It seems that after the unspecified apocalypse, angry survivors destroyed copies of the bible, believing it to be responsible for the catastrophe... Carnegie, the evil representative for what passes as government in this part of the world wants it...he needs to control the minds as well as the bodies of his reluctant followers, and to do this he decided he needed a bible."" See a connection with another earthly ruler who sought to trade the favours of the kingdoms of this world for the power of the kingdom of heaven. Clue – the copy of ""Da Vinci Code"" that Carnegie rejects as lacking the power of the bible spells it out in great detail. Answer - that deal that Constantine made with the fourth century church decriminalised their activities and showered them with favours (Dante in his ""Divine Comedy"" calls it the Gift of Constantine) in exchange for their allegiance to, and acceptance of, his rule over the very unruly Roman Empire. Elijah refused to make deals with King Ahab Eli refuses to make deals with Carnegie. The ""Book of Eli"" is aimed at fundamentalist Christian audiences who believe in the right to bear arms"" – David Stratton. No David.

Carnegie got played by Eli, Carnegie lost almost everything to get a fancy braille bible he couldn't even use lol. Thankfully Eli had memorized the bible & was able to dictate it to Lombardi before he passed away.It was sad though even Eli completed his mission, but he died shortly after.

227,E-un,Most Misunderstood Movie Of The Year?,8,20 June 2010,"As an atheist you might expect me to be completely against this movie. Some have pointed to its Christian content as pure unadulterated evangelism. Sure, the lead protagonist does hear ""voices"" telling him to take the ""book"" west, but that's pretty much were it ends. While there is a hint that he has an invisible force-field protecting him, it becomes apparent that it is his faith alone that carries him on. And that, folks, is really what the movie is about: faith in the face of constant danger and almost certain death. In a world where most people have taken to either taking advantage of the weak, or settling for whatever they can get, he presses on with his mission. And, even if I do hold that the ""book"" is nothing but a collection of fairy stories, it still holds great historical meaning to our race as a whole; just as much as, say, the works of Shakespeare or Mozart. The fact that it is responsible for so much suffering means it should be saved, to serve as a warning to the future, possibly.Ultimately, this is just a story being told of an improbable future. There are plot holes aplenty for sure, but no movie ever gets the apocalypse quite right anyway. The clichés and the idea that one man can down 20 in a stand up fight take some cake too, but I can get past that, even if the ghost of a certain Mel Gibson character does come to mind a little too frequently. And there is a certain point where the story has dragged for a little too long and the viewer wants to get it over with. That's something a lot of movies suffer from these days. I also have to wonder if the writers saw flashbacks from The Fifth Element when Oldman finally opens the ""book"". I certainly did, though I was pleasantly surprised by the reveal as it wasn't anywhere near as obvious as it could have been.So, all in all, I quite enjoyed this little romp. It didn't quite prepare me for Armageddon as much as The Road did but it filled an evening with some popcorn-type entertainment.",The Book of Eli
228,formicidae,Disappointing,5,17 January 2010,"The Book of Eli was getting some poor critical reviews, so I went to see it with pretty low expectations. They probably weren't quite low enough, because I still came away disappointed/disgusted with what I thought was a poorly constructed post-apocalyptic world, and a storyline that was fairly ridiculous. To avoid attaching spoilers, I will simply say that some plot developments are very difficult to accept, and for me, ruined whatever attempt at realism the movie was attempting to portray.I think the cinematography is appropriate (lots of washed out, grainy scenes of bleakness), and sufficiently compelling to earn some points. The acting is solid, and for the most part, the dialogue isn't offensively bad.Where the movie just completely runs off the rails for me is in the unlikely behaviour of virtually every character we are introduced to, including Eli himself. Nobody seems to respond realistically to any situation they find themselves in, and as such, I found it hard to buy into the notion that they would have actually survived more than a month in this post-apocalyptic world, let alone years. The intentionally ridiculous comedy ""Zombieland"" had more believable characters than this solemn tale.It could have been so much more. 5/10",The Book of Eli
229,neacorp,"Better than The Road, but still a terrible movie.",1,13 August 2011,"I watched The Road before this. This film is an improvement, but it's still a terrible movie. If you are other than a devoted Christian you will hate this film for the amount of gospel it tries to pull on you. There is almost nothing otherwise to see here.Let's get something straight – the big reveal in the end that Eli is blind is ridicules and him retelling the bible word for word, because he lost it, is just offensive. You literally made a movie about Daredevil being a zealot in post apocalypse, which is practically a western. I've seen far better movies about butt kicking blind people and this movie is not on par with them.Eli is a horrible person. In the first 15 minutes he kills a cat, murders a pacified assaulter, doesn't intervene to stop a rape, all while mumbling that he is on a mission from god. I my opinion he's just a suicidal mad hypocrite. The premise for the books importance is laughable. The quotes are typical and bland. But his Ipod still works and has good music on it.No movie relies to pass so much bull for us to take it up as faith. Every time Eli shoots a gun or listens to music, tough he ""blinds"" himself, he still has perfect reaction and aim. His enemies armed with superior weapons always miss. The leader lost most of his guys, but just lets Eli walk away while having a good shot at him. The bad guys have cars, but need hours to catch up to him on foot, while he walks in circles because he runs into the same gang of scum TWICE.The movie clearly hates old people and proclaims that shaky hands are the result of you being a cannibal... Why?! And why must modern apocalypse movies be shot in brown and gray with heavy shadows? It makes the movies bland and fake, clearly hiding CGI. Good apocalypse films like the Mad Max trilogy don't need such filters.The main villain was pathetic. He likes to read, but burns anything he doesn't like, rather than collect to sell to others. His reasoning to go through so much loss to find the good book – he needs its word manipulation to conquer the dispirit minds. Dude, do what so many have done before you – make up a new religion based on the old teachings, by pulling words out of your **** and guns! This is literally a no brainer! I wonder what he would have done if he found the Koran first? This degrades the tension in the movie a lot.Uh. Terrible. Just terrible. It isn't the worst movie (The Road tops that easy), but it's still terrible.A movie about losing faith so much they would hunt religious texts into the ground would be better, as it's rebellious. A movie about making the good book as the sole savior of all that is good in man is an ancient, forced upon you, tale.You know what would be funny? If somebody just wanted to play a prank on Eli, whispered in his ear that they were god, gave him a random book and send him of into the desert.

Wait for a sec wouldn't that mean double standards if denzel's character follow's through his task he would create another holy war which caused the nuclear warfare in the first place.

Well, in that case, it was a great Mad Max-style post-apocalyptic action movie. How I do love those? One of the amazing things about this Book Eli carries around is that it can be used selectively to serve just about any purpose (just read Uncle Tom's Cabin). The movie does make this point well I think, but clearly, it strays from what might be considered the message of the Gospels. I'm just saying! Nevertheless, it was definitely a step up from Waterworld...though a step down from 'The Road.' Denzel does love to play those detached, withdrawn, yet stoically purposeful roles, and always does a great job. I never thought of him as a martial arts expert though, but he seems to pull it off.

But The Book Of Eli doesn't exactly throw Christianity in your face. In fact, it's a good while until you figure out that the movie has a religious theme.The action starts pretty quickly, it's at around the ten minute mark that it really gets going with one of a fair few of epic fight scenes. Not what I expected from a movie rated 15 and, as I later realised, sometimes out of the blue and unexpected in certain scenes.I'm not going to reel off a massive plot synopsis, I'm sure if you really wanted to know you could search for one. Basically, Washington is heading west because he believes he's been told to by a higher force. He's in possession of some kind of important and significant book, and people try to prevent him from completing his mission. That's the best synopsis I can give you without revealing too much of the plot.What struck me most about this movie is that even as I was watching it, I knew that this was one of those movies you have to watch more than once. There were just these little things that just make you think something else is going on here plot-wise.Washington and Oldman are brilliant as usual and Mila Kunis makes sure the offers will come flooding in after this release.

236,jgregg42,The Book of Eli - An old west tale set in an apocalyptic future,7,15 January 2010,"I am always hesitant when movies come out in January or February. The Oscar buzz is about last year's performances and the summer blockbusters are still five months away. So, when movies come out this time of the year there is a distinct possibility that the movie is going to have a weak story line and sub par acting. This is not the case with ""The Book of Eli."" For a January movie — it exceeded my expectations.I have respect for both Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman and their choice of past roles. Gary's role in this film was that of the old bad guy running a small western front town 30 years after a nuclear war (I am assuming it was nuclear war, they only vaguely described what happened). He sends his traveling bandits out of town to find the last Bible on earth. He does this because with the last Bible on earth he can reestablish civilization under his reign. It does seem far-fetched but then again it is a January movie so I will cut it some slack. Gary did a great job, reminded me a little of his bad guy character in ""The Professional,"" but he wasn't over the top with his acting, only when he needed to be.On to Denzel, who did another great job. He reminded me of Clint Eastwood in his western movies where he didn't say much because he didn't have to. Denzel's actions spoke for him. That leads us into the action sequences. The Hughes Brothers delivered the action with a wallop and without a lot of blood and guts. The first fight scene looked like five silhouettes fighting a shadow of a man. There's also a shoot out scene where they used some pretty innovative camera shots to put the viewer into the action. The action was quick and to the point and just as important, it was memorable.We covered the actors and the action, so what about the story? The story could have taken place in the Old West just as it could have taken place in an apocalyptic future. It was simple and didn't have many confusing elements to it. The premise was to get that Bible. Denzel's job was to head west to deliver the last copy of the Bible to someone. He does everything in his power to protect the book. Since the Bible is the main focus of the hunt there are some religious overtones but nothing too heavy. There is also a good use of humor, something totally unexpected considering the drabness of the film.The camera helped in telling much of the story. Through much of the movie the camera and landscape was all that was needed to carry key elements in the story. In one scene Mila Kunis' character was attacked and instead of talking about it afterward, the camera took time to focus on her reaction to the situation. There are also several shots of Denzel walking in the desolation showing the audience the ruined landscape. Dialogue couldn't have added much more.Should you see this movie? Yes. Even though it won't get Oscar nods or be the next big summer blockbuster, it will still keep most people entertained. The ending might make you want to see it a second time to see what you missed the first time. All I am saying is keep your eyes open.",The Book of Eli

Reading a lot of the nonsense on here is just too depressing, as it just demonstrates the sad, sad state of our nation. The truth is, there are some people who will get their little pacifier-sucking feelings hurt and offended if a movie even hints at the existence of God or that the Bible is really a divine book, because they will immediately think there is some sort of 'religious agenda' or it's just 'religious propaganda' or the creators of the movie are trying to cram religion down their throats, etc. Ignore the complainers and watch this movie.

Washington is convincing as a man making his way across the country in a post- apocalyptic world carrying the Bible. I will not throw out spoilers, but we figure out early he's a morally good person on some sort of a mission, or as morally good as one can be trying to survive in a 'Mad Max' world where he has to constantly kill and defend himself against ravenous thug- like scavengers. Oldman, as usual, plays a great bad guy as the villainous 'Carnegie'. But the real star of the show is Jennifer Beals, in my opinion. She plays the blind 'Claudia', Carnegie's tortured girlfriend. Not a stretch to say this is her best role to date, and she still looks great after all of these years. As an action movie, there's plenty of it. Washington is fantastic in the fighting/shooting scenes and the atmosphere of the movie is very effective, giving us the feel of a depressing, disintegrating world where people are just hanging on, trying to survive in a sun- parched desolate land crawling with bad people, doing bad things with no real law to keep them in check. One interesting part was when Washington gives a humbling statement to Mila Kunis' character about the state of the world before the apocalypse and after by telling her, 'People had more than they needed. We had no idea what was precious and what wasn't. We threw away things people kill each other for now.' Pretty profound words that the current population could learn from, but the folks that found this movie offensive because of the whole God/Bible element probably found something wrong with that statement too...(sigh). Anyhow, watch the movie when it comes across HBO or Showtime, it's very enjoyable.",The Book of Eli
238,sixbells99,Washington does post Apocalyptic Ninja with great effect!,7,4 July 2010,"If you are older enough to remember the early 80's home video craze, a video shop on every corner, you'll remember the shop windows covered with posters of post apocalyptic films. Glance your eyes across any shelf; you will see titles with tag lines such as ""after the world of Mad Max came the death warriors!"" The video covers normally had the hero, artist drawn, with exaggerated muscles, with an equally exaggerated heroine by his side, with a background of fire and a generous helping of mutant zombie faces scattered in random places. I never used to like turning the cover to see the back where you were presented with still imagines of the film, they never lived up to the cover. The book of Eli is a little like looking at the cover of the video turning over and being disappointed with the real action.The film offers an incredible cast, Gary Oldman back as a villain, Washington who has never had a bad role, set in a bleak future. The idea is mouth watering, however don't be fooled, this is not an Oscar wining master piece. Instead what you get is a rip roaring polished gem of a film that harks back to holocaust film of the 1980's.It's a flawed film, some ropy dialogue and forced scenes, not to mention the at times Texas chain saw editing, which cuts out whole plots, one second a person is locked away and 3 scenes later they are back, with no logic on how they escaped. The main plot is more cheesy than cheddar and will absolutely offend a large group of people. Also in the post Apocalyptic world, the hairdressers and makeup artist were obviously treated with sainthood. As every female character in the film could turn to camera and say "" I'm worth it"". This doesn't quite fit when most of the characters we meet have their teeth dropping out.But this isn't a serious film, this is a comic book film set with enough violence and twists to keep you watching until the end. As Holocaust films go this is the citizen cane of entertainment, it has more than a hint of madmax with a strong western feel.Take it as a cheesy high class 1980's style Holocaust film and you'll love, take it too seriously and you will be disappointed.",The Book of Eli
239,jmcginn174,A masterpiece in film making.,10,16 June 2011,"Let me first say I am by no means religious. In fact I would define my self as agnostic. I believe there is a higher power, I just don't believe in organized religion. I don't believe you need a church or a book to believe in a god or a higher power. I think all you need is faith, and that comes from within. Now I have no ill will toward religion as a whole. It can be used for great good. Giving people without hope, hope. Giving people the will to live and helping people do great things for the benefit of humanity. It can also used for great evil as all religions have done throughout the centuries, and I think that is ultimately the message I think the film conveys.The Book of Eli is a religious movie that hides behind a post apocalyptic, western theme. Which follows Eli(Denzel Washington) as he wanders the wasteland heading west carrying the last remaining bible looking for the right person to give it to. On his journey west he comes to a town run by Carnegie(Gary Oldman) who so happens to be looking for a copy of the bible, so he can use it for his own means. Which puts the two at odds with each other, and with the add of Solara(Mila Kunis) the two go on the run. The climax and the twist near the end you will never see coming.The acting was brilliant. Washington and Oldman as usual do outstanding jobs. The supporting cast did a great job from Mila Kunis(who I thought was great.) to Ray Stevenson(Punisher: War Zone), Jennifer Beals(Lie To Me), and Malcolm McDowell(Heros and Fall Out 3).The visuals were superbly done giving life to the post apocalyptic world. You can imagine that's what the world would look like after a nuclear war, though they never say what caused the world to come to be except a war.The directing by the The Hughes Brothers was well done. They haven't directed many movies. The only other one of their movies I've seen is From Hell which I personally loved. So from the two movies I've seen of theirs they are really good directors who should get more work.Overall this is the best film I've seen since Zombieland, and unlike the other recent movies I've seen The Book of Eli blends story with a message, acting, action, directing, and visuals perfectly. Out of all the movies out there right now this is by far the best, and I highly recommend it, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",The Book of Eli
240,accountcrapper,Brings a whole new meaning to the phrase Bible Basher!!,4,13 November 2010,"Not great but it did have a sustained atmosphere. The message was very heavy handed. The music was brooding but good for the most part. The acting was professional although there was not much scope for drama. Carrying out or reacting to violence, general brooding, being withdrawn or cold was about the extent of the acting needed. The lighting uses a gel of some kind to bath the whole film in a dusky sand. It can be annoying at times and doesn't seem to work as well with certain shots.The staging is solid.The basic premise of the film is a bit obnoxious. It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase Bible Basher. The end of the film is the weakest. It will annoy most that it is deemed more important that a Bible survive than the printing press that has to reprint it. Any half witted twit would see that the survival of a printing press is more important that any particular book. All in all a mixed message from the film. It is more b-movie slock than blockbuster and more propaganda than art house. So you could call it b-movie propaganda and you might not be too far off. Although not a great film it does have a well presented general atmosphere and for that I give it a 6. I dislike the Christian basis personally so I take away 2 for obnoxious plot. Overall I give it a 4.",The Book of Eli
241,Elain-ee,"""Savagery is the way of all men and only God can save 'em""",3,7 August 2018,"...is what this movie wants us to believe. It strides off boldly in that direction without a second's reflection of its basic, flawed assumption that people are feral, rapacious, murderous and greedier than the worst animals are. Opening scenes show us women who willingly collude with misogynistic highway robbers, men killing each other for water and a supposed bible basher slaughtering a dozen people at a time. The 'hero' doesn't intervene when someone else's neck is on the line, though - for example, when a couple is being beaten and raped - oh no, fulfilling his quest is more important! Presumably, the additional message here is that preserving the alleged word of God is more important than the lives of innocent men and women, who are mere pawns in the quest to ensure 'something greater' survives. What could be greater than the human mind that creates these stories? Isn't destroying people to preserve a stupid book what countless inquisitors and jihadis believe to be right? How is putting a book above human lives meant to make the world a better place, when it apparently led to the near-annihilation of the human race just 30 years earlier? None of these questions are addressed or even asked. Many of the other assumptions that are made in this film are so gross, it seems like they must have come from someone who was raised with no other education aside from the bible. People never thought of sitting down and sharing food before the bible was written? Seriously?? Ancient artefacts from Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Meso America and all across the planet would beg to differ. Even monkeys and gorillas share their food, for crying out loud (even dogs do). Countless other civilizations have managed to survive huge calamities and upheavals and survive, without a bible. The directors ought to crack open a real history book sometime. They may be pleasantly surprised what they find there. I've personally also seen better use of this sort of black n white scenery in other graphic novel adaptations, like for instance, Sin City.",The Book of Eli
242,Caribstu,Confused?,6,15 June 2010,"This is a strange one. I sort of liked the film but it didn't grab me, yet at the same time it's left me thinking about the whole concept which I'll get to at the end.Eli is a traveller, in a post apocalyptic world. It's dark and almost uninhabitable, directors the Hughes brothers bring a well worked arid and desperate atmosphere, much like in The Road. Eli, played by Denzel, is making his way west across the land, where to? He doesn't know. Why? We don't know. Avoiding road gangs of thieves and murderers until he reaches a small town run by Gary Oldman.No need to guess he's a bad guy, as soon as you see Gary Oldman's name in a cast list you know he'll be the archetypal narcissist villain. We learn that Denzel is carrying the last King James Bible on the planet,( this being an American film set in America the World clearly ends at the borders of the USA and we are left to assume it represents the rest of the planet) and Oldman want's it for his own dictatorial power.From here you can fill in the blanks, there's no real surprises ( other than seeing two English actors, Francis De la Tour and Michael Gambon out in the middle of the Utah desert ) but apart from that the film follows a fairly predictable path, lots of poor continuity mistakes with a slight twist at the end, which although it was a twist, in itself it was predictable that there would be a twist.So, it's well acted, good sets and costume design, well produced atmosphere, some great cinematography and not at all heavy handed with the CGI, even a cameo from Tom Waits. But it's not a fantastic film it sort of drifts toward the metaphorical blue sky at the end and lacks a punch.Now we get to the concept I mentioned at the start. What I don't understand fully is the concept of a Hollywood film about the Bible. Normally Hollywood is so anti Christian it's almost it's own religion, sure they'll make movies about God and Angels and Demons but Christianity or the Bible? The character of Eli says "" some people believe this book caused the war"" and yet here he is doing everything possible to preserve the Bible. Is the film saying that man is so foolish he would allow religion to end the world and then preserve the same religion to do it all again? Or is it saying that even in a time of abject disaster for mankind, there's still hope because there's still God and the Bible is the word of God? I believe, due to some of the events which occur to the characters in the film, that it's actually the later the film is saying. Hope. There's always hope and there's always God's word. And that's what I'm having a tough time getting my head round, a Hollywood film promoting the goodness of God and the sanctity of the Holy Bible? I never thought I'd see the day.6/10",The Book of Eli
243,dimitrisalomao,Good!,7,23 March 2010,"This is a movie for people that, at least, believe in God, so if you don't believe, or don't like Christianity, you'll be very disappointed with this film, although you may admire it's action scenes.Eli (Denzel Washington) has been on a journey for 30 years, walking west across America after a cataclysmic war that turned the earth into a total wasteland. After the war and the ""Big Flash"", Eli was guided by a higher power to a hidden book and given the task of protecting the book and taking it to its final destination. Eli guards the book with his life, because he knows that the book is the only hope that humanity has for its future.The cinematography of this movie is extremely well made, and has some great takes, like the first expectacular fight scene where we only see their silhouettes, or when Carnegie opens the book for the first time, and we see how the lock works (Which remembered me of David Fincher's ""Panic room""). But some unnecessary shots, like the first scene where the bow splits the dust (Which is there for no reason).The Hughes Brothers's direction is very stylish and sometimes elegant, we can see that by noticing that they don't spent a lot of time explaining why the world is like that, that would take a lot of time and was not really necessary.The acting is brilliant, which is almost superfluous considering that the main characters are played by Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman, but there was some surprises, like the short appearance of the old couple Martha and George, that although seem that they were there for nothing, it was good just to have funny scenes, like when someone asks Martha what they were going to do, and she answers ""I know what the @$#% I'm doing!"".Although the movie has some great scenes where Eli is reading the book to Solara, it has some clichés, like when he says that what he learned from the book is that he should care abut others more than he cares for himself. It can be true, but he just could say another teaching, one that we haven't heard.Verdict: Run away if you don't like biblical messages, but if you do, you'll not be disappointed.",The Book of Eli
244,MisterMxyzptlk,By the book.,6,31 August 2010,"Here's another bleak, filtered and cold post apocalyptic tale wonderfully directed but poorly delivered by the infamous Hughes Brothers. Like all the recent adaptations of showcasing the demise of the human race, this one is no different. The film starts off intriguing enough, but never expands on the idea behind it. It's a western tale we are familiar with. And when the third act begins, we have already predicted the outcome and patiently wait for the story to arrive there. This is the moment in the story which loses all tension and conflict. We see the sacrifice early on and we don't buy the haphazard shell game that they try to impress you with. Still, the choreography is dead on, the acting highly capable. A strong cast rounds out what turns out to be a bleak film, that raises interesting ideas and thoughts, but leaves it there because they were to afraid to be answered.",The Book of Eli
245,newguy85,Pleasantly Surprised,7,19 January 2010,"I knew the punchline to the film from the second I saw the preview: The world has ended, and a man is tasked to take the Bible westward. The twist at the end was a pleasant surprise, but I realize now that I was tired, and there were plenty of hints as to the condition of our protagonist.I loved the message of the movie: that the Bible is a powerful tool depending on who's hands it's in. Carnegie is the metaphor of an imperialistic government who would use the Bible to control men. Eli is the metaphor of free choice, and how through faith, the Bible can be inspiring, and restore order to a world of lost people.Many people will bash the religious themes, and will be quick to point out the irony of a man on a task from God that goes around killing people. The truth is, he does kill a lot of folks, but in self-defense. However there is a rape scene that Eli does not stop. He says later in the movie ""there's always a choice"". Well, man is fallible, and he chose not to step up and do the right thing. Had he defended the woman, the ""rogues"" would have been stopped there. Instead, he got into a conflict with them at the bar, and ended up killing more people than just the rogues.Overall the acting was pretty stilted, as well as the dialogue. I also feel like they could've developed Carnegie's number one a little further, but they never did. I also think that as beautiful as Kunis is, I will never picture her as anything but Meg, so it's hard to take her seriously when I picture that.Washington and Oldman were great as two men opposing one another idealogically and physically, and were presented in a perfect contrast. Eli was calm, cool, and collected. Carnegie was skittish, and manic.Had the dialogue done more to progress the journey and demonstrate the two views of how the Bible should be used (as a weapon or as a tool to inspire the masses), I would have rated it higher. As it stands this was just a basic post-apocolyptic action film with a refreshing theme that is rarely seen in mainstream Hollywood.",The Book of Eli

Hollywood seems to be scared of making such films without adding a cheesy element or humour which rudely brings me back to the real world reminding me that its only a story. good directing to achieve this with a limited story and very limited script.i have to say the story could have been so much more and gary oldmans talents were wasted on the simple character he played.amazing to watch once at the cinema but but i think it might be ruined if i watched it again on DVD.well worth seeing on the big screen.",The Book of Eli
247,sraweber369,A well photographed film with some story holes,5,25 May 2011,"A stylish post apocalyptic western The Book of Eli looks good on film even though there are many holes in the films plausibility. A story of a man with a mission from God to make a quest to the west to deliver an important book.Denzel Washington plays Eli a man of incredible faith and some good skills with weapons and knowledge of how to fight. Is taking an important text with him which he is willing to fight and die for so that it stays protected along the way he meets Carnegie(Gary Oldman) who wants the book at all costs believing it will give him power to control people. Along the way Eli picks up a fellow traveler Solara(Mila Kunis) who becomes his partner. Along the way there are many action sequences that keep the film rolling at decent pace.The Good: I like the cinematography the western landscape devoid of color this film could have been filmed in black and white. The pictorial contrast is fantastic great photography. Another good point of the film is the acting of Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman they really make the film enjoyable to watch.The Bad: Many unexplained impossible things happen, where do they get fuel for the vehicles, how do they keep getting new sunglasses. Many others. Mila Kunis is badly cast and looks way to g;am for the setting.

250,Dory_Darko,"Gritty, uncompromising and grossly underrated.",10,17 April 2011,"The Book of Eli is one of those films that, at first glance, doesn't offer a terribly thrilling premise: a post-apocalyptic world, a lone wolf who fights for whatever is left of the good of mankind, and the young, naive and somewhat annoying girl he reluctantly takes under his wing. And of course, the bad guy. Sure, there are many more films like this you can find at any local video store.However, when you put two acting grandmasters like Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman head to head, you already know you're in for a treat. And in that respect, ""Eli"" absolutely delivers. Denzel Washington, in the role of Eli, does what he does best: he delivers his most perfect rough-around-the-edges, I'm-a-good-guy-but-I-don't-care routine we all know and love. He is a hard knock alright, and he has absolutely no problem whatsoever severing a few of your body parts if you get in his way. But he is still good to the core, one of the few decent human beings left in a world forsaken of decency. All you need to do to know this is look in his eyes, because the warmth and charisma Washington possesses say it all, even if he is completely covered in scar tissue.And then there's Gary Oldman. Good old Gary Oldman. I have to say, it's really nice to see him play a stone cold, heartless scumbag once again, especially after his soft good guy role in Batman, where he was almost dorky – to no fault of his own of course, but still. This man deserves to get every inch of space to act freely, and thank goodness, the Hughes brothers allowed him exactly that. He plays a sort of mob boss, the self-appointed leader of a dingy little town and owner of the bar. He beats his wife, prostitutes his stepdaughter and he does it smiling. He is the most filthy kind of evil, absolutely rotten and loving it. Why? We don't know. He's just a bastard, and that's that.Which is another thing I really like about this film, even though I realize many other people might actually hate it: it offers absolutely no motives, no answers, no explanations to anything, no bite size plot lines, nothing. There's no intro, no voice-over telling you where we are and what's going on. Only half-way through the film there is a scene with Eli and Solara (played by Mila Kunis) where he tells her a little bit about his life, but that's it. Like I said, some people might hate this, so if you are the kind of person who likes a formula-driven action flick with catchy punch lines and nothing to think about, this is not the film for you.I would also like to make a little note on Mila Kunis. I must admit, I first had some doubts about her taking on a genre like this (although I was impressed with her performance in Black Swan, but that's a completely different kind of film, and other than that I only know her from That 70's Show), and throughout her first couple of scenes, she didn't do much to remove those doubts. However, as the film progressed, she got her act together and in the end, delivered a credible performance.The visuals are stunning from start to finish. If you are a fan of the new, Frank Miller type of film style with high contrast colours and surreal scenery, you really need to see this. The bleak colours and images of darkness set against a really bright sky make the atmosphere heavy and haunting, making the anxiety of the characters almost tangible. You can just feel dryness, the desert, the hunger and the thirst. The western-like scenery of the town with the ""saloon"" at the heart of it, only adds to that sensation.Another thing I'd like to mention is a quality not many modern-day films possess: the lost art of being silent. It is very rare for a film in this genre to simply be so... still. There is no dialogue except where it's absolutely necessary, and even the music is only used to actually add something to the scenes, but never as filler. The absence of sound here is just as important as its presence. Perfect.On a similar note, the final credits go to Atticus Ross, who created an absolutely magnificent soundtrack, with music that sounds somewhat like the hybrid lovechild of Trent Reznor and Thom Yorke. It's just stellar and truly adds (emotional) value to every scene.Finally, I'm not going to tell you what the story is about, I will simply recommend that you go into it with an open mind and no prior knowledge. That's what I did and it worked perfectly. (I will only say that you really need to stick around for the awesome, slap-in-the-face plot twist at the end!)Of course it's not the best film ever made, but I still give it a 10, simply because it's beautiful, it's cool and it delivers a few excellent and satisfactory action scenes. And because it's been a really long time since I have downloaded a soundtrack immediately after seeing the film.Original? No. Eye-candy? Absolutely.Go see it.",The Book of Eli
251,jhuni_x,Watch this if you are a Christian that likes post-apocalypse films,5,24 January 2010,"The apocalyptic theme has been thoroughly explored: the Fallout games, Water-world, I am Legend, Mad Max, Children of Men, and so on. The bartering, the subjugation of women, the ""evil biker gangs"", and the resource shortages are all too familiar, such that their cinematic appeal has diminished. What makes this film exceptional is the fact that the protagonist is a blind Christian man who is willing to kill to protect his braille bible.This movie is essentially a fantasy movie. First of all, bibles have become a very scarce resource, even though in reality the bible is one of the most printed books in history. Besides that, there are countless digital copies of the Bible which could be accessed with electronics such as the electronic music player Eli possessed. Instead, in this fictional reality, all of the copies of the bible got wiped out, and somehow a braille bible just happened to be laying underneath the rubble and Eli just happened to find it.Furthermore, Eli initiates several unrealistic battle scenes where he single-handedly defeats many opponents at once, even though he is old and blind. Some people have said that perhaps Eli had the ""hand of god"" supporting him, after all, he apparently heard some sort of voice which lead him in a basically pointless 30 year journey across America. I also find this religious element to be unrealistic, why would god create an apocalypse or support someone like Eli who killed countless people. Doesn't it say somewhere in the Bible: ""though shall not kill""? In addition to this, are we supposed to come out of these movie thinking Eli is a good person, even though he killed countless people over a braille bible?In conclusion, it can be quite stunning to realize Eli's blindness and how this explains so many scenes of the movie. This and other parts of the movie were certainly somewhat good, however, when I reconcile those good scenes with all those parts of these movie that were religious or confusing, I end up with a 5/10.",The Book of Eli
252,SubZeroMK,The Book of rELIgion is pretty good,7,21 January 2010,"As an atheist, the only two things that bothered me in the movie was the fact that he would save humanity with the bible. I mean, he even said that the war with ""the flash"" was caused by religion. So why re-introduce it again? Because god told him to, that's just nonsense. It's Christian to think that way. Because a voice within you tells you, God guides you. So if god told you to blow up a community center, you would blindly do it? This film certainly proves that point.I guess it's understandable for where he took the book, to a big library on Alcatraz island in San Fransisco, where they have all kinds of books on science and culture to remake civilization. I'm just saying, if religion caused the world to be in such circumstances, why make the same mistake again? The second thing that bothered me was the fact that Eli was blind throughout the whole movie. Somehow, he knew his way around a dead end in the middle of a bridge that is steep to death. I guess I should have noticed since he was wearing shades the whole time, which is pretty good how they all fooled us at the end where they reveal he's either blind in one eye, or both. Well, the book pages of the bible were the first revelation that he was blind. Brail language to be read with sensitive finger tips.Interesting movie, great character development on Eli, and even the sexy Mila Kunis, and Gary Oldman is always gonna be a guaranteed 3-dimensional character, he pulls it off so nice. The action was great, felt like a Transporter movie meets Afro Samurai. Some comic relief in there too, which was a good laugh. Love the overall background of the world after the nuclear holocaust, the wasteland, the green sky is just beautiful. And whether you like it or not, some of this movie is definitely from the FALLOUT game..just the look and survival aspects of the movie, especially the line ""people now would kill for what people would throw away back in the day"" that's a given in a Fallout game. I'm not saying it's a rip-off, it's great! If it didn't have the religious factor added to it, I would have given it a 9.5-10 out of 10. If I was Eli, I would rewrite the book, and call it the book of Evolution & Logical Thinking. It would take moral and strategic thinking of everyday life plus evolution borrowing from Charles Darwin and Richard Dawkins, and god or Jesus, or religion would not be included in the book..no term, word or phrase would be written. People would learn and we would not cause the same mistake again.",The Book of Eli

The story was so rich, and it was about the post apocalyptic world and quests one must take in order to survive. Fallout 2. The theme of the future world gone down the drains, turned to dust, cannibalism and slavery is ever present still. You got all of that right here in this film of Eli. The concept was made to stand strong on the sole state that future people have forgotten the meaning of the good word, and chose to live from day to day, without any hope what so ever. Of course, the antagonist in this film needs to find a special book to capture the hearts and minds of the people, therefore make it easier for him to master over them. Interesting view of the world, but no other story beyond that I'm afraid. Its a movie with a man on a mission, and just like in every other PC game, he is the key to finishing the last level. The last sequences of Mila Kunis copying Resident Evil, didn't bode well with my intentions to view something unique and original.

255,guasco-2,So many butthurt people who rate it 1 because they hate faith,9,17 August 2019,"It's obvious that all these one star reviews hate the religious themes of the film and so rate the movie unfairly low, in spite of the movie's fantastic acting, cinematography, direction, score, and script. Heck, even Ebert gave this movie 3/4 stars!People need their aggression against God to stop ""blinding them"" (pun intended) against a good film, such as this one.It's easy to hide your bias against religion when reviewing cheesy Christian films but when a good film gets made, promoting God, it's hard to hide said bias.Why is this film propaganda because Eli carries a Bible. If the film was about him carrying a textbook or Marxist literature, I have a feeling those same people wouldn't be calling the film propaganda then.Anyway, regardless of what you believe this is not the ""worst film of 2010.""

256,micz81,"Hey, it's better than Battlefield Earth!",2,28 February 2010,"It was almost pain to watch it. The plot reveals unnaturally, and unbelievably. But - surprisingly - still remains predictable. Oldman and Waits have here almost nothing to play, so you could paste any other actor in their places (but I have to say it - Oldman looks awesome in Mastroianni's sunglasses). Washington does his regular job of being extra-calm in every situation and lowering jaw without opening mouth. And Mila Kunis is just a casting mistake (there's nothing wrong with her acting skills - she just might be way to old for that role; Solara's lines and actions makes you ASSUME she's a girl, but... you SEE a woman and it's confusing realism-spoiler).So what to do with a flat plot? Nothing else than to direct it flat and film it in a showily hey-let's-put-camera-here-it's-so-cool style. Then in post-production we add some extra-grainy-desert look wishing to rescue the sets from being a card-board and we end up with pretentious ""Waterworld""-like movie with A Massage.And sad thing is that it COULD have been a good movie. Gary Oldman, Denzel Washington, Tom Waits.... That is MORE than enough for that purpose. I liked the whole concept too. Reusing this old symbolism (you can predict from the title of the movie, which symbolism I'm talking about) to create a modern tale. It worked fine with ""Matrix"", it could've worked here. Could've been refreshing. Not as refreshing as ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", but still better than nothing. Unfortunately directors Hughes Brothers and screenwriter Garry Whitta didn't manage to keep this ride entertaining and indoctrination began to emerge from deeps (where it belongs if it's clever) to absolutely flood the screen. But hey - it's better than ""Battlefield Earth"", right?PS: I recommend to buy the soundtrack - without the movie it's a good dark-mood material.",The Book of Eli

This is exactly how I would imagine a Fallout movie. 2) Solid action scenes (all of them). 3) Good suspense and excitement during the first 90% of the movie.Cons (what ruined it for me):1) The choice of the leading actress was dreadful and the whole character was annoying and shallow (and what's up with her wearing eye makeup.. come on..) 2) The whole concept of Eli being blind is simply too silly to swallow. Unless you are willing to accept everything that happens as ""Deus Ex Machina"". I cannot buy that he was partially blind either, as there must be a reason for why he has been walking across US for more than 30 years. 3) What probably irritated me the most was the scene in the end when they put the King James bible in the bookshelf next to Torah. They could at least have save him the time and trouble (remember, the poor guy was dying) to recite the Old Testament.",The Book of Eli
258,hendry-robert,The anti Christians are out in force,7,6 June 2010,"I really have to pity the venom spouting from the anti religionists and faith void reviewers. These people completely fail to realise that their own fanatical non belief in faith (of whatever kind) religious or not is in fact a religion its self reaching fanatical proportions in the west. They believe humankind (sic: I should say Christians) are inherently bad and the cause of all evils in the world. They of course pick on Christians because they are cowards and Christians are easy targets. The other prominent religious believers turn their words in to action so the anti religious brigade never criticise the other religion. Its a very typical trait of the western atheist who are in fact simply haters of all human beings but in particular their hatred towards people of the Christian faith knows no bounds.I am not a religious person, but what I do have is faith in human nature, my self, the universe, the cosmic winds or whatever else you may wish to add. I believe a world filled with humans who believe in nothing except for their own self fulfilment (Decadence in a nutshell) is a doomed world, or at least it would be an extremely miserable place to live. Life would become a thousand times more dispensable than it is now. Imagine tomorrow all humans were given indisputable proof that there was no higher being and when we die there is nothing. I don't believe humankind is ready for this knowledge, except for the haters of humankind. Millions upon millions would just think what is the point of life, and with that train of thought there would be no boundaries. They would do whatever they please and of course that would mean a lot of trouble and of course suffering. A world filled with 6 billion people who know for certain there is nothing after death is something the majority of this planets people are not ready for. Perhaps in 500-1000 years, maybe.The anti faith brigade would have us all believe that every bad thing man has done through out history is the fault of religion. I certainly don't deny that in the name of religion millions have died over the last 2000 years. But of course history proves without any shadow of a doubt that many many more millions have died because of political ideology which is always faithless and thats only over the last 100 years. Only humans kill each other and the less faith they have in humankind the more they kill. Stalin is a perfect example.As for the movie its self I thought it was reasonably enjoyable. Of course Denzels performance was sterling. He plays that silent hero character so well very much like he did in Man On Fire. Gary Oldman plays the bad guy equally as good. I would have liked to have seen a bit more character information. These can usually be achieved in only five or ten minutes of screen time. For example how did Washington survive, how did Oldman survive. What was the general state of the rest of the planet. Perhaps what started the war etc.Without giving any spoilers Oldman realises that this book is power. He and Washington are living in a world where a generation have grown up without the ability to read or write. Murderous activity is a daily occurrence in peoples lives. Oldman wants that book because he knows he can use it and gain more power and control more people. He is right of course and it has been used in such a way. But he would be using it a political tool motivated by his lust for power and control over people. Of course Washington has other plans.The point of the film was completely missed by the anti religious brigade. It isn't saying jump to the bible now and start reading, its simply saying how in certain situations one book could have the power to change the course of history and in the wrong hands not for the better. The other very important point completely missed by the anti brigade is in the very last scene of the film. Pay close attention to where the book is placed. This is a very important point and proves that this film wasn't made as a propaganda tool.As I read the anti reviews it brings home how obvious these people are. Their extreme hatred for Christians is particularly sad because it clearly shows they will pick on the weakest, the ones that wont fight back and isn't our history full of this. They never ever mention the Muslim religion because of course some of their followers put action to words. Their selective hatred is a clear sign to me that these people are nothing but bullying cowards. Its the same on Youtube. The atheists make their videos only ever screaming at Christians. Very sad people.In time if human beings are still around in a thousand years or so we could be ready for the knowledge. But right now we simply haven't evolved as a species to grasp the concept of nothingness. That is not a world I would like to live in right now.But enjoy the film, its basically a decent hour and half's worth of escapism.",The Book of Eli

260,jcdugger,A Mixed Bag...,7,18 January 2010,"The post-apocalyptic genre...my favorite genre by far! I believe the reason why it appeals so much to me (and others like me) is that it creates a non-industrialized world where every day brings a challenge in a struggle to survive. In the current world of bills, taxes, 40-hour work-weeks...and climbing that damn rope in gym class as a kid...it's appealing, almost relaxing in a sense, to get thrust into a world where simple survival is key...and losing your social security card wouldn't bother you in the least. Most people feel the world would be ""too hard"" without electricity, running water, health & public services and whatnot. But for someone where this genre appeals, like myself, the ""hard"" is exactly what is most appealing. To me, and others like me, scavenging, hunting, gathering and relying on survival skills trumps a life of perpetually going to school and work and eating Wendy's every stinking day! So when ""The Book of Eli"" was released in all of it's post-apocalyptic glory, you know I was there opening weekend! I knew going in that it was going to be about the Bible -- being a very non-religious person, that was highly unappealing -- but a post-apocalyptic movie is not to be missed, so I went.There was a lot to like about the movie. For the most part, it had the feel of a futuristic, barren landscape. It definitely serves its purpose for those who love post-apocalyptic themes. And some really creative touches were added...a ""A Boy and His Dog"" poster in the background, a dilapidated (but working) Ipod, and an old couple resorting to listening to a hand-crank record player. And there was a standout performance was from the fantastic Gary Oldman, playing Carnegie.On the flip side, I thought the dress could have been a bit more creative. Everybody - and I mean everybody - wore dark colored trench-coat style clothing. You would think somebody would scavenge a house and find, then wear, an old white Adidas sweatshirt every now and again! But, no, everybody was dressed as if they shopped at the same Army fatigues store. And it was difficult to tell at times if it was hot or cold. It appeared as if everybody was wearing heavy multi-layered clothing, there was a snow scene at the beginning, and fires to keep people warm were burning at many times. Yet, there was no vapor coming from anybody's breath, the wide shots of the highway seemed as if it was the middle of summer, and Mila Kunis had no problem wearing a thin one-piece sexy outfit (bare feet and all) in Eli's unheated hotel room.The biggest downer in the movie was the inconsistencies with Eli's character (aptly played by Denzel Washington). At one point, it appeared as if Eli was either Jesus or protected by God. He was fired at by one of Carnegie's henchmen at close range and the bullets seemed to turn to dust when it hit him. Then later, he gets successfully shot in the stomach...HUH?! (Eli then proceeds to patch himself up with some duct tape!) There are some points where Eli is clearly using his eyes...then you find out he's blind in the end! Smaller bad points include: A scene where it shows a malnourished cat...yet a nearby rat appeared plump and healthy. Water was ""the good stuff"" in Carnegie's city (supposedly because water was so impossible to come by)...yet Carnegie owned a spring that sprouted fresh drinking water. You would think a working spring would help alleviate the water problem a bit! At least to the point where whiskey would still be considered ""the good stuff"". Some of it was just a bit absurd if you think deeply about it.One last thing I would like to touch on was Mila Kunis. I just couldn't buy her as Solara. The IMDb trivia states Kristen Stewart was originally offered Mila's role...they should have done whatever it took to land Stewart. She has the face and body of somebody ""worn"" and would have fit in nicely in a post-apocalyptic world. Mila Kunis, on the other hand, looked like a beautiful Hollywood star that just walked out of the costume designer's room and onto the set. I don't think you can just ""dirty-up"" somebody that stunningly beautiful...and it didn't work here.But if you look past the inconsistencies in the story and with its characters, ""A Book of Eli"" is some good eye candy. Turn off your brain for a while and sink yourself into a world of no W-2 forms, no lobbyists and no Sarah Palin! Just imagine! :) If you want a ""Book of Eli"" type movie without all the bible-thumping and inconsistencies, I strongly recommend ""The Road"" starring Viggo Mortensen. That is my personal favorite post-apocalyptic movie. Thank you for reading! JD",The Book of Eli
261,rosanna-83335,God or the Devil?,6,18 August 2021,"The book of Eli is the story of a man who in a post apocalyptic world is journeying west to bring the Bible, apparently the last Bible on earth as if they could really know that, to a safe place where it would be shared. He fights 10 guys at a time and wins to protect his mission. But of course there is also the bad guy who also wants it to use as a means to control the masses (well what is left of them at least).I found it repetitive and boring. And sure there is a twist at the end but frankly it just makes it even less believable. .
Not only is it ridiculous that one guy is so good at so many things but that the whole story is based on the fact the Bible is meant to be the book that is meant to save the world. I mean what crap. I mean so many wars since religion is a thing (and I mean way before Christianity enterterd the scene) are because of religion. And the Bible has its fair blame. So to think that religion is going to save a world where most don't have clean water, food or shelter is pathetic. In a way the film did get it right, men will always be men, they will use religion to manipulate and control the masses like the bad guy wanted and all that it ends up doing is bringing death and destruction. And our hero who makes it to the end and accomplishes what he thinks is so vital, his precious book is just one of many saved things, something they just put on a shelf and don't give much more regards to than any other item in their collection. It shows in a way how religion and one book can be disproportionately seen and worshipped, and an importance given to itby those who believe but how the rest of the world are much more reasonable. Even within the film look at all the deaths caused by just one book written in a way that is meant to control people.It's funny, as I'm writing this review I'm thinking two things, 1 maybe the film isn't as bad as I had originally thought. I'm going to change my 4 to a 6 and 2. If I were someone who truly believe in the full Catholic version of hell and the devil and heaven and God, I would be starting to think that Jesus was the son of the Devil not God and the Bible was made by the devil talking to men not God. I mean when you see the destruction, hatred and death caused by religion and the Bible as well as all holy books then I can only think the devil must be very pleased to see so many ending up at his gates because they killed in the name of their religion. Sort of feels like something he would have planned. If you believe in that sort of thing of course.",The Book of Eli

It's a tale of a man who needs to get a book from Point A to Point B, no matter the cost. Religious overtones are afoot, so certain people have to know that going in. The scenery is dark, grim, and flush with yellow and orange, similar to an unknown and unexplained war. This barren landscape almost channel's Eli bleak and endless journey.Washington is great, as always, and Oldman always know how to channel his inner bad guy. However, we do get the obligatory twist at the end, which calls into question everything you've seen with Washington up until that point..

The look of the film works really well, the colours have been drained and it really captures the world in a complete mess with the help of some really cool FX..

266,revelinchaos,Denzel Washington takes up Costner's 'legacy' in The Postman II,4,14 February 2010,"LIGHT SPOILERSThe characters have zero (absolute) depth, and this alone is quite the remarkable feat on the writers/directors' part, considering they could count on actors such as Washington and Oldman... (and let's not forget about Malcolm 'clockwork' McDowell, relegated to an insignificant appearance). What do we get instead? Oldman - the archetypal bad guy: reads books about Mussolini and his only goal in life is to put his hands on a bible, because, of course, that's the ONLY WAY he can finally use religion to control people. What a joke (in both metaphorical and literal sense).Washington - the archetypal good guy: the righteous lone gunman/(butcher), whose most remarkable feature ends up being an absolutely absurd superhuman combat prowess with both blades and guns (combined with an inhuman eidetic memory...). Costner's postman character was 10 times more structured and credible in comparison (and that's telling).The story itself lacks any 'preparation', sense of credibility and perspective or real development to speak of. It all ends up being a series of fight/action scenes without any substantial and believable thread to link them. All the secondary characters lack even the most basic sense of depth and feel like cardboard cutouts.--------REAL SPOILERS--------The 'main' 'plot' elements: Eli is not your average ass kicking Joe, instead, he's... well, a Christian zealot ass kicking Joe, and the book he carries is, guess what, a bible... and god spoke unto him: ""go west"" (creepy). After the apocalypse, someone wiped out ALL the copies of THE book but one (guess whose). Somewhere during the movie we are told the nuclear showdown happened because of religion.So, based on these premises, my thought is that it is nothing short of demented to build an entire movie around the idea of a holy journey (crusade) to save religion itself from oblivion.What's the message? People have been fighting and slaughtering each other for past millennia over religion, but we never learn, do we? I read comments citing the 'religious factor' of this movie as an asset and as a positive metaphorical interpretation key. Well, frankly I do not see how someone could positively evaluate the misuse they make of Christian religion in this ""Action|Adventure|Drama|Sci-Fi|Thriller|Western"" movie, regardless of their personal faith or lack thereof.If you consider yourself a 'true' believer, then a guy who strolls around amputating fellow human beings with a machete while citing bible verses should definitely be a no no. While if you just don't care about religion, then you COULD even consider it funny (in a Tarantino-like kind of way), were it not for the seriousness(?) with which this element is treated and embedded into the plot(?) and which will likely prevent you from enjoying it.Let me tell you, there's nothing metaphoric in this. On the contrary, the writers/directors have materialized here their own crude (distasteful for some) and literal interpretations of biblical metaphors, such as psalm 91 (AKA the soldier's psalm).In my opinion, this is a movie that tries to be many things at the same time and miserably fails at each and every one. It's not a funny action movie; not a breathtaking thriller; not a spectacular sci-fi; and definitely not a western (but for the sloppy and utterly clichéd characters duality). Mediocre movie: a real shame considering all the wasted potential.",The Book of Eli
267,joelsmith190,"Pretty great, despite getting preachy at times",8,22 July 2015,"Book of Eli is a post-apocalyptic/Christian film starring Denzel Washington and Mila Kunis, where all of society and knowledge are wiped. Eli has the only Bible in existence and is trying to travel to a promised land in the west.I'm not one for watching religious films, but this one is surprisingly solid. Now I won't talk about religion for this review as I don't want to fill the entire review with my religious beliefs. Instead, I'll be judging on whether Book of Eli is good as a movie.BoE has great action sequences, though they are few and far between. The dialogue is well written, and the acting is solid. The sets feel weak and the characters use traditional weapons, which I feel shouldn't be in a post-apocalyptic film. People should use improvised weaponry, instead of everybody having shotguns and assault carbines. It just doesn't fit with the world BoE attempts to provide. The musical score is quite good.The story, outside of the religious motivation, is pretty cliché. Name a post-apocalyptic film that isn't about the protagonists reaching the promised land. It also has a few plot holes, which never get explained. It attempts to be gritty and such, but it tries too hard. There's barely any color in the film and every location looks and feels the same as the last. And it tries to have some wow factor, but fails outright.Book of Eli is a solid film, though it feels preachy and doesn't have enough imagination to make it a stunner. Book of Eli gets an 8/10. I'd be proud to have this on my shelves, though it has faults that can't be ignored just because of it being religious.﻿",The Book of Eli
268,MrPink08,DELIvers us from a dreary winter,7,9 February 2010,"Few things are hotter this winter than Mila Kunis walking around a post-apocalyptic town in a pair of Aviators. That and a quiet Denzel Washington wielding a sword sets up The Book of Eli, yet another post-apocalyptic thriller set in the future (or lack thereof). The post-apocalypse film may be getting old after films like Children of Men, The Road, I Am Legend, etc., but The Book of Eli manages to keep itself away from the cliché apocalypse film.Denzel portrays the title character of Eli, a mysterious man who walks around around a destroyed world carrying a book he believes can save humanity. He wanders into a makeshift town where a sadistic villain (Gary Oldman) desperately wants the book. Enter some hacked limbs, explosions, and cannibals, and you got yourself an interesting film.This is a different role for Denzel. Usually, he's just the calm talker who tries to make sure the bad guys don't do anything crazy (think Inside Man and last summer's remake of The Taking of Pelham 123). However, not only does Denzel do a lot of talking, but he's cutting off people's arms and shooting up the place like he's Jason Statham. One memorable scene involves Eli killing Oldman's men-who are armed with sniper rifles AB machine guns-with a simple handgun.It's also very refreshing to see Gary Oldman return to the role of a villain. Younger audiences now see Oldman as a good guy after portraying famous literary protagonists such as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films and Jim Gordon in the recent Batman series. While there's nothing at all wrong with that, I was starting to miss Oldman's villain days, including classic turns as a drug addicted cop in Leon The Professional and a Russian terrorist in Air Force One. Oldman shows his versatility in Eli, where he makes his character a complete psycho.When I first saw that Kunis was cast in this film, I was a little worried. Sure, everybody loves Mila, but could the star of comedies like That 70's Show and Forgetting Sarah Marshall make the transition in a serious film? Kunis plays her role well, but she should stick with the comedies until she's given a character with more to do.The Book of Eli isn't perfect with its choppy action sequences or pacing issues, but its a fun film nonetheless. It's films like these that keep the post-apocalyptic genre alive and well.",The Book of Eli

270,Thomasamills,The Hughes Brothers Latest Film Is A Freah Look On A Bleak Future,8,11 August 2011,"The latest offering from the Hughes Brothers (From Hell) comes in the form of The Book Of Eli. A post apocalyptic thriller staring Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman. In recent years, a whole load of post apocalyptic films have been released meaning the Hughes Brothers would have to give us something special to make it stand tall with such triumphs as Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later. Although the film does not live up to Danny Boyle's mini masterpiece, there is still much to admire and respect from this underrated gem of a film.Denzel Washington is Eli, a survivor who travels alone across what is left of planet earth. His journey has a purpose which involves the protection of a book in his possession and it's deliverance to what he calls it's rightful place. Among his journey he is confronted with hijackers, thieves and murderers. However his most dangerous confrontation seems to be a man named Carnagie (Gary Oldman), who controls a small community. The only thing he wants more them anything is the thing Eli is willing to protect with his life, the book. A battle between these two men and their beliefs of what is the right thing to do with the book is what makes the film a compelling and interesting watch.Many critics complained about the simplicity of The Book Of Eli and how the film seemed shallow. I thought that was one of the strongest points of the film. We don't need a heavy plot with twist to make it a better film. It's a simple story of two strong opinions during a desperate time for what is left of humanity. The Hughes Bothers aren't being preachy with the film, they are giving us a simple tale a good vs bad and how human will can conquer human strength.Denzel Washington is well cast as Eli. He is not the Will Smith character in I Am Legend who remains fit, has a daily routine and is without doubt a Hollywood action hero. Eli is a normal man who travels by faith and not sight. OK he seems to be good in a fight, but aside from that he is an everyday man with a job to do. The supporting cast are all fine. Gary Oldman is great as with anything he does and I was particularly impressed with Mila Kunis as a young women who takes a shine to Eli, his thoughts on the world and his concepts. The striking cinematography brings the audience into this empty waste land and creates memorable images. Not just the ones we would expect of Eli travelling alone across empty roads and bridges, but of impressive action sequences that really create a sense of danger for the characters. The stillness of the scenes with Eli on his own or when he is conversation of with other characters does not prepare us for the loudness and disruptiveness of the action. This is not a bad thing as we are thrown into the action which is superbly directed.Although the film does have it's faults, it delivers what it has to. A basic, but necessarily basic script gives the film many strengths including a rewarding and uplifting ending. Even though it was not what I expected. Fine performances, terrific cinematography and strong directing by the Hughes Brothers makes The Book Of Eli a journey you won't regret taking.Amen.",The Book of Eli
271,miesnekawalki,Wacko on the mission,2,3 February 2016,"The Book of Eli is the story of a guy who walks somewhere to deliver some book there. Oh and there's the other guy who wants to have this book. The plot begins after the apocalypse of some sort. Most of the people die and when survivors start crawling out of their mouse holes, God speaks to one of them and tells him to take the bible and go west.Guess what does this messenger of God do when he encounters other survivors? Does he reason with them, tries to talk his way out of the trouble? No, he cuts off their heads with the machete, shoots them in the crotch with the bow and smashes their heads against the tables. The best description of the logic in this movie is: contradictory messDenzel Washington plays Denzel Washington. It's the same role that this guy plays in every other movie. Nothing to talk about, let's move on. Mila Kunis plays a weak girl sidekick unconvincingly changing into badass avenger in Top Gun shades. Gary Oldman is the villain this time. He's evil, one dimensional and pretty freaking stupid. All of the performances are wooden, overly gritty and quickly become... goofy.Cinematography? Music is immediately forgettable, all shots smell like 'I just want to get my paycheck please', colors balance and brightness are screwed up to the point where sometimes you can't see anything (it's Aliens vs Predator:Requiem kind of bad), props, sets and wideshots are acceptable.There are a lot of annoying things about this movie. People walking around with their sunglasses and mad max googles, while the weather doesn't justify using this stuff (it's like a nice, sunny, average spring day every day). They wear sunglasses all the time by the way, even when they are looting corpses in pitch black tunnel. Protagonist says that 'he's protected' (by God I assume) and in one of the scenes he takes 2 bullets to the back that don't even leave a scratch. Another scene - big shootout and 4 people are just standing near the windows, talking and shooting (freaking get down you morons, it's like they don't care about that primal survival instinct that they should have few decades after the apocalypse, living in this barren, hostile world). And a cherry on top - guy fixing his stomach gunshot wound with the flippin' duct tape...The ending is just cheese in its purest form and I can't believe that Denzel Washington was able to play that without bursting in laughter. Plus it basically says that 'the new bible' can just be a bunch of delusions made up by some wacko (so basically, religions 1:1)This movie is a prank. Prank on people aching for a good postapo movies. You wanna see stressed people, fighting for survival in a barren, harsh environment? Nah mate, just have a guy walking in the name of Jesus and reciting The Bible for future generations. What a sad joke.

272,mailljs,a new candidate for the list of 100 worst movies ever made,1,5 March 2010,"This movie is so bad, I would seriously consider it as a candidate for this list. I guess the Hillsong people might consider it to be worth watching as a religious tale but looked at simply as a movie it fails because the plot is ridiculous it is laughable. There must be at least 50 million copies of the bible extant in the USA but somehow, after the (unexplained} apocalypse there is only one but that one is not an actual copy, it has been memorised by Eli (this is also unexplained). What happened to the copy that he memorised is also unexplained. Eli gets a message from some metaphysical source (presumably the Christian god) to go west.So off he goes, while he is on his journey he becomes bulletproof and also a killing machine until for some reason he is actually injured and looks like dying but not before he recites the whole Bible to someone who writes it all down (wonder where they got all the paper). Apart from the plot the acting is wooden, the dialog is almost non existent and the characters are not developed so you can't relate to or care about them, Total nonsense, the whole thing and I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it,",The Book of Eli

The film probably would have looked better in black and white instead of the sepia-tone that was used. There were several points, mainly the trudging through the barren landscape scenes, where the story just dragged. It reminded me of ""The Postman"", but this was thankfully a much shorter film. There were some nice small scenes with some actors that I wasn't expecting –wouldn't want to give anything away if you haven't seen it. The payoff and dénouement was unsatisfying.

How could a man who had the Bible committed to memory, a book about love and compassion, go through the movie slashing and killing people left and wright? This is truly contradictory and against the messages of the old book. The make up of Gary Oldman was so strong that I did not recognize him were it not for the cast of credits. Mila Kunis's character was lame and I wonder why did she even get this role in the first place? Denzel Washington was his own cool persona that we have seen in many of his other productions.

And if you want religion in the story ""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" would be a much better movie and a more intelligent story too. I also found the movie hard to watch -literally.

277,thefinisher_23,Yeah its okay to bELIieve,8,24 January 2010,"Denzel Washington is an elevator. He lifts the talents of a script, cast, setting, to a level he sort of demands them to reach because he is already there. The Book of Eli is a prime example. On its surface this is really just another post-apocalyptic, desert wasteland flick designed to make us imagined a world without society. With the presence of Denzel, that is to say Eli, it becomes something far more entertaining and surprisingly rewarding. If you have already guessed what the book could be that is fine. You may be right or not. I am no clairvoyant. Either way, don't feel like you figured anything groundbreaking out. I guessed right too.Eli never identifies himself as Eli. He has been walking for thirty years since ""the blast tore a hole in the sky"" and the sun came down and finished us off. He carries in his possession a book that we will protect from anyone. Where is he going? ""West"" he says. He has a specific location in mind. It's a good thing he didn't tell us right away, otherwise I'm not sure I could call the film rewarding. The journey is so bleak that even the possibility of a destination is a positive.Eli stumbles across a town run by Carnegie (Gary Oldman) who is its' resident degenerate in a town full of people who seem to get more barbaric by the day. Carnegie possesses something Eli has and that is, experience and intelligence which is why he stands out in a world of illiterate survivors who never knew the comforts of 4 walls and a bed. They were both alive before the world turned to dust. Therefore they both know of the book and only Eli has it. Carnegie is such an awful man that Eli really is the only one who deserves its content. Before he leaves town, Eli takes on Solara (Mila Kunisif she ever has to call someone ""Donna"" in a movie here career is over). Solara is the daughter of Carnegie concubine, a blind woman. She is far from innocent but is still rather green when it comes to understanding the world she lives in. Like so many, she is just surviving on what she knows. What commences then is a series of stellar gun-fights and violence in this barren landscape.Washington truly is one of the six best actors of his age group. His characters always know their motivation, have enough cool in them to make them appealing, all while being strong enough to bring intensity, ferocity and fear to any situation. Eli is no different. The material here is in fact tried and true. We've seen it before the cannibals (The Road), the roving gangs (Mad Max), and the stark, lonely landscape (I am Legend). The difference here is we are given a protagonist to sure of his journey, so confident in his purpose that we can't help but be intrigued by it all. You can see it in Solara and Carnegie. Solara sees him as a man from another time, which basically makes him from another world. Carnegie views his resourcefulness as a legitimate threat in a place where he is the only one. After all, he wants that book.The movie's directors are the Spreig Brothers (From Hell) who give the film are crisp look and a barren and bright palette. None of this looks cheap and in fact keeps our attention during the times when Eli is just walking through it all. I suppose the best credit to the directing duo is that they know the recipe for success lies within their legendary star. In the end, this is a picture about faith in something we have every reason not to have faith. Oh yes, religion is present but really it adds to the story and its character. It is never preachy or overzealous. In a time of extreme opinions and extreme religion that is most refreshing even in a violent action film. Regardless of anything else in the picture I take this away: we can all have faith in Denzel. The Book of Eli, like so many in the past, is a testament to that.",The Book of Eli

279,reviewer135,People Are missing the point,6,27 June 2010,"Everybody is missing the point of this movie. True, This movie should be offensive to religious and non-religious alike due to the Horrendous acting, extremely poor continuity, Denzel's self righteous portrayal and the trivialization of biblical events to a ""Batman"" like sci-fi movie.Beyond the superficial arguments of how could a blind man do this, is he blind, It was God's guidance, yada-yada-yada is actually a cool lost story. The point of the movie is that the Bible was Lost.The very thought of that I'm sure sent sickening feelings to the core of the deeply religious. And to the not so religious maybe a relief but then disbelief that he could recite word-for-word the bible from memory. The point of the movie is that it was God's will that Eli travel with the last remaining Bible, study It, and learn from It's words but then ultimately lose It. Then at the end of the movie, The Bible was recreated through the words of a good man ""Eli"". So yes, maybe not word-for-word but the essence lived on. That's kind of a cool thought. I think the movie says ""what if we stopped getting wrapped up in the word-for-word details"" and instead started living by the essence of do no wrong.I originally gave this movie a very bad review because of the extremely poor acting, directing, and flow, but now I recommend everyone re-watch the movie with this concept in mind (or better yet, read the book cause the movie is pretty bad :) ).",The Book of Eli

287,thimage,"Another ""Faith"" related movie |:(",3,29 January 2010,"I usually pay for any movie that includes such figures as Gary Oldman and Denzel Washington. This time, though, I was hugely disappointed, the plot was not worth a dime. Under the pretense of a situation similar to that of ""The Postman"" (brilliantly written by David Brin years ago and impersonated by Kevin Costner in the movie of the same name), the story here collapses into a ""Quest for the Grail"" kind for a bible book, mixed with the crowd-pleaser type of gunslinger scenes in which a hero never dies even when the odds are thirty to one and he's got only one bullet left. My eyes rolled upwards in a ""Oh Puhleeeeeeze! Not again!"". And I had to forcefully hold myself down into my seat until the end. As a matter of fact, I wanted to see the end so I could write this without error.That such a notion as ""Salvation"" and ""The word of god"" could be used to uplift the survivors of a holocaust is beyond me. It's a ""back to square one"" kind of behavior that shouldn't be promoted under any circumstances.I may be overreacting but: What? You want to do it all over again? Repeat all the mistakes made in history under the auspices of religion or for a ""greater cause""? This movie may seem to be made to produce veneration, reverence, epiphany. But the context of destruction in which it is presented contrasts so starkly with the hero's aim and values that whomever can use his/her brain can see where these good intentions will lead after a single generation: fanaticism, inquisition and autocracy are already lurking behind the corner to redress such a desperate situation.It's time people get better plots to go with fantastic special effects.

288,i_am_bryony,I absolutely hated this.,1,25 February 2013,"I'd like to make a short list of things that annoyed the living hell out of me in the film.1) The blatant thievery from Mad Max II and Waterworld. Only one of those films is worth stealing from, and its pretty damn obvious when you do.2) Canned goods are still edible and can be traded 30 years after they were made and have been through a nuclear war? They're hardly edible now! Also, clothes and designer shades have survived without any damage and you can look like a model from one of the higher end catalogues if you put a little effort in.3) The world appears to be a sandy wasteland with no agriculture or industry, so what did the people eat and where did they get the cloth to make their clothes, the ammunition for their semi automatic weapons and the fuel for their still functioning motor vehicles?4) Further to that, it is stated that not many people from before the war survived, so who taught the ones born since to drive and operate complex machinery? 5) Books can survive war and fire and 30 years without getting scorched or even turning a bit yellow,and your Ipod will still work. Nobody has thought to plant a crop, but they have developed battery chargers.OK, those are the most obvious flaws, but now we have to take a look at Eli himself, a character so ridiculous that its impossible to take him seriously. First up, he's bulletproof (except he isn't) and he's blind, although right up until that little bombshell is revealed he performs tasks that would be impossible for a blind man to complete. Oh, and he can stand in the middle of a firefight and not get hit once, but he can shoot down about 12 baddies with a single magazine from his pistol. Not since the A Team have the bad guys been such lousy shots. When he isn't using his pistol, he uses a big machete to hack people to death with, all in the name of the Lord. But thats OK, because the Bearded One has chosen Eli to be his last prophet, delivering his word to the poor folk of the now ravaged earth. Only he doesn't.There is absolutely no back story to Eli, we only know that he's been walking for 30 years murdering anybody he doesn't like (which is everybody)and in that time has never found people worthy of his teachings. Oh yeah, he has the only copy of the bible in the whole world. Its a King James bible obviously, because God is a W.A.S.PWe are told that after the war, the remaining citizens of planet earth spent the time that followed not rebuilding or replanting, but seeking out copies of the book and destroying them. It appears that only 10% has survived the war and subsequent scorching of the earth, but between them they managed to destroy about 5 billion copies of the gospels. they must have worked awfully hard.So, a bullet proof blind prophet of God wanders the deserts of America for 30 years killing everybody, unless they really deserve it because they're rapists, trying to find a safe place for the holy book he has in his possession. There's a baddie after it, but he is so inept and stupid that he lets Eli keep his knife and gun when he takes him prisoner, and even sends him a young girl to keep him occupied while he's being detained, in the hope that he'll join his baddie gang. He doesn't, of course, but the girl hears a few words from the book and instantly becomes his disciple. They escape his clutches and walk out of town, hotly pursued by vehicles that he manages to outdistance by miles in about 15 minutes. If it sounds like I'm making this up as I go along then its because this is exactly what happened I suspect. to fill in the massive plot holes and action sequence absurdities, the writers appear to have patched the script with garbage like 'Oh, lets make him bullet proof. Thats gets him out of that one'So onward we plod until Eli gets bested, which makes God angry and there's a big flash of lightning but no repercussions, and the baddie, played by a completely wasted Gary Oldman, gets his prize. Only he doesn't because TAADAA!! The book is in braille! Genius. Luckily Eli has memorised it and finally reaches his destination, having taped a bullet wound in his stomach up, and recites the entire thing to a man with a pen and around 10000 sheets of paper to spare before finally dying.Now, the entire film is nothing more than a poorly realised piece of Christian propaganda, the message being that without the word of God, the world will descend into savagery. I don't really have a problem with that, films have to be about something and thats as good a premise as any other, my problem is that it is just very badly played out. I don't mind being fooled, like in The Usual Suspects, what I object too is being treated like a fool. The close up of Eli's eyes, where his blindness is revealed is supposed to be the big 'Ahhh!' moment, where everything suddenly makes sense, but it makes a nonsense of the entire film and you just wasted 2 hours being lied to by the most inept story tellers I have ever come across. It is suggested that he's only half blind, so perhaps in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king is the moral here, but even on that level it fails miserably.",The Book of Eli

290,PopcornJury,An Underwhelming Post-Apocalyptic Mess of a Movie,2,27 October 2010,"I love post-apocalyptic films. In fact, John Hillcoat's The Road was my favorite film of 2009 (close tie with Up in the Air). There's something about the idea that humankind turns evil in response to a disaster, and we can't help but wish for a hero to bring back hope. With a title like Book of Eli, hope is the first thing that came to mind. Couple that with a trailer that showcased mild violence at the hand of a sword, and I thought we were dealing with a first of it's kind: a post-apocalyptic film with religious overtones in the vein of a graphic novel. I couldn't have been further from the truth. Book of Eli is neither religious nor graphic in nature, rather it is a film that builds its premise around a surprise ending that provides nothing more than a few cheap thrills at the expense of any type of story line.Book of Eli is about one man's journey to protect a secret. That man happens to be Denzel Washington, and the secret he is protecting is a Bible. We don't know where he's been and we don't know where he's going, we simply know that his mission in life is to make sure the good book doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Why is this book so special? Because it's the last Bible on Earth, and those that want it don't aim to bring back life according to its scripture, they plan to use it to rewrite history, their way, simply using god's word as a framework for destruction.The film tries so hard to be simple, but it's messages are mixed in a way that makes this an almost impossible to not get confused. In his attempt to protect the Bible, we see the protagonist kill hundreds of men with his bare hands (with the help of a sword). There's no remorse, no regret, and no repercussions to what he does. Where does he learn his superior fighting skills? We don't know. How did he obtain the good book? We don't know. How did the world get destroyed in the first place? We don't know. There are so many questions left unanswered that we're left unable to put pieces of the story together. Instead we're expected to watch aimlessly in hopes for a payoff. Guess what; the payoff isn't there.I won't give away any details, but what I will say is this: there is a ""surprise"" near the end of Book of Eli. There's been movies that have done the surprise well (Sixth Sense always comes to mind), but Book of Eli isn't one of them. What happens in the latter part of the film literally renders the previous two-thirds useless as it throws a knife in a premise that I didn't think could have any more holes.All in all, Book of Eli is an underwhelming entry into the post-apocalyptic genre. It's not an action movie, it's not a drama, and it's not a thriller; it's simply a movie about a man with no motives walking around the desert in dismay. Nothing good comes out of his battle, no hope is brought back to humanity, and no truths are enacted from the Scripture. This film may be about the good book, but the film is extremely bad. Stay away from this and rent The Road or Winter's Bone; both films post-apocalyptic but with a purpose and a pulse.For more reviews, visit http://www.popcornjury.comMichael Buffa-Editor, Popcorn Jury",The Book of Eli
291,RockBiter,Can the World To Come Be Better Than the World Before?,7,11 February 2010,"It is 31 years since the 'Flash', says Eli, when a hole opened up in the sky and the sun burned up the 'World Before' and everyone not underground. He came out after the Flash, he says, and wandered for a time until a Voice led him to the 'book' - his book - and told him to take it West.And so the movie begins. It IS of the stuff of standard post-Apocalyptic sci-fi fare and it is certainly not bereft of flaws but the 'Book of Eli' does have some things to offer its viewers and some intriguing posers too. Like what exactly IS this book? Well, it is no surprise that it is the Holy Bible - stating that is perhaps not even a spoiler nor is the Viewer intended to take any other view. And yet there is a special quality about this PARTICULAR Bible that is the key to the story and also to Eli himself.And just who IS Eli? Denzel Washington, a phenomenal actor whom I greatly admire, is given the difficult task of defining the main character. And Eli is a multi-faceted, not easily defined one at that. At times Washington's Eli resembles Wesley Snipes' Blade, wielding a lethal, machete-like sword and fighting off bedraggled way-faring gangs eager to plunder his back-pack and make off with his water and food and scavenged items (which include BTW an old MP3 which he loves to play at night and fall asleep to) while at other times, he seems to bear an almost mystical, prophetic quality not unlike Ian McKellan's Gandalf. Huh? Seriously! He is the only source for the Viewer and for the movie's younger generation of the glimpses and knowledge of the 'World Before' and the only source of hope for the present ruined one. He is very much a prophet of his age and the key to everything lies in the success of his Quest.But the Road West leads through a tiny, dusty Old-West style town ruled by an older intellectual-sort turned war-lord named Carnegie (Oldman), mindful of the ways of the 'World Before' and obsessed with finding a certain book - and we the viewers again know which one. With it and its inspiring words, he will be able to gather all the remaining people in America to him and re-build a great society under him. When Eli comes into his town to barter for supplies and to power up his MP3 and is forced to swiftly dispatch a few of Carnegie's minions in the bargain, Carnegie is on to him.From here, the two 'quests' of both men are inextricably linked and in the balance is the ruined world's future as well as the fate of Carnegie's 'captive family' a mother and daughter whom he terrorizes and uses to get at Eli. The mother, Claudia (Beals), is blinded by the Flash while young and the daughter (Kunis) finds herself eager to learn everything she can from Eli of the 'World Before', gaining a sense of his hope for the future, and eventually seeking even to accompany him on his quest.But Carnegie gets the best of Eli and gains the book (!!). Eli, however, continues to the West coast anyway and completes his quest. How this can be so is the twist to the film which I will not utterly ruin.Overall, this was a decent satisfying sci-fi yarn. The cinematography and the various shots of the burned landscape were truly excellent. The ever-present, dirty grey-orange tones in the film made you FEEL the heat and desolation, and yet the film was beset all the same by an at-times frustratingly weak and quirky script. The writing of the ending could have been 'cleaned-up', even revised, but it still imparted an impact.",The Book of Eli

295,elkabong-dd,Christian's Version of Mad Max,2,3 August 2010,"The Book of Eli is a paradox. It's clearly a Christian movie, but there is so darned much killing and maiming and just plain violence, that it's not really recognizable as Christian much of the time.But don't kid yourself. The preachy-preachy is always there. The nagging tones about the ""only"" book that mankind needs to be saved. The belief professed by the bad guys that they could use the book to control people. The ever-present nags about how mankind was sooooo foolish in the post-apocalypse to burn all of the Bibles. Because, yes, this whole thing is about a Bible.But they couldn't call it ""Eli's Bible"", which is much more accurate.... That wouldn't sell tickets.Anyways, I was revolted to be proselytized to for an hour and a half. I love sci-fi, but thinly-disguised religious sci-fi.. not nearly so much.Personally, I'm more interested in what led people to burn all the bibles... now THAT is probably an interesting story.",The Book of Eli

A very powerful movie. Whether you are of faith or not this movie is a must see. It looks at religion from the believer's and non believer's view point.My ex-fiancée tried to get me to watch this long ago but I would not because I lost my faith. I guess I wasn't ready to watch it then but was ready now. Maybe I hope there is something better than this place and maybe the hope I have buried down deep inside that there is a God and he does not like what is going on in this world will be shown to be true one day. My eyes will be opened.Totally recommend this movie to others. I am so glad I finally saw it.,The Book of Eli

After this point the Movie began to get more and more far fetched and funny ""30 years to get to the Midwest ?"" then when we realised he was blind ! we couldn't help but laugh :) this how ever explained some things like backing into the shadows to even the fight (not sure how he knew there were shadows there though.)

Not just in this story, but as in all his cinema work, effortlessly creating the perfect, convincing, believable character for the part, pulling the audience into the story. Gary Oldman on the other hand is the cinema polar opposite. You never see Gary Oldman on screen being Gary Oldman. In this film, the master of movie character disguise hides in plain sight as the heavy in ruthless pursuit of Eli's mysterious book. They pair well.But then there's the bad: It's a stock post-apocalypse story. Perhaps I'm developing apocalypse fatigue, but matching up Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman as foes in pursuit of the same goal is a bit of a waste of talent in this rather singular, bleak and colorless setting.Lastly, Jennifer Beals and Mila Kunis play the stock-roles of the oppressed, helpless and submissive women trying to survive their new world, although Kunis' character, Solara, seems to have a revelation, eventually, and chooses to side with obvious good against the obvious evil.Is it worth seeing? Sure, but don't be blinded by the action trailer. Perhaps best saved for a rainy day.",The Book of Eli

300,spanixtan,The post apocalyptic prophet,8,26 December 2019,"The film is clearly symbolic. Eli is a chosen man, who after a global war has to deliver the book (The only Bible not burned in the war) to a western and unknown place. Prophet Elijah and a post millennial society are evident.The story is set somewhere in the United States, now a wasteland. The US a symbol of the whole world. Going west was always the American way to rebuild one's life when the colonized cities become hostile.
Therefore, it´s an all USA film: a new America as the new post millennial order.
Eli has to go through an area ruled brutally by a man:he sends hunting gangs around terrorizing and killing; taking him all books they find. He knows the power of the Bible; it contains the texts and wording that once again can be used to convince and rule.
Eli's book is discovered. He escapes without the book (which is written in Braille, a language the wicked man of the town can´t decypher) and goes on west until the coast. There´s an island where civilized and wise men rule. Eli knows the Book by heart and begins to dictate it to a wise well-intentioned man representative of the island, while lying fatally wounded.
At the end the Book is placed in a library among others whose titles we can just glimpse for a second. They have a printing press.We suppose that it will be the source of the newly reborn world.
The movie is not just that millennial tale; there´s a lot of action and violence; evil characters and few individuals that could be redeemed. Road ambushes; bar fights; chases and hunting. Fight with guns or just blades and blunt weapons...
The prophet is an amazingly lethal fighter; ready to raise hell when he has no other peaceful way out.",The Book of Eli

One: Too many reviewers here are spilling the beans. The beauty of the movie--like The Sting--is the presentation...the dramatization of the elements. If these people are going to walk you through it, they've wasted your time.Two: too many reviews betray the reviewer's anti-God/religion bias. Similarly, I would never review a 'chick flick' or 'sorcery/wizards/vampire' movie, or feel my input was worth anything. If religion, God, or teachings from the Bible turn you into a rage at the lunacy of believers, you will be wasting your time with this movie. When it ended, I nearly rushed to this site for further discussion and exploration of philosophies. This is not just an apocalyptic action movie (like Mad Max), but a think piece. An imaginative story, compelling action and direction, great photography and design, and extremely well acted by Denzel Washington and Gary Oldham. Some here said it was slow.

I liked the Fallout style atmosphere. Because if there is one thing this movie has it's style. The nuclear post-apocalyptic ambiance is brilliantly achieved with its own fashion. The yellowish filter works but ultimately gets frustrating for some reason. None of the acting impressed me, in fact I had the feeling that I had seen those same actors playing the same characters in other movies. It's a collage of past performances. Whether you believe or not might influence your feelings about this movie. But if you put aside this specific aspect of the story you're objectively left with a pretty container but no content. There could have been much more developments with the story and more explanations about the background of the neo society (or absence of). Special mention to the hands verification that they perform to know if they can trust someone. It takes some time to figure out why they do it but it's subtle and gives an uneasy feeling. A search on the Web confirms the science behind it. Having said that, it's a movie that entertained me well enough to remember it for years to come (no small feat for me as I usually forget about movies which didn't have an emotional impact).",The Book of Eli

My position is that Richard Dawkins has got it pretty much right in The God Delusion. However, I do feel that I have to come to the defence of this film. It is simply not sensible to give this film 1 star. On a number of counts it is a spectacularly good movie. The post-apocalyptic scenery is excellent, the action scenes are very good and. although the theme is not new, it is an original film. As for the ""christian message"" it did not offend me at all. Truth be told it is not pushed that hard - there are no angels or clear miracles. In fact there is nothing that points to the absolute truth of Christianity; if you want to view the believer as misguided (and that's my preference) then the film gives you room to do that. I thought it was rather like an updated version of the American television series that starred David Carradine, Kung Fu (1972–1975). Go for it grasshopper!",The Book of Eli

But the next day, I started to like it a little more than I did initially. There was a couple of light-bulb above the head moments at the end as well.I was really frustrated with the lack of development for Gary Oldman's character. What a poor use for one of the most talented actors of our time. Some of acting is pretty cheesy, but if you listen to the lines, you can't expect much from the actors.I was also frustrated with the identity of this film – what was it trying to be? A story that looks at the human condition? Or was it trying to be a post apocalyptic western thriller, with a weird twist at the end? I don't know – just trying to think about what this movie was trying to do hurts.On the positive - I will say, the message was cool in the end. Denzel and Gary Olman in the same movie is worth a look.

He stirs the viewer viscerally. He makes bad movies watchable, this being a prime example.2. The cinematography is extraordinary. The camera angles, coloring, shadowing, CGI, and the over-all visuals of this movie are extremely cool.As for all the rest, give me a break. The ending has a couple of plot twists that are intended to leave your mind spinning as the realization sets in. In actuality, you spend the next hour realizing how stupid they are, and how ridiculous they make the whole movie in retrospect. As you look back on the movie there is so much that is not plausible that it becomes impossible to buy into the world of this movie.The acting of Gary Oldman and his band of baddies is clichéd and tired.

It had the same formula as The Road Warrior: The Loner taking on an outlaw Motorcycle Gang. Denzel Washington gave a great performance as Eli, a man walking across a world where there was hardly any food or resources and people were trying to get what they could to survive. The visuals were stunning and beautifully done. The ending was the exact opposite of TRW: The hero dies and a woman starts walking down the road he was.

He carries the only surviving bible ""west"" per an intuitive spiritual whisper. En route he runs into Gary Oldman as the intelligent, power-hungry Carnegie, who is searching for ""The Book,"" which he believes will allow him to control the masses through its powerful words.Carnegie is a symbol for everything that is wrong with organized religion, while Eli is a symbol of humankind wanting to do what is right. The problem here is, if you need a book to tell you what is right, you are already screwed. And if you don't need the book, then why drag it west. Also, organized religion is probably what led to the world's annihilation to begin with, so wanting to jump start it is nonsensical.There was one funny scene that involves an old couple that puts a vinyl record on a dilapidated turntable... the record is an old disco single (I won't say the title cause I don't wanna include a spoiler) but the old man kind of sings along and it is quite funny, albeit short-lived.Gary Oldman is always great, Denzel was good as usual, Jennifer Beals and Mila Kunis were also good. Just did not find the premise compelling or believable, and the ending is even less believable... in more ways than one. I won't say this movie is a waste of time, especially if you are a Denzel fan, but if you don't have a high opinion of organized religion, the premise will not be captivating enough to allow you to suspend disbelief and be entertained.

If I had known the extent of the Christian propaganda before I started watching it, then I would never have pressed play.

So the new civilization can eventually be destroyed the same way ours was in the movie??? Or will it all be fine and dandy next time around? And when this King James bible finally gets printed, they put it where? On a shelf beside the Quran, and Torah, which totally implies religious conflict is inevitable. Umm Holy War?I think the movie does a great job stressing the dangers of religion, even if it was intended to be a Christain propaganda/indoctrination film.

317,clivecollett,I enjoyed the film,7,7 June 2010,"*****May contain minor spoilers***** The reason so many people have given this film poor comments is because of the Christian spiritual content. People don't like to be challenged by a concept that speaks of ultimate objective truth or morality. Those people like to have the freedom to choose their own truth and live according to their own rules. If you start talking about God, then they feel very uncomfortable because that then causes them to consider a truth that transcends human thinking; and so removes their 'right' to concoct their own moral standards. The Book of Eli, although flawed in some aspects, presents an interesting slant on Good Vs Evil, using the same Tool/weapon..... The Bible. Eli realise its power through years of reading, meditating, digesting and learning its contents, even though this does not necessarily cause him to obey all of its concepts.....killing, for example. Carnegie, on the other hand, want it because he thinks he can use it to gain power over people, thereby expanding his little empire; not realising that it is not 'The Book' that possesses the power, but the Spiritual content therein. Great cinematography, great acting, (what else from the two main actors?), great 'feel to the film overall.

The characters both good and bad are great and the acting is quality.I liked the premise and it makes you wonder throughout the movie on the supernatural element of it all. However it sticks to its reality roots keeping it real (as real as it can be for an apocalyptic setting!).Throughout the movie dentil Washington has the fighting skills on par with that of X-men character but it gives no back story on this which I thought might have been nice but they leave it mysteriously open for you to decide.The premise of the book being powerful is both true and it has indeed been used over the years to control the masses and with the last one in existence the book holds it power now in the apocalypse more than ever. I liked the scene in the town where the first time Eli is shot at the bad guy misses, then the second time it hits his back pack. The movie is not saying that Eli is invincible but he holds a brave confident faith that plays out throughout the movie In this way Eli's character is exasperated and shows us how we could all use w little faith (religious or otherwise ?) in our lives especially with the current pandemic corvid crisis that is fast approaching now.Very cool movie a strong 8/10 for me. Some with roll there eyes with 4/5 out of 10 and some will love it more than I at 9/10 out of 10.

319,thegene-2,WOW - What a movie!!!,10,14 August 2010,"This is a very special film. I do not give out 10 ratings unless a film has a great impact on me. Yes, it's nothing new under the sun as the old saying goes, but humans have the capacity to see wonderful things in what is never new, just different, or special, or wonderful. Was this a wild action movie? No – but the action was there and it was very good and just the right amount. Were the special effects fantastic and wowing? No – but they were great. It was that they fit so perfectly into the film that they did not overtake all the other components of the film, and thus, were just what was needed. Was the plot super sensational? Many might say ""not really"". But was it great? For an answer to that I believe most would say yes. Was the acting worthy of outstanding life time achievement awards? Probably not in most people's minds. But if the characters are believable and you do not see them as actors, then the job was done right. For example, you do not see the main star as an actor though that is what he is, but rather as a real person. And that is exactly what we are supposed to see when the job is done right. I did not see one bad acting job in the entire film though I did not know any of the other actors off hand.So it sounds like you might want to know why I gave it a 10. Since I am only an emotional person under the most extreme conditions, most films that I like do little for me in the emotion department at the end other than raise a comment of ""good movie"". And I have been watching movies for over 60 years. A lot of movies. This one brought liquid to my eyes at the end. Now, that's emotion. The components of this film all fit together so that you watched a story rather than a movie.Here is one way I can tell how good a film is for me. If it moves somewhat slow and yet you just have to keep watching to see what is going to happen next. And I will say that I felt that through from the first few seconds of the movie to the very last second before the credits rolled. Now that's how you make a movie.Another is how one feels about the movie long after it is over. I was still and am still thinking about it even after days from when I watched it.Will it affect most people like that? Probably not. But it will affect most people in a positive way. And I believe this movie is somewhat like radio is when it is called ""theater of the mind"". There is more to this film than meets the eye. Probably because there is always that problem with significant films where you have what could be 4 hours of move and you have to do it in less than 2. Thus every little detail is not fully explained and there is a lot of interesting details here. You do actually think about the why and where and what and when and so on, and you must then add to the movie mentally in order to feel you are closer to what the story is.Anyway, that is getting into deep psychology and we don't need to do that. So get this movie and watch it. You will enjoy it and it will make an impression that for most will be very positive. It is entertainment time well spent.",The Book of Eli
320,ncoviell,"Beautifully shot, acted, but somewhat unclear",7,19 February 2010,"Denzel's latest film is an entertaining, although flawed is several different ways. The story centers on Eli (Washington); who has been traveling West with the last copy of The Bible for thirty years. On his voyage, Eli runs into the villainous Carnegie (Oldman), his wife and her daughter Solara (Kunis). Carnegie has been searching for a copy of The Bible for a long time and when word reaches him that Eli is carrying a copy, the chase is on. However, as the film progresses the relation of religion and religious beliefs become skewed. For example, Eli lives by God's rules, yet he passes up the chance to help a girl avoid getting raped. Carnegie's main interest in procuring The Bible is that ""its power will bring people here;"" however, the story is set around older characters like Carnegie and Eli who experienced the world before its destruction and those who weren't. One of the biggest differences between the two is that those from a post-apocalyptic world don't know how to read nor do they know what The Bible is. That brings up the question of how The Bible's power would draw anyone aside of older people in? But The Book of Eli doesn't stop there with there religion- based content. In fact, the final shot of Eli might be borderline offensive to some religious people. As far as the performances go, Washington, Oldman and Kunis all give it their best; however, the writing of their characters isn't the strongest, especially Oldman's Carnegie. Many film buffs were excited to see Gary Oldman return to a villainous role, but Carnegie wasn't exactly the world's most antagonizing villain. In fact, Carnegie's evil acts include abusing his wife and shooting an unarmed man in the stomach, which don't exactly scream ""bad ass."" For Washington, playing Eli was both new and familiar territory. Certainly playing the hero who kicks ass and saves the day is nothing new to Denzel; however, Eli was very soft spoken, which is deviant from Washington's usually loud, aggressive and in-control characters. On a final note, The Book of Eli was definitely visually stunning as it offered a beautiful, sepia-filled sky version of a post- apocalyptic world. On the other hand, the slow motion scenes only worked on some levels and the wardrobe of the characters was a little ridiculous. Somehow, Kunis' Solara managed to look fashionable in her sunglasses and scarf, which gave off a pleasurable feeling compared to the well chosen, bleak wardrobe of earlier post-apocalyptic movie, The Road. Overall, The Book of Eli was an entertaining watch, but had its share of problems and controversies in the writing and plot.",The Book of Eli

The bandit who looks for this book for some sort of salvation.The Bible doesn't necessarily represent some kind of religion. The bible carries the message what our values should be. The movie shows people having those values and people without them.The film has an interesting plot, good visuals good acting job. However, it contained too much violence. The movie bringing this kind of message looked too weak in a sense that I understood what is the message but I failed to believe in that message.

A great film is simply a great film ; I don't have to buy into its world view to appreciate it.Such a thoughtful ending is unusual in a movie which as others have mentioned is part post-apocalyptic action-film, part road-movie, part-western.The screen-writer was thankfully restrained in his use of humor for a modern Hollywood film (I love a laugh but it would have detracted from the gravitas of a film like this), and the brilliant acting and unobtrusive camera work brought the story to the screen superbly.I must see this at least one more time, since I'm sure there's stuff I missed. Like the twist at the end; I'm still not convinced!",The Book of Eli
323,michelhovenkamp-1,enjoyable movie,7,17 March 2010,"I saw this movie yesterday and i must say i enjoyed it a lot.Most people say this is a propaganda movie towards Christianity. I can not totally agree with this. Although the moral of the story is that faith can save mankind it is also stated in the movie that the whole war began because of religion. So my view on what they are trying to say in this movie is that faith can save but also destroy mankind. And that lots of people try to abuse its power to take control over peoples minds.The special effects and the way the post apocalyptic word is being shown is very good and believable. All in all ""The book of Eli"" is not your everyday ""Mad Max"" thriller but a movie with a nice story to it.",The Book of Eli
324,ShawnM84,Religious Propaganda - I wish I knew before watching!!!,1,30 May 2010,"This movie is basically saying that people without religion are uncivilized scavengers, and that a book written by MEN hundreds of years ago is the ONLY way for people to learn morals and maintain civilization... without it everything falls apart..WTF? How on earth can this movie be taken seriously? For someone to believe the message this film is trying to portray blindly, is a worrying thought for myself, and makes me think how much of a disservice they (the person who believes our morals and rules for society can ONLY be learned from a book written by MEN hundreds of years ago, gee whiz I had to repeat that) are doing for the progress of humanity in this unknown universe in which we live.We now know more than the bible explains about our existence. Plenty of recent knowledge discredits many parts of the bible IE. the core premise/main part. Our ever expanding knowledge has advanced way beyond the word of the bible.Philosophy is where the ""TRUTH"" can be found. These texts far outweigh the importance of the bible.Peace :)",The Book of Eli
325,phil_gee,Predictable but Watchable,6,31 May 2010,"I like to watch post-Apocalyptic flicks because I usually enjoy the sets and the idea of survival after civilization tries to liquidate itself. Most are middling, though, in terms of originality and overall quality, and ""Book of Eli"" isn't an exception.Denzel Washington gives a good performance as the stoic hero zealously protecting an ""important book"" (can you guess which one?) that survived the ultimate war's carnage, and Gary Oldman provides energy as the bad guy who wants the book to help him rule his little slice of the planet. Neither is outstanding, though. There's also the requisite sexy young thing, but I found her more annoying than cute -- and she was also way too young for Denzel (though he didn't try anything with her).Great sets. Worth a watch on a slow Sunday afternoon, but you probably won't want to pause it if you go to the bathroom.",The Book of Eli
326,jens-wegar,Great cinematography and sound,8,3 January 2012,"The story itself, when it all boils down to it, is fairly straight forward. There is the bad guy who wants something that the good guy can provide. The inevitable showdown is also not very hard to predict. I do however like the biblical theme of the movie, which however might be what turns some people off. You can always trust Denzel to pull off a solid performance, although it wasn't anything spectacular either. I did like how his character was a ""I'll only tell you once"" -type of guy. Mr. Oldman does a very good job as well as the main villain. The person I was positively surprised about was Mila Kunis. Before seeing this movie, I still had here in the ""That 70's show"" B-level comedy actor category, but this movie I think showed that she has the talent to pull off more serious roles as well.What keeps pulling me back to this movie however are the visuals aided by a very dynamic sound scape. The movie is quiet when it needs to be, ambient sounds are almost absent at times. It plays a soundtrack that I feel really supports the massive scale of the hero's quest only when it does not interfere with other events on screen. In other words, you won't hear a fight scene backed up by a big band. Instead you'd only hear the wind over the desert and the sounds of the actual fight. This is one of the few movies where I've felt that the ambient sound and the visuals supported each other well. I also liked the somewhat cold, colorless but contrast rich cinematography, which further helped illustrate that it is a cruel world in which the people try to survive.",The Book of Eli
327,TrevorHickman,So Dull,2,12 July 2014,"I couldn't believe how weak this movie was. Economic and global uncertainty seems to have sparked a growth in post-apocalyptic films in recent years and I must admit I was looking forward to this jaunt through a bleak 'new' earth. I read and enjoyed 'The Road' and I figured this film would be in the same vein.Actually it's an odd biblical yawn-fest set in a left over spaghetti-western set. So predictable and without any heart.You're left with no feeling for any of the characters. Gary Oldman tries his best as the bad-guy, but I was left with a feeling that the film says much more about America's relationship with religion than any meaningful outcome or story-line.A major error the film makes (and let's face it is the major crux of the movie) is that braille is actually a pretty large typeface - a bible converted to braille takes up 18 volumes. It would be quite a lot for Denzil to carry around.Like a braille bible - I'd recommend leaving this one on the shelf.http://www.braillebibles.org/kjv.htm",The Book of Eli

Great performance by Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman. This movie kept my attention from the beginning and was maintained until the credits were rolling at the end.I enjoyed the secrecy of the book Eli deemed so dear.

I've actually seen over 220 of the top 250 movies listed on IMDb. But I've never reviewed a movie on this site....until now.The fact that this movie is not on IMDb's top 250, while movies like ""Up"" and ""Dark Knight"" are on there is a crime and shows that most of IMDb users are 12 or 13 with no sense of taste...no offence.But the real reason this movie is getting such a low score is not because of lack of taste on the part of the viewers, it's because of all the religion haters out there.This movie is about a soldier of God, played by Denzel...who is on a holy mission to help restore order in a post apocalyptic world where first they rob you and then they eat you. The Book of Eli is actually a Bible, probably the most important book on the planet. So please leave the ""Jesus Freak"" mentality at the door and enjoy the movie.Eli is basically a lone wanderer, wandering across the barren former U.S.A with God as his guide and inspiration. He pulls no punches when dealing with people in his way, cutting off arms, and shooting a 12 gauge with surgical accuracy. What's more there is a twist that will make you do a double take and be inclined to watch this movie again. The 2nd time around you will realize Denzel's subtleness and genius. He deserves an Oscar for this performance.Definitely a must see. I gave it an 8 out of ten because it's a really great movie, with great acting and great action.

333,nettrice,The Book of Eli Pays Homage to Zatoichi and the Spaghetti Western,8,16 January 2010,"The Book of Eli is part dystopian re: Mad Max and part futuristic horror re: I Am Legend. Perhaps this is my biggest criticism but it mostly works (there are no new stories in Hollywood). An avid fan of Japanese samurai-type films I made the leap from Eli to Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi, a story about a fictional, popular Japanese blind swordmaster who fights to protect the innocent from oppressive or warring yakuza gangs, and fights to stop injustice. His fighting skill is incredible, his keen ear and sense of smell and proprioception, renders him virtually unstoppable.As Eli, the journeyman/protagonist/hero, traveled West over a barren, bleached, and burned landscape the musical score brought to my mind a few Sergio Leone's films, i.e. the ones with Ennio Morricone at the music composing helm. Not once but twice did Redridge whistle Morricone's theme for Once Upon a Time in America (my favorite film of all time), making clear the Hughes' brothers' homage to Sergio Leone's spaghetti western. I did a comparison between the stills from Once Upon a Time in the West and The Book of Eli. The influence of Leone on the Hughes brothers is undeniable.I have several production stills from Leone's OUTIW (Once Upon a Time in the West), so I decided to compare/contrast those with the ones I easily found online from The Book of Eli. Of course I saw the similarities immediately, with some important differences that I won't get into so as not to spoil it for those who have yet to see the movie and shouldn't even be reading this far down. I was reminded of Denzel Washington's craft as an actor while watching The Book of Eli. Some say Washington was miscast but I beg to differ (see Zatoichi). Casting a younger actor like Will Smith wouldn't have been right. I also thought several of the other actors' performances were well acted. Gary Oldman is still Gary Oldman. The intensity of his performance was low-key but deadly. It seems like Jennifer Beals gets better with age and Mila Kunis was okay. Redridge (Ray Stephenson) was a surprisingly compelling character.All-in-all the Hughes brothers made another film worth watching a few times (I liked From Hell). Well done! I give it an A-/B+ for the inspiration alone.",The Book of Eli

There is some disturbing scenes, no swearing, some inappropriate sequences but not nudity or romance like that. It was one of the movies that you think about after.

However, the screenplay left much to be desired. Not being a fan of the hero against many and coming out without a scratch usually leaves me snickering. Way too many holes in the story (don't want to spoil it by discussing them) and an ending that was hardly feasible, I have to say that I've seen much better stories in the past. That maybe why this one was so predictable. Any time someone wants to develop an after WWWIII story, they really need to spend some time thinking about it and spending more time in research. My guess is that this didn't happen with Book of Eli. The best way I can sum up this one is that it felt like Mad Max in the desert southwest of the US.

It's lensed as through we're seeing through the damaged retinas and partial cataracts of the survivors—everything's contrasty, bleached of color, and diffuse.It's a terrific movie, but about half the reviews are sour, even hostile. I have to conclude that those who put their faith in man's rationality (despite a mountain of grisly evidence to the contrary) are put off by the spiritual theme. Too bad.

They ripped of a western theme - lonely cowboy doing good deeds on his journey to the west. He meets evil in the form of bad sheriff of a poor town. There's a fight, final shootout and peaceful ending. All spiced up with post-apocalyptic stage set - which I suspect is supposed to add volume to the leitmotiv of the movie. And of course it had a side effect as well ... very simple and cheap CGI (which was eye striking the whole movie). There's no sense in finding holes or say little errors in the story - there's no real story. If you go to your closest church on Sunday you'll most probably get the same story.

349,mrbill-18,"Good cast, nice look & feel, let down by poor script and editing",5,18 January 2010,"I won't mince words. Denzel is a great actor, and the supporting cast is quite good, with special kudos to ""That 70s Show"" actress Mila Kunis who demonstrates fine talent in a dramatic role. The look and feel of the film works on a visual level appropriate to a post-apocalyptic story.But the script? It's a combination of ""Pale Rider"" -- unkillable hero ""Star Wars"" -- the force (Christianity, here) that can be used for both good (Denzel's goal) or evil (Gary Oldman's desired use), and""Unforgiven"" -- an old fashioned gunfight with the little guy against a whole lot of bad guys, coupled in this case with graphic slicing and dicing by our hero (Denzel) using a machete.Denzel does a variety of movie roles, and he always does them well. But his selection of movie roles is not always the best. This one is on a par with ""Man on Fire"" where lots of action and killing attempt to make up for a weak, albeit emotionally charged, plot. ""Eli"" lacks the emotional involvement of ""Fire"" and ups the ante in terms of violence and gore.Then there's a ""surprise"" at the end involving Denzel's character, a surprise that is no such thing, but when you think back about the movie, it just couldn't be.The basis of the plot is that Eli (Denzel) has the only copy of ""The Book"" left in the world -- the all time most published book in the world -- and Oldman wants it for his own corrupt purposes while Denzel wants to save it for the good of mankind. Their paths cross and ""it ain't pretty.""Other annoying ""factual"" or logic issues include Denzel walking ""west"" for over 30 years to get to the west coast(?!). From where? Beijing? At one point he shows up with a bow and arrows, and doesn't retrieve his arrows after disposing of a couple of bad guys. . .where was he keeping his arrows? All he had was a backpack? To summarize, the editing leaves in fighting, gore and violence, and leaves out character development and logic. The story is lame, lame, lame: saving the world by preserving the only copy of the King James Bible. . .If this review doesn't make sense, it's because it mimics the movie too closely! See it, if you must, for the talent of the actors, but otherwise it's three thumbs down for the story from a post-apocalyptic three-thumbed critic.P.S. -- If you want to see a terrific post-apocalyptic movie, don't miss ""The Road.""",The Book of Eli
350,Bart_OP,"The Road and The Book of Eli - wonderfully similar, wonderfully different",7,28 January 2010,"I wrote this essay for the 1/31/10 Sunday Bulletin at the University Parish in Tucson (of which I am the Pastor): I have to admit to liking movies with post-apocalyptic themes. The triumph of the human will or human spirit makes for good story telling. Whether it's overcoming the aftermath of some cataclysmic human folly (The Matrix, Terminator) or surviving the results of some natural disaster (2012), the potential is always there for a good story, even if the resulting movie is not always great. There have been a number of such movies recently and I found two particularly good and worthy of recommendation to you: The Road and The Book of Eli. These post-apocalyptic stories are wonderful in their common characteristics, but are made even more wonderful by their differences. Both left me feeling hopeful.The Film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road is very faithful to the novel. Set against a bleak backdrop of a world still reeling several years after an unspecified cataclysm, the story focuses on a father and son trying to make their way across the scorched land to an indeterminate ""south"" where they hope they will have a greater hope of survival. Hunger, thirst, and a seemingly never-ending winter are their primary obstacles. Every human being that they encounter in their journey is suspect because so many have survived by resorting to cannibalism. To the father, this represents the final loss of humanity and he is determined that he and his young son will never fall to it. The key to hope in this story is the love between the father and son. When I read the novel, I found that love so compelling that I could not put the book down, even though it is a hard story to read. The film captured that. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee were superb as the father and son. Their performances drew me into every anguish and triumph of the story.I kept expecting Denzel Washington's Eli to run into Viggo and Kodi while on his journey. Less ambiguously, The Book of Eli is set 30 years after an all-out nuclear war. Eli too is on a journey. Guided by a voice in his head (God? The Spirit?), he heads West across the western United States carrying a mysterious book. Like in The Road, cannibalism is a threat in the The Book of Eli, but there are many more non-cannibals and pockets of survivors. The key to resettlement is water; but water is not the resource around which the central conflict of this story revolves. The Book turns out to be the only surviving copy of the Bible – our Bible. In an interesting commentary on religion, it is revealed that all the Bibles were destroyed in the aftermath of the war because religion had been the cause of the war and its resulting death and destruction. Eli has become the guardian of the sole surviving copy of the Bible and protector of the power in the words. He is an unwitting evangelist who has so internalized the Word that it becomes the driving principle of his life. On the other side of the current conflict is Carnegie (played unevenly by Gary Oldman), a man who also recognizes the power of the Word and who will stop at nothing to possess it. He recognizes that the Bible is a powerful weapon and that whoever possesses that weapon, can control the hearts of men. The Book of Eli is a much more explicitly religious film than The Road, but both are filled with religious (even Christian) imagery and both are tales of the most Christian of themes: the triumph of the human person. (I have been saddened to see that some reviewers who like everything else about The Book of Eli downgrade it because of its explicit religious themes) Neither of these stories ends with the protagonist(s) walking off into a hope-signifying rising sun or blue sky. The landscape is every bit as bleak in the end as it was in the beginning. There are still obstacles to be overcome, enemies to vanquish, and miles to travel. The hope does not come in the form of a literal end to a dark night, but rather, the bright hope of the human experience and goodness of the human person. The rising sun at the end of these stories is in the human heart.Generally The Road is a much better film than The Book of Eli. Eli resorts to comic book violence and at one point I characterized the movie as ""The Road meets Mad Max."" – I did not intend it as a compliment. But both are well worth seeing – and discussing. Unfortunately, The Road has left local theatres, but will soon be available on DVD. The Book of Eli is still showing all around town.An aside – while we are on the topic of religious movies don't bother to see Legion, it is literally the worst movie I have seen in the last ten years!",The Book of Eli

The religious theme behind this was refreshing and uplifting. Many people will bring this movie down for having any kind of a religious plot but they can suck it up and enjoy the movie and stop trying to be ""that guy"" or ""girl"".The scenery was lovely for a wasteland of America, and was enough so that you could see certain beauty from it. The sound effects and bites used is what hurt this movie the most for me. There were a few parts where the sound was too overpowering and took away from the scene that was happening. The dialog was solid, a few silly parts in there but nothing to take away from the movie. There was one too many close up scenes that made you giggle, just because there was no need to be that close to show pain in someones face.There were however a few things unanswered and or holes that were a little sketchy but nothing too big that it was overly distracting. The end of the movie draged on and took away from the powering scene where Eli passes. The twist was not bad...if you were paying attention there was a ton of hints of his condition.

Even the supporting characters were there: Jennifer Beales as the Diva, Michael Gambon as the rather ineffectual Cornelius and Ray Stevenson as Aknot.Only, this movie lacked any of the originality or entertainment value of TFE. Washington was not bad, but he should never have played this part. I don't know if he IS of a religious bent, but even so he should have seen that this was a total parody of religious faith.As an avowed atheist, I hate movies that try to preach that religion is a good thing. It is not. If we had never been ruled by it, mankind might have achieved much more and might not have suffered the huge divisions that plague us to the present day. Still, we will never know.The one thing that I do know is that if there was ever a chance to get rid of religion for ever, then mankind should grab on to it with all our power. The logic holes in this movie have already been picked up by many other reviewers, so I am not going to repeat them here, no need. Suffice to say that this movie, while not the total depressive loss that The Road was, could have been so much better than it turned out; there is no big message here.

355,oscarlawren,Memory,8,18 February 2013,"The appeal of this picture, and some reviews testify to that, is that it contains familiar elements from our culture. It furthermore builds on doomsday-scenarios which have come into cultural existence since the invention of the Atomic bomb. Many a SciFiand horror movie in the fifties was filled with fantasies from after a nuclear strike. A more impressive cinematic attempt was On the Beac, after a book by Neville Shute. Nuclear destruction is the background of The book of Eli. In this movie it is referred to as the big Flash. It came about because of religious zealotry and the source was the Bible. Hence Eli finds himself surrounded by a culture of the depraved, a.o. cannibals or shakers. The horrors of hunger, famine and rape are generously scattered throughout this picture, with a wink of the eye when Eli and his companion meet an old crazy couple in the desert.. These horrors of famine belong to our romantic fantasies and narratives. Already in the 19th century they appealed to man's more primitive states of consciousness, take f.e. Gericault suggestive painting Raft of the Medusa. Our times and age are luckily not often haunted by stories about the recently shipwrecked who have eaten their companions. Culture is just one call from a cell phone away. And who can get lost with GPS-tracking? So the nuclear destruction is mainly the suggestive backdrop of the story. The hero in this movie is Eli, or Denzel Washington, the heroines are a blind woman and her daughter, slaves of the villain Carnegie, without any fine-lining. The magical has been rationally taken from the evil side by the story-writer, testifying to his solid modernity. He glosses over he magic, whereas in most man-eating cultures, eating the other was also gaining or submitting the other's qualities and powers, chewing the other was an act of superiority. So the plot is this: Carnegie is trying to find The book, and is desiring to use it to enslave a greater number of people.. Not just a village. This story builds on Rousseau's and Voltaire's perceptions about the social relevance of religion. Carnegie sees religion as a tool to structure civilization and control the ignorant. That is it? Religion, for dominating the dumb in a Nouveau Kansas, or Thugtown reborn...? This scenery has been put up to clarify the violent hunt for the Book of Eli. What we see is therefore a familiar landscape, a villainous gang not on a horse going for the gold, but rogues on bikes going for a rare book, serving Carnegie, the book-collector who is hoping to complete his education to power.. But Eli is in the way, he also refuses to stay, but he possesses the desired object. What ensues is this: a struggle, battles, and people get killed brutally.. Heads and hands are chopped off. A variation of the hunt for the treasure? Well, on the psychological level you have the archetypes of the warrior-sage, Eli, and the wicked king, Carnegie. That is truly a biblical motive. And then there is the metaphysical element, yes too.. This picture addresses several topics and that makes it interesting. Really interesting. This is foremost, I think, the story about a man who follows his prophetic nature and the voice in his head who tells him to go west. His inner compass tells him where to go. No budging from this road and inspiration. As a result Eli travels across America, a journey which takes 30 years to complete. And during that time Eli reads and rereads his bible, meditates on it and acts with great concentration. From a book, not condoned by the culture as that time knows it. Near the end of his story Elis surrenders his book, but continues to go west, accompanied by a young girl. In the last 20 minutes or so, the story unravels and is structured along a more optimistic viewpoint. Eli has come to rest among group of real men, evolved civilized humanoids, set on restoring civilization.. Eli's contribution to that project is the Bible he memorized. Eli returns the Scriptures to the world not as the physical object, but as something he took to his heart. And Eli has memorized the Scriptures on more than one level. To sum up the last sketchy part of the picture: Eli is hurt, without the book, saved by the Lord, helped by the girl, heading West after the struggle with Carnegie and his men. His destination is the prison of Alcatraz, and there he comes to meet his optimistic destiny. And recites the Bible from memory. We are shown in suggestive seconds that the prison has become a storehouse for culture, the prison thus as a paradise, the home of Alcatraz Press, whereas the world in general has become the prison. What becomes of the vile king Carnegie and his new book? The bible Eli surrendered to Carnegie is a peculiar book without words, a book with punctuated dots, braille for the blind. The irony is that the blind woman, Carnegie's slave, who might read it, states she no longer can read it. She tells Carnegie it is too long since she has read these kind of books, and then she smiles.. Only a blind woman can give Carnegie access to the Book of Eli and she denies him that access. His project to construct a new slave-state on the Book of Eli is therefore doomed. This is not a mad max picture but a story about inspiration that is self-threatening. Perhaps not a great work of art, but still with many complex strands, containing worthwhile ideas. Expanding these ideas dramatically was a hell of a job, but still a worthwhile project for those who want to look beyond their obvious ideas about entertainment and dashing narrative structures. Or: Is your life's inspiration and inner voice a 30 year's travel worth?",The Book of Eli

Sometimes, as in this case, a film can ask and prompt the audience to create their own explanation, after all, its why we have imagination right? Denzel puts in an accomplished performance as per usual, and why Gary Oldman, the perpetual criminal/bad guy in Hollywood is ever so slightly hammy, it's not a bad pairing off, with the old cliché of the hero being based on morals, knowledge, strength and skill, with the villain basing his skill set purely on intelligence and man power.The soundtrack and score is superb, one of the best if not the best this year, setting the mood nicely, and helping the film ease along it's way.It's a film no doubt which will derive mixed reviews, as it's mixed in itself, starting off truly dark, then bordering into the comical, with an ending that isn't deserved of the movie itself (and I mean the VERY end).All in all, in my humble opinion, beautifully made film, with Denzel Washington in typically excellent form (I can't remember the last bad film he appeared in), and I would recommend it to anyone as one of the few great films of 2010.",The Book of Eli

I disagree with some reviewers that claim this movie to be religious propaganda. Yes, the book of Eli is a bible but that's what makes it different from the old ""wander and kill to survive"" that we usually see on post apocalyptic films. It has its share of wandering and killing with great fight scenes and Denzel Washington's performance is quite good. I admit there are some continuity issues with the shooting, but that's expected from any action movie. It's a great lesson about faith, but please, people, don't take this literally.

360,samuel-84,Look past the controversial themes and find a decent action movie.,6,4 July 2010,"SYNOPSIS: The earth is left in a post apocalyptic state from what seems like a final religious war that happened 30 years before our story starts. Typically for this genre, resources are scarce, people are disorganized and lawless and murderous gangs roam the abandoned highways. There is no government or religion.We meet Eli (Washington), a resourceful loner with special abilities who has survived in the wasteland for over 30 years by dispensing of the heads of those who try and do him harm. Believing he his has been tasked with a mission from God, his faith allows him achieve some pretty questionable feats and guides him on a route that takes him through a small town run by a rather immoral businessman called Carnegie (Oldman). Carnegie is searching for a Bible to access words to help him control the remaining people. After the war, people burned bibles to prevent another religious war from happening. None have been found for 30 years and not many elderly people remain and the youth have no idea of religion.Carnegie learns that Eli may have what he wants and the struggle to get it unfolds producing some great fight scenes.ACTING: Washington is decent and Oldman does a great good job with Carnegie. The rest of the roles are convincing.CINEMATOGRAPHY/PRODUCTION VALUE: The production value is good and the sets are convincing. I particularly enjoyed the opening scene which provided a excellent view of the bleak environment and resource shortage.FINAL THOUGHTS: Gary Whitta's script has some major flaws in it which make the direction of the movie difficult. Twists that arguably may should have been omitted as they removed credibility from the film. If you are able to look past the clichéd religious comments, you have a pretty decent action movie that is best enjoyed for some great fight scenes. 6/10",The Book of Eli

It's an intriguing tale about a man in post-apocalyptic America walking west to deliver an initially unnamed book. The fact that he's been doing so under the most bleak of circumstances for 30 years is a testament to his strong faith and determination to complete the task. The movie has a good amount of action...Eli can handle himself and takes down any of the deranged lunatics who try to get in his way in crowd pleasing fashion. The core of the movie occurs when he stops at a small town ruled by Gary Oldman's evil character and his merciless motorcycle riding thugs. The ensuing confrontation is yet another test of Eli's faith. The movie contains a surprise ending that will make you say, ""WTF""??? and is absolutely impossible, but makes you think back over the entire film and want to watch it again. Denzel Washington, as Eli, is outstanding and he exhibits the amazing charisma he brings to all of his roles. The movie is well cast, and it was great seeing the fine Jennifer Beals (""Flashdance"") on the big screen again. The Hughes Brothers are excellent directors, and I love the diversity of their body of work, from ""Menace to Society"" to ""From Hell"".

364,ValianceInEnd,Not just another post-apocalyptic thriller.,8,19 January 2010,"Upon first viewing the trailer I was immediately giddy to see a new post-apocalyptic film in the vein of The Road Warrior. Being a fan of the genre, one must get used to the repetitive ""lone wanderer"" theme so prominently used. I figured this film would go through the same formula, but prepared to enjoy myself.Yes it did use the lone wanderer as a driving plot device, and yes it did bring the arbitrary twist. Yes all the survivors are short on t-shirts, but live in a wealth of leather and goggles. Yes everything in this film looks like and feels like a typical post-apocalyptia. But the substance of the story is far more powerful then I could ever have expected.Without giving away too much, yes the film is essentially a Christian metaphor. Eli seems to be protected by some mysterious force, guided by ""God"" to head west. But it's what the meaning behind this admittedly bizarre plot that makes this film so great. It truly is a film about faith and believing in one's self. Using the dreary post-apocalyptic backdrop, the film is able to contrast this powerful message with the harsh landscape. Even amidst such despair, one can rise and accomplish anything. In a world slowly becoming apocalyptic itself, this message is much welcomed.The other aspects lending to the power of The Book of Eli are its technical aspects. The cinematography is simply beautiful. Moody slo-mo shots abound with wonderfully toned colors. Everything looks dark and dead, the sun beating down endlessly on the dusty dunes. The soundtrack adds immensely to this feeling, using soft ambient chords and blasting action-scene drums when necessary. Overall The Book of Eli is an excellent film itself and an excellent spin on the post-apocalyptic genre.

This movie though to me really perfected the idea of how it would look and getting the sense of feeling of our characters due to events not seen, only heard from sad telling. Some of the action scenes are a little lacking in the department and I believe that is what makes this film not the most epic. Seeing Denzel swing his trusty blade will send anyone for a cheer. Gary Oldman does a great job as always being a villain for once in a long time.

I watched it on HBO because I was tired of the repeats of The First 48 and I'm not that brain dead to want to watch any episode of ""Hot in Cleveland."" The film was meant as mindless filler. And some of it truly is. There's a preposterous-ness running all through it: That having a Bible will actually bring people together and save the human race, especially when, even in it's own script, belief in god brought the destruction in the first place. That after 30 years a second generation Ipod would actually still work when it never lasted more than 18 months in reality. That any song written by the Bee Gees would still be attractive after the apocalypse. That there were be so many strapping, healthy men living on what? Is there really much protein in water and alcohol? That a woman would be wearing a plaid shirt that looked like it just came off the rack at Urban Outfitters. That sunglasses that old would look so pristine. My sunglasses are scratched by end of the first day I wear them. The costume designer obviously was either just out of high school and/or should be fired. But, somehow, they managed to set aside enough money to pull in some decent folks to give it moments of life. It's a long, slow movie, with no new ideas except for the main twist and what the cinematographer and musician managed to do was make this a very attractive piece to keep you gawking. The camera work is top-notch and some of the ""intentionally"" cartoon-ish fight scenes have inspiration in them. Best of all, Denzel Washington decided to discard that annoying ""Malcolm X"" performance he's been sporting for 20 years. I was starting to believe the he was going the route of Al Pacino who generally faxes in his same, screaming, emoting performance. But Denzel does fine here. He's pulled back and it fits the ""semi"" passivity of his character. Gary Oldman does his usual rat performance, nothing more. The art direction, unfortunately, goes from excellent to awful as though some scenery was pulled directly out of the stock room but there are glimpses of a better picture. The shootout at the wooden house and it's surrounding story is killer. It's not on even keel though. The ending should have simply been the printing press. NO FURTHER. There was no reason to show Eli's grave marker that was obviously bought from ""SkyMall"" on JetBlue. It looked like it should have had a water feature or a gnome with it. And, what, they have expert stone chiselers on Alcatraz now? And, how original is it to have a main character fade into the sunset?

People killing and dying over books. And ignoring the key messages of the books as they justify it.

The movie is mysterious and leaves you to do a lot of thinking. It leaves you to discover things on your own. Something that recent movies do not seem to do. They seem to think we are slow and point out every plot point right in front of us. The acting is great. When has Denzel not been great in his role. The movie can suck but it will still be entertaining just because of him. Gary Oldman finally gets to be bad guy after being our favorite from the Batman films and Harry Potter. He does great in this role and helps us make ourselves hate him. Mila Kunis does well but she doesn't do anything to special. The weakest part of the movie is probably her walking away into the sunset. They tried to make it a cool ending setting it up for a sequel but I just heard myself saying, ""Who cares about you?"". The movie puts us into a new world a world after a nuclear war and the movie puts many things into perspective. Things we take for granted we start to care about more and understand how important it is and how much we need it. Maybe I am biased because I am a Christian and maybe you are biased against the movie because you are not. It delivers a great Christian message but hides it in an awesome action movie that the rest of the public can also watch and enjoy. That is what is so great about it.

Then throw in a quasi-religious, confused subtext laid on thick & cheesy, change the zombies back into humans who act like zombies, and you get the Book of Eli.Apparently after we humans atom-bombed each other into oblivion, the remaining survivors were sufficiently focused and high-minded to organize a Bible burning, then immediately thereafter started killing, raping, and eating cats.Despite the lack of proper sustenance, even water, the remaining humans are sufficient in number to organize into old-West-type settlements with plentiful stockpiles of guns AND ammo, even 30 years after apparently everything else in the world (including gun manufacturers?) is blown up.A man emerges, equipped both with kick-ass fighting skills and invincibility power-ups he ostensibly acquired while roaming the land after the fall of humanity, AND an iPod, which still works after 30 YEARS (yayyy, Apple?!?!) and whose batteries only require a recharge when he nears a town.This is just the first 5-10 minutes.

The only different guy seems to be Eli. He does not just take possessions away from the weaker but tries to remain civilized or to follow whatever has remained in memory from what people used to call civilization. But why does Eli act differently? Is he one of the few ""civilized"" survivors who didn't yet completely lose the habits of the old world? Or is this ""civilized"" behavior just another, maybe smarter, strategy for a particular goal? But what is different in Eli's case is that the goal is not his survival but rather the book's survival. Eli is just a medium for the book and he is prepared to do whatever it takes to do in order to bring the book to its destination. But isn't just this type of behavior, acting in a symbolic role (as a medium, soldier, priest, politician, businessman), what brought the end of the old world in the first place?

Washington played his usual gruff take no crap from anybody attitude. I cant believe i forced myself to sit & finish this movie really. The whole thing seemed unguided 2 me. First of all, whoever said its OK 2 kill @ will and not have anything to fight for besides some book? The bible, the bible has bn shown 2 manipulate ppl & thats what Gary Oldman & his gang were after, 2 control his ppl as every leader wants. To me its even more ridiculous to think of Eli as a weapon of force, weapon for what? A bible that was wiped out 2 protect future generations from having something 2 claim they have rights 2 slave, kill, murder virgins, incest, mess with order of family, human sacrifice, etc. Movie should have made a bigger point about why people destroyed all the bibles. If there was no more bibles than people would have to finally reach out to people & not force ideas man made from random authors. The main concern of this movie 2 me is its lack of disguising its true hate for people who need the truth. Why does Eli have to pass an obviously ruined town with lack of morals, & go 2 SF 2 hand the torch to some already well sustained society as God supposedly led him? Its contradicting what Eli & God tells, you must help the weak & reach out to others in need in order to fulfill my destiny. So Eli doesn't even try to kill Oldman but does wipe out his bad guys & just leaves town in dirt like U.S. has done with Iraq & many other foreign countries, its all about forcing something that seems to be of higher law upon morally unbalanced places. People need to look within themselves & not fight for some book that is nothing more than forged words & lies.This disgusted me most, it really downplayed the good parts, mainly the action. Still didn't get why the old cannibalistic couple was in this movie other than 2 stall fate of Oldman's greed. I don't mind Oldman, i actually liked him since he knew what he wanted and did everything fairly & didn't claim 2 have any power from above or within as Eli does. Other side-notes, the movie stalled when it didn't need to & it seemed unnecessary to make Eli blind to me, it only represents his true blindness to not helping others when he could have & he almost missed his chance with Mila Kunis, but saves her somehow.

377,psychoartus,"Film isn't bad, but it does have flaws",7,24 July 2010,"by mindselfDenzel Washington is a versatile actor. He fought in the Civil War as Private Trip in Glory, He played the human rights activist, Malcolm X, in Spike Lee's Malcolm X, and he was the corrupt narcotics officer, Detective Alonzo Harris, in Training Day. He's an accomplished actor who's always charismatic and always finds depth in his roles, even if he's playing the villain. His latest role in The Book of Eli is no different.The film follows Eli, played by Washington, as a lone wonderer protecting a book that may be the last hope of man kind. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world 30 years in the future. It doesn't explain what lead the apocalyptic event, but instead moves forward and leaves the audience guessing what happen, which I like. Throughout the film Eli is face with many challenges. Besides surviving without the needs of food and shelter, he is confronted by countless scoundrels who tries to stop him. Of course, Washington's ability to fight is never in question, so usually his attackers end up on the ground unconscious or dead.Eli ends up in a small town run by Gary Oldman, who plays the antagonist, Carnegie. Carnegie is looking for the book which Eli has possession of. I don't want to connect the dots and make it too obvious but I think you know what's going to happen next. Eli refuse to give the book and all hell is broken loose. Also, along the way Eli is befriended by Solara, played by Mila Kunis.The Hughes brothers wonderfully directed the film. The grey and dull palette that covers the film fits the mood of what a post-apocalyptic world should look like. I also like the touch of how the world looks like an old western film. Actually there are many references to old westerns. The way Washington walks through the town or how Oldman is the corrupted official running the town. All that's missing are some horses. As for the action, I must hand it to the Hughes brothers for the well choreograph fight sequences. You can't deny the people who brought us Menace II Society and Dead Presidents, the action here is amazing and exhilarating. There are couple of action sequences where I can't stop to think that the Hughes brothers were inspired by Hiroyuki Nakano and Michael Bay, yes Michael Bay. Nonetheless, they were awesome sequences, especially the Michael Bayesque Mexican standoff set piece. The story isn't bad also. It's written by the once game designer, Gary Whitta. This could have been a knock off from a Mad Max film instead we get somewhat an original story that is told with a good narrative and dialogue. Unless you're an atheist then you'll probably understand the religious content more. The score of Atticus Ross is also good. It's ghostly and hypnotizing which plays off very well in the film. The song ""Panoramic"" is a great example of how he captures the bleak tone perfectly.Most of the acting is good, especially from Washington and Oldman. If anything, they saved the film from being too silly. You get a small but humorous cameo by Tom Waits. My only problem is Mila Kunis, she technically ruins it for me. Besides one set piece, Kunis is wasted and seem out of place. She seem like she's a model for Forever 21. Everyone has dry skin and dressed like salvages but Kunis manage to have great skin with make-up and clothing that's too fashionable. Not believable at all. She's not a bad actor, I just think she's miscast.Overall the film isn't bad, but it does have flaws. If you can dismiss the plot holes and the ridiculous last act, which I love, than you'll enjoy the film. You can watch it for it's deep message, lack thereof, or watch it because Denzel is kicking some ass. Either way, you'll have a great time.",The Book of Eli

I knew after seeing the book of eli there would be a lot people who felt pure hatred towards it just for that reason. Why? Who cares if it was about god, it's just a movie. Casting it away on personal beliefs is just pure ignorance. I'm amused at the people who use words like ""absurd"" and ""ridiculous"" to explain how unbelievable the storyline turned out to be. I bet half of these people(at least) when on to write positive reviews about spiderman, superman, batman and whatever else. Oh sure, because its completely plausible for peter parker to swing from buildings with spider webs he shoots from his wrists.

379,tkaczyk-m,Cliché at every step,3,24 January 2010,"Gary Oldman and Denzel Washington. Hell - it should to be a decent film! Yea. Should be, but it isn't. In every aspect.Denzel plays Eli, an unnamed protagonist, who walks through the USA since the incident (flash/war - call it whatever you want) - 30 years or so (really, that long? no idea of trying to acquire a vehicle?). You don't ever get any serious info about his background nor the war itself. He just walks. He's not a character. He's just a delivery man.But he's one badass man. Kills with his huge knife or guns. No questions asked. A post-apocalyptic badass. And incredibly boring one.If you have any experience in action films, you'll guess the next thing to happen almost always during this one. Oh yeah - a woman, in the middle of nothing. ""can you help me?"". tits out. Cliché one.We enter a city. Orbiting around one man's agenda (Oldman). He needs something, a book. And Eli's got one. Soooo... yeah. He wants it. Cliché two.A young one. Meets Eli. Fascinated. Sent to convince him by offering some interesting services. Of course he refuses. Cliché three.He leaves, wreaks havoc upon departure. The young one follows. He doesn't want it. But finally the team up. Cliché four.And so on and so on.It's a movie without any serious pace, predictable from the beginning. There aren't any twists to be honest. At first you wonder about the books title, then you know that Oldman won't get what he wants. He'll be devoured by his actions to obtain it.Denzel doesn't even try to act, Oldman tries a bit but there is absolutely nothing to stimulate his character. Mila Kunis just... looks. Yea, we do get an idea, that her rack is a decent one, but hey... is that all that she's supposed to do (well, I laughed hard at the film's ending - that's regarding her character).It's a boring, very long and hm... boring movie? It's crap. Really. I could tell this story in about 15 minutes, but instead we get over 1,5h long something trying to be a moral journey. Many have shown what people would do and surely will do in such a case scenario - kill each other without regrets. But why make a movie about it? The only reasons I can up with are Denzel's and Gary's salaries. Nothing else. Because besides their benefit from this thing, there are absolutely no reasons to make such a movie. While I still recognize Oldman as an actor, Washington has lately become the man who goes in, does his job without bigger ado and collects the paycheck. And that's exactly like that movie. Totally crap.",The Book of Eli
380,timmyjmcc,Missing Something,4,7 June 2010,"Denzel is a great actor. Oldman is a great actor. This is not a great movie. This is not a good movie. This is a want to be futuristic after the big flash B-movie that has really good actors in it, and a great message. Yes, the message of religion. That is the best part of the movie without doubt, the message. Something happened along the way, however, that stopped this movie from being something more than big actors in a big budget B written, or at least B delivered, film. They say sometimes that the writer wrote a great script and the actors signed on and then the studios got involved or producers or someone along the line and it just got watered down or B'ed out. This could well be the case. Don't know. How could we know, we're only subjected to the final project. The message is powerful and by no means am I a religious man, but that aspect is presented well. Something's missing. Could the town of sin been more exciting or maybe that would have just been more gratuitous in nature. Something was missing or empty. Not meaning the sets or the feeling that you get after the flash, but something was missing. Open Road had that feeling of abandonment as far as the setting, even more so than The Book of Eli, but Open Road had that pulse or substance that satisfies and it was somewhat of a tragedy. But a couple of days later, after seeing Open Road I felt that was a movie that was delivered ""with"" substance, The Book of Eli wasn't.

As usual Denzel Washington plays his intelligent, motivated, and unforgiving character that we are used to seeing him play.

Hope is gone, devastation abounds and mans cruelty rules as God's rule has been forgotten. There is no education which brings structure to society or civility.

Why the New Testament, and not the Old, would be the savior to mankind is a bit of a reach, for me, as a philosopher and a scholar. (And there is no explanation in the film, either.)('The Lord is my Shephard...' is in Psalms 23 - which is in the third part of the old testament. That is the quote he reads to Solara in the cave...)So, the point being to get a copy of the 'King Jame's Bible' to the West, when there is already a translation there of the Jewish scriptures, seems to overlook the entire point of the Bible, and its influence through History, in general.And, there was NO explanation of the importance of the new testament as opposed to the old. So that final scene, where we see the 'English' Tanahk on the bookshelf, totally destroys the entire plot and premise of the entire film!That being said, I still enjoyed the film, and the big reveal at the end about Denzel (not gonna say here!) was pretty cool and would even enjoin me to watch the film again, if the plot was not so ridiculously and fundamentally flawed.",The Book of Eli
384,haydnlawrence-18649,Good movie even with the propaganda,6,25 January 2016,"Overall, as a movie, I think it is well done. The acting is average or above, the action is good, and there is a strong story line.Obviously the biggest issue with the movie is the insanely obviously Christian propaganda within it. This has people, both Christians and Atheists, voting on it more so based on just this. As an Atheist myself, I assume the Bible is a work of fiction, so it works perfectly into this movie and makes for a very interesting background and lore for it. Anyway, I watched it again just to make sure, but in the end I feel the people who give this movie low scores based on the religiousness of it didn't think critically about it. Maybe it's just me, but I found that the entire premise and unfolding story actually told us that religion, especially organized religion, is one of the most dangerous things out there and should be left out of a society attempting to rebuild. I doubt the people who wrote, directed, and produced it would agree though :)",The Book of Eli

The world is in disarray and civilisation appears to have been catapulted back into the Stone Age. The setting is great, and is perfect for a great story. As in most situation like these, near extinction of the species makes for big conflict, and bigger heroes. The book of Eli is no exception, during his travels Eli comes across all manner of bandits and desperate individuals, very reminiscent of the Mad Max scenarios, right down to a character missing a hand actually.Without giving away too much, I will say this; it is clear from the beginning that Eli is a man driven by something pretty serious. He is a man of few words, but his actions speak volumes. I cannot comment on the score of movie, because I don't really remember hearing much music, but this is not to say that it did not have one, simply that maybe the movie did not even need one. At first glance, the movie feels a little shallow, but turns out to be anything but. I say watch it.The story is good, plausible and you will connect with it.

The locations seemed similar to any post catastrophe with all barren lands all around no trace of any greenery.One thing which intrigued me was the availability of gas for their vehicles.How could they get gas? Other than this aspect i felt the movie was very well directed and obviously acted by Denzel sir. he did a really good job.this movie could be very much accepted and liked by people who had deep faith in god. The bible means a lot to them and i think every religious guy after watching this movie would surely try to safeguard some aspects of bible or their religion which shows the importance of religion and faith.the climax can be validated by the fact that he had faith on god.Denzel Washington looked very different in his look but he was handsome.

This proved to be something else: A stranger on a journey with incredible survival skills with a book capable of immense change and has been the subject of intense counterculture and has changed the world and lives for thousands of years. Of course, it could only be The Bible. And a battle ensues to capture the book and the power of the convicting words in that manuscript which also guide Eli's life.There are things you should have seen from the opening minutes of the film that you are going to miss until the end. This warrants a second watching. For instance, the movie all but tells you that Eli is blind from the opening scenes but you may not realize that until the end.

392,jameshull86,Man on a Mission,8,10 February 2010,"First off, I am not a Bible person, I need to make that quite clear. So this isn't stemming from a need to convert the world to Christianity. Last time I was in church was Christmas Eve mass. Time before that was my older brother's wedding last summer (let's see how long that lasts ;-). And before that it was Christmas Eve mass the year before that. So when I went to see Book of Eli it wasn't to praise the Lord, but to see people get whup-ass-kicked by Denzel Washington, plain and simple. The trailer showed him take out a room of tough guys and I was like, okay, I gotta see that one, and I did. When I left the movie I thought it was kind of a B action movie with a movie star in it, and I wondered why Denzel took the movie. And then a day or two later I kind of forgot all about the action moments in the movie and remembered—or actually realized—the focus of the movie. This guy was on a mission, and if whupping ass from time to time was part of the job requirement, well, so be it, but it was about the mission to spread the word of the Bible, and what gave him the strength to carry on against the odds. Yeah, I know, sounds like I'm going to get religious and try to sell you a Bible—don't worry, I'm not. But as odd as it might seem, I feel like maybe I'm missing something in my life, and that may be religion or may be a mission. Either way, I guess the movie kind of drew me in to watch it for one reason and then tailspun me into thinking about it's message. I'm out of college and just living off the land, so to speak, but maybe I need to go out there, on a mission, and find God. Or maybe I just need to go out there and get Denzel on somebody and open up a can of whup-ass upside their head. Just kidding. But movie left me thinking that I need to get my business, and degree, in order and become a 'man on a mission'.",The Book of Eli
393,Bruce_Stern,Apocalyptic visuals; Fine acting; Confusing story,6,20 January 2010,"It's thirty years after an earthly holocaust. A lone man strides determinedly along a two-lane blacktop with a knapsack on his back. The visuals are sepia-toned--brown, like the desolate landscape. Then, the confusion begins. Is he protecting what little he has on his back? What's with the bad-ass sword he wields? What's he doing with the leather-bound and locked book he reads from? Why does he keep to himself? Why doesn't he give up the tangible treasure early in the story, when it becomes clear at the end of the story he didn't need it in the first place, accept as an apparent excuse to demonstrate his weapons prowess throughout the rest of the movie? Is this a good vs. evil story? Is it a story justifying violence for greater good? Is this a movie about keeping a special message from evils hands and minds to prevent the messages' corruption? Is it about means justifying ends? Does the story want us to believe that some preservation of a particular philosophical message warrant whatever behavior is necessary to preserve that message? Why is the message appealing, and so much so that it captivates listens of a small part of it immediately, especially those without any apparent ethical or moral education? And, as the movie shows, why couldn't the message be construed as being destructive, rather than constructive, or even uplifting? The Book of Eli presents too many conflicting messages for this viewer of it to have a handle any clear message to take away from my watching of it, despite enjoying Denzel Washington's performance and the visuals of its camera-work.",The Book of Eli
394,theworstseats,God survives the apocalypse,8,25 January 2010,"Post apocalyptic films exist to show you what really matters. Water, giant knives, cults, rape, cannibalism, bald henchmen and incest are all crucial. Luckily for timid Denzel fans, the Hughes brothers (From Hell, Menace II Society) decided to focus less on rape and more on religion for their newest film The Book of Eli.With a plot rotating around the central tenet that a world without any religion is a savage, hopeless one, The Book of Eli has Denzel Washington cast as a lone wanderer named Eli whose only purpose is to deliver an unknown book to an unknown location 'In the west'.Adding mystery to intrigue and wrapping it around a knife the size of a skateboard are Eli's phenomenal, yet unexplained combat abilities, as well as the fact he has apparently been looking for this place for 30 years so far. As you can imagine the long trek has made him very tetchy, and he uses his knife/sword/skateboard to maim and slay anyone attempting to stop him, even popping a few that only looked like they might. He's that serious.Alongside Washington as the futuristic crusader, The Book of Eli has veteran bad guy Gary Oldman in a superb turn as Carnegie, Eli's nemesis, and a man who will go to any lengths to get the book for himself. On the other hand, Mila Kunis pretty much phones in her role as Eli's intensely irritating sidekick Solara, although she certainly isn't helped by mental images of Family Guy's Meg popping up every time she speaks.The biggest problem with The Book of Eli is without a doubt its deeply Christian undertones. At times it feels like the audience are being preached to rather than entertained and it is only Washington's on- screen charisma that keeps his character from becoming genuinely abrasive at times. Of course, if you don't have a problem with intense religious dogma, this film is unremittingly wonderful.Aside from the religious self-righteousness, and couple of heavily signposted twists (around 2 out of 10 Shyamalans), The Book of Eli is a joy to watch. Action set-pieces are done in a stark comic-book style, perfectly suited to the apocalyptic setting, while the Hughes brothers' use of a washed out palette of browns and blacks in their set creation conjures up an atmosphere more akin to a spaghetti western than a barren grey desert like that of recent fun-fest The Road.",The Book of Eli
395,MrKlette,Clouds and Courage,9,8 March 2010,"When I went to the cinema to see 'The Book of Eli' I did not expect very much. I was looking forward to a post-apocalyptic road-movie - and that I got. But there was more to it. First, there is the underlying tale of the whole thing - the one who is ready to sacrifice not only himself, but also his ambitions, who is ready to let go of the very object he is striving to protect, does not only stay true to the spirit of that same object, but reaches salvation, meaning the only named grave to be seen in the movie, while the bad guy may reach his goals but will, finally, find them hollow and inane. And whether you believe in this message or not, it works as a tale to tell. The second point I want to make is visuals. Personally, long time being a fan of the Fallout-Computer-Games-Series, I admired the settings of this movie, the former-civilized lands, the broken roads and struggling new settlements. But even more so the shots of the landscape and, above all, the sky. There are those shots that are the markings of all those great Western-movies - and 'The Book of Eli' has them, along with a few that literally pull the rug out from under the audience, while at the same time foreboding the same fate for the characters. Finally, the third thing, besides all the good standards like performances, music etc., that makes 'The Book of Eli' an outstanding movie, is the courage it takes to tell a story that leads to a final twist, a little surprise for the audience, and to allude to this very twist from the first scene onwards, for the audience to forebode. And the courage it takes to tell a story that requires the viewers to accept the necessity to believe in its core as well as message, since unless one does, it does not really seem to fit.",The Book of Eli

I can't say much about the plot because it'll ruin the surprises. And sorry, for those who complains about the theme (the object of the movie that Eli is protecting), I'm sorry, everyone is entitled to an opinion and each one of us have it's all beliefs, so don't get me started on an endless discussion about that because I'm not interested.All I can say is that the plot of the movie is intense and entertaining at the same time. Be sure to book a place on your DVD shelf for this movie because it have a strong potential to become a cult movie.I went this last Sunday to see the movie and I'll see it once again because it's been since ""The Wrestler"" that a movie didn't touch me the way this one did.

397,esalackstrom,"Couple good, but short, action sequences and strong acting compensates for a shallow plot.",7,27 October 2019,"Without the always fabulous Gary Oldman this movie would be much more run-of-the-mill. The plot itself centers around Eli, a man who carries a mysterious book to the west. An interesting premise but it falls short quite quickly. There's a small town, commanded by Gary Oldman who is obsessed with finding a certain book. Unbeknownst to either one of them about their goals, they cross paths and this is where the film lost it's appeal and mystery. It turned into a run-of-the-mill dystopian movie with predictable plot and events.The few fights this movie had, were great, although short.no quick editing and good choreography. Not enough to justify this as an action movie though. I personally didn't feel Denzel character, he was cold and emotionless but Gary Oldman gave me a reason to watch this until the end. His portrayal of the small town dictator was great to watch.I presumed more from this movie since i heard the name often, and few of my friends have recommended this, but i personally found it just mediocre. There wasn't a deep plot, nothing surprising really, no great mystery. Without Gary Oldman's chops i'd given this movie a 5/10.

398,fat_dude_007,STOP! Please?,4,16 January 2010,"Let me start off by saying that i wanted to like this movie. I like post apocalyptic movies. I like the idea of a desolate wasteland full of raiders. I even liked the premise of this post apocalypse movie, man all alone on a mission from god and no one is going to stop him. The beginning of this movie was awesome. We get a great sense of Eli and the land he is living in. Eli is a lone wolf in this huge desolate world. He doesn't need anybody else, and he doesn't want anybody else. The only thing he wants is to get ""the book"" to the west.As Eli is making his journey, we see the how crude this world has become. Raiders litter the place setting up around every corner waiting to take advantage of the weak. But Eli by no means is weak. The action scenes in this movie were very well done. Eli is an absolute 100 percent bad ass, and the movie does a good job showing this. The only criticizing thing I'll say about the action scenes, the camera does not need to be going around a loop to watch Eli kick ass, it's a little annoying.As Eli continues his trip to the west, he walks through a small town, owned by Carnegie. Carnegie, as we find out, has employed many of the raiders to go around looking for ""the book"". None of the raiders have any idea what book he is talking about, probably has something to do with the fact that not one of the raiders can even read, and just go around pillaging and taking all the books they can find. Eli walks into Carnegie's bar and asks for a bottle of water, while the guy across the street fixes something very important for him. We see Mila Kunis (notice i did not use her characters name) go fetch the bottle of water. While she is doing that, a raider picks a fight with the bad ass known as Eli. Another great fight scene, followed by the most important line in the film. MILA KUNIS: STOP! please? (NOTE: SORRY TO MILA KUNIS FANS) Cue line to stop movie. Mila Kunis's character is just stupid, and to be honest, if you just left her out of the film, or at least in the spring, this film gets better. Her character felt like a joke. She creates her own plot hole by being this dumb. When Carnegie asks if she had talked to Eli in a later scene, she says no, and follows this line by asking for her mom's hands and starts a prayer. The plot hole? She has been living with Carnegie almost her entire life and has not once done a prayer! Why would she start now! Or after lying to the boss man, START PRAYING! IT'S SO STUPID!Now, if you can get past Mila Kunis, which i could not, you would of probably enjoyed this film. ""The book"" has a great deeper meaning. It has the power to save, and destroy. I really like the reason Carnegie wanted ""the book"", so he can control everybody like his servants and claimed it was a weapon, it shows you the true power of religion. When Eli talks about what the older generations thought about ""the book"" is an even more powerful scene, if you ask me. He is referring to this generation, and we all have our say on ""the book."" So by the end of the movie, i really have it on the teeter. it's not bad, but it's not that great. Not bad because of the interesting story, good acting by both Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman, Good directing by the Hughes Brothers, i really felt involved with the story. Not great because of Mila Kunis, yeah no other reason. Then came the end. I don't want to ruin it, but when you see it, COME ON. HE WAS SO NOT!",The Book of Eli
399,ProfRevDrFilmReligionHistory,Inter-texting par excellence,8,20 April 2017,"The Book of Eli features a post-apocalyptic wanderer and his treasured book. In fact, Eli's book turns out to be a rarity and the object of some envy and contention. Eli enters a town run by the despotic Carnegie. Carnegie wants the book to gain power and control people. When one of his henchman questions how a book can have such effect, Carnegie yells: ""It's not an effing book; it's a weapon!"" Eli, similarly, comes to objectify the book, albeit not as a weapon.At one key point in the film, Eli confesses to his co-traveler, Solara: ""All these years I've been carrying it...I forgot to live what I learned from it."" From the juxtaposition of Carnegie's and Eli's conceptions of the book, it's possible to surmise that the Hughes brothers want at least to communicate the point that ultimately this book is only as good or as bad as the people who use it. That's not a bad takeaway.This film features a great deal of clever interplay with the book, its contents, and the possessors of the book. In fact, this film does ""inter-texting"" like no other.It's all there in the double-meaning of the movie's title: The Book of Eli.In the most obvious sense, the ""of"" in ""book OF Eli"" is possessive. It's the physical book that Eli possesses, reads, memorizes, carries, protects.At the same time, because he has carried the book for so long (30 years!) he has had time to learn its entire contents by heart. In this sense, Eli has become the book, he IS the book. (Grammatically speaking, here the ""of"" in The Book of Eli functions as a genitive of apposition.) The double meaning of the book ""OF"" Eli sets up the ironic ending of the film. It also helps you understand the evolution of Solara, who begins as an unread novice but evolves into a book of her own.Perhaps there will be a sequel: ""The Book of Solara""?",The Book of Eli

Our hyper-capitalistic, free market system is still inculcating and disseminating lies & propaganda; we can survive the scourge. Moreover amidst this insanity we are told the word of God is giving more that taking. Why do we need Hollywood to tell us this simple truth. Could this very juggernaut instill other psychosocial integration, as opposed to dislocation? After watching the Road I was depressed, after watching the book of Eli, I believe there is still good, even if its co-opted by the very evil which created it.

402,echodaxx12,why such bad reviews?,7,20 January 2011,"***spoilers!*** 1)this movie was great. so many people have criticized it for it's Christian propaganda.however, not many people criticized the 2008 remake of the day the earth stood still for being environmentalist propaganda. not many people criticized avatar for being anti-military propaganda.(please note i have not read every single review ever made of these two movies) 2)alot of people noticed the ""plot hole"" or ""error"" of how it took 30 years for Eli to walk west to Alcatraz. but,as i recall, he never said he had been traveling for 30 years. he said it had been 30 winters since the warany way, i think it was a great movie. a good ending when we find out hes blind.

403,criticwithnoname,A John Lennon Song Gone Horribly Wrong,6,9 June 2011,"Imagine there are no countries; it isn't hard to do. Also imagine there is no religion, no possessions, with greed and hunger as a commonplace affliction. Now picture an enlightened man wandering the desert, add an excessive dose of violence, mixed with a wandering plot and you have two-time Oscar winning actor Denzel Washington's newest movie ""The Book of Eli."" ""The Book of Eli"" is a very unique movie because an audience member can be more than 35 minutes late for the movie and still not miss anything vital to the story.The movie begins in the aftermath of a cataclysmic war where details on what actually happened are as hard to come by as the presence of meaningful dialogue. This desolate wasteland may appear to be a shameless rip-off of recent post-apocalyptic movies such as ""Terminator: Salvation"" and ""I Am Legend"" on the surface but as time progresses audience members discover the true depth of this apocalyptic nightmare: not only is water scarce but people are willing to murder for it if they don't have moist towelettes from KFC in order to trade with.During this time we meet Denzel Washington's character, a nomad equipped with a ""forever-sharp"" machete and a pistol that never seems to run out of bullets. For a little over an hour, the audience wanders through the desert with a character with no name. Only at about three quarters of the way through the movie is the character's name, Eli, revealed but is only shown once and is never spoken again for the rest of the movie. One could guess that this lack of information is to morph Washington's character into a kind of Clint Eastwood ""Man With No Name"" persona but this gaping hole in character development may serve to agitate audience members instead of engaging them.After battling and maiming scores of desert bandits, Denzel Washington's character, (I suppose we should call him Eli, even though it's not revealed for another two thirds of the story still) ends up at a recovering village living out of the ruins of a city. Wow, whatever happened during this war, not only wiped out everything green from the face of the earth but also utterly destroyed a bunch of cities. Gee, if only I knew what exactly happened.After a bar fight with some motorcycle riding rough customers, Eli comes face to face with the village leader and villain Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie is a very strange individual whose hobbies include reading, ordering his illiterate motorcycle gang to scour the surrounding area to discover a book, spoiling his woman, Claudia (Jennifer Beals) with precious goods like hotel issued shampoo, and then beating her for no apparent reason.Then, that night, when Eli has a sleepover with Solara (Mila Kunis), Claudia's daughter, a plot dramatically takes form. Audience members find out that there is in fact a reason for Eli's aimless wandering and that is to journey west with humanity's final copy of the King James Bible in his possession. Upon discovering this, Carnegie tries to obtain Eli's book, first by asking for it kindly like a civilized man and then brutally shooting at Eli like an uncouth thug. The motive for this violence is that Carnegie believes Eli's book could be used as a weapon.Eli then leaves the city to continue his wandering westward, Solara tags along and Eli brings her with him against his better judgment. Upon learning that Eli and Solara are gone, Carnegie scours the desert with a band of armor-plated SUV's: apparently water is a scarcity in this post-apocalyptic world but gasoline isn't?Eli and Carnegie then have a climactic showdown outside a rundown farmhouse that's run by a heat-packing grandma and grandpa couple who serve the sole purpose of comic relief. This climactic showdown employs mindboggling physics and excellent cinematography but does not resolve the conflict.The story continues after this battle with twists in the plot that are certain to strangle the audience. These twists consist of revelations so colossal in importance that the plausibility of the story becomes all but defunct.The actual message of ""The Book of Eli"" revolves around the ideals of practicing what one preaches and believing faith is a firm foundation. However, these ideals are shrouded behind this film's violent context. Violence is not only commonplace in this movie, but excessive, especially against the women in this story.""The Book of Eli"" is really a two-part movie where the first part is a wandering plot-less story devoid of meaning and consequence. Then suddenly, in the second part, courtesy of deep philosophical concepts, the story suddenly develops a plot —ungainly heavy though it may be— engaging the audience if nothing more than to see how many more sudden and irrational turns the plot can take before the end. Although intriguing and benevolent concepts are the main message of the movie, the whole experience is stuffed full of excessive violence guaranteeing a bumpy ride for any audience member. The commercials may say ""believe in hope"" but the real content of the story screams ""hope this never happens, believe me.""",The Book of Eli

There's next to no logic in why things happen as the story falls along. there's little to hang on to, to keep you watching. it takes a while to come to terms with the fact that millions were spent in achieving such a banal punch line. The script reflects the story line and the people in the film amble along, seemingly more interested in their next project - the producers would have been better off financially using extras in all roles. There's no opportunity even to find any unintentional humour in the film - like most bad movies - take Kevin Costner's efforts in his heyday.

408,cinefiladas,9 out of 10 and one of the best Scenes EVER FILMED,9,23 May 2010,"I was very exited to see this movie mostly because some friends were saying it is not to good. Gess What? They Where Wrong.. Of course many can say that a Bible Movie is always kind of Bad but i actually liked the all plot and how things end up. First let me say that the directing is amazing... It should receive an award for best directing... Saying this i am speaking about a particular Scene. When ELI goes to the two old couple's house with the girl and take some tea and realize they are eating all their visitors the bad guys appear.. This is Where an Amazing Sequence Shot starts.. of course with some 3D on the way specially with the transitions from inside to the outside but it is amazing how the camera can move trow windows, bullet holes and etc.. it is all so very well done that my face just drop on the ground specially because i am also in the movie industry and i just loved that amazing long shot. The actor are all amazing and even Denzel (And he is one of my favorite actors) is different from his ""Custom"" Character from past movies. Some can say that the World looks a little bit like The Road movie but in the end i think this one shows and explains better why the same is like that 30 years latter. I just don't have words for the amazing ride i've had. At the end i was thinking.. ohh.. of course... he has the book and gave to Gary Oldman a Blank pages boom but guess what? i was impressed again when i realized That the book was in Braile... The thing i didn't get was if.. in the end Eli was a blind man.. which i think i looks like it specially when he is saying the words for the old man to write the bible... But.. all in all it is a great and a must see movie.",The Book of Eli
409,aka_sabretooth,And They Said It Was In The Mad Max Vein...,2,28 March 2010,"Well, this movie will certainly ignite either blind love or utter rejection among the masses. By the way, I am in the second group. Yep, I read post-apocalyptic film, a lone man with a mission, and I was drooling. Oh, and add Gary Oldman as a villain, you have my money for a ticket.Well, from time to time I fell into these traps. By the 20th minute I was wishing I were at home watching it on DVD with a fast forward button at hand.The set up was OK, the scenario was OK, Gary Oldman was OK.... and then the development was sliding slowly into boredom, then quickly, and by the 34th minute I was checking the time on my muted cell, and then some plot holes, or rather plot voids, and then I think I got out of the cinema before the screen turned black with the titles. It was probably the right time to leave: the main character was dying of a bullet wound to the belly he had taken at point blank and presumably a few days ago (time here was kinda blurred but he got to travel to San Francisco after being shot), and despite the gunshot he looked even healthier than me. Having seen untreated abdominal wounds with and without bowel perforation on a fair amount of people, this was way too much for me to digest, and all this came about when the movie suggested for lack aof a better term, that the character was also... blind, blind even since before the narration began, despite he shot people with a gun from more than 20 meters and no misses. So I think you get my point.We need better movies.",The Book of Eli
410,brandorres,The Book of Eli REVIEW by @KillFillM on Instagram,7,6 May 2015,"**LITTLE TO NO SPOILERS**THE BOOK OF ELIDirected by The Hughes Brothers .Another post apocalyptic world where the essentials to live have become scarce, and its made people desperate and violent. Although this is one is one of the more entertaining, unique, and stylish ones I've seen. Eli (Denzel Washington) has the last remaining Bible, and he has been traveling alone for decades in search of a home for it. Carnegie (Gary Oldman) is one of the corrupted men, running a town of maniacal people, and he has been searching for the bible for a long time. .One of my favorite things about this movie what it has to say on religion and the beliefs of people. Eli is a man of God, and Carnegie is an atheist. Eli wants to bring the bible to a holy place where he can preach the word of God to good people. Carnegie knows the power of the bible. He says that it can control people because it speaks to the weak and the desperate. He's seen it happen before. I always love hearing people's views on religion so I really thought the plot of this was great. .It feels very much like a Zack Snyder movie in the style it's directed and shot, the slomo's, the very vibrant or very bleak colors. Movies like that are always very visually entertaining and this definitely was. It feels like you're watching a graphic novel on screen, with a mix of Mad Max, western, and Japanese samurai elements. The fight scenes were alright. The choreography was great, but since Denzel did all his own stunts I feel they could've been filmed better and less choppy. Though some action scenes were awesome, especially a shootout at a house and a car chase scene. I really liked Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman in this, and though I never particularly like Mila Kunis in movies, I didn't mind her in this and I really liked her character near the end. The finale, a lot is revealed and explained and when it is it makes it so much better. I wasn't expecting to say this going into it, But I can say I loved this movie. Definitely check it out. I think it's very underrated and pretty great. .The Book of Eli gets an: A-Follow me on Instagram for more Movie reviews @killfillm",The Book of Eli
411,bcikasa-96482,"Action, Denzel, Oldman, Shocking Revelation...Great Movie",10,2 April 2017,"I've watched this movie many times since its release and it still impresses. The first time I watched it I was simply along for the ride. Every viewing after the first, knowing whats going on, I'm able to see more and enjoy the story that much more.In the reviews you may see people referencing religion. There is no religion in this movie. Religion is a man made construct. What you will encounter is the human experience. Despair, hopelessness, tyranny, evil and the human struggle to be better and serve a purpose beyond our simple existence.The movie revolves around God, as presented in the Bible. If you believe in the Bible and God then this fictional story is not crazy, outrageous or outlandish. The idea that a man can be chosen by God to complete a seemingly impossible task is not only possible, it's historically accurate.",The Book of Eli

Every basic concept of the film is flawed. From the scarcity of bibles (really??? there are so many bibles in print even after an apocalypse it would be more rare to find a book and have it NOT be a bible), to the villain's motivations, the ham-fisted metaphors, and even the ultimate conclusion not a single idea withstands a second thought, but the film takes itself completely seriously. It makes it hard to enjoy the action.
To say nothing of the fact that Mila Kunis looks ridiculously out of place in the film's apocalypse.

416,pdavideastburn,Rent Fahrenheit 451 and Forgettaboutit!,4,15 January 2010,"Yawn, that's what you'll do when the over loud sound effects aren't popping you out of your seat. This movie defines bleakness. At least Denzel doesn't mind looking old until the end when he is cleaned up before his chapter is closed out. Looks like a prophet then. The Black Moses roaming the desert for 30 years; he should have wondered 10 more years to make it match the Bible. Too many discrepancies: Can you really find your target 100 yards away with an arrow when you're blind? Did no one hear of the Gideons for this movie?. Surely there was one Bible left under the bed at a deserted Motel 6 somewhere on the globe. Water was so valued and rare, but where did all that gasoline come from? And do you need a physical Bible to have a church? None seen. So Eli memorizes the King James Bible. It was done in Fahrenheit 451 when all the books were burned. Each person was responsible for reciting a classic in order to keep the book alive. Been there, done that, read the book. Even if it was in Braille (cute plot twist, but hey the blind girl (Jennifer Beals/Claudia) says to Oldman/Carnegie that it's been too long to remember how to read it. Does one forget to read a regular book, too? Doesn't Oldman/Carnegie see the near orgasmic smile on her face when she runs her hand across the raised lettering when opening the book? (Are these post apocalyptic slime really going to be receptive to religious hocus pocus and change their ways? Instead of shaving Eli/Denzel, they should have shaved off the raised Braille lettering, now that would have been a plot twist). Loved Ray Stevenson as Redridge the goon with a semi-conscience (wasn't he great in ""Rome"" and ""Cirque du Freak""?). Mila Kunis was the best actor in the movie and a good foil for Eli/Denzel's character. And when can you ever say that Gary Oldman isn't the quintessential bad guy? He was born to be bad! I could watch him sleep and still be satisfied. George and Martha (Washington? or, from ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?"") played by Frances de la Tour and Michael Gambon were wonderful and much needed comedy relief for this bleak drivel. How appropriate the last bastion of security is Alcatraz. The Alcatraz Press? Too funny. And to file the vaulted newly printed Bible on a shelf with the other books is like filing the Ark of the Covenant away never to be found again. A lot of wasted life for that tome. And let's not forget Tom Waits as the Engineer pawn shop guy. If Eli wants to recharge his Ipod for music, does that make sense to remove your most valuable sense, hearing, when you are blind and the ultimate protector of the Word? It was great hearing Al Green booming, ""How Do You Mend a Broken Heart"" from his headset. Nice inclusion into the movie. Some sweet relief from the grunge. In all it was like the Black Moses meets Mad Max, but doesn't stay around to ""see"" the end.",The Book of Eli
417,testudinidae,What's all the theological commotion?,7,30 May 2020,"Beyond the religious context, which I find particularly boring, I am finding I like post-apocalyptic films like this... Mad Max, Fury Road, to some extent even The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome to Resident Evil-Extinction.
I suppose I find those films watchable, because there are no distractions from today's society to burden the story or the hypocritical idea that civilization was better than what we find ourselves immersed in.
To be entirely honest, it's more about certain scenes, than plot. Post-apocalyptic films always have plot holes and egregious scripting faults, and The Book of Eli is no different. The acting is solid from just about everyone in this film, and seeing Tom Waits again is refreshing. He's one weird dude.
There is much worse out there, to watch, than this film. While it's nothing to review your ethics and morals over, it's more American force-fed entertainment, and if you're wanting a couple hours where the thinking is done for you, The Book of Eli waits! 😃",The Book of Eli

The second very great director is the Russian Andrei Tarkovski with its ""Stalker"" and ""Andrei Rubliov""-the same color code: black and white for bad and dead World, ""true colors"" for good right and living world .The closer to us movies are the Madmax series.Not to forget ""Last man standing.""Looking at Denzel's character survival techniques and behavior reminds my Bear Grill's ones, in Discovery channel documentary : 'Ultimate Survival"". About the religion theme, I find it very brave for an American movie.Is rather unusual in American culture to mention the bad side of religion power and manipulation, including through the Bible,usually named (only) as ""The Holly Bible"". So, in my opinion, for a born-today spectator ,the movie would be rated 8-9/10.

This showed me that the plot got more and more ridiculous as it developed. I feel betrayed by Denzel Washington because his films are usually top-notch. How could he have become involved with this piece of junk? Specifically, my objections are: 1) Nothing is explained until much later in the film, 2) Eli's ability to kill everyone in sight is preposterous--especially in view of what is revealed about him at the end, 3) If you persevere to the end of the film, you still don't see why they made it.

There's a religious message in this movie, but in my opinion, it is possible to happen whatever happen to denzel in this movie.Seriously, if an apocalypse did really happen, hell will break all loose and people will tend to fall to their animalistic character and succumb to their basic needs.

But the Hughes are obviously not Mr. Shyamalan and so people say: Let's see it again!"" Come on! The film left a really bad feeling in my mouth and a lot of questions remain unanswered. The bad feelings (beside the stupid blind Samurai stuff): Gary Oldman's been there, done that character -- annoying screen writing. Mila Kunis outfit. Is this post-apocalypse or fashion week 2010? Mila Kunis character. Plain awful. ""Let's put this little hot looking girl in there -- we'll sell a few more tickets because, well, she's hot and most important: Someone has to move the boat. And she will look great wearing Denzel's iPod!"" I don't want to rant in detail about the scene, where the little hot girl discovers the Bible in The Wanderers cell room. It must be discovered, of course. But the way it happens is really bad and uninspired writing. Sorry. The unanswered questions (beside the blind Samurai stuff): How did little hot girl manage to escape out of the cave after being locked by Denzel? It's one thing when you make Mr. Washington disappear out of his cell. It works because it's in character"" and it really doesn't matter how he managed to escape. They show you the empty room and the story is told. But not in the cave case. How did she escape? The answer is missing. This is especially sad because the story develops on this detail. Next. At which fuel station did they stop on their ride to San Francisco? And did I get it right -- Denzel hits the bad guys with his arrow or his gun because he smells them? Nice. What was this farm couple all about? Did the producers feel there's some need of comedy? The scene, where Mila is ambushed. Little coincidence, that this is the same woman, Denzel meat Miles away and before. Anyway, he smells that Mila is in trouble and heads back to save hear. This makes sense. Even more sense makes the scene when Mila manages to crash the car, kill Gary's guys and escape with the car. Which she is able to drive because her mama payed for her driving lessons. Good writing.

427,jaustenaa,What's so important about the these books?,9,25 September 2010,"(There might be a spoiler in this comment, but if not please remove the spoiler warning, thank you :) There is nothing good in religion that you can't learn elsewhere. And if there is no religious followers of a religion, there is no people that will hold the book dear. Therefore there would other pieces of knowledge more worth savoring.Ideals like free speech, freedom from discrimination, human and animal rights. Good insight like the scientific method of ruling out subjectivity through placebo testing, to read all arguments from all sides of the discussion before making up your mind, that homosexuality is not a sin but there are arguments for and against.These give much more truth and insight than the usual simplified religious black and white teachings. This in addition to all the aggression, threats, discrimination and child abuse written in these books makes them even less worth. No, popularity does not make validity.Religion spreads with people, not from any holy persons or revelations. If there where no books or literature, no old fathers teaching their traditions to the next generation, there would be the end of every religion.Other than that the movie excels at every point. Even the martial arts action have calm filming so you can actually see and enjoy the show, and our hero sequences from one enemy to another very good.",The Book of Eli
428,Admit_One,Not a bad ride....,8,28 June 2010,"How long does it take a man to walk across the United States? About 30 years. Just long enough to memorize exactly, a very long and intricate book (word for word). I'm not sure what is so offensive or impossible about this premise as compared to other sci-fi or apocalypse films, but it sure seems to tick a few of the self described ""open minded"" reviewers off. There are some plot holes here and there in the film, but it's not a horrible movie by any measure. Part Old Testament, very small part New Testament, Eli's journey is not untypical of other lone heroes with a purpose or a moral code. The plot unfolds in an interesting way and is peppered nicely with some fine action sequences mostly done in silhouette. There is a nice twist at the end and it's a good pay off for the viewer. If you get a chance to see the film a second time you will see how well Washington actually does what he does. If you can't suspend your disbelief for this film it's not because it impossible to do so. It's a very well done film. All this nit picking about small devices in the film reminds me of when I was watching Walt Disney's ""Up"" with my brother in law. About an hour into the film he saw something and commented ""Well that's not very realistic!"" I told him ""The whole film is not realistic! It's a cartoon!"" A note to the open minded reviewers IT'S A MOVIE! IT'S FICTION! IT'S MAKE BELIEVE!How many atheist and agnostic movies were made and will be made in 2010? You stick the Bible reference in one film and some people act like they were cheated in a three card Monte game. Chill.As for the girl going back to the desert, I got that she was going back for her mother, not that she was taking over for Eli. Roll with it on this one. It's worth the ride in my opinion.",The Book of Eli
429,macguffinfilmreviews,Disappointing and Bland,4,19 January 2010,"Overall, I found The Book of Eli to be disappointing, but it was a disappointment that arose from watching it (and not from my expectations going in). It manages to hint at different ways in which it could set itself apart from other post-apocalyptic films, and these moments really add to the viewing experience. Nonetheless, it does not feature nearly enough of these moments to overcome the film's inconceivable plot, which ultimately sinks the entire viewing experience with an absurd ending.For the most part, the film is really for fans of the genre. Audiences that like ""end of the world"" films will probably find this one enjoyable for those little ways it differentiates itself. Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman look like they are having fun putting on a show, and that definitely helps the minutes flow by. At the end of the day though, it is not nearly good enough to be a ""must-see"" for anyone that did not already want to see it.Full Review at MacGuffinFilmReviews.blogspot.com",The Book of Eli
430,jjgurd,"Unoriginal, weak plot, poor characters and pretty average acting",1,21 January 2010,"In expectation of the soon to be released film version of Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road', the post-apocalyptic story behind The Book of Eli grabbed my attention.Having watched the film, I now think I wasted 2 hrs of my life. The plot is a poor rip off of The Road, just substitute a few characters but the general story is incredibly similar. The only difference is that this film seemingly has no real point, no satisfactory conclusion or end point and no soul. Uncanny then that it was released around the same time.The characters and visual effects have been 'borrowed' from Mad Max, the plot from The Road and strung together with a barely creditable performance from Denzel Washington. There are some completely random and incongruous cameos from respected actors like Michael Gambon and I'm guessing by Malcolm Mcdowell's involvement (seemingly using the Doc from Back To The Future's stylist..) that his pension is running short. Add some eye candy to entice those who don't need compelling plot or credible characters, season with some basic and uninspiring visual effects and you've got The Book of Eli.About the only positive for me was that the cinema was warm on a winter's night and I quite enjoyed the pick'n'mix. Tom Waits gets the nod as the best acting performance but he didn't face too much competition.One of the worst films I've seen in a long time. I know post-apocalypse films are meant to be bleak but this was simply void of anything to engage my mind or offer anything of interest.",The Book of Eli

432,valentinestanford,One of the best post-apocalyptic movies out there,10,6 July 2010,"If you wanna see another recycled Mad Max, go elsewhere.Some reviewers have ragged on this movie for lack of character development, or weak plot. Many idiots call this a propaganda film. I believe this was a solid movie that worked with ideas we know and love and interjects something new that not many people have seen before, especially in this type of film.Firstly, this movie takes a solid setting we're familiar with (post-apocalyptic world, shanty towns and burned out cars and buildings) and a familiar theme (the lone wanderer) and makes it all look good. I haven't seen a barren wasteland look so good in a long time. It felt like I was playing Fallout 3, but w/o the controller.Secondly, never once did it pretend to be something it wasn't. There was no deep twisting plot (although there is a twist at the end), but there never needed to be. Character creation wasn't too heavy, again it didn't need to be, as we know from decades of film who these survivors are, and what their motivations are going to be. Because of this we don't have to go through the always present monologues describing how evil the villain is and how he came to be, or how good and righteous the hero is and where he came from. Sure you find out, but its short and simple, no need to be over elaborate with silly flashbacks. This leaves time for storytelling, action, and beautiful cinematic shots. This movie was two minutes shy of two hours, and I didn't notice the time even once. Very well balanced with action, story, and dialogue. Third, God forbid movies have substance these days, this is a movie that has something more than flash pans and giant robots: it has Hope. Hope for the future, hope for mankind, hope that, even when everything is burned down (literally), we can still work towards a future and make one for future generations.I already kinda knew about the movie before I watched it (a friend saw it and gave me a briefing) but I didn't know about the ending, and I have to say I cried at this one. Wow, what a powerful ending for the main character. I'd have to say that was one of the best ever for best endings in my book (pun intended).",The Book of Eli

Denzel is the still the best!In my opinion, this movie is amazing. The themes in this movie are THE themes of life. the violence and other themes you would think kids should not see are completely de-fused, and nearly unnoticeable against the backdrop of the life, truth, and faith themes echoing from this film. I would give this film a chance for EVERYONE to see it for that reason. this is no simple super hero story --it surprised me very much. As I said before, if Denzel is in it, its a must see.",The Book of Eli
434,beaverfever,Not good; very predictable; very clichéd,2,11 February 2010,"Most of my review is in the summary. There are aspects of the story that don't make any sense, even when making a stretch to take context into consideration. The story is a long, dull, cliché- filled way to go for two small twists. Every character is a shameless cliché. In addition to the problems with the story itself, at times the computer graphics are too obvious (people, scenery, backgrounds), and this becomes a distraction. An omnipresent detail: in telling a post-apocalypse story where food and water are supposedly very scarce, there could have at least been an effort to hide everybody's well-fed chubby cheeks with make-up. The sole purpose of this movie seems to have been to provide endless opportunities for close- ups of Denzel Washington looking like a grizzled action-hero. It gets tiring very quickly.I am having a very difficult time thinking of a positive comment for this movie. At times the scenery looks okay.",The Book of Eli
435,mbowles64,Apocalyptic Brilliance,7,1 December 2011,"A wanderer known as Eli travels west across a vast post apocalyptic America carrying a book that is said to hold the hope for all mankind. He travels alone witnessing the harshness the Grey land has to offer, resisting it's horrid flesh eating bandits and power hungry warlords. Guided by god, he contains a holy presence protecting him.When i saw the trailer of this movie a few months before its release, I though B-rater nothing much accept for the fact that it had the brilliance of Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman. I saw it as a small follower to Mad Max, Legion and The Road trying to contest with these cult classics and small wonders, but as I flicked through the fox movie channels The Book of Eli caught my eye.I went into this movie feeling optimistic having the potential for a marvelous plot and some disturbing yet brilliant scenes. So i sat down with my orange juice and watched the movie and may i say my resistance to go to bed before the movie definitely payed off. The first thing that slapped me in the face with this movie was the setting and mood, obviously being set in a apocalyptic wasteland the mood was certainly cold and mysterious creating a increasing curiosity of what is going to be on the road next.The character in this movie really magnified the feeling of hopelessness in the wasteland all disease infested and desperate. But the character Eli played by Denzel Washington was a symbol of hope carrying the ultimate book of hope and ripping through bad guys with his sweet blade. This leads me to the amazingly simple action sequences. The first action I saw with Eli created a trance as I Became unable to turn my eyes away from the T.V.. His ease in slicing and dicing his enemies makes for a fantastic ride throughout the whole film.This surely a very brutal movie seeing people been randomly shot in the head and occasional horrid deaths for the evil bandits. But its brutality is powered by the always brilliant Gary Oldman as the evil tyrant warlord. Oldman's character is after the book for his own power hungry needs and will go to any lengths to acquire it. Acting in this movie is sound as Mila Kunis plays the new sidekick of Eli feeding her own to the movie. But the stand out was Denzel bringing the cool and calm character that is Eli to life.The plot is wonderfully simple with a kind of road trip feel to it. The main flaw this movie has is the resolution. It lacks a climatic finish but of course I shall not reveal it. All in all it is brutally fantastic movie with excellent acting and great application of setting to the mood. This is why i give it a 8.4 out of 10.",The Book of Eli
436,picturesque-arts,A film that will leave you thinking about it long after it's finished.,7,23 January 2013,"On the whole, I finished this movie just fifteen minutes ago and am compelled to write a movie review concerning the flaws and fortes of this film. I liked it! There were certainly both good and bad elements to ""The Book of Eli."" Sometimes I found myself questioning, ""How did that happen?"" or simply, ""Why?"" but the rest of the time, I was completely and utterly entranced by the film, especially the incredible lead roles of Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman. They were simply spectacular - SPECTACULAR. In defense of the themes of the plot, I would strongly disagree with the plethora of reviews attacking the movie as a Catholic evangelical mish-mash conspiracy film. I was actually pleased to see the religious aspects of this film emerge (and by the way, I am an atheist). It was refreshing to have a sense of spirituality and an emphasis on literature in a modern blockbuster, as I think we are lacking those two things in American film. I don't think the Christianity of this film detracted from the plot whatsoever, and I found the guardian angel motif of Eli very beautiful. There were other weak points which contributed to the downfalls of the plot - but the religion components of this film did not. I will begin with flaws. The beginning of ""The Book of Eli"" was somewhat excessively slow and languorous, but soon the film began to flow and pick up the pace. I agree with other reviewers who wish the film had ended earlier on. The narration of Washington is appreciated, but needed to be more succinct. As for character development, in my opinion, a lot of Mila Kunis' lines and acting were really detrimental to the film. For example, her violent interest in Eli's book was melodramatic, and her extremely blatant and almost immediate throwing of Eli under the bus (in telling Carnegie that Eli was reading) was not realistic either. Similarly, neither was her obvious prayer that she exhibited right in front of Carnegie. If Eli helped Solara out by letting her stay in his room to help her mom out, she should at least put a little bit of effort into being subtle in keeping Eli's customs and secrets a secret as well. I was annoyed by the seduction scene because of course any director would jump at the opportunity to dress Kunis up in a short mini dress... too Hollywood. I also didn't like the ending with her being the next religious warrior. How could she have been at all prepared to be as good a fighter as Eli was? She threw a few grenades, so what; I never saw her use a sword once. Other flaws included how there were way too many shots of men with guns aiming from on top of buildings, the non-realistic badass-ness (though it's forgiven because so badass), the seemingly endless amount of fuel in Solara's truck, the superfluously kind and gentle Lombardi, several cuts of inartistic cinematography, the lack of cohesiveness and lack of expansion on the ""human flesh"" idea, and the loss of the modern twists such as beats and KFC from most of the middle/end of the storyline (though perhaps it's supposed to show transition into from the ordinary into the transcendent over time). Despite the long list of flaws, these were just nit-picky details that I picked up on. There was a myriad of great things about this film. For one, I really, really loved the performances by Frances de la Tour and Michael Gambon - their scenes were hilarious yet very sad. Like I said, most of the acting was great, and the dialogue felt very natural; there were few clichés in the script. I relished in the exciting action scenes, even though I usually don't like them. I did enjoy most of the cinematography, including the vast scenes of clouds and very tiny silhouettes. Moreover, remember that my list of failings of the film were just several details, and that overall this film was great! Watch it!",The Book of Eli

In our century, people are losing faith in God and religions because of Athesim, some people aren't ready to face life without faith, so they become Atheists and -in my opinion- they destroy their selves.

439,tinylight3,Book of Eli not what I expected,6,14 January 2010,"Not even Denzel Washington can save this movie despite his acting. The trailers make it seem like the movie is going to be an action movie and that the book is very important, not that this particular book is not important but I guess I thought it was going to be something else. There are a couple of action scenes which are very well done but they are few and not well spread out throughout the movie and one starts to feel like they were deceived by the trailer. The book of Eli is nothing more than the Bible. I do understand that the Bible is one of the most important books but to make such a big deal out of this particular religious book to the point of killing to protect it is ridiculous since I'm sure the Bible mentions or is at least against killing. The premise of the movie about the importance of the Bible is not unwarranted but I'm sure that to others, other books are equally or maybe even more important that this book. The whole movie pretty much centers around protecting it and you get to hear Mr. Denzel reciting from it oh and a few action scenes. If I wanted to know about the Bible, I would have opened the actual Bible instead of going to see a movie that centers around it. There's a particular scene that made me laugh because they did such a bad job with the special effects if that is what it can be called. The scene is when they are rowing to the island because you can clearly tell that they are just rowing in front of either a screen that shows an ocean or a green screen but it is obvious to the naked eye. I would have expected this a few years ago but to see this now is laughable. Give it a 6/10 and I think I was kind. If you are thinking about watching this movie for its action sequences, don't go since there is little to none. If you are thinking about a post-apocalyptic movie, please see The Road instead which is a much better movie. Now, if you want to hear Mr. Washington reciting from the Bible then this is your movie but I think you would be better off just reading the Book yourself. Once again, beware the trailer because it seems to advertise it as an action movie when it is not.",The Book of Eli

443,eddiemad,Blind faith on the road to Alcatraz,6,15 January 2010,"In a desolate post apocalyptic United States, some 30 years after a world war has ravaged the planet, cat hating loner Eli (Denzel Washington) slowly makes his way from the East coast to the West on foot, sometimes avoiding and sometimes taking on the remaining gangs of human scavengers who fight over any water, food, clothing or basic necessities they come across. Eli is different however as he has a certain book in his possession, the last of it's kind on Earth, which he feels compelled to deliver to a suitable safe haven. The book also seems to grant Eli unlimited protection allowing him to take on numerous assailants at once and still walk away unscathed. But he's not the only survivor from the old world to know about the potential power contained in the book. The head of one mid western ramshackle town in particular, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), continually sends his men out in search of the book, believing if he has it then he will be able to take control of the remains of humanity. So Carnegie can't believe his luck when Eli walks into town with the very thing he's been looking for...Very similar to The Road in it's basic premise and look, The Book of Eli is less concerned with the bond between father and son in a post apocalyptic world (how could it be, our Denzel is a loner for the most part in this one), focusing more on the power of belief and faith (so, erm, the bond between Holy Father and son then?). It's not really giving too much away to say the book Eli is protecting is the very last known Bible (we find this out fairly early on) so, depending on your religious beliefs or lack thereof, some will find this a reasonably uplifting tale that reinforces their own views while others might feel it takes the religious aspects a bit too far to be plausible. Viewed in between those two extremes it's not a bad effort. If you see it as Eli's own determination and belief that ultimately drives him on rather than some omnipotent force then it works a lot better. Although the twist ending, as entertaining and unexpected as it is, does put the whole thing firmly back in the religious arena once again. Yes, there are plenty of plot holes and inconsistencies along the way. How can Eli/Carnegie be so sure this is the very last Bible for one? America's a pretty big place! Have they looked everywhere? Unlike The Road however, Book of Eli manages to liven things up a fair bit with some nifty action/fight sequences along the way. They're spread pretty thin throughout but are nonetheless effective when they arrive. As are the occasional guest appearances from familiar faces. Jennifer (Flashdance) Beals is Oldman's woman, Malcolm (A Clockwork Orange) McDowell turns up in the latter stages, musician Tom Waits has a small part, and most surprising of all is the cameo from elderly cannibal couple Michael 'Dumbledore' Gambon and 'Rising Damp's Frances de la Tour! Like The Road then, the movie has a dried out desolate feel with an almost monochrome visual look. Unlike The Road it will probably go down better in the multiplexes as it's a bit more livelier. Whether audiences will swallow the heavy religious approach is another thing though. I enjoyed it more than The Road so it gets a higher score. And the film does acknowledge past influences, most notably when Eli crashes out for the night in one of Carnegie's 'guest' rooms. On the wall behind him is a faded poster for the cult 1975 post apocalypse movie 'A Boy And His Dog'. Hollywood's certainly been toying with the subject for quite a while now in one way or another.

This is honestly one of those shows where everyone involved made an exceptional film but when you boil the film down, it's awful. The religious overtones are horrible, this film is chock full of them. It's basically nothing more than a lesson in Christianity hidden in a post-apocalyptic film. The performances are amazing however, especially Gary Oldman. The way the shootout in the house is filmed clearly shows that the people who filmed it and did the special effects pulled off some the most underrated action shots that deserve recognition. Can Eli see? He does things a blind person would do and it's evident he is blind at the end of the show. Eli does say however that his ""voice"" told him he'd be protected and it's obvious he has super-human abilities. He literally survives a hail of bullets and a direct shot to the back of the head with a shooter who seems dumbfounded as to how the shot ricocheted off him. Yeah, that's when the movie pretty much lost me. Eli's ""fate"" takes a turn for the worse when he gives the book to Carnegie who proceeds to shoot Eli in the gut. After he gives up the book, he's as human as everyone else. If he wasn't blind, how'd he see Alcatraz Island let alone row a boat to it? If he wasn't blind, how'd he navigate his MP3 player? The movie is worth a watch but take it with a grain of salt.

It Had Denzel Washington (Great actor) and a very interesting trailer. So i figured am in for a treat, several minutes later into the shocking scene of the hunted cat and the mysterious-vague character development, i saw my self watching an action scene somewhat out of the blue with slightly poor fighting sequence or was it the directing am not really sure, it started with nothing and One scene later a hero emerges with godlike martial art experience, still there was some answers missing like within the first 30 min the movie haven't explained where, what and how! at least one answer would have kept the audience anticipating.few minutes in and i finally see my self in a western movie, not a big shock assuming the world have been destroyed by a war of some-sort keeping in mind what i have learned in the first half hour of the movie i tried looking for loopholes in the script throughout the movie but honestly i couldn't do that until i found my self aware of the what to expect, whats coming ahead just when Denzel Washington meet Gary Oldman following yet another action sequence that made no sense (They had guns FFS couldn't they shoot and avoid being slaughtered all 9 of them) so mind the poor character development throughout the movie still the script wasn't the best, the dialogs were very repetitive and none of the actors were capable of winning the heart of their audience with such a poor script.i have only given this movie a 3 star rating for the not-very original plot needless to say it could have been way better even with a boring storyline, the casting wasn't the best Denzel Washington should have realized what kind of a movie that is by the preliminary screening, yes it look like a low budget movie besides some rare CGI effect of the destroyed city, but what really got to me is that even with low budget movies you see a twist you couldn't and wouldn't expect but in the Book of Eli it didn't really matter For example: while Eli is leaving the small town west after the massacre he pulled exit-ing the town, he got shot twice! twice in the back with no follow up on what happened and how he wasn't injured! am not looking for an already vague scene in a movie that really doesn't make a lot of sense nor have have this mysterious appealing scripts but somehow i feel the producers needed to catch the audience's attention by more and more useless action scene's (Useless: are those action scenes that do not relate to the man nor the mission the director is trying to sell us). thats my objective opinion as for my subjective one ...I couldn't relate to the actors, the script not even the storyline. perhaps they could have spared the mysterious hero/world and gave me something to wonder about as i leave the movie theater. but nothing happened another 2 hours wasted !",The Book of Eli

This whole movie is based on a journey involving faith.There are very minor details in this movie that may leave you with a few questions, but they certainly should not effect your opinion of the movie. A few examples involve the storage of the bow/arrow, houses left standing, amount of gas in vehicles, etc. Every movie has minor things like this that aren't fixed.Overall, this was a swell movie and a must see. It is based off of a religious background, so depending on your religion/beliefs, it may leave confused. But that doesn't mean it is a bad movie. It is just made for a particular audience.

450,Cyck1,A flawed but interesting little piece of cinema.,7,20 June 2010,"Book of Eli may as well be called ""Bibleman: Done Right"".In Bibleman: Done Right we follow Denzel Washington as a machete-wielding drifter named Eli through a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by war and inhabited by illiterate raiders and rapists. Actual film is only about half as interesting as this sounds.First I must talk about the production value. As expected, its pretty darn high. The Hugh brothers paint a dreary picture of a scorched world that is admittedly typical and yet still awe-inspiring. The costumes, the broken architecture, the one shot of a brown grassy plain melding into green grassland at the end of the film... its quite beautiful and it tells a story that no character in the film really has to. In fact, I feel like the guys who made this should have let the landscape sell the movie all by itself. TOO OFTEN (esp. in the beginning) are we treated to unnecessary ""epic"" shots that don't mean anything... like when Solara is crying and Eli stands there. The camera is panned far away and the clouds are moving quickly. What does that mean? Should we be impressed? So it turns out that the grand production value and fancy editing oftentimes ends up hurting the film... like the Hughes didn't know when enough was enough and kept throwing a bunch of camera tricks at us.Then we come to the action scenes, which I have no real complaints about. There isn't much in the way of originality for anyone who has seen more then a few samurai flicks or westerns, but everything is shot extremely well and works well. There's a reason we loved seeing these scenes in Zatoichi and Unforgiven and I don't mind seeing them again. And the fact that Denzel is doing all this crazy ninja stuff makes a huge difference that I can't quite explain.And now the plot. You've likely heard the general consensus about Bibleman: Done Right.... it being Christian propaganda. Well, yes, Christian overtones are undeniably here but I hardly found the film to be preachy or too insistent about the matter. If anything, I found a lot of the writing to be a bit on the ambiguous side (like Carnegie's bodyguard dying with a smile on his face. What?). I could stand to see MORE films regarding faith that isn't afraid to be a little one-sided. I have very little doubt that if any other religion were represented here there would be no big uproar. In all likelihood it would be labeled as ""controversial and bold"" rather then ""preachy propaganda"". Then again, I am a Christian. *shrugs* A lot of great actors in this film but the somewhat weak script never really let them flex their muscles. Bibleman: Done Right is so eager to convince you of its dark and gritty atmosphere that its scared of the performances being too ""emotional"" from Denzel or Oldman. Not a good thing. In the end, I wanted to like this film a lot more then I actually did but it isn't what I would consider bad. I'm not afraid to admit that the incredible action scenes really saved the movie for me. They're that impressive The plot is just compelling enough to hold one's attention til' the end... where it will, undoubtedly, lose many people. Still, whether you like the views of the film or not it WILL get you talking and thinking. That's gotta count for something.",The Book of Eli

If every movie were this good, our people could get to where it is that we belong much sooner. Hats off to the writer of this movie. It won't be the biggest money maker because of the special audience that it will appeal to. Not being the biggest money maker has nothing to do with whats really at stake.

452,insubrian,contradictions and inconsistency,1,21 December 2010,"This movie is full of contradictions. At the end in Alcatraz the guards have fully automatic submachine guns that look brand new, yet the apocalypse is supposed to have happened 30 years prior, prompting the bad guys to use some kind of manually operated Gatling gun! So, we are shown hand-cranked gramophones and hand-water pumps, yet in one part of the movie there are guns from the Civil War, and later modern weapons? This 30 years after the production of bullets, lubricants and parts would have stopped? Where did they find the bullets?If no one is making arrows, why does he leave one behind? if bullets are rare, why do they use a Gatling gun? Water is supposed to be the most precious resource on the planet, yet the only spring we are shown in the movie is left unguarded and apparently unlocked.How does Mila get out? How does denzel get out of prison? Are we supposed to believe the town is located 100 ft above water level? It would take hours and hours of pumping by hand! Eli is obviously not blind or he wouldn't be able to kill multiple assailants from all sides nor to figure out the old couple are cannibals.so of the few people that survive, there is one that is not blind but somehow is fluent in braille! no one would be able to memorize the whole bible exactly word for word.if there is one book that would survive the apocalypse and the burnings it would be the Holy Bible, there are literally billions of copies. It is the most published book on Earth.By the way, if the old couple are cannibals, and they obviously built the trap door for capturing human prey, why don't they shoot Denzel and Mila when they have them in their sights? Why do they show them the graves? After 30 years of neglect, the Golden Gate Bridge would probably have rusted out and collapsed completely.another major contradiction is the use of vehicles. Everything has reverted back to 1800s technology but somehow we still have functioning gas guzzling armored vans? This 30 years after the last refinery was supposedly destroyed? they say: we barely have enough gas to get back,( i guess it's the last gas for the whole town) yet they take four vehicles? they could have all fit in the van!Why do we not see any wild life, horses, cattle, or agriculture? Are you telling entire towns are living off rats and extremely rare even today, bald cats? shooting a flying bird with an arrow and supposedly being blind? Impossible.obviously that old house would have been destroyed by so much gun fire and no one would have survived in real life the library is located on Alcatraz island where there are no natural sources of food or water. and getting them requires crossing the treacherous currents of the ocean (you would be swept out to sea and be capsized on a small boat like they show in the movie) the woman born blind doesn't remember braille?

Another star because someone actually seems to have tried to make it look good. A third one because it's a movie that would have had more stars if it wasn't just someone preaching to me through the format of a movie. Also it's just boring. They tried to spice it up with fights, but it really didn't work on me. Fights were boring and over the top. I guess that's what happens if you have God on your side. This is a typical Hollywood movie with a typical Hollywood format, and then you just add a lot of God to it. The only reason I stayed awake through it all was because I really like a post-apocalyptic setting, and I'm starved of those. Don't even mention the pathetic attempts at humor.

454,name_not,Could have been so much better (Spoilers only at the end),2,13 March 2016,"The movie starts just fine by setting up the post-apocalyptic world with awesome soundtrack, revealing panoramas, and Denzel Washington doing his best to survive. Some nice camera work at the beginning. Just a bit later we are shown that Denzel's character is a freaking Rambo. OK. I can swallow that since the action scenes are pretty good. And who wouldn't want to see Denzel chop-off arms and heads left and right with a machete (even though he has a gun at him at all time)?Story progresses and we find out why Denzel is so special. He caries a book. And the main villain, played by Garry Oldman, wants it badly.Then we have the fun part of the movie: we get to watch chasing and shooting and fighting, and also Mila Kunis (Solara) failing to act yet again, then also some chit-chat about the book and why its so important. All fine and dandy.(Massive Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)Mila Kunis can't act. No, wait, you knew that.The book carried by Eli is the Bible, and Oldman wants to use it to rule the world (smart guy this Gary, learns from history). Eli however, is a completely invincible killing machine because he was apparently chosen by God (who spoke to him) to bring the Bible to a peaceful society. Even though it is hinted that the apocalypse was brought upon by religious conflict. Supported by the fact that every Bible was burned except the one owned by Eli.Also, the bible Eli was carrying is a Braille version of the book. Because Eli was blind the whole time.

So I have to remedy it by giving it 1 1/2 stars more than it deserved. The mood, the lighting, the cinematography, the soundtrack, Denzel W's acting, Gary O's acting, most of the supporting roles far outweighs a couple of the director's choices, a few continuity issues, and problems in the props department. And jeezus H. krist!!! so the eff what about the religious overtones?!? It's part of the story. Do you have a problem with Harry Potter pushing witchcraft and wizardry down our throats? Or maybe aliens are more realistic for ya because you've been probed a couple of times and liked it? Reminder: it's a friggin' movie! Enjoy it because it's fun.

The very end of the movie, people in the audience started to laugh, if you see it you will understand. Also, when you find out a very important part of the movie, at the end, something about Eli, it really shows the writers trying to hard to make this movie different. Sorry writers, it just made the movie that much more stupid. I believe if Denzel would have had more impute, I'm sure it would have been better. He usually does very good movies.All and all, it was entertaining, with the action. DVD movie for sure.",The Book of Eli
457,jfrahman,"Great flick, in the same vein as 'Fallout 3' and 'The Road'",7,29 June 2010,"I watched this movie fully aware that the book Denzel Washington's character Eli was carrying was a Bible, and actually put off watching it because I find religious polemics of any type quite distasteful, seeing as how I have one Muslim and one Methodist parent. I'd just watched 'The Road' the weekend before, however, and gave this movie a shot just because I was in a post-apocalyptic Fallout 3 sort of mood. I was not disappointed.In a nutshell, rather than a plug for Protestant Christianity (the branch I understand reveres the King James Bible), I took this movie as the chronicle of one man to preserve a sliver of the knowledge accumulated by humankind before 'The Flash' (presumably a nuclear exchange) destroyed civilization and most of the biosphere 30 years before. If this movie had been set in a Muslim country the protagonist would have had a Quran on his person, in a Buddhist country perhaps the Tripitaka (although that is a whole shelf of books and not just one).Denzel Washington played his role very well, a sort of post-apocalyptic American Zaotichi, although to be honest I did not catch on to the fact that he was supposed to be blind; this unnecessary plot twist is why I give this movie a 7 instead of a higher rating. Gary Oldman, as always, played his villain role to the hilt; I halfway expected him to bust out with the ""Jean-Baptiste...Emmanuel...Zorg"" Southern drawl (5th Element) at some point, glad he didn't though. Mila Kunis was passable as Solara, even though it's difficult to see her as anyone but Jackie Burkhart from ""That 70's Show"".One complaint: as many copies of the King James Bible are in existence, it's inconceivable that Eli was in possession of the only one left, in Braille to boot. The last copy of the Gospel of Peter would have been more compelling.Still, this was a very entertaining movie that got me thinking about some profound questions of existence, and in spite of the weaknesses in the plot it was a movie that had hope for the future in the end, very much unlike 'The Road'. I watched it twice in the 24 hours I had it (rented from Blockbuster) because I liked it that much.",The Book of Eli
458,collinbentley,Solid post-apocalyptic action flick!,8,21 December 2010,"Well, the summary line pretty much says it all. If you don't go into this movie expecting a life-changing experience you'll really enjoy it! Over-all it is a great depiction of post-apocalyptic life - fans of the Fallout series will dig it for sure. Yes, there are certainly some silly moments but it's still a neat world they've created and it's fun to watch if you're into the post-apocalyptic genre. As for the characters, Mila Kunis'character is weak but isn't a deal breaker. Gary Oldman also isn't spectacular in the role, surprisingly since it seems like a part he would excel at. He has this odd accent and goes a bit overboard with it. Denzel is spectacular, however.Definitely a solid watch if you're feeling action.",The Book of Eli
459,tjross-1,Faith vs Religion,8,20 August 2010,"8 of 10 stars because it was entertaining, well acted, and left me thinking about the role of faith/lack of faith in the world. Most importantly, it made me question my own faith. Denzel and Gary are at top form, Ray Stevenson and Mila Kunis give solid performances, and Jennifer Beals made me wish I had seen more of her. The tinted style and the cinematography work for the post-apocalyptic theme. The score works. The strength of this movie is that it surprised me and has been a great source of conversation with others that saw it. The Hughes brothers do a good job with a limited script. It's a gem for people who know the difference between religion and faith and who can extrapolate the themes of the movie with the modern world.",The Book of Eli

I would recommend this movie as it is not too bad with violence and rude or scenes and has quite a decent storyline If you're looking for an apocalyptic movie without zombies but with a good storyline then try this out some time.Probably one of the best apocalyptic movies I've seen in a while.

I mean how come that Eli first was ""bullet proof"" when he had the bible back in the small town, but when he gave it/was taken away from him outside that house, he turned to be ""just a man""?? faith and god will protect their messengers/men no matter whether they carried a bible or not. that made the movie, for me, losing it's Christian touch and turned it to a vampires- kinda-thing.

How do contemporary means of written communication affect our consciousness? What is the difference between a posted video or audio message and a thoroughly written text? What are the ways for integrating the different modalities of our Reading? And, finally, how could a single book give birth and self-organizing drive to entire civilization? What is the consciousness that summoned its manifestation? These are the questions I keep asking myself.",The Book of Eli
463,Jammal_Stone,An attempt to convey a message through a noble film with mixed results:,7,18 January 2010,"The Book of Eli follows the story of a man who travels the wastelands of a post apocalyptic world on a quest of the utmost importance. As films go the beginning opens to an idea of a world in despair where the desperate cling to life be they plant, animal or human. It contains many stunning shots of this wasteland but indulges perhaps a bit too much in the notion that the emotion of the image is visually intriguing by itself. There are quite a few scenes where you will ask yourself what the director meant by keeping focus on one character for thirty seconds as they stare into the distance with blank expressions. This sets the tone for the rest of the film which is dotted in rhythm much like the opening fifteen minutes that moves between intriguing and artistic attempts turned dull.The film provides quality action scenes spaced with the progression of a plot that is somewhat bland at first. There is a man. He is a bad ass. He is heading West. However this grows into something more once Eli finally reaches a form of civilization depicted in the trailers. As you may have guessed his desire to cause no trouble does not prevent trouble from finding him. What emerges from the violence is a bit of a strange plot given the circumstances. If you reflect on it rationally the entire premise of the villain in the film is outright confused; if he knew what he wanted and knew the nature of what it was, he could literally just invent it for himself.Once the film begins to pick up and Eli has been established as a character, his visually pleasing manslaughter encounters a sudden twist: quoting the bible while slaughtering the heathens. Now this can be done well; a Pulp Fiction style reference dotted with humor to ease the tension of the act would have been a classic moment. Unfortunately the lack of humor involved (a necessary choice for the plot) and the fact that it was not a passing reference becomes awkward. However if it does not bother you to listen to a man talk about the *God of *love whilst carving up a fellow or two then this itself is no deal breaker.Forgiving the jihad, Eli makes himself out to be a tad more intriguing for his butchering ways akin to Shepard Book from Firefly for a stint. This in itself may have proved to be an excellent progression but this is America and we like an attractive female to stare at. Thusly introducing the female lead; an entirely too attractive for the environment, too well spoke, too clean and too independent individual for her role. It is not entirely the fault of the actress; the character was written incorrectly for the past it was supposed to have and ultimately boils down to what appears to be a valley girl stalking Eli from shot to shot against his will.The actions between Eli and Solara do little to bring about synergy between the pair. There is a distinct lack of bond between their crafted characters which becomes more difficult to ignore as the film goes on. That aside there are still quite a few moments of entertaining murder left to behold, despite numerous shots that begin to wreak havoc with the verisimilitude, like Eli's shining white teeth.All and all as films go it is a decent action film with excellent environments laced with more Christian overtone than you can shake a cross at. By the end of the film you might feel something emotional if you are Christian or possibly deeply offended if you are some other religion. The reason I say this is because the film is not about faith, it is about Christian faith which gets super special miracles while other faiths just sit on the shelf.If none of the above bothers you too much, this film will entertain you for most of the time you are watching it. If you happen to be Christian, this film has deep message for you about how you are right and everyone else is wrong, which is almost certain to entertain you.",The Book of Eli

466,ncoutlander,How Can You Mend a Broken World,10,20 January 2010,"Good movies always find a way of immersing the viewer into the movie. Sometimes it's through a sudden event and other times it can be just a subtle moment. In the movie The Book of Eli it was one of those subtle moments. The scene focused Eli listening to a tune on his I Pod. The song playing was ""How can you mend a Broken Heart"". This tune was made famous by the Bee Gees,the rendition used in the movie was one by Al Green.I could immediately tell why the producer chose the later version by Al Green. The song's calming effect immediately transported us into that room with Eli. The lyrics of the song were a memorable reminder of the past and what he was feeling in the present. These are feelings I'm sure we could all identify with at some point in our lives. From that point in the movie on, we found ourselves ready to accompany Eli on his journey. Eli was a journey based solely on hope and faith. There were reminders to us all along the way of the things in life we often take for granted(one which even included one of those little bottles of shampoo you get from a hotel). One doesn't have to be a Christian to appreciate movie, but I'm sure some will view it that way. The message the movie conveys is a good one for all to see. The Book of Eli is well worth watching. Denzel Washington gives another great command performance. The supporting cast is a great fit for the movie, all giving excellent performances.",The Book of Eli

He seems to only kill when necessary, and he's isn't when he does.I only realised while reading the reviews that he was actually blind... Although it's a beautiful plot twist, it's also one extra bit of unbelievableness. I always find it hard to believe that one person keeps killing all the many others.Altogether a wonderful movie, intriguing to me how he works towards his goal.

468,stephenllewellyn2003,Dreadful,1,5 June 2010,"This post apocalyptic nightmare is made compelling by its ability to be completely dire in every aspect of its construction. Why? Firstly, it's annoyingly contrived and moronic direction. Not least in the scene where a rather hairy Malcolm McDowell receives a less than well- earned paycheck for sticking, and then lovingly wiping, a restored bible between the Koran and Torah. Doubtless a scene inserted to appease any accusations of political incorrectness. Then there's the twist (if you can make it that far), which was damned apparent from the minute the opening credits rolled. Mind you, it's worth a peek to see old Denzel with his hair shaved off; I didn't recognize him myself, which is probably just as well considering. Finally, but certainly not least, there is the overwhelmingly nauseating message of the piece, with the now follicly challenged Denzel proffering a post apocalyptic world salvation through a restored and restituted bible. The very thing that doubtless caused the nuclear destruction in the first place! Surely, a nice leather bound Richard Dawkins tome would have been better!Truly dreadful film-making. Save your money!",The Book of Eli
469,einsi_tequila,"Looks good, the rest is disappointing.",3,31 July 2010,"After seeing the average rating, you might think that I'm harsh to give it only 3 stars. Let me explain why: When this movie started, it looked very promising. The graphics were something else... then they started talking.The storyline and dialog expose how terribly ""hollywoodized"" this movie is. I'm getting extremely irritated of how desperately religious minds always spread their empty messages through film screenplay, leaving those who know better with a bit of frustration after viewing almost every movie produced in Hollywood. In The Book Of Eli they don't even try to hide the tunnel vision. There is fiction... and then there is propaganda.The good (3 stars): It looks good, the graphic atmosphere was pretty convincing. Denzel Washington does a good job adapting to the atmosphere. Gary Oldman is always convincing in his role, including this one. The fighting scene in the beginning was well made.The bad (0 stars): The storyline and dialog was empty, extremely unoriginal. The only believable part of it was that the nuclear war was believed to be caused by religious fanatics. The shootout scene later in the movie was unrealistic, a hail of bullets fly through a weak wooden house but everyone inside seem to avoid it all because they don't stand by the window... i guess. I'm not going to spoil the surprise but it wasn't that great, actually also quite unrealistic.Conclusion: If you believe in the bible or don't care about the storyline, this movie is probably for you. If not, then you are better off playing Fallout 3 (computer game) that has the graphics and a proper storyline, multiple story-lines actually. This could have been a great movie if it had been properly thought through and more neutrally open minded. But when I look at it as a whole, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.",The Book of Eli
470,marc_dambrosio,what Eli saw....,9,11 October 2010,"Another Denzel Film, another Apocalyptic Film.Two elements which generally serve to put me off quickly. This film was originally explained and made exciting to me by virtue of its action elements. More specifically I was told this movie will blow your mind because Eli - Denzels character is nothing short of a master of fighting skill.I knew nothing of this film, except that it starred Denzel, an actor lost on me for years. I cast this film away in advance of seeing it worried that it may end up as John Q on the longest training day in the history of Mad Max' world.I see reviewers take from this film an overtly Christian theme, while its prevalent it adds for me a certain level of solitude of the film. Plainly if he didn't follow that book, or any religious book his character would come across more as a vigilante rather than a follower.Denzel plays a quiet character void of the actors usual ego and obsessive charisma. He is solemn, but sharp - his interactions with all other characters in the film show his sincerity, this sincerity carries with him throughout the movie.The action was as was explained to me in advance, still unexpected - it was gory, it was fast, it was god-like. It often forced you to question the actual history of the Eli, who was he?, what was he capable of?....could he be killed? Another interesting and unexpected element of the film was the music both ambient and intentional. It plays an active role throughout, with an industrial score of sharp un-film like shrills and pre-apocalyptic music. In the early stages of the movie it sets a tone of sincerity and warmth throughout the film. Eli himself find solitude in music, as a guide.Im not entirely sure what those who did not enjoy the ending expected. By the time the films ending came about, I was without any further expectation, I was seeing what Eli saw and that became the movie.What Eli saw....The book of Eli was a perfectly engaging movie with stunning cinematography abound, moving music, tedious character development and a tone in movies often lost in a world were movie watchers are too lazy to go on the journey shared.For the first time in 29 years I've seen the genius of Denzel in a genre I don't prefer,wrapped up in a Christian theme with thoroughly violent action.",The Book of Eli
471,pascal_winnen,Boring,6,15 September 2010,"What's wrong with movie makers these days? It seems a lot of fair to good actors are available, but there are just no good scripts around.Once again a totally ridiculous plot spoils some decent performances by 2 good actors: Oldman and Washington. You can forget about the others, because they are all bad attempts to copy Mad Max-like stereotypes.It's all about a ""mysterious"" journey of a man with a ""mysterious"" book. It took me about 2 seconds to guess this was the bible. Anyway, a blind guy who seems to have a built-in radar needs 30 years to walk to Alcatraz, meeting villains trying to rob, kill and eat him about every half an hour (apparently the script writers found the trap with the shopping cart robbers so extremely original that they had to use it twice). And as usual in this kind of movies, finding decent shoes in the right size seems to be an issue. Bullets, knives and chainsaws don't seem to hurt him, however, as soon as he loses the book he gets shot in the guts. No problem, a bit of duck-tape and he moves on to Alcatraz where he dictates the book and dies. Oh and our hero meets a chick on his journey, but that is totally irrelevant since there is no chemistry whatsoever between the two, she anyway didn't have anything to do.I was waiting to hear Scott McKenzie's ""Are you Going to San Francisco"" throughout the whole movie, but the soundtrack passed just as unnoticed as all the characters and suddenly it was all over and I could finally go to sleep.",The Book of Eli
472,sjl330,This movie was fantastic!!!,10,18 January 2010,"I had pretty low hopes for this movie from the previews but after seeing it all I can say is I loved it and so did my husband and everybody else I've told about it who have now seen it. As usual Denzel does a wonderful job of acting and Oldham does as well. There are some very violent scenes in the movie, which I'd expect for a world such as they were living in. I thought it was a very thought provoking movie as well as inspirational and even a little bit scary, but I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. It's one of the best I've seen in the last year. At last a movie with some real substance. One that makes you think rather than so many other movies where you wonder why in the world the movie was even made in the first place. I rarely see movies more than one time but this movie is one of those that I'd like to see again.",The Book of Eli
473,KinzerSGTR,Not comparing this to the Road..... OK yes I am!!!,7,6 February 2010,"I was not sure what to expect of this film when I went to say it. But I was told repeatedly to go see it. I was largely impressed. Considering the directors haven't exactly got the longest of ""Stellar"" resumes. But this movie made me Feel Grim, it made me laugh, it made me smile, it made me shake my head in disbelief, and nod in agreement. It made me feel stronger about certain beliefs I already have, and it made me want to see it again... that is what makes Eli a good film. Not its action, and not its special effects.OK, First; I hate movie trailer/marketing schemes that give the entire film away. This movie luckily didn't get that. The directors also played the film along, without giving to much away to the audience. It did a great job of making you wonder what in fact ""THE BOOK"" was all about, and who this man was. Little Details weren't necessary! Second; I don't want to get into a comparison with ""The (Horrible) ROAD"". Because I have already reviewed that film... the Road was the worst idea of people trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world, that has ever been translated to the screen. I would rather gouge my eyes and ears out than sit through it again. Nothing else being said about it.(Its a film of weak human beings, bad choices, and bad Fathering, and a waste of acting talent!) Now yes... Eli, is a film designed to appeal more to the masses, but it is also a film that took the same concept, and did it in a more believable and compelling manner (not to mention entertaining). Yes, The ending was a little unnecessary, but I can understand the idea of his friend turned student, feeling like his ""Successor"", and having an emotional need to go out on her own journey, to possibly find and help someone the same way that Eli did for her. Finding her, ""Home"" as she stated!! It explained, what was necessary to carry the film. The behavior of the people in the environment was realistic, unlike a certain other movies idea of an over sheltering father. The plot/screenplay in Eli is simple... some people want his stuff in his backpack for self preservation, others want the ""BOOK"", for their own self sustaining reasons. Find Eli, walk, action sequence, walk, talk! Repeat! Twist! Roll Credits. Largely the heart of the movie is in Fact the characters themselves. The emotion Eli has in his determination to protect the book, and his unfailing ability to fight by any means to do so. The ""inspired"" child, who feels the need to learn something from him, following him on his path. The mad man, driven by his greed to gain more power in a desolate unforgiving world. And even the henchman, who isn't quite sure that what he is doing is right, but feels that he needs something to believe in, to keep going, with nowhere else to turn. The movie is totally simple to understand, and the BRAILLE twist at the end, and his (NOT)""Disability"" is a big enough surprise to make anyone gasp in surprise!! It didn't make the film though. The Cinematography is stellar, the setting and scope in size is rattling, Oldman makes any role he takes on completely believable, especially ""Crazed Baddies"", as does Denzel in his acting! Yet, This role is something more specific, that I wasn't use to seeing Washington play. Namely being a hand to hand combat BAD A$$!! But he pulled it off magically. Kunis was even well fitted in her role. Which was not as cliché as I expected it to be. And a bit more multifaceted. Beals, almost seemed like the she would've turn out to be the white light, to Oldmans darker half, but didn't. No one seemed unnatural in their parts. The movie was largely convincing and entertaining! Managing to make something simple, seem much deeper, thanks to a ""hidden meaning"" that you where waiting to find out by the end of the film. The enveloping soundtrack, the grittiness of the landscape, and the question of the book, made for a largely entertaining and satisfactory movie, with a great cast, and a great philosophical outlook on the world, and how we take it for granted. I would definitely watch it again, and recommend it to anyone!",The Book of Eli

The Book of Eli starts off very exciting and half-way through we discover a twist in the story that shows the potential of this piece as a would-be cinematic classic. At this stage I am really enjoying myself — what a great movie this is!Unfortunately, we find out towards the end that it is, in fact, a piece of religious propaganda aimed at preaching the importance of Christianity. Extremely disappointing. For this reason the movie deserves a 1/0 in my opinion. Unless you are a fundamentalist Christian, this is one to avoid.",The Book of Eli

How they managed destroy it from there on must be considered as an huge accomplishment. They actually set a new record in terrible directing, producing and writing. And to spit about 5.5 billion people in the face like that was the most distasteful thing in television ever to be seen. Gay Whitta, Hughes brothers and Joel Silver should be ashamed of themselves.

What's worse the filmmakers, in a not too subtle storyline at the end, set the stage for a sequel, as if anyone really cared. This has to be among Denzel's most embarrassing movie moments in his otherwise excellent film career. Why he chose to do it remains a mystery. The director and writers hit you over the head with references to biblical themes and utterances. Never more so than at the end, when the librarian on Alcatraz (yes, the prison) positions the only known version of the King James bible between the Torah and the Kuran. That may be a pop corn moment for young teens, but for adults the scene coughs up phlem. This is an anti-intellectual film. It chokes off any thought. There are no deep insights in the movie. In fact, there is nothing deep about it all except the producer's pocket to pay Denzel's fee. The worst message the film sends out is that without the bible, humans are utterly lost. According to the story, there is no way people can distinguish right form wrong without the ""book."" Human beings, say the filmmakers, are incapable of showing any moral values ---unless they receive divine light. What a laughable premise. As for the producers behind this movie, I say remove your names from the credits. I can only help your career.",The Book of Eli

The action sequences are good, until the part where we see that Eli is of course the mouth of the pope and protected by god.This movie is thinly veiled Christian propaganda. Eli is a holy warrior protected by god. Bullets miss him, and he is on a mission to take the bible back to the core of post apocalyptic civilization which he has been told to do so by god.He doesn't use cars or bikes to do this despite the seeming abundance of them belonging to men much less skilled at obtaining/defending them. Apparently his long 30 years walk another obvious religious metaphor.Despite being able to kill 25 men at once with a knife and a toothpick Eli decides not to help as a woman is raped by 3 motorcycle thugs. Not sure what the message there is? There are several stupid scenes where he could of clearly been searched for weapons and detained, yet for some reason the bad guy lets him keep everything on him, revering perhaps his ""Holyness""? Giving him a choice representing the devil's temptation? The last thing a post apocalyptic world needs is the stifling burden of creationism on its future scientific rediscovery , by the end of the movie there is absolutely no case for the importance of Eli's mission and the abundance of religious metaphor wipes away the excitement created by the early on action scenes ( where it seemed he wasn't bulletproof yet).I was half expecting to be offered mailed pamphlet's by the end.",The Book of Eli
479,brandon-mcanally,"Great cast, Great story, Great rental",8,23 January 2016,"Second Look Review: The Book of Eli (2010) Denzel Washington is a lone wolf that has to suddenly deliver an important message based on a matter of importance. He carries a backpack, a book, and most importantly, a sword he bought at a zombie survival store just before the radiation / hot sun apocalypse happened. So, he keeps the sword anyway and commences to trotter about.Denzel must deliver this message 'somewhere west'. His message delivery mission is set against the backdrop of a wasteland desert America, probably already somewhere out west. He swords some guys in the face and finds a pair of shoes off a dead guy. Denzel comes across some unsavory types that try to take advantage of him in a bar. He takes one of their hands, I think. I do remember he makes his presence rather known to the town's unofficial leader, played by a ticked off Gary Oldman. Don't tick off Gary Oldman. He's looking for a book but his henchmen can't find it. This book is the bible, obviously. Gary knows that he needs that thing to get the full backing of the entire populace because if he has God's word then everyone will listen to him. If you want to participate in the business of hope and crowd control, become a religious leader.Denzel then finds Tom Waits. This film has Tom Waits in it as a gravelly (surprise) shopkeeper that charges Denzel's batteries for him. Not those batteries, actual batteries. He's a good guy, that Mr. Waits.Denzel tries to leave the town but Gary Oldman wants the book he has. Titus Pullo tries to shoot Denzel. Denzel then has to fight the bad guys. Denzel escapes, but Gary Oldman eventually catches up with him and fate catches up with Gary Oldman.Denzel eventually makes it to the spot where he delivers his message and the movie ends. There is a lot to love about this film. It has a fun, weekend-viewing premise and is backed by a great cast. Also, Mila Kunis is in it.Bonus: Malcolm McDowell reprises his role of post-apocalyptic community organizer (Doomsday, Tank Girl, Cyborg 3: The Recycler, and Entourage (TV)).",The Book of Eli
480,maryam_haider,Based on Islamic predictions and concepts.,9,16 January 2010,"The movie is based on Islamic beliefs and on the predictions made in the Quran about the events leading up to the end of the world and the day of judgement. The concepts taken in the movie are: 1. The word of Allah (God) will be taken away from the world. This will include the Holy Book Quran being taken away not only physically but also taken away from the hearts of the people i.e. the people will forget it.2. Muslims are the only religious people in the world who learn their Holy Book the Quran by heart. This is a tradition that has been going on since the birth of Islam which was adopted for the exact reason that it wouldn't be forgotten. The book is learned word for word, with exact pronunciation by thousands and thousands of Muslims called 'hafiz - e -Quran who dedicate their lives to this learning. The same concept was shown in the movie, Eli learns the book by heart.3. Islamic prophecy: A major war will be fought between the Jews, Christians and the Muslims. This was also hinted in the movie when Eli says that people believed the war happened because of the book and in anger they burned all the copies.4.A few other prophecies are also taken from Islamic traditions but the ones quoted above are the most prominent and the ones on which the movie is based.All in all, the movie was an excellent representation of what the world is going towards. Elis comments about the pre-war world 'people had much more than they needed' still stick in my mind. Without putting in too much dialogue the writer still makes his story easy to understand. Bravo!",The Book of Eli
481,Kritic7,"What in the ""good lord's name"" was that?",4,24 January 2010,"This movie for me peaked way too soon, how soon, the first fight scene. That soon! It went down hill from there as far as action went, and as far as absurdity went, goodness that just went threw the roof, maybe to the gates of heaven. Was it an action film, a religious film, I couldn't tell you.The way the film was shot was cool. It was on the low end of the CGI scale and the browns and blues made for a real burnt feeling. The sets where cool, and I did feel like I was walking through a town that tried to shake hands with the sun! But! Denzel Washington played a good role; Gary Oldman was a decent bad guy, both actors are better than they showed, a lot better. I personally thought the movie was a giant let down. I wasn't scared of Oldman for really any of the film. Was his bald headed pack leader Redridge a bad guy or not. Make up your mind! He shoots one guy in the head, and then doesn't shoot Eli for what reasonI'll tell you when I figure it out. Mila Kunis' character wasn't bad, but could have been done without. All in all, not one character was amazing. And the relationships between characters sucked, plain and simple. Truly, I think if anyone took a bullet in the chest, the other characters would maybe shed the ""one tear"" and move on. Except Eli and Solara, maybe! He did get shot, not sure if she cried. She screamed, but I can't remember tears.The plot about the Bible being a weapon for evil or a tool for good was interesting. In the movie all the Bibles are burned for ""starting"" the war that tore open the sky. And with this being the last one, people of the faith will have something to live by once again for better or worse. When Oldman's character finally gets his dirty paws on the book and gets it unlocked, it turns out to be in brail. Bummer! Well sucks for him, and yes, that does in fact mean Eli is a blind man driven by faith to cut people's arms off with a machete. At the end when Eli recites the bible word for word as a blind monk-like man dying on a pewOK WTF! I am sorry, this just is dumb. The movie was OK at best then I gotta be hit with this garbage, give me a break. And if my soul wasn't already broken, I get to see Solara dressed like Rambo, walk off into the sunset!

482,rgjm4,"""Go check the television! What's a television?""",10,30 January 2010,"Conversations like the above help make this an entertaining movie. The directors do an excellent job of setting the mood of a lost world. Denzel Washington and the other actors did an excellent job of keeping me interested. It is true that the storyline DOES contain some logic flaws, which is why I gave it a score of less than 10. The appearing, disappearing, reappearing bow and arrow or the unexplained way Eli escaped from his room are two examples. However, the movie makes up for such flaws with some great action scenes that are truly fun to watch. In summation, to paraphrase a sports saying: ""You go to the movies to be entertained"".

If you take Denzel Washington out of this film, you have an utterly forgettable straight-to-DVD flick. As it sits, you have an utterly forgettable should-have-been-straight-to-DVD flick with Denzel Washington.The most absurd, unreasonable element of the film is the shockingly pathetic concept that the whole film is based around - there is only ONE Bible left on the planet. Of course, there are many other equally far-fetched and almost equally as silly plot holes, but that one alone is bad enough to warrant giving up on the film early. Sadly, I didn't not and watched it to the end hoping for some payoff that never came. We won't even get into the fact that we're never told why it's taking Eli 31 years to travel across country (yes, that means he averaged 1/4 mile a day). As far as post-apocalyptic films goes, it lacks the originality of the ""The Road Warrior"", the human element of ""The Road"", the energy of ""Escape from New York"" and the great ending of ""Planet of the Apes.""

484,scleaver237,Surprisingly good!,8,25 May 2010,"Before seeing this film I read many of the reviews on this site, many of which said it was rubbish and not to waste your time. I disagree with these people i thought it was thoroughly enjoyable from start to end. Good acting yet again from Denzel Washington really made this film. The storyline was really good not a storyline you see in a movie or book very often. And the films visuals were quite impressive, with what the filmmakers thought the Earth would look like after an apocalyptic event.So the Book of Eli is really about how Gary Oldman's character(Carnegie) is after the last Bible on the earth, this Bible belongs to Denzel Washinghton's character Eli. Eli's mission was to travel west, but He had trouble as Carnegie wanted his Bible, Carnegie and his men put up a fight to get the Bible too.This Film has plenty of features, in pretty intense action scenes, good acting and visuals, and an amazing twist at the end.

485,delomundo6905,"Worth watching, not worth hating, not worthy of loving *spoilers*",6,21 July 2010,"There is a lot of controversy surrounding this movie. So let's jump right into it. Yes, the book Eli carried with him was a Bible. Does that matter to some people? Yes it does. Are there religious themes in this movie? A few, however does that make this a bad movie? The answer is know. These film makers aren't Christians. They are trying to bring people over to this religion called Christianity. They are simply trying to make a movie about the impact of religion of the lives of people. Did they do that? Well yes they did. The movie is not about religion it is about the impact of religion on the life of Eli who is the main character of the movie. I would be perfectly fine with this movie if Eli had a Koran, or a Torah. When you watch movies you must look for what the director is trying to convey, not what you want for him to convey. Evaluate the director's presentation of their idea, not how you thought they should have presented it. So, was this idea well presented? Yes, and no. Most of leads were good, except for the girl. The action was good, but the environment while diverse seemed halfway done. I know that green screen is big now a days but you don't have to make it that obvious. Some of the special effects were spot on, some of them weren't. Some of the editing was great, some of it wasn't. Some of the writing was superb, some of it was really cliché and dry. This movie is a mixed bag that comes out on the better side of neutral. The director successfully conveyed the main idea of the movie.

487,Gonissa,Don't Trust the Hate,10,4 February 2011,"Simply put, this movie is nothing like Hollywood in all the right ways. Let me list it out.1. It's deep. It doesn't point out every plot point but lets the audience find it for themselves. So much of this movie is based on one's personal impression rather than how Hollywood forces you to feel.2. No inane pop songs. This is all Atticus Ross' work, only excepting one classic song early on that's better than modern boring songs. Seriously, go look up ""book of eli the journey"" on youtube.3. The special effects follow the story. This isn't some plot hacked together just so they can show shiny action scenes that are supposed to blow your mind. Here the plot is king, with each digital creation making the movie's world richer rather than just trying to impress you with it's fake extravagance.4. The plot isn't cookie cutter. This plot is considered by some to be controversial, but really it's a wonderful tale of a man who faces good thematic conflict: completing the mission vs being there for others, going forward instead of giving in, trusting God who he can't see, and being or at least trying to be righteous in a world where there are people who will kill you for your simplest possessions. It's a moral trap no matter what Eli chooses.There are people who hate this movie, but the truth is, the plot, visuals, and actors were superb. The hate derives singly from a hatred of Christianity itself or else the concept of God. So honestly, if you hate God that's the only reason not to see this movie. You don't have to be a Christian to enjoy it. It's a genuine, fun movie that you'd be missing out on not to watch.",The Book of Eli

489,mindspider-1,"Incredible, if you can accept the religious themes",9,20 June 2010,"Honestly, I've never felt compelled to write a review for a movie on IMDb before. For The Book of Eli, however, I feel like I have to. When the movie came out, I was told that it was an average action movie, not worth my money. Having finally seen it, however, I wish I had gone to see it on the big screen. I'll start with the easy parts to talk about. The visual style of the movie was beautiful. I am a sucker for the whole nuclear-apocalypse setting of the movie, as seen in Mad Max or Fallout. The Book of Eli, with it's high-contrast and low-saturation color palette, was beautiful. Many of the scenes were brought to life by interesting shot compositions and an excellent use of lights and darks. In the same vein, I thought the action scenes were great. They were fast-paced, fluid, and brutal. The first fight, which takes place in the shadows beneath a ruined highway, was especially standout. And I can't leave out the music - low- key and brooding, the soundtrack was perfect. It had a hard electronic edge, and was dark and moody enough to convey the bleakness of the world left after a nuclear war. I won't spend too time on the acting, because I thought it was very good overall. Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman both put out great performances, and the supporting actors were solid and believable. The plot. Many people don't like it, I personally loved it. I think it essentially boils down to this: how do you like your religious overtones? Book of Eli is full of them, and by it's very nature, religion is an ambiguous subject. If you demand a tight, well-explained plot, you might be frustrated by this movie. The plot wanders. Considering the transient feel of the movie, however, I felt like it was acceptable. I thought the ending had some real suspense, as well as some nice surprises. Again, your enjoyment of the final minutes may vary, but I loved it. Overall, I thought the movie was very enjoyable, combined several genres in an interesting way, and was backed up by great production values. I totally disagree with any notion that it is a ""mindless action movie"", as was described to me. Love it or hate it, at least have the decency of calling it ""unique"".",The Book of Eli

No creepiness, no unease, no thrill down the spine so typical of a post-apocalypse movie, where the values and human moral code have ceased to exist.The plot: Eli, a lonesome cowboy, is apparently the so very special new cat in town because he has a book. A book, or rather 'the' book, since the bad guy also wants it. Eli finally escapes but looses the book, which he fortunately recites by heart for John Printer at the end who will make new copies.Why does the bad guy want the book? I still ask myself this question, it does not make sense. Why is the book - the bible - so important? no clue, it does not make sense. Why is Mila Kunis wearing raybans and look like she's going to the mall at every scene? no clue either.The plot is not flawed, it is non-existent. The apocalyptic world is not well depicted, which weakens considerably the immersion: e.g. the world is gone and the sun too agressive apparently, so that people always wear sunglasses, it could work but everyone wears ray-bans or gucci glasses, which looks ridiculous in that context.

496,weby2,It's not a pro-Christian film!,6,15 October 2010,"I won't bother with the synopsis, as that's already been done to death.What I do want to say is that I didn't find this to be some evangelical Christian film. Those that have claimed it is are not really understanding the film. I suspect they're just seeing the portrayal of the Bible as important and jumping to this incorrect conclusion.*** Spoilers *** Yes, Eli is devout in his faith in the Bible and his 'mission' to take the book west to where he believes its rightful home will be. Because he heard a voice in his head. He absolutely believes he's protected on this mission by God, and due to this protection will enter his various combats without fear and with an absolute certainty that he will prevail. It is this belief that makes him so effective in the fights, not supernatural protection. This is demonstrated when Carnegie just shoots him.Carnegie wants the Bible not because he's of a religious bent and wants to illuminate the minds of his minions with the glory of the Lord. He wants it because he knows the power that religion can bring to those whom control it. Living before 'the war' and being an obviously intelligent man, he'll have known that the grip that religion can hold over the indoctrinated has been abused for time immemorial by those who control the religion to manipulate those under its spell.Carnegie wants that power and control for himself. I thought the film was pretty clear in making that apparent.Finally, when Eli gets to Alcatraz, he isn't lauded as some messianic figure who's fulfilled his mission to deliver the Bible to a peoples who will use it to reunite civilisation. Instead, he's welcomed as someone who's brought an important historical book that they didn't already have. Lombardi then explains their mission to rebuild civilisation with ALL the artifacts of the lost humanity - a wide range of books, music and other items. After Eli completes the dictating of the Bible, it is merely put on the bookshelf amongst all the other books.Saying all that, I found the film to be nothing special. I know people who lose a sense (in this case sight) often have their remaining 4 senses develop to slightly counteract their disability, but there's also taking this notion too far. It's probably best that the twist isn't revealed until the end, because I'd have likely switched off well before then with an incredulous shake of the head.The film also added disappointingly little to the post-apocalypse genre, relying on a lot of Mad Max imagery and plot, especially concerning the villains.Overall, a watchable film... but not a great.",The Book of Eli

499,chuck s,This movie does not make any sense,1,22 January 2010,"This movie explains that the Earth was destroyed because of wars of religion and that therefore the survivors destroyed every religious books to prevent from repeating the same disaster. And yet, one man – Eli played by Denzel Washington – who's supposed to be a good man, a wise man chooses to preserve one of these religious books which was partly responsible for almost destroying the Earth!! What's the idea? He expects this time the job will be done correctly and Earth and mankind will be destroyed completely? The Hughes brothers are trying to say that religions are a good thing that can be bad if used by the wrong people (Gary Oldman's character). Which is a stupid message. The good question is: do we need religion to live together? The answer is no because as soon as someone has one religion he rejects anyone having another religion (or no religion at all). Religious tolerance is a myth, it does not exist. Man has invented something better than religions to live together, it's called Laic Democracy. One more thing, Eli hears voices (like Joan of Arc) telling him what to do and the Hughes brothers, who obviously believe in God, implicitly assert that God exists by this subterfuge (since ""He speaks to Eli""). Didn't the Hughes brothers ever heard of medical science? Someone who hears voices from God (or anyone else) is not a Saint it's someone who suffers from schizophrenia (a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder). By the way, religions do exist, it's a fact. And God does not exist, it's a fact.",The Book of Eli

It doesn't make much sense, but in principle, it doesn't have to in order for this genre to be entertaining or thought provoking. And as far as these things go, the cinematography is pretty good, as is the acting.However, the uncritical acceptance of Christian stereotypes and beliefs disturbing. Humanity has destroyed itself and these people still don't get it? I suppose compared to the lack of moral compass and reflection in the movie, the plot holes themselves don't really even matter much; perhaps the audience is supposed to consider them ""miracles"" or ""divine intervention"".I give it three stars for the cinematography and acting; other than that, this movie is forgettable.

But this movie is seriously one of the worst movies I've seen in 10 years. It has the same scenes and action over and over again and never really builds to that climax at the end. It is depressing as the world is black and white. It was like sitting through your worst nightmare. I wanted to walk out, but you're always curious about the message and what happens at the end. I was neither blown away by the ending or moved in any way by this movie. It was a dark depressing version of the world in 30 years.

The acting is okay. Denzel plays the same role he always plays and is what carries the entire film. Without him this would be a complete disaster. Though I imagine it could make a passable comedy if they replaced Denzel with Jim Carrey. I can just picture him do the all the sword fighting. Perhaps this is something for a sequel? Anyhow...Continuing with the review, not much character development - a weak attempt is made to show the development of a young girl who follows Denzel around, but neither she nor the script can quite pull it off. The soundtrack is standard industry fare, though thankfully not too melodramatic or over the top.The plot seems realistic enough: a few years after an apocalypse and after the civilized world is rebooted, religious people can hardly wait to start murdering each other over a book, again.All in a very cool and poetic way of course.Decent to watch if you're on an air plane or such, otherwise avoid.",The Book of Eli

From there it goes down hill faster than gravity should allow. Mel Gibson launched his carrer on this movie back in 1979 with the Australian film, Mad Max. It was a good idea back then. Not now. It's another post-apocalypse story with the main character (Denzel) in possession of the last remaining copy of the book that would save mankind. What book might that be? Guess!. As he travels west through a violent lawless land (divinely guided) to deliver the book to the people that will use it wisely, An evil lord (Gary Oldman), knowing the power it would bring wants it for himself. The heroine played by Mira Kunis, wants to get away from Oldman travels along with Eli as The evil lord tries to find them. He eventually finds them and gets possession of the book.

The writers just had no inspiration at all and delivered a high-school level of script. Their top ""inspiration"" was the revelation of main character's ""problem"", but this was worthless. It didn't make me feel excited at all. Worst of all? They had Gary Oldman playing the bad guy and managed to NOT make him that bad. We're talking about Gary Oldman, who with a decent script can make miracles in playing the bad guy and he was just tasteless. Not to mention the silly end... All in all, it more reminded me of a adaptation of a video game (like Fallout 3), rather than a film worth the value of actors like Washington and Oldman. Such a waste...",The Book of Eli

I've waited a while now to have the chance, but it was totally ruined for me. I don't like seeing cats die, I did not appreciate this at all. You see the arrow, the cat and the arrow in the cat. You hear the cat's dying yowl, you get to see the cat's dead body. You even get to see it on a spit and being eaten, by man and mouse. Then comes the first fight scene, pitting machete versus chainsaw in the end. Against the odds, the machete beats the chainsaw and the gang is dead. Totally bad-ass and I love Denzel for this. Then comes more people, innocent looking enough, but then there's the bikers. This just REEKS of trouble. Bikers never seem to be good in Post apocalyptic movies. Well, they are typical and they're not good. They shoot the dude and then.. Guess what? They proceed to rape the girl. Eli could have rescued her, but no, ""It's not your problem"".. Bullshit! In my eyes, when you can stop a rape and you don't do anything you're as bad as them. I walked out of the theater at this point, ready to puke all over the rows in front of me.

510,shashiladha,Too stretched and too hypothetical,6,18 January 2010,"Rating - 2.75/5 Spoilers - Not really Highlights - Denzel's acting and the setup of action scenes. I think - Do not watch unless you don't have anything to do. Comment - Can watch because some people liked it a lot.As many others have said, the trailers suggested it to be an action-pack movie but you will be looking for more. The main plot around which the movie revolves is that Denzel has to protect a book and take it towards west to a place where the book actually belongs (in the right hands). Why the book?? Because - After the war, humanity has almost come to an end and only this book can lead the civilization to rise again.The movie started with a scene in the woods where an animal (don't know the name) was sniffing around a dead body and then it suddenly hears a movement at a distance and before it could find out, an arrow comes and pierce it dead. Denzel enters here. A nicely shot scene and the movie promised of good action.But from here the movie shows Denzel walking along the high-ways of a post-war world, reaching a torn-down house, finding a dead man hanging. He takes the shoes on the dead's feet. He stays the night there, reading the book , listening to music and dozing off. I was almost asleep by the end of this scene. First of all it totally took away from the first scene and it was too long to be shown to the viewers.Then he walks along further and ruthlessly kills everyone who tries to snatch away his back-pack in which he has kept the book. Everyone is saying that he is the good guy but he can kill when the book is being attacked. Why does he have to kill and that too so ruthlessly? He has been shown as a super-skilled fighter who can defeat (read kill) anybody. I mean he could just hit them down and then escape. No, but he has to chop hands, slice throats and everything. Anyway I am getting too emotional here.So he goes along protecting the book and reaches a small town where he finds another guy who is in search of this book. He believes that with the words of this book, he can control the town and rule even more. When he finds out that Denzel has the book, a war starts between his men and Denzel which continues into 3-4 different scenes and finally with the help of another girl (She was just a placeholder) form that town he manages to reach the place where the book should belong.The movie looks hypothetical from start to end and then they have to do a revelation at the end which totally blows off the little bit sense left in the movie. All scenes could have been edited to be more crisp and compact. But then it would have become a 30 minutes short film.Although the action scenes were less than expected and were totally too much hyped, they were picturized nicely with good effects. Nothing else that I could find good about the movie. And yes, Denzel lived his role pretty well too.",The Book of Eli
511,kieronmiddleton,Amazing Cinematography,8,16 July 2010,"Amazing cinematography with great acting from Denzil Washington, and a fresh approach to the post apocalyptic genre makes for an enjoyable watch. A good pace, good action scenes and what I thought to be a strong script made for a worthwhile evening of viewing.However, I find it a bit disappointing that some of IMDb's reviewers have chosen to rate this movie down due to its religious undertones. The ""Book of Eli"" was the Bible, yes that became pretty obvious early on but it didn't have to be the Bible. It may as well have been any major influential literary work. What the film was trying to express in my opinion was that in a society that had become so far from humanity, where did it's source of moral reasoning come from? A lot of our own personal moral reason comes from history, and documentation such as the Bible. In a world where books may have been burned and not many people could read, would we turn back to our natural instinct? Would you eat human flesh if you absolutely had to survive? I thought this film created many good questions for a post-apocalyptic drama. Let me put this another way, would you have ridiculed the Simpson's movie because Homers father predicted the doom of Springfield through a ""word from God?"" Please don't let your personal beliefs affect a good movie.If I were to make a criticism at all it would be that the digital colouring artist was a bit too heavy handed. The bland, desert like colouring was very atmospheric, but a little too harsh on the eye. Or was that the point? Giving us a view of post-apocalyptic earth with the glare of a non-ozone atmosphere? Good scientific theory but a bit much for 2 hours viewing.",The Book of Eli

After Eli's subsequent death, Solara takes up his mission to spread the word of God.I could only appreciate the movie till the very end, and solely because of the plot twist. Overall, I thought the glorifying of the King James Bible a little much (could have found an earlier version? That's just me.) There is a lot of bad acting and emotionless scenes to sit through before you can get to the good part. Don't get me wrong, it's not shy of Denzel swiftly kicking some ass, but that's about as much substance as I could gather. And frankly, living in a post-apocalyptic world for nearly 3 decades you might think everyone would know how to fend for themselves (I thought it was stereotypical that nearly every woman portrayed was completely helpless).

514,hkfroschauer,"One-dimensional, badly written, very disappointing",1,22 June 2010,"'The Book of Eli' is a post-apocalyptic road-movie that could have been so much - but instead disappoints almost as soon as the opening scene is finished.About 20 minutes into the movie I was speculating if this is an adaption based on a graphic novel, or (even worse) a computer-game: The characters are one-dimensional, and grossly overdrawn - there's the hero (who's an unbeatable ninja-like warrior), the damsel in distress, and the evil-without-a-reason villain that could come right out of a 70ies Italian Western (the entire setup is very Western-inspired).Those ingredients are sprinkled with alternating heavily color-graded visuals that interrupt the pace of the movie (if there is such a thing here), and superhero-like fight-scenes, again without any discernible motivation apart from the villains being 'evil'.I see just about everything that's released, and I'm not just talking major blockbusters - I usually refrain myself from writing reviews. 'The Book of Eli' though disappointed my to a degree where I feel I need to write this, just to get closure... ;-) I was hoping for a commercial action-version of 'The Road', maybe with a little 'Zombieland', but all I got was an evening with what in the end turned out to be a badly written story about a religious fanatic willing to kill just about anyone standing in the way of re-publishing the bible.",The Book of Eli

The setting seems to be either present day or in the future in the aftermath of a huge war that destroyed most of everything in the world. In a small settlement that Eli passes through, a man named Carnegie is searching for this book that Eli carries. Carnegie pursues Eli and Solara to get the book; Solara is a slave-girl of Carnegie that Eli agrees to take with him. Carnegie eventually does get the book, but Eli keeps walking west until he reaches a group of people at Alcatraz who plan on rebuilding the world. We later find out that the book was actually written in brail which suggests that Eli was, in fact, blind. Eli, as if he remembered the entire Bible, tells it all to a writer to write down and reprint. Eli then dies when the job is done and Solara goes on her own away from Alcatraz.The purpose of The Book of Eli was to entertain. The entire movie was filled with action, but at the same time it carried a sense of curiosity throughout the entire movie. We do not find out what this book actually was or that Eli was blind until the end of the movie, so for the duration of the movie we watch, wondering what this book that Eli carries is. The plot in this movie also contributes significantly to the entertainment. The Book of Eli was very successful in accomplishing its purpose in entertaining many age groups of people. When I went and seen it, young people, as well as, older people were in the theater enjoying the action as much as myself.In conclusion, The Book of Eli was an awesome movie. I give it eight out of ten stars. The movie was full of action, and it definitely accomplished its purpose. The plot of added a lot to the entertainment factor of this movie. Many age groups and types of people have shared and will continue to share a thrill and sense of curiosity by watching The Book of Eli.",The Book of Eli
516,MNentertainment,Very good movie....,10,9 October 2012,"After reading many reviews good and bad, I would have to say that I'm displeased with the many that bash the religious aspects of it. The movie is more about faith then the book itself! The book is just a tool a focus point for the plot. Many people have used religion for their own personal gain and sadly it overshadows the masses that are faithful to their religion. It just so happens that it was an American movie, they could easily make a version where Muhammad crosses the Sahara or Raj passes through Gujarat etc...(forgive my examples if they cause any disrespect) If this were a film about pushing Christianity on everyone what at the end why would they make it a point to show religious books from many of the predominate religions other then the Holy Bible.The story line is well written around the plot. Most of the dialect is very direct and doesn't diverge from the plot. The emotion of the movie is displayed very well with the cinematography. This is one of the more unique Post Apocalypse type movies to come out and it's not a remake of an oldie but goodie! Bottom line if you believe in the Holy Bible you can't go wrong, if you don't you can't go wrong, think of your own testament to faith.",The Book of Eli

Eli (Denzel Washington), could be described as Clint Eastwood in a Wild West movie, he didn't talk much, but he didn't need to because his actions spoke louder than words. Setting: ""The Book of Eli"" is set in the future, 30 years after an event which wiped out almost everything. The various camera angles clearly show how they live in a world that is almost nothing.Plot: The plot was a very simple one, Eli just needs to take a sacred object in his possession to it's final resting place.Worth Seeing?

519,pauwilo,A Story To Be Comtemplated & Savored,10,31 January 2010,"Directors Albert and Allen Hughes have created a symbolic, sensory-filled landscape with The Book of Eli. Cinematically captivating, this post-apocalyptic tale explores a variety of biblical and moral themes – the most import being God's promise to mankind to preserve his word.Eli is the main character. Viewers who are familiar with the biblical story of Eli will have an easier time picking up on the multiple and varied symbolisms which proliferate this film. Although, not revealed until the end of the film, Eli is blind. His heightened senses, along with his deep conviction in God's purpose for Eli, takes him on a 30-year journey to deliver his copy of the bible to a group of individuals who have been charged with rebuilding and maintaining the literary works essential to re-teach and stimulate civilization. Denzel Washington shines as Eli. His utilization of expression, body language, and tonality are essential to the pace and reveal of the plot. The nuances of Eli express both the obvious and the sublime.While the film content is written for general audiences, some viewers may be confused by the magnitude of symbolism in this movie. Many reviews have only stated the obvious, neglecting to acknowledge the subtle reveals in this film. Nearly every inch of this movie, including fight sequences, carry several message at a time. Don't apologize if you feel you need to watch this twice. There is a lot going on under the surface. Cinematically, pay attention to the use of light, shadows, and angles. Lots of thought went into the placement of props and characters to underscore different themes.The Book of Eli is not the type of special effects eye-candy that one might expect from an apocalyptic thriller. It is an indulgence of a different kind; a dark, rich, confection to be savored and contemplated. Don't be surprised if you want another piece.",The Book of Eli

This is just good film making. The Color dazzled my eyes. The sound sent shivers down my spine.This film does not preach, and is an eerie warning of our future. We are the stewards of the earth and need to take responsibility for the people around us. Help others more than yourself.

Eli traveled to the island where there were no bible, but they lived there much more better than those savages wanting the book. How can anybody miss that? For those wise people collecting the art and other historical artifacts, bible was just another book. The only positive thing which might be granted to religion in this case is the persistence which is given to people when they blindly follow their ideas. On the other hand, persistence is not always a good thing if we look at the ""evil"" characters of the movie. Of course the story could be about any book invented by authors of this movie, but that wouldn't be so ""controversial"" (because bible holds a lot of violence and isn't the book I'd recommended to build society on) and there probably would be much less discussion and attention to the movie.

He protects it with his life, his slick martial arts moves (they are cool to watch! The speed, the fluidity, etc). Roadside gangs and ultimately a local mob boss with headquarters in some dusty town try to kill him, rob him of his carry-on possessions, and get his treasure. Word has apparently spread about it. Eli has been on the road for 30 years when some unnamed disaster turned the world/ the country into a wasteland, yet his mp3 player still somehow works, when he recharges it miraculously at some settlements. He buys a canteen full of 'clean"" water for a horrendous price (a scarf and some of his other belongings -reminds me of Waterworld), almost giving up 1/3 of his possessions. It raises the question: How and where did he get his 'clean' water supplies in the last 30 years?? And then of course the book, the last remaining copy of that book that will safe humankind.. A third into the movie, it was pretty clear which book the movie was referring to: ""the good book"". I will leave it at that, but it begs the question: Why's there only one copy left? (if there are so many other precious things that survived the years...) In thirty years Eli could have walked into any remaining ruin of a chain motel and found a copy in the desk drawer... The real contradiction of the entire story is this: the book is supposed to bring salvation to the surviving people, yet the entire movie is about fighting, killing and violence surrounding the book. The mob boss wants the power of the book to control the new world. Even the carrier of the book, Eli, is heavily engaged in violent activities. Is this not a sad irony and reflection of historical reality? The 'good book' is supposed to bring peace, but in reality it is divisive and leads to more violence. Look around in our contemporary political landscape, all those ""precious books and faiths"" only motivate fanatics to fight with other people.

And if Gary Oldman is in a movie, it's immediately twice as good as it would have been. If you're tired of a culture that denigrates the Bible, you will be pleasantly surprised by this movie. I absolutely loved it. I watched this film with a certain level of trepidation, waiting for the same old Hollywood secular humanist spin on things to rear its ugly head but thankfully it never materialized. It was a compelling post-apocalyptic quest. There was plenty of violence but I never felt it was gratuitous. Maybe that's just my own de-sensitization. All I know is I couldn't have been more surprised or pleased that to see a major Hollywood film that centered around the Bible and never once took a cheap shot or portrayed belief as some kind of mental defect. A welcome change from the progressive crap that usually underlies big Hollywood films. It's no wonder that it's being so effectively ignored. Highly recommended.",The Book of Eli

This is a good movie and it would have a higher rating if atheists stopped bashing this because it involves religion. I think it deserves a 9 but I might as well give it a 10 because people keep giving it 1 because they say its unreal God could guide someone, perhaps their forgetting that this is a fiction movie. People with special powers fighting crime dressed like a bat is insane, but I am I going to give it a bad review just for that? This is one of Denzel's best performances in years.

You essentially have to be a mindless moronic Christian to find any kind of worthwhile meaning here. I could enjoy a movie cobbled around this premise, ""saving a holy book after the world has suffered catastrophe"". But nothing about this makes sense. We are led to believe that wars over religious beliefs were responsible for the world nearly being destroyed, therefore the only way to save the world is... religion. And God is in on it, right? He gets Eli going and protects him on his 30 year trek across America. Where the hell was god when the world was killing itself over different interpretations of ""holy"" books?",The Book of Eli
529,akthar723,worth watching,7,25 July 2010,"the style of this movie is interesting and so is the idea it is dealing with. A very foolish thing about the movie is (nearer the end) to create copies of the only existing bible and then you find the print company placing a copy next to an already existing copy of the Muslim Quran. Having read the Quran and bible and know of many similarities and the moral codes delivered, I find it silly in the concept of the movie that mankind can not live without the bible (organise their lives) when the copies of the quran continue to exists. its interesting to note that there are a lot of doomsday prophecies in Islam - fascinating, worth looking into e.g. the dajaal.",The Book of Eli
530,mehdi_taileb,Faith can lead to miracles,10,20 December 2010,"In a post-apocalyptic world, Eli (Washington) is walking in a hostile world, led by a voice which tells him to go West find a safe heaven for his book. He doesn't know what place this is, or if it exists at all, yet he doesn't need more to start a thirty year long journey through danger, thirst, hunger and disease. On his way he will cross the path of Carnegie (Oldman), who has been looking for Eli's book for along time with the intention to gain a power lost and forgotten since the War... In my opinion the Hughes brothers have signed here a master-piece: one is quickly immersed in the movie, which is visually very strong (the photography is outstanding) with amazing pictures of desertic/post-war landscape in which the main character walks, underlining the enduring pain of his journey... Sound is also very present, for the best. Although this is not truly an action movie (I'd say it's more drama, then adventure, then action), the brothers showed their sharp skills in technically demanding scenes like the one at the old couple's house, when they are under fire from Carnegie's band. Absolutely mind-blowing. As for the theme of the movie, I feel it is very much about faith and the miraculous powers it gives one, with sub-themes like the double-edged power of religions, the need of some for power and control, the self-destructive nature of humanity, its resilience, the luring power of material comfort... I've watched this movie six or seven times so far, and I'm not done yet ;-)",The Book of Eli
531,tapcur,"Beautiful music, stunning action scenes and Mila Kunis. The trifecta.",10,28 January 2011,"Let's face it; this show isn't for everyone. Eli doesn't bother to preach. All the preaching, what there is of it, is by the bad guy. It doesn't bother to explain much, either. You have to pay close attention to get what's really going on. I admit it; I had to be told. I blame modern cinema for spoon feeding us so much that most of us are half brain dead. The Book of Eli spoon feeds you nothing but a simple message, Mila Kunis, and some stunning action. When I re-watched this movie, finally having been told the truth about Eli, I was WAY more impressed than from the first viewing. It has an excellent sub-story and you can watch it repeatedly without tiring of the action. If you pay close attention to the fight scenes you'll see how exquisitely choreographed they were. Phenomenal fight choreography without quick editing, shaky cam work, wires, or sped-up action. It all happens in real time and you get a 3rd person view of it, just like you were standing there. I've never seen anything like it. As for the story...well I am old enough to remember Kung Fu with David Carradine. Substitute Christianity for the buddhist philosophies and you've got the same idea here. D-Wash carries the whole thing with more grace and presence than did grasshopper but he has the exact same sense of mystery and reluctance to start trouble. But once trouble is unavoidable, well, he busts some moves. This movie was justice done to the legend of Zatoichi.",The Book of Eli
532,jhenders029,Review,10,28 November 2011,"The reason many do not understand the movie, The Book of Eli, is due to the fact that one needs to be abreast of the Bible in great detail and what the prophets were called to do. Eli was a prophet. The Bible was initially verbally translated and then codified in written form. Our ancestors had this remarkable skill set that we have lost due to being ""dumbed down"" by gadgets and things that dissuade critical thinking. One has to also understand the importance of why he had to protect the book at the expense of his life. His last lines says it all at the end of the movie. After Eli died his successor, the young lady went out to fulfill what he had already fulfilled. A careful canvassing of the prophets and apocalyptic books such as Daniel and Revelation will give more insight into the underlying themes in this movie. Also, the Bible lived within him and was more than just a physical book.",The Book of Eli
533,ndkilano,Misinterpreted by Atheist Opinion,8,9 December 2011,"I read the many reviews by the individuals who flame this movie for its use of religion. I am left disappointed in my fellow film critics to not take this film for what it truly is. You people hate this movie for its use of religion in the context of propaganda. Some of you didn't even watch it, it appears, only commenting to further your own views of anti-God. This leaves me rather irate. Why? Because you people are giving a film a terrible rating for your own personal closure, but also to make yourselves seem to be the cream of the crop when it comes to disliking the movie. You only go against the use of religion and faith. You don't even touch on the inconsistencies or the bad lighting in some scenes, or even the bad plot device of wandering over a landscape for thirty years.You don't take into account the acting of Washington, or even Oldman (who in my opinion had an Oscar worthy performance in this film). You don't take into account the amazing visuals, the beautiful landscapes, the extreme sets and great use of camera, and terrain.Yes, it is a about man who carries with him the last known copy of The Holy Bible. Yes, he claims that he is being told to go West. However, I honestly do not believe any of the reviewing Atheists took the time to watch this. The moment the word ""Bible"" or ""God"" is uttered, everyone immediately says, ""Christian Propaganda!"" Jesus' name was never mentioned in the film. There was nothing in the film to say that it could not be accepted by the other two major religions: Islam and Judaism. The Quran and the Torah both have the same message as the Bible (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you). Is that not what WE as a society strive to do regardless of religion? But instead of understanding that this movie is about a moral conflict between the forces of good, and the forces of evil, it is deciphered to be strictly religious based and hated by those who feel that it is not what they wish to understand.Good news though, the title of the movie SUMS UP THE WHOLE MOVIE. The Book Of Eli. Eli was a Biblical character in the Old Testament. In the Book of Samuel, Eli was the high priest of Shiloh, the last Israelite judge before the rule of the kings for 40 years, and he was blind. So honestly, Atheists, if you didn't want to watch a movie with religious undertones, you could have deciphered the title to be what it is with minimal knowledge. However, because the majority of all Atheists do not choose to study that which they do not understand, they will soon find that they will hate this movie because of their biased opinions.The fact that the book is the Holy Bible is irrelevant. It could have been the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and the same outcome would have ensued. Its not what he was traveling with, it was how important HE believed it to be. Hell, if he were even wandering across the country with a copy of Twilight, so long as it had meaning to someone else, the outcome would have STILL been the same.(However, if he were wandering with Twilight, this movie wouldn't have been so controversial because not very many would have gone to see it. Honestly, 'The Book of Eli,' sounds a lot better than, 'The Book of Bella.')Regardless of the WHAT, one must look at the WHY. And to write this movie off because of your own personal belief is ignorant, especially when it is agreed upon by many that the Proof of God's existence can neither be confirmed nor denied. Either way, don't watch this movie if you don't have an open mind, because if you do so, you will just show your ignorance by posting your nonfactual review on sites like IMDb.",The Book of Eli

Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman are a perfect fit for this genre and somehow give it the feeling of true apocalypse. Mila Kunis on the other hand, after seeing her in 'That 70's show', and hearing her voice in 'family guy' as Meg Griffin i couldn't really take her serious. The Cinematography in this movie was some of the best that i have EVER seen. It made the world after the war that Eli was in feel dark, desolated, and genuinely disturbing. And the ending! It's One of the most shocking and interesting endings of a movie i've ever seen. It will leave you wondering for days. The only flaw with this movie, was some minor goofs here and there, but they aren't big enough to notice. Don't look past this movie, it's a stellar and amazing movie that truly leaves in shock.9/10",The Book of Eli

Denzel and Mila are very good in this movie; G.Oldman and J.Beals are excellent. This is a feature of some of Clint's films, where the secondary actors' performances and roles are better than the main characters.This movie drew me in to the ""new"" old west territory, (circa 2043) after some massive devastation has occurred.The plot unfolds in a largely linear fashion - where most of the time, faith supersedes petty ambitions.

537,bradeycornwell,"Great Movie, Small Mishaps.",8,10 February 2012,"This film took a very over-played concept and completely set it on its head. Everyone knows little variations on the post-apocalyptic world and why/how people choose to survive in it. The Book of Eli gives a totally new twist to an old premise with Eli's sole purpose in this new world being to deliver the last Bible to the west. Thus switching the normal story line from the purpose of surviving, to surviving for a purpose. Admittedly Mila Kunis being cast as Solara was a poor decision. Any actor who plays a voice in Family can't be expected to be taken seriously. I am also not sure who decided she should walk into the sunset as the ""new Eli"", but he/she should have been fired. The way in which Eli keeps his bow is hard to follow, but forgivable when compared to the rest of the movie. If you are going to complain about trivial plot points like how Eli's blade goes from the dash and ""fully"" into Redridge's chest in a crash, then you really should be questioning why anyone has survived nuclear fallout for the last 30 years and not bother to see this movie or write a review. Some have also complained that this is ""church"" propaganda but that is an extremely bigoted statement. If it were purely church propaganda then the Quran and other holy texts wouldn't have been seen in the Alcatraz library that they were building to reeducate the populous. This movie has small cracks in the overall structure but they can be easily overlooked if one focuses on the cinematography and the talent of the actors. (minus Mila Kunis of course.)",The Book of Eli
538,jerome-salgado,Powerful Movie!,9,26 March 2012,"The Book of Eli was overall an incredible film that had some deep messages regarding humanity.Eli, the protagonist, is a man driven by his faith. He explains that he heard a voice that led him to a book and entrusted him with the task of protecting it by all means until it was where it was supposed to be somewhere out west. As a result, the message he received told him that he would be protected along the way.Interestingly enough, the book in question is a bible. Bibles had been burned because after the apocalyptic war that left the world in ruins, those who survived began burning all bibles they could find. The belief was that it was religion that caused the war. Therefore, the bible that Eli is carrying is the last one known to exist.Through his journey, Eli comes across a village that is a lot like a modern 'wild west' setting. The town is corrupt, and its leader, and older educated man, wants the bible so he can claim power over everyone. His belief is that the bible contains words and messages that will make people succumb to his will, and as a result, he would be the supreme dictator. Therefore, he exhausts all of his resources and men trying to get the bible from Eli, and when he finally gets it, he can't read it because it's written in braille. Along with that, he has lost control over his town and is sick from an open wound that he didn't take care of while trying to get the bible.This leads us to the end of the movie. Eli and his companion whom he met along the way, Solara, make it out west and row a small boat out to Alcatraz Island where there is a sort of sanctuary. On the island, there are civilized people striving to save the historical documents that defined our history, and Eli's contribution is the copy of the bible which they do not have in their collection. Unfortunately, Eli doesn't have the bible in his possession anymore since it was taken by Carnegie, the power hungry dictator, but Eli did read the bible every day for the past 30 years. Therefore, he memorized it. The film ends with Eli reciting the bible while having it scribed by one of the men on the island, and finally a copy of the bible is printed on the printing press they have on the island. In the end, Eli completed his journey, Solara sets out to carry on his legacy and spread the faith.",The Book of Eli
539,jerry1-356-966248,I Give It A 10!!,10,13 November 2013,"Modern movies have way too much CGI, cookie cutter action scenes, imagery, etc. Add in the loud metal music and strobe-light effects and we might as well be at the club. This need for more has become such a focal point that many creators in this genre are forgetting the principle duty of film-making—to tell a story.This is what sets The Book of Eli apart. Although its post apocalyptic premise could have easily warranted much of the same nonsense that we have sadly become used to, this movie instead chooses to avoid all the fluff and focus on the more philosophical elements of the story. Rather than hypnotize use with eye-dizzying imagery and in-your-face action, this film takes a step back and tells its tale from a simple, outward- looking, and objective point of view.The story takes place in the United States 30 years after a presumably word-wide apocalyptic war. Just like every other post-doomsday tale from Mad Max to Thundaar, the few remaining survivors of this planet are left to survive with a limited supply of life's bare necessities—food, water, fuel, etc. Where The Book of Eli differs is that in this world, a certain book was blamed for starting the war, to which every copy was destroyed shortly thereafter.This is where the film's hero, Eli (Denzel Washington), comes in. We learn that he has the last remaining copy of this influential ""book"". His ongoing mission is to head west until he finds a location where the book will ultimately be protected. Along this journey, a sinister town developer, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), learns of Eli's prize possession and decides to capture it for his own purposes. He has long been searching for this book himself, and will not stop at nothing to have it. Through his struggles with Carnegie, Eli eventually learns of the true meaning of the book and how he must put faith in others.The camera-work is steady and controlled. The action, although still electrifying, is filmed realistically and only appears within the proper context of the film. The background noise is not overbearing and the characterizations are woven beautifully within this post-doomsday tale. The pace still keeps you focused and interested, for The Hughes Brothers interjects many brief scenes to quickly advance the storyline. Although this film does share some obvious similarities with other wasteland movies, its style and plot elements actually coincide with those seen in classic westerns like High Noon and Hang-em High.The Book of Eli is a refreshing change-up from the way-too-clichéd movies of the day. Its action does not distract you from the plot, and that is why it is a great film. In the end, it ultimately manages to accomplish a feat that is rarely seen in action movies nowadays—the beauty of simplicity.10 out of 10!",The Book of Eli

I've wanted to see it since I saw the very clever and surreptitious little trailer and thought that it looked like a cool, kickass dystopian sci-fi thriller thing. It wasn't. It was instead the tale of an insanely accurate blind holy-roller man doing a long haul across a barren America, being a contradictory self-righteous little muppet along the way. But then I guess that might be typical. It might just be that I'm a borderline atheist and when it was confirmed that this precious, life-giving, life-saving, world-altering book was a bible, I wanted to throw a shoe at my TV. And I would've if I hadn't just bought it. Ultimately a very disappointing and frustrating film; I am not a fan of being preached at by some dude in a suit, let alone by a Hollywood ""futuristic action"" movie in disguise; the only reason I sat through all of it was to become even more irritated.

The film is populated with strangely beautiful barren landscapes, expertly presented fight sequences, and well rounded characters both good and evil. However, the plot forgets where it's going halfway through, and never addresses its initial conflict.At first, the plot seems to be presenting a compelling paradox to the audience revolving around the protagonist's book: a narcissistic power-monger plans to use it to control others, whereas our protagonist is intent on preserving it for humanity.The second act dives into a conflict for ownership of the book. During the fighting over the book, it's as though the plot is put on hold. By the third act, it's as though they completely forgot about the conflict presented at the start of the movie, ""Can the book really be used as a force for goodness and beauty without becoming a weapon for the wicked?"" The third and final act doesn't resolve this, instead skipping directly to the resolution.The performances by Washington, Kunis, Oldman and Stevenson are all top notch. The action sequences are exciting and well designed, and the movie contains its fair share of well written dialogue. It's also true that this movie contains a fair amount of religious overtones, but it isn't unwarranted based on the fact that a major character is themself religious.Definitely worth watching, but do not go in expecting a great plot, or you will be somewhat disappointed.",The Book of Eli

To be fair, a lot of people may like the movie because of it's subject matter (I may share this bias).The movie itself is atmospheric--the majority of it filmed portrayed in a kind of dark, sepia-like tone. The acting is excellent for the most part--Denzel Washington delivering solidly (what else is new), and Gary Oldman providing an excellent villain (on this matter, I was pleasantly surprised--usually, Oldman's villains are way over the top with their odd mannerisms and eccentricities to the point that they're almost cartoonish; this character was far more subtly played). The action sequences were engaging--particularly the melee combat scenes. Best of all, this movie has a twist ending a la The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense, that almost makes you want to watch the movie again to watch for hints of it.If you have strong opinions against Christians or Christianity, you probably won't like this movie...although it certainly acknowledged the other side.

First it is about BELIEF, FAITH, HOPE, and unrelenting SPIRIT all of us humans possess.If the BOOK was not THE GOOD BOOK, it may have been any other religious scripture, such as Kuran or The Egyptian Book of the Dead, Mormon Texts, Divrei Torah, Bhagavad Gita or ANY OTHER.The message is ONE, if your faith, belief and hope is strong enough, you will conquer ANYTHING, be it sickness, be it poverty, be it ANYTHING you set upon on doing.Now the movie portrays just that with a backdrop of fallout ( or Van Buren canceled Fallout 3 project art-story board-sketches), with a mixture of R.B. Fahrenheit 451, Montag and The Book people. Also The Enclave mention in Fallout 1,2,3 appears in the West as the new beginning.I've read what people object about, but as a devoted Christian, I took great pride in watching, and enjoyed this movie VERY much. Denzel played it well, and Gary played his usual bad guy smirk thing, the supporting actresses, are rather pale, but considering the story and The Book in question, I cannot see them doing much else to help, as to say they played their part.Wasteland is a tough place, not for the faint hearted, meek nor skinny females, but then again, I did not even look at them, as the mere gold leaf of The Bible gloved in my eyes for the few frames up until the end, where ITS beauty and purpose was shown in the only possible outcome.Also the scene of Gary's fall on his porch ( Scarface anyone), is memorable as that is how it ends for such.The White robe is a symbol of transition and purity of Man, Task and Devotion, where he in the end makes his TRUE peace upon completing it.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to all the people, as they forgot in these materialistic days what TRUE BELIEF can DO, and this movie is along with District 9 at true wakeup call to look upon and help your neighbor, brother and fellow human regardless of religion, color, race or anything else.Thank you for investing the time to read this, and I wish you all the best in watching this movie.",The Book of Eli

Eli: It means you know something even if you don't know something Solara: That doesn't make any sense Eli: It doesn't have to make sense, its fate, its fate, draw from the strength within... It is just ridiculous, and it really does not make any sense. Or think about the fact, that Eli quotes his holy book before killing. And all the other various hints. In the end, the bible is placed between the thora and the quran - its equals, or as some including me would say, between its source and its offspring. This film is a warning. It warns us, that as long as there are scriptures, there will be men driven crazy by them, because its faith, and it doesn't have to make sense - or to say it with the words of the Hospitaller:""I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of god. I have seen too much religion in the eyes of too many murderers. Holiness is in right action, and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness.""

And I should say if someone is expecting a sensible post apocalyptic movie,better not watch this. This takes all the senses far away as what a religion is doing. I'm giving 4 star for the sake of the crew that worked.",The Book of Eli
554,ministack123,One of the best of 2010,10,19 June 2010,"First of all, I have to say something regarding the many 1 and 2 star reviews, it seems no film nowadays can even hint at anything to do with a bible or religion without being accused of being 'religious propaganda' or the like. I saw this film as having a message about how belief in a cause, whether it be religion, or just being a decent person and helping people, can allow you to achieve things you may not have thought yourself capable of.This next section has a few spoilers so don't read on if you haven't seen the film yet.Now obviously Eli does kill people in this film, and has a number of graphic fight scenes, which because Eli is indeed blind, seems a bit far-fetched, but as i see it, it all comes back to the overall message of the film. Eli was able to achieve these unbelievable events because he believed he was part of a greater cause, which wan't to bring religion to the masses, there was only one book made at the end, it was to bring belief to the masses, just look at Solara, she goes out on her own at the end, but to all those who saw the film as nothing more than a religious movie, where was her bible? the answer is she didn't have one, but she did carry with her the belief that anything is achievable if you believe in your cause, which i would assume is the message she is going to take to the rest of the wastes.Now if we take all the narrative aspects out of this film and look at it purely for the mise-en- scene elements and cinematic devices, the film comes out nothing short of amazing. I was left amazed looking at the screen at some of the cinematography in this film, the camera work is simply amazing. The setting itself is exactly right for this film, the towns and surrounding areas give the film the right feel, and add greatly to the appreciation you get from the story in this film.Although the film has a few question marks, it was only one that stood out, the lack of the bow on his back, but his ability to have it with him at all times seemed weird, but the question marks that some of the other reviewers seem to have found stem from their lack of understanding of the film, rather than the film itself. Firstly, yes he shoots a cat at the start of the film, but this clearly does not to make the film pointless and seem like a lot of strange events, as if anyone looks at the surroundings and Eli's situation of being a loner in a vast desert like wasteland, then they would understand he has to eat, and can't really afford to be picky. Now obviously if he was in the middle of a town and killed a cat to eat then it would be weird, because there are places in the town to get something to eat, but he's not, he's in the middle of a wasteland. Secondly, now i don't know how this reviewer thought this up, but he does not have a pet mouse or rat or a pet at all, in fact this scene just features a rat running along side Eli when he is cooking his food in a rundown shack he has found. Eli gives the rat a piece of the meat, and that is that for the rat's starring role, hardly a device to demonstrate a bad point about the film. Lastly, i don't really see why people are complaining he has an ipod, it's shown when he gets in town that it's possible to charge it up, as he goes to a store and does this, so him having an ipod and listening to a song before he sleeps is far from unbelievable.Finally, don't let the reviewers put you off, this film is not religious propaganda, it's not even about religion, its just about belief in general, and what is possible when you believe what you are doing is right. The film at no point pushes religion on the viewer and merely uses it to demonstrate Eli as a person who brings hope to the people of the wasteland. As far as i can see, the bible and religion itself is only used because we all know what they are and what they mean to people. Now the film generally as a film, in my opinion is a masterpiece, as soon as i saw it, it moved into my top 10 films, the Hughes brothers give this film the perfect feel for the narrative, and have a very impressive command over the micro elements in this film, at no point in the film does it feel like the main narrative is strayed from to add to anything else, so your attention is never lost.Please don't watch this film thinking it's about religion, it's just not. If you watch this film with an open mind then i'm sure you'll share my same view on the film.",The Book of Eli

558,gtmenace24,Denzel has finally led me astray...,3,4 September 2010,"Let me make this perfectly clear. I don't follow current movies or TV so I had no preconceived notions going into viewing this other than what I learned from a very misleading synopsis of the film. That said, I definitely feel duped.The only reason I found out that this movie even existed is because I randomly decided to try out Redbox. While browsing the titles I came across this Denzel Washington flick. Although I am a fan of his movies, I didn't even know that he had made ""Eli"". I thought to myself, hmmmm, I've never seen a Denzel film I didn't like, so I scanned the brief synopsis.Post-apocalyptic America, Highway of Death, on a mission, wellspring of a revived society, keeps his blade sharp and his survival instincts sharper, and a savage wasteland. So far so good. This sounds like this could be really entertaining! Then I read, ""explosive conflict with a resourceful warlord (Gary Oldman)"". Sold! It has Oldman doing what he does best, playing the psychotic villain (think Zorg in 5th Element). So without much further thought I checked it out.Oh, Denzel and Oldman, how you've disappointed me.It goes like this. 1st 1/4 of the movie. Eli, the misunderstood wanderer comes across a few ne'er-do-wells, and proceeds to kick butt. Its pretty predictable & formulaic, but the fight scenes are fairly well shot and entertaining. That's where the film earns the generous 3/10 I've given it and that's also where it stops being enjoyable.The last 3/4 of the movie is nothing but Christian propaganda which is unleashed when we find out that the ""revival of society"" the synopsis points to is actually the last remaining Holy Bible, which Denzel faithfully protects on his mission from god to take the holy book west. From there on out the rest of the movie drudges on with any other potentially good action scenes made unbearable and buried beneath the incessant, blatant, and tedious Christian preaching.For those of you who deny that this movie was a Christian preach fest, get real. The book Eli protects is not just any nebulous unspecified religious text, but the very specific ""Holy Bible, King James Version."" Denzel is constantly quoting the Bible throughout the entire movie. It doesn't get any more in your face than that.That being said, don't get me wrong. This movie has its audience and it is a fine movie on those merits alone. What makes this movie bad is that it pretends to be something its not. If the synopsis had been upfront and honest about the movie, I would have avoided it and not given it a 2nd thought which consequently would have prevented this negative review all together. In fact, if they had been honest, I wouldn't have a leg to stand on because it would've been obvious that they had no intention of entertaining a non-religious person. On the contrary, its clear that the filmmakers wanted to lure people in on the pretext of the movie being an exciting post-apocalyptic action film only to give 'em the ol' religious switcheroo. What's even more infuriating is that they apparently thought that this tactic wouldn't upset the viewers who have no ties to religion or the desire to have it shoved down their throats for 2 hours. I have to deal with being bombarded with religion in my real life! Why the heck would I want to see a movie in which that's its sole agenda?The filmmakers would have done both the audience and themselves a much greater service by being ingenuous about the whole religious nature of the film. Instead, they threw some big name and well respected actors into a flick with an exciting yet obfuscating and misleading tag line and ultimately end up insulting the intelligence of those who just wanted to see a good bit of action escapism.If only these guys had realized that, with a movie like this, the best you can really do is to present it honestly and preach to the choir. Just think of ""The Passion of the Christ."" You knew exactly who the movie was for and they showed up in droves.",The Book of Eli
559,peachs-stephanie,"Strong visuals, weak plot.",7,11 June 2010,"The Book of Eli has the potential to be a great film or complete rubbish depending on your expectations of what is to come. If you are looking for a film with some deeper meaning then I would not recommend it. However, if you are looking for a film with beautiful cinematography, solid acting and a little bit of fun action then you will be pleased.The key in watching the film is to not buy into the plot too much, which is where the viewer is going to be disappointed. The ending is a little far fetched and I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Although I honestly don't see a particularly good ending for the basic premise of the film.If you are able to put the silliness with the story behind you, the film is wonderfully done. There is great camera work with interesting angles and framing; the set showcases the contrast between the stark light of the sun and the shadows where humankind is hiding; and the acting makes you want to buy into the characters and their conflicts.I would recommend seeing the film, just don't get too involved with the story. Instead concentrate on the acting and the scene.",The Book of Eli
560,GoldMedal,An Entertaining But Ultimately Average Film.,7,26 January 2010,"Post apocalyptic tale starring 'my man' Denzel Washington in his unwavering quest to head 'West' with a special book which he aims to defend with his life. Along the way he encounters various bandits and villains who aim to rid him of his prize possession.Firstly,these numerous encounters lead to some rather magnificent fight scenes, they're choreographed superbly, not overly stylised and lack an abundance of quick camera cuts which ruin most modern fight scenes. It's a refreshing change and they manage to make Denzel over-coming 6 weapon wielding attackers look entertaining as well as convincing, not an easy task.However, the story itself is rather tedious, plodding at times, with a rather irritating need for a slow-mo shot whenever our protagonist enters a new location, however, the big mystery surrounding what the book is, and why it's of such importance keeps you entertained as well as the superb look of the film. Visually it's wonderful, even simple scenes where Denzel is wandering through the wasteland are shot well and the town he finds along the way is brilliantly convincing as the seedy centre of the local wasteland.As for the side characters, they're a greedy, crazy and generally malevolent bunch. Think of Mad Max, but not as psychotic. Most of the villains encountered are under the control of Gary Oldman, the self- professed town Sheriff who just also happens to be looking for a special book... He is great as always and injects a much needed shot of entertainment to the rest of the film. However, with Oldman, comes his 'step-daughter' in the form of Mila Kunis, who is simply rubbish in every way. Dull, uninteresting with a penchant to over-acting, any screen time she has is utterly wasted. Still, she's just about necessary to the plot so it's not a huge hang up I have with the film.Overall, I can't reveal too much plot wise without spoiling, the story takes some unexpected turns towards the end and has a rather brilliant cameo with Michael Gambon that's not worth missing. The Book of Eli isn't really as smart as it thinks it is, and has a tenancy to feel overstretched at times, but the lead performance of Denzel is excellent, and it really had to be, any film with such an emphasis on the main character is risky, if the audience reject the main character you risk losing them for the whole film (I am Legend for example), so it's good to see they've pulled off this risky move. Add to this, some bizarre characters, a convincing atmosphere, some really impressive fight scenes, and a rather interesting ending and you've got a solid film, i'd recommend forking out the £7 to go see it.",The Book of Eli
561,Rko5955,Nothing Special,5,11 November 2010,"First off, I don't mind the religious aspect of this film. It certainly gets preachy, but that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would...That being said, this still wasn't a good film. Not for religious reasons, but rather just for pure quality. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible, it just fell in the middle. The one criticism that immediately popped into my head was that they were just trying too damn hard. The cinematography, editing, and camera-work, while beautiful at times, comes off as obnoxious and unnecessarily flashy. This movie takes Zack Snyder Syndrome to a whole new level, and fails miserably at doing so. Even the backgrounds and environment look phony. I had to lean over to my girlfriend and ask her if I wasn't just seeing things. They might have been going for a surreal look and feel, but it kind of took me out of the experience, and I spent a lot of my time watching trying to figure out what was real and what wasn't.If anything is redeeming of this film, it's the performances...just barely though. Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman, two personal favorites of mine, are commendable here and do what they can with a decent script. Mila Kunis is perfectly acceptable, bordering on the edge of amazing due to the fact that...well...she's Mila Kunis. Her outfit during the eating scene with Denzel is the only reason I'd recommend this movie, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.I received this via Netflix, and I don't even remember putting it on my queue. I didn't have high expectations at all, and it STILL managed to completely underwhelm me. There's some fun action sprinkled throughout, one scene near the beginning sticks out in particular, but everything good about this film is overshadowed by everything I mentioned within the first paragraph. Like I said; it just feels like they were trying too hard.Final Score: 5/10",The Book of Eli
562,jorler1,I really don't understand some peoples review of this movie,8,25 January 2010,"The Book of Eli was one of the most enjoyable film's I've seen in a theatre in years. It wasn't the action, it wasn't the dialogue, it was the scenery and/or the thought of the chaos that would ensue if there was a major nuclear war.Obviously some reviewers didn't watch the movie, as in they completely didn't see the scene in the woods DURING THE FALLOUT OF THE BOMBS, which was absolutely stunning IMO. The flakey ash like stuff that was falling in the woods was Nuclear Fallout. So right there you all would have seen that in fact there was a worldwide nuclear war (God didn't rip a hole in the sky). It wasn't necessarily a religious war (although it may have been) but the war decimated the earth and very few survived.I wont go into many more details, but obviously the book he was carrying was the King James Holy Bible. Eli was on a mission to travel west with the book, where to he didn't know. Obviously as you will see Eli was touched by the Holy spirit to complete this task.I'm not a overly religious man, but I am baptized a Catholic and the movie really really made me think about a lot of stuff....which a good movie should.I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone. Great cinematography, the fallout scene sent shivers down my spine. 2 of the best Actors in Hollywood and some nice hack'n slash action.

All I can say is that I loved it, had a great time and hope you have too.Before when I watched the preview if was concerned it would be about a magical book, something too sci-fi that I would not ""buy it"", but no, it is a solid movie, credible (for a movie of that type) and worth watching.I guess a difference in between this movie and the movies those bad reviewers like is the difference in between the book the holds and the other books on the movie.",The Book of Eli
564,mccabbage,Brutal,1,30 January 2010,"The movie started out pretty good. I was convinced that I was in a post-apocalyptic world. It was gray, depressing, and very believable. Then Mila showed up, and it was all down hill. The acting was terrible. The plot was terrible. I was just waiting for the movie to hurry up and end so I could go home. Ironically, it got to a point that the only good thing about the movie, was Mila and her beautiful face with her tight little dress that she wore trying to entice Denzel to join Gary's gang. This movie was a waist of money. Fortunately I saw it on a Tuesday. Wait for the DVD if you feel you must see this. If anyone wants to try to compare this to The Road they had better have a good argument. In my mind there is no comparison.",The Book of Eli
565,dragotto14,My opinion so if you get offended then my work is done.,5,17 January 2010,"To sum up my feelings about this film in the simplest of forms I wish to say this, ""I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!"" Now with that said let's get on with the details. The movie takes place in a future U.S. were the world has been destroyed by war (possibly nuclear. All people living in this world fit into 2 simple categories. Non-cannibals and cannibals. The later are usually ruthless thugs who do as they please to travelers. Well the whole story surrounds the protagonist never reveals his real name. The only speculations we can go by is from a tag located in his backpack which says Eli. He eventually stumbles upon a town which is run by a man by the name of Carnegie who is obsessed with finding a specific book. Well fortunately for him Eli has the very book he is looking for. This book is said to have the a way to fix all the problems with of the world. He first tries to persuade Eli to give him the book but then realizes that Eli will never give up the book so he resorts to violence. Now this is the point in the movie where you think things are starting to get good but 20 min. later you'll feel let down. All the action you have been led on to believe that's in this movie is only a ploy to get people to watch the movie. I say if you're going to pay to watch it then don't go expecting to see Eli killing an entire army of bad guys. Lastly I want to say the ending was horrible. It came too sudden and left you feeling disappointed. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was Gary Oldman's performance as Carnegie. He did a fantastic job. As for the rest of the movie I say don't waste a cent on seeing it, wait till it comes out on DVD and Bluray. But then again that's just my opinion. Good luck!",The Book of Eli
566,bubblyjen_2406,"Promising start, disappointing middle and awful ending.",1,21 January 2010,"Well, I went to see this film last night not knowing much about the actual plot of it. The start was promising, with some great fight scenes and on the whole, it was well filmed with some great cinematography. Washington played his role well, as did Oldman as Carnegie, however Mila Kunis who anyone who watches 'Family Guy' could tell was the voice of Meg Griffin wasn't good at all. The fact she is the voice of Meg also made me unable to take her seriously, but thats probably just me. I enjoyed the film at the start up until it becomes apparent that 'the book' is in fact the Bible. The fact that the whole film was based around this alienated a lot of people who may be atheist or even if they were Christian, as it was completely hypocritical that Eli killed maybe 100s of people in order to keep the book. Is this in-keeping with Christianity? Well, now the ending. It just about had it for me when we found out that Eli was blind. This put the great fighting scenes that i mentioned earlier in a poorer light for me, as we realised he was supposed to be fighting several people single handedly whilst blind?? Completely ridiculous. as was the fact that he was shot in the stomach, and then 5 minutes later back on the road with some duck tape over the wound. On the whole, its maybe worth seeing if you don't mind contradictory and frankly ridiculous plot twists, hearing Meg Griffin's voice throughout a supposedly tense and serious film and of course, if you don't mind killing 100s of people for the possession of a Bible written in braille.",The Book of Eli

It had me interested in the movie till Eli makes it to the town and the plot is spelled out very plainly -- one good man wants to keep the bible for himself until he finds the right place to share the books teachings to good people, for good reasons. and the ""Bad Guy"" wants to use the books teachings for personal gain and control.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the BOOK OF ELI as my expectations for this film were very low. The remainder of my comments I'll classify as satisfying and dissatisfying.The dissatisfying: 1) Again an African-American lead that is stripped of his sexuality. I would guess that the same film with a Caucasian lead would have him in at least one sex seen with the female lead. 2) African-American character in sci-fi film dies.The satisfying: 1)Eli achieves his goal in the end in an interesting and surprising way.Also, just to touch on the religious aspects/comments. At first, I too thought this was religious propaganda but in the end remember one should remember that Oldman's character world is destroyed because of his over-attachment to the bible and his ""religious"" pursuit of it. In the end, it is a worthwhile watch and definitely more fulfilling than the grand disappointment of I AM LEGEND.",The Book of Eli
569,sxebass,i did not like this,1,15 January 2010,"*spoilers*the book of Eli is centered around Eli (denzel) as he travels from east to west in a post apocalyptic wasteland to save a book that ""has powers"" and can ""heal nations"" he has impeccable combat skills and after getting shot in the stomach point blank range he can still walk and live like a normal human being. but when a man stumbles upon Eli and finds out the book he has he will do anything to retrieve the book from Eli so they track him down and get the book to find out its written in braille and Eli has memorized it to recite it to a press in Alcatraz so they can print it and have an paper copy. sounds kind of like a stupid story then you find out that the book is the bible and that didn't really sit well with me. Christian or not i just felt uncomfortable with all the Christian subtext in this movie, and trust me its filled with themi didn't cope with the story that much in the first place i called the plot twist (braille) from a mile away there was NO character development at all the ONLY things we know about Eli at all in this film is that he was blind and his name was Eli and, obviously he loves the bible. but the fact that this whole movie was centered around the bible and a hokey storyline with characters i didn't really like too much, it just made the movie for me i was getting bored near the end but the bible thing just did it for me i was hoping all throughout the movie that it Wasn't the bible but it was and this movie should be passed",The Book of Eli

But then i read all the reviews on IMDb, and i though, maybe this movie if worth watching. Turns out most of the people writing these reviews are ignorant and don't know anything about movies. Believe me when i say that nearly every scene in this movie is a Hollywood cliché. Everything is predictable, except the ending maybe. The camera movements, lighting, scenery and special effects are OK, but the plot is very, very cheesy. I think that Denzel is Just making these last movies for a couple of bucks before he retires or something, i couldn't believe that last one he stared in: The Taking of Pelham 123. These Americans seize to amaze me with their stupidity. By the way that guy who wrote : ""A movie that you need to watch twice"" is probably mentally retarded.

571,biancatlover,An Objective Opinion,8,18 January 2010,"What struck me about this movie was the message it carried. Though religious, it was not overly Christian. It depicts everything that is wrong with religion in the world today (practiced en masse, used for power and control, mindless and fear-inspiring) in contrast to the good that can come from it (basic moral guidelines, community structure, and something to believe in when you have nothing else), and I appreciated this a whole lot.That aside, I thought it was thrilling, well acted, and engaging. The twist near the end made me want to watch it again. Immediately.I took off two points for the following: (1) Poor editing in regards to the beginning and end of the movie (just coulda been a bit better, y'know?), and (2) at the end the all-important book is shelved. What good will it do there?",The Book of Eli
572,wesleysolmon,Great Acting...but thats it,7,23 January 2010,"The Book of Eli was an interesting idea of a movie, one man setting off to the west trying to find the best place for this one of a kind book he walks around with. Now, that is pretty much the whole plot of the movie. 2 hours of watching this man walk west, obviously encountering a few obstacles on the way. This eventually leads to him being chased by someone that really wants the book. Now, not to be hasty...but there is no real intriguing plot to the movie. I do believe that Gary Oldman did a great job in this film and as did Denzel, though at some parts the acting seemed less believable. This movie does have some interesting action scenes where Denzel goes on a killing frenzy, which was quite entertaining. If you want to see this movie, realize you are not going to be drawn in by the plot. It is a very slow-paced start that gradually builds up, and then, in my opinion, drops at the very end. I don't mean the end in general, I mean the last 10-20 seconds of the film. It really was quite a dumb ending that just should have been taken out.Final Rating: 6.5/10",The Book of Eli
573,emiryardimci,A nice idea gone very wrong.,4,4 July 2010,"Probably one of the worst movies I've seen recently, if not the worst. The cast is good, the idea of a lonely man protecting something that is very important to him in a wasteland is nice also. As an agnostic, I can even ignore the religious propaganda/themes if the movie is watchable and well written. But the truth is, despite all the cool camera shots, great visuals and some not so bad action sequences, the movie is absolutely a let down! I remember watching The Passion of Christ, and again, as an agnostic, I loved the film. Purely because it was a great movie. I personally don't have a problem with movies with religious themes and even the ones that promote and propagate religion, since it doesn't affect me in any way at all. But I do have a serious problem with movies that are poorly written and thought.And the influence of Mad Max doesn't help either. As a MM fan, it even distracts you from the movie for the reasons I have stated above and in time it starts to make you go like 'Ohh, I wish I was watching a real MM4 or something rather than this rip-off'.All in all, some great visuals to watch and use for reference (if you are an illustrator like me), a nice idea but a very very very poorly executed movie for it is absolutely poorly written.What a bummer.",The Book of Eli

There were never any parts that took me out of the movie so to speak I also enjoyed the biblical references and the deference given to them.There was such realism given to the fact that the Bible has such power. There will be lots of memories because of this movie. It is easy to see how much we take for granted. The Pledge of Allegiance to the United States is an oath of loyalty to the republic of the United States of America, originally composed by Francis Bellamy in 1892. The Pledge has been modified four times since then, with the most recent change adding the words ""under God"" in 1954. The Pledge is predominantly sworn by children in public schools in response to state laws requiring the Pledge to be offered. Congressional sessions open with the swearing of the Pledge, as do government meetings at local levels, meetings held by the Boy Scouts of America, the Freemasons and their concordant bodies, other organizations, and some sporting events.",The Book of Eli

He did FANTASTIC! I personally saw a lot of me in the character which helped me understand his actions. What makes the movie stand out is the real life dialog and situations he's put in. There are so many movies coming out these days that have masted the art of fake. I am very glad to have had this film created. Comment's wont do the movie justice.

How can a director not see that shooting with digital, even with the red one is inferior to film. There was no warmth at all to the picture, it was dead. The movie was pretty bad to be honest but the quality of the vision only made it worse. I guess its in human nature to look and go for the more convenient and easier ways of making or creating things, so I don't really expect this industry people to stick to film for good, I can only hope they will. Its funny, most people I know are in awe of HD quality, It is more in your face, shiny, bright, looking very sharp. But mind you I say this is not how you see things in real life; looking at a very beautiful valley for instance, real is warm, it's soft, its REAL. Thus according to my little survey, I had to conclude based on the fact that most people prefer a different quality to life more ""vivid"", that most people do not treasure their lives the way they are capable of or supposed to.Ayal, musician and a beginner filmmaker",The Book of Eli
577,Rootzgirl,Great film!,8,13 January 2010,"Denzel carried this out without a hitch. I am never disappointed with seeing him in action. I think he is one of the best actors and brought this movie to life. The plot was quite interesting as well, for me the movie had a philosophical message that can be interpreted as spiritual yet satirical at the same time. Satirical in the way it identified the role of the bible in today's society. It also highlights the power of the spoken and written words in combination with faith in times of crisis. I definitely suggest watching it! 2 thumbs up! This film carries a certain character that is sometimes lacking in Hollywood films. It seems to be a combination of Western, action, drama etc all combined in a futuristic yet historical way. I went to watch it with a friend and we were both enthralled and inspired by Eli. A must watch for movie goers!",The Book of Eli
578,JimmyH77,It's okay...nothing special,5,15 January 2010,"This movie is set in a post apocalyptic world, but there is not any real back story as to why the world in the movie is in the state that it is in. Briefly there is mention that a hole is torn in the atmosphere and fire scorches the earth...as a result of some war or something...the rest is left to the imagination.Denzel's character is supposedly on a mission from God, based on his faith, to deliver a book to some destination in the west. The book that is so important is the bible and supposedly it's the only one that has survived in all of the world. Gary Oldman's character wants to take this book from him to use it as a weapon to enslave the ""weak minds of the people"" and get them to follow him without question. I'm not sure how in this post apocalyptic world it is a certainty that all the millions of bibles in the world are gone and this is the only one, but that's the main plot of the movie.There's a couple knife fights and a couple gun fights...but the action during a couple of these moments are so improbable that you sort of assume that Denzel's character is some sort of SuperHuman for a good part of the movie. Turns out he's not. Anyway, Long story short...the bad guy takes what he thinks is the bible, and it is...but it's written in braille and the only person who can translate it for him is the blind lady he abuses...and it's already too late because his ""empire"" is crumbling. Denzel gets to his destination and there is a major movement underway in the west to get humanity back on it's feet again. They even started a printing press and are collecting all the major works and teaching people to read again. Just so happens that the bible is not one of the books that they have collected yet. And it turns out Denzel didn't need the book anyway...he had it memorized in his head. This is pretty much the end of the movie but for some reason it seems like it drags on for another 10 unnecessary minutes as ""Eli"" quotes bible verses...very boring, it's safe to walk out of the movie at this point. And then the very end is extremely corny, as his tag along hot chick takes his big knife and gets set for her own mission, back home, alone across the wastelands.Overall I'd say this movie is about as average as it gets. In my opinion it's not worth full price at the movies. I'd recommend waiting for DVD or Cable. It's definitely not a must see movie.",The Book of Eli
579,calebmilla,"...but don't listen to me, just watch it for yourself",10,16 January 2010,"This movie had a great message of perseverance and faith. It could've been longer but it's better for it to feel too short than for it to be way too long (Avatar). It was also very refreshing to watch a major film that doesn't have the same old story of hopelessness and meaninglessness that the typical ""end of the world"" Hollywood production is built around. The fight sequences reminded me of ""Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman"", which definitely has the best sword fighting of any movie. If I had one word to describe this movie I would say it's: hope. Hope that there is a real meaning to life.The end might be a little unbelievable, the girl making the journey by herself to go save her mother, but I think most girls would do the same for their mother. Some people might point out technical things that didn't make sense, like where did his arrows go, but it's a movie, who cares maybe it folds up and fits in his bag. Or where is his ammo, who cares, maybe it's hidden somewhere in his coat.",The Book of Eli
580,TehGaminGurl,Still left with questions...,7,16 January 2010,"As others have said, the beginning is slow and really could have been something on TV. It was the ending that I absolutely enjoyed from a faith perspective. But I have been left with questions that I hope others could give their opinions on: 1) I am thinking that perhaps Eli was blind before he was given the mission by God to bring the book which would explain why he could read braille but that perhaps God gave him the gift of sight for the purposes of his mission which would explain why he could see. The reason I think this, is that not only did he read the braille, but his other senses (hearing and smelling) were very fine tuned and then during the first fight scene, he seemed comfortable to draw back into the darkness of the shadows to fight. Now here is where I'm also confused on this part; at the end, the moment he starts to speak the words of the bible and the camera focuses on his eyes, they are clearly milky as some blind people have, but I am unsure if they were becoming more milky as he spoke or if that was an effect of the camera focusing closer and that really wasn't happening. Can anyone else give an interpretation of this? 2) When he was walking out of town and was shot at, what happened? Did the bullet just bounce off? I figure maybe because he is on his mission and has the bible with him, he's safe. So then when they are at the cannibal couples home and he is shot in the stomach after giving up the bible (which by the way, did everyone else see the flash of lightning behind the bad guy as he shot Eli?), was he actually hit and injured because he went off the path of his mission and gave up the bible to save the girl? Or because he didn't actually have the bible on his person? 3) What did Eli die from?I think that's it. I would say that people of Christian faith should see this movie but some would say what if they don't like fighting or blood? Well as someone else said, the scenes where those situations take place are rather clean and quick. Also, to see just the last part of the movie when they get to San Francisco just would not be as impacting without the build up of what Eli had to go through to bring the bible there. To me, it does make it much more powerful.However, they could give alternative endings and have Eli bringing any sacred book from any other religion and then the movie could be favored in other countries :). Although Eli is a Christian bible character and the cross on the front of the book may need to be edited as well.",The Book of Eli
581,chrisgardsmith,A Movie Worth Considering..,8,16 January 2010,"Alright, so this is my first review so please go easy on me. When watching the Book of Eli there is one thing that you can not get over. That would have to be the quality in which the movie is filmed. I do realize that yes there are a million other appocalypse movies out there but the way the movie is filmed is simply breath taking. The quality and attention to detail the film producers potray really leads to a movie that one would want to watch. The filming is done in a rustic fashion, great detail, and gives almost a darkening effect. Something that would be expected after the appocalypse. Denzil Washington plays one of his better rolls in this movie, portraying a character who survived the initial destruction of the earth. As you watch the movie you understand why he was given the part. Eli is the strong silent type, very powerful in commanding, a part that Washington is all to familier with, a.k.a Man on Fire. As he travels, for all you video game lovers, you can relate the terrain to that of Fall Out 3. Almost as if they were trying to mimic the exact landscape. That was the one thing that I could personally not get over. The ""new"" city in which he travels through can easily be related to one that was in the game. Just to much of a relation for me to get over. However continuing on, I am impressed by the acting of his side companion that he meets during his trek, Solara, played by Mila Kunis. I would have to say she acted the part perfectly and I will even go so far as to relate her acting and her look in this movie to Michelle Rodriguez. Overall this movie is definitely one I would recommend to watch in theatres. It did keep my attention. The fact that there are a lot of silent parts throughout the movie, and yet the way the movie is filmed giving so much detail within its picture keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The idea of the bible being the ultimate weapon is something that we all can relate to a real life scenario. After sitting here for over fifteen minutes without being able to come up with a con, I will leave it at that. I am giving this movie an eight just because it did not make me jump out of my seat and say that was the best plot and filmed movie of all time. It was a great movie, but it was not the BEST movie. For the only reason that yes I have seen a few appocalypse movies. However this one would definitely be the best and most realistic. Plot 8 Visuals 9.5 Acting 9.5 Overall 8.5",The Book of Eli
582,kosephback,Denzel Washington stars as Post-Apocalyptic Prophet delivering message and taking names.,8,16 January 2010,"Just thought it was a breath fresh air from a lot of the Liberal Agenda that's being thrown around these days. Now do not get me wrong, I love me my lefties, but I really enjoyed this pseudo-spiritual film. It truly re-affirmed and made me appreciate the Bible as the Word of God and how to take my reading of it as a gift to be cherished. Even if you don't believe in the Abrahmaic faiths, one would still be encouraged to watch this movie for the ending twist and the beautiful green-grey skied cinematography. Also Mila Kunis does a spot on job portraying an girl ignorant of the Pre-WWIII era and someone who is hungry for pure Truth and knowledge. This film is a true untainted warrior.",The Book of Eli
583,hcice,"""The Book of Eli"" – My Initial Thoughts",7,18 January 2010,"""The Book of Eli"" is a story about a post-apocalyptic world in which the human race has been mostly wiped out. It has been 30 years since ""the flash"" and a few small, makeshift towns seem to have popped up again. Eli (Denzel Washington) is a traveler who is heading west with a book he believes is the key to saving civilization. When he comes across a small town run by Carnegie (Gary Oldman), Carnegie finds out about the book and tries to take it from Eli at all costs. That's pretty much all I feel I can say about the movie without giving things away.I really had no idea what to expect going in, but ""The Book of Eli"" ended up being a pretty good movie. I wouldn't say there was anything special about it though. It simply kept me interested and drew me in to where I really cared what happened to Eli, Solara (Mila Kunis), and the book. The movie was pretty slow in a number of places, but the slowness definitely added to the suspense. My mind had time to race around and wonder how things were going to play out.There were only 3 small things that bugged me in the movie. First, overall the explosions and special effects were pretty well done. There was one place in particular though were a bomb was thrown next to a car. Instead of an explosion happening NEXT to the car though, an explosion emanated from the inside center of the car. Second, there were a couple of times where Solara (played by Mila Kunis who is the voice of ""Meg"" on ""Family Guy"") was pleading with Eli in a whiny voice. Unfortunately, this ""whiny voice"" is the same voice she often uses for ""Meg."" It was enough to knock my train of thought out of the movie for a bit. Finally, the ""great revelation"" at the end of the movie was very ""meh"" in my opinion.Before I get into a final description that I see as containing spoilers, let me go ahead and give my overall rating for this movie. As I stated, there was nothing really special about this movie, but the acting was good and it drew me in and made me care about what happened to the characters. I give this movie a 7.5/10.*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS *** It becomes obvious pretty quick that the ""book of Eli"" is a copy of the Bible. After this is made clear, Carnegie (Oldman) gives a short speech about how religion is used to control people and how the ""weak and stupid"" flock to it. I was worried that the movie was going to take a turn at this point and be nothing but ""look how bad and stupid religion is"" in somewhat the same way as ""The Invention of Lying"" did. I really didn't want to sit through another movie that harped these points.Now, to be clear, I do believe that religion can easily be used as a means to control the ""weak and stupid"" but that it is not true that ""only the weak and stupid seek religion."" Overall, the movie did a nice job of showing that there are those who seek to use religion to gain power and control people but then there are those who seek to use religion to truly help others.",The Book of Eli
584,cswimc-638-459983,The Book Of Eli,8,18 January 2010,"The Book of Eli was overall an entertaining film that had some deep messages regarding humanity. Eli, the protagonist, is a man driven by his faith. He explains that he heard a voice that led him to a book and entrusted him with the task of protecting it by all means until it was where it was supposed to be somewhere out west. As a result, the message he received told him that he would be protected along the way.Interestingly enough, the book in question is a bible. Bibles had been burned because after the apocalyptic war that left the world in ruins, those who survived began burning all bibles they could find. The belief was that it was religion that caused the war. Therefore, the bible that Eli is carrying is the last one known to exist.During his 30 year journey, Eli is a righteous man who does not seek out trouble. His main objective is to follow the path that has been laid out for him from a higher power. Along the way, he encounters gangs, hijackers, power hungry dictators, and more. People in this new world are savage-like and uncivilized. It's a lawless world in which some people have resorted to cannibalism. Others claim to be more civilized by choosing not to eat human flesh, although many of them are just as bad as everyone else from their heinous actions. They kill for water, shoes, books, and almost anything.Through his journey, Eli comes across a village that is a lot like a modern 'wild west' setting. The town is corrupt, and its leader, and older educated man, wants the bible so he can claim power over everyone. His belief is that the bible contains words and messages that will make people succumb to his will, and as a result, he would be the supreme dictator. Therefore, he exhausts all of his resources and men trying to get the bible from Eli, and when he finally gets it, he can't read it because it's written in braille. Along with that, he has lost control over his town and is sick from an open wound that he didn't take care of while trying to get the bible.This leads us to the end of the movie. Eli and his companion whom he met along the way, Solara, make it out west and row a small boat out to Alcatraz Island where there is a sort of sanctuary. On the island, there are civilized people striving to save the historical documents that defined our history, and Eli's contribution is the copy of the bible which they do not have in their collection. Unfortunately, Eli doesn't have the bible in his possession anymore since it was taken by Carnegie, the power hungry dictator, but Eli did read the bible every day for the past 30 years. Therefore, he memorized it. The film ends with Eli reciting the bible while having it scribed by one of the men on the island, and finally a copy of the bible is printed on the printing press they have on the island. In the end, Eli completed his journey, Solara sets out to carry on his legacy and spread the faith.The movie does throw a twist out at the audience suggesting that Eli has been blind throughout the entire movie which is unknown to the viewers until the end. Although, I have to disagree with this. I personally feel that Eli was a blind man but that when he received the arduous task of bringing the bible out west, he was given the strength and tools needed to carry out what was asked of him. As a result, in the end, you hear Eli thanking god for helping him carry out his task by giving him what he needed in order to successfully get the bible to where it belonged. In that monologue at the end of the movie, it seemed to me that Eli's combat skills, sight, strength, will, and perseverance was driven by his faith and that there was divine intervention helping him along the way. After he completed the task and made it out west to Alcatraz Island, he no longer needed these abilities, and as such he went back to the way he was before the war and before he found the bible. Once it was complete, he was relieved of his duties and soon after, he perished, with Solara carrying on his legacy.",The Book of Eli

By far much better than most of what Hollywood will try to drive down your throat over the next year. Regardless, I'm not too surprised to see this movie generate so much hate as including the Bible in anything now days seems to draw fire. This movie didn't just include the Bible, but put some emphasis on faith and religion as a whole.I wouldn't say this movie was preachy by any means, nor was perfect. What the movie did well was done great. The art and sound direction was on the spot and pretty memorizing, the action scenes were well thought out, MOST of the characters were well developed, and the story was good. I also enjoyed the overall feel of the movie as it kept my interest and got me to actually post something about it.On the other hand I did not care for Mila Kunis's character Solara much in the beginning. I found her to be straight up annoying through the first half. The fate of some characters could have been elaborated on, some of the minor plot holes (which i can be anal about) could have been patched (mostly regarding life in a dystopian future), and the war could have been fleshed out a lot more. Also as someone posted before, the old man (Malcolm McDowell) was slightly out of place.Over all I was impressed and would highly recommend this flick.

587,grimmtw,Very Powerful Movie...,10,21 January 2010,"I do not write movie reviews professionally, but I think those that do really need to re-evaluate how the rate movies.... At the end of the day, the true measure of a movie to me is whether I enjoy it or not. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I didn't see any good reviews on this movie before I went to see it, but despite what the ""professionals"" said, I went to see the film anyway. In a setting 30 years past a nuclear war (never stated whether it was or not, but hinted as such), a man is traveling because a divine spirit told him to. He is traveling to deliver a book somewhere to help restart civilization - as opposed to the existence most are seen to be living in the movie. It tracks some of the things he encounters along the way and things he is forced to do to survive. He avoids what he can, but acts when circumstances require action. Whether some of the scenes could really happen or not is irrelevant; that's why it is called a MOVIE rather than real-life events.

I'm really not happy being preached to by movies, especially those whose central character fails to live up to anything he tells other people (how Christian is it to cut another mans hand off?). If you're a Christian, don't go to see this movie - it's violent (this violence is seemingly OK, as long as it's a good guy killing people in the name of God, rather than the bad guys killing people - which I find to be a rather worrying message). If you're not a Christian, don't go and see this movie, unless you like being preached to. Go and watch The Road. It's much better.",The Book of Eli

Now the problem with this film is that despite the star studded cast, the script doesn't seem to have what it takes to exploit their talent.First off, this is a road movie, and so it has to be as good or better than other road movies - and it just is not so.Second, it's tapping on religious undertones, and in doing so, it tries to carry a message, and it does so poorly. Thus, it neither does the road movie justice, nor does it justice to the religious undertones.Third, the shots are tired and seem to have been tried before, with nothing new to reveal. In other words, it wasn't exciting.In summary, The Book Of Eli severely missed the mark on what it was trying to do - and the highlight was that Denzel in the fight scenes were brilliant.",The Book of Eli
590,sam-koopman,What happened here?,4,5 February 2010,"Hmmm, the Hughes Brothers, Denzel, Gary Oldman and Mila Kunis. This movie has the recipe for success. Well not exactly. I don't know where to begin with this movie because i think it was a total crap show. The four stars i gave it are solely for the cinematography, which I think was phenomenal. But amidst those beautiful silhouette shots and perfectly framed fight scenes is an ugly movie.The film starts off with around 30-45 minutes of our main character walking aimlessly, and we are not to sure of what is going on. We come to realize that this book, The Bible, is very important to him. Oh, and it can also help him kill groups of 15 plus gangsters. When Oldman is introduced it is clear he wants this book, but we don't know why yet, we have to wait for about a half an hour more again. There are inconsistencies in how the world turned out the way it did and this is really confusing as a viewer. The whole story never makes total sense. Simply put, this movie likes to take its time.The dialogue, though not horrible is odd, and makes Kunis look like a horrible actress. But where the film really dropped the ball was how unclear it was as to the genre of the film. It never digs you in enough to make you care about the fights or the characters, but then it adds in a load of useless humour. After leaving the theatre I still can't figure out if it was a action film or a comedy.Another aspect of the movie that was ridiculous was the product placement. The opening sequence featured a lovely advertisement for headphones, a mp3 and of course, KFC. Sprinkled throughout the movie are many more way to obvious ads.Finally, the biggest annoyance of this film is the ending. To me, the way they ended it was similar to saying 'never mind, it was all a dream, and they lived happily ever after'. The conclusion was silly, unconvincing, and did not make sense. The final scenes of the film kept dragging and dragging along going no where, this movie could have and should have been a lot shorter.Though Washington put in a decent performance in what i believe is the decline of his career, The Book of Eli is just one large mess.",The Book of Eli

I'm all for the end-of-days films. I love the post-apocalyptic setting and story lines. I think the concept of faith as motivation as displayed in this flick is a stylish literary mechanism which avoids ""gimmick"" repetition. In short, script pulls it off nicely.However.... the violence is extensive but stylized as to be sanitized. Wounded lie quietly. Large blade weapons result in screaming torrents of pain and anguish in their victims. They do not ""die"" but are incapacitated. In Eli, the violence has all the realism of a Saturday Kung-Fu movie but is stylized as a realistic bent. We're to accept the violence as an extreme example of the lengths of which the protagonist must go in his singular motivation. His motivation drives him to extremes which are otherwise out of place. Irony , as it were. It doesn't work for me. It ends up being cartoonish and detracts significantly from what otherwise is a great story. It doesn't work as action. It doesn't work as violence for its own sake. It doesn't add to the feature but stands as a bad major supporting actor detracting from the enjoyment of the well shot picture.

The entire movie I found myself constantly checking my watch and searching the theater walls for something worth looking at. It seemed to stall for long periods of time at random intervals to add suspense or drama but only bored me more. The movie was neither realistic enough nor fake enough. The cast was filled with a few really great performers that should have chosen a different movie to make. The thing that bothers me the most is how directors don't sweat the details like how all of the cars in the film were 1950's to 1990's cars and there were no modern or futuristic cars. The movie is supposed to take place in the 2090's which means those cars would be a hundred and fifty years old and your telling me that they would still exist? I don't think so!

The action is intensely sweet and definitely hits the action junkie spot so to speak. The directing is spot on with ingenious views of gruesome deaths. If you aren't impressed with all of that the acting is carried out by two timeless acting giants in Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman. Although, Gary Oldman has clearly aged a bit compared to how young he was just a blink ago in The Professional. Without giving too much away, (because the best part of the experience is figuring out for yourself where the director is going conceptually) the plot is undeniably smart. Think out side of the box, bounds, or confinements of religious subscription and have a little faith in this movie; it's worth it.",The Book of Eli
599,mzbkubiitch,great movie,7,7 March 2010,"The book of Eli starring Denzel Washington was a great movie. My first thought of this film was that it would be boring because it had kind of a slow beginning, but it turned out to be great. Denzel Washington is the main character Eli he's going north to get this book (bible) to a new civilization. He wanders into a town where Gary Oldman (Carnegie) desperately tries 2 take it from him.The story of this moving is very interesting. The major characters are Eli (Denzel Washington), Carnegie (Gary Oldman), and Solara (Mila Kunis). They all gave a very good performance but I think Denzel's was the best out of all three because he was the main character. This movie is about Eli having the last bible on earth and he's traveling trying to a place where civilization can start again from a world that was destroyed by some huge war.There were many things visually interesting about this film. As far as the costumes and the scenery it all fit very well. All the actors gave great performances. My favorite scene would have to be when Denzel killed Oldman's men who are armed with sniper rifles & machine guns with a simple handgun. HE is also chopping people up wit a sword.In conclusion, The book of Eli was a great movie. I would recommend it 2 any body especially people who love action films.* please don't pay mind to this review its 4 my film class*",The Book of Eli

I find this to be ridiculous. Yes, this movie is a very strong/overt metaphor to Christianity. Yes, Denzil Washington is a Christian. Yes, passages of the Bible are read. But should this be censored? What about FREE SPEECH? If you disagree with the movie's message, then you don't need to like it! But this doesn't make it wrong for those involved with the creation of this movie to want to express their thoughts. You are free to have your own thoughts, as are the movie's creators.James Cameron's Avatar was another ""religious vehicle"" if you will. It is very much a spiritual, connect with the source of energy, mother earth, etc, type message. I have a feeling most people ripping on The Book Of Eli would not say the same for Avatar. Your bias is against Christianity, not on a movie having a message. This is rather intolerant and prejudiced. You don't have to enjoy or agree with this movie.

There would of course be a god- there has never been civilization or even humans without some sort of higher power and literally hundreds of these existed before Jesus or the bible.Therefore while I absolutely agree that without belief in something, mankind is lost, I find it insulting that anyone suggest that without the bible specifically we all become degenerates with not only any moral conscious but apparently imaginative or creative thought.",The Book of Eli
603,knight32-719-581252,The Beauty of Simplicity,9,22 April 2010,"Too often in today's action films, we as viewers are forced to witness a barrage of unnecessary excess. It almost seems as if some directors feel it is their duty to constantly bombard us with more, more, more—more blood, more action, more CGI, more machine gun-like imagery, etc. Add in the loud metal music and strobe-light effects and we might as well be at the club. This need for more has become such a focal point that many creators in this genre are forgetting the principle duty of film-making—to tell a story.This is what sets The Book of Eli apart. Although its post apocalyptic premise could have easily warranted much of the same nonsense that we have sadly become used to, this movie instead chooses to avoid all the fluff and focus on the more philosophical elements of the story. Rather than hypnotize use with eye-dizzying imagery and in-your-face action, this film takes a step back and tells its tale from a simple, outward-looking, and objective point of view.The story takes place in the United States 30 years after a presumably word-wide apocalyptic war. Just like every other post-doomsday tale from Mad Max to Thundaar, the few remaining survivors of this planet are left to survive with a limited supply of life's bare necessities—food, water, fuel, etc. Where The Book of Eli differs is that in this world, a certain book was blamed for starting the war, to which every copy was destroyed shortly thereafter.This is where the film's hero, Eli (Denzel Washington), comes in. We learn that he has the last remaining copy of this influential ""book"". His ongoing mission is to head west until he finds a location where the book will ultimately be protected. Along this journey, a sinister town developer, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), learns of Eli's prize possession and decides to capture it for his own purposes. He has long been searching for this book himself, and will not stop at nothing to have it. Through his struggles with Carnegie, Eli eventually learns of the true meaning of the book and how he must put faith in others.The camera-work is steady and controlled. The action, although still electrifying, is filmed realistically and only appears within the proper context of the film. The background noise is not overbearing and the characterizations are woven beautifully within this post-doomsday tale. The pace still keeps you focused and interested, for The Hughes Brothers interjects many brief scenes to quickly advance the storyline. Although this film does share some obvious similarities with other wasteland movies, its style and plot elements actually coincide with those seen in classic westerns like High Noon and Hang-em High.In conclusion, The Book of Eli is a refreshing change-up from the way-too-clichéd movies of the day. Its action does not distract you from the plot, and that is why it is a great film. In the end, it ultimately manages to accomplish a feat that is rarely seen in action movies nowadays—the beauty of simplicity.",The Book of Eli

606,Another_Take,Enjoy with an Open Mind and Suspended Belief,8,23 May 2010,"Although I tried to keep this as spoiler-less as possible, I am going to give a warning that this review hints at parts you might want to view for yourself.Plot:The Book of Eli (2010) paints a dystopic view of the future: the United States lays barren and dry after an apocalyptic war. Sharing a common theme with the movie Mad Max (1979), the roads are controlled by raiders and looters making travel dangerous. Despite this, Eli (Denzel Washington) takes a personal mission to deliver a book to an unknown location ""West"". His journey eventually brings him to a small settlement where his mission, his book and his life are threatened.Pros: (+) Visually Spectacular: A lot of thought was put into the detailing of lighting and colour themes. Also, the panoramic views are a nice treat for the eyes and imagination. (+) Well-paced Action Sequences: Whenever there was a conflict, Denzel Washington never failed to deliver an exhilarating show. In particular, there was one unbroken fight scene near the beginning which should impress you. (+) (Mostly) Well-paced Story: During the majority of the length of the movie, the plots and events that transpire are delivered in a nicely concise and deliberate fashion. Personally, I felt every scene (until up to the ending) contributed and not a single second of screen time was wasted. (+) Serious Tone/Themes: Although the themes here are definitely controversial, the movie's mature tone and believable setting should be enough to get one to provoke some serious thoughts. Some might be impressed upon by the religious themes while others might be touched by the message of the importance of preserving knowledge. In any situation, the movie does leave an impact on the viewer and I believe that should be celebrated.Cons: (-) Unnecessary Plot Device: If you watched the movie, you probably already know what I'm hinting at. There's one glaringly important aspect of the Eli character that is supposed to be shocking to the viewers. However, in practise, it turns out to be highly unnecessary and unrealistic to the point where its somewhat gimmicky.(-) Plot Shield a Little Too Apparent: The definition of a character protected by the ""plot shield"" (too vital to the plot than to be killed/harmed) fits Eli a little too well. There are scenes where bullets downright dodge Eli. And with the movie's serious tone, you will definitely find it difficult to suspend belief in realism to ignore this problem.(-) Heavy Christian Themes: Now, before I start on this, I want to stress that this is may not necessarily be a negative. If you're a Christian, this will be nice treat of a movie for you. As a Christian, I found the movie's themes somewhat refreshing. However, I completely understand atheists or people of other faiths may be uncomfortable with the ideas discussed in this movie. And their feelings are justifiable: the movie positively advertises Christian beliefs and practises to a surprisingly large extent.Recommendation: Before you view this movie, just know that Christian themes are delivered with a heavy hand. If you are Christian, that's great; watch the movie and enjoy the religious themes. If you are agnostic/open-minded atheist, I would suggest you try to separate yourself from the religious themes and focus more on the idea that Eli is just a man on a journey trying to protect knowledge that is precious to him. Although his mission might not touch you personally, try to imagine how it might affect Eli personally and his belief on what is truly important to him. Finally, if Christianity REALLY isn't your cup of tea, avoid this movie. The extent to which it celebrates the Christian faith might offend you (and I wouldn't blame you if it did).",The Book of Eli
607,michael-s-reece,Well done. Dramatic. Does it have an agenda? Yes... but so do so many other movies.,9,5 June 2010,"I am prompted to write this review because of the myriads of people giving this movie one star ratings just because the guy is protecting the Bible. I'm going to try to provide an non-biased review. The movie was very well done, and original in it's own respect. Of course the post apocalyptic scenes are going to give you flash-backs to ""I Am Legend"", or ""The Road"", or ""Terminator Salvation"", or if you're a gamer the ""Fallout"" series. But the story is well thought out, and fresh. The man isn't just looking out for #1. He's got a purpose. There are a few plot holes, but come on! Give the movie a break. I don't necessarily need to know how the guy broke out of the locked room, or why it took him 30 years to cross the United States to enjoy the movie. Also, to those objecting that him being blind was totally unbelievable. The movie doesn't explicitly say that he was blind. He might have just known braille. I agree that there is no way he could have done the things he did blind, and during the entire film he does not act like a blind man. He walks right up to people and looks them in the eyes and talks to them. I don't think he was really blind. Maybe God gave him his sight back, that would have fit in with the story. And also to those who are calling Eli a hypocrite because he killed mercilessly and did not protect the couple at the beginning of the movie; Eli actually admits that at the end of the film. When he and his sidekick are heading west after she comes back for him and finds him on the road. He says to her ""I got so caught up in protecting the book that I forgot what it taught me; To treat others better than you do yourself."" Or something roughly to that effect. Just wanted to point that out. Denzel did a wonderful job, as usual. His character was very likable and he made him very convincing. He was also intimidating, just like his character needed him to be. The action sequences were gripping and were fun spectacles to behold. The very first fight which is shot in a unique silhouette style reminded me slightly of 300. The cinematography was interesting as well. The movie looks as though it was shot through a filter like 300, but not as drastic, rendering it in a nearly black and white picture at some points. All in all the movie is very well done, and I don't see why everyone but Bible believing people can push any agenda they choose. I don't know how many movies I've seen that try to tell us that we're killing our mother earth and that we need to stop being blood-thirsty capitalists. I say let them make the movies they want to make, and if you disagree with them, that's fine, but don't slam a movie just because you disagree with their beliefs. That said, this movie is a wonderful piece of film making. And as long as you don't throw a fit about the religious position of the film, you should enjoy it thoroughly.",The Book of Eli
608,lesbian_ninja,What's the point?,3,6 June 2010,"I found this film incredibly disappointing. Not only was the 'point' or 'message' completely wasted on me but I was entirely distracted by the level of sexual violence that the film incorporated.The numerous scenes depicting rape and violence towards women were horrendous. There is one such scene very early on in the film where a travelling pair are shot and the woman attacked by a group of four men. What can be seen (albeit it in the background of the shot and slightly unfocused)is the four men throwing the woman to the ground, tearing her clothes off of her and repeatedly striking her. Oh, and she is screaming and begging them to stop as this is being shown. I found this scene, and the following depictions of rape and violence, highly unsettling, inappropriate, unnecessary and overly graphic.So it's post-apocalyptic Earth? Maybe the makers were trying to show the audience just how gruesome and horrendous that kind of world is. However, these representations could have been significantly diluted whilst still insinuating the same act and connoting the barbarism and anarchy of such a time.The scenes, for me, completely undermined the true point and content of the film - versus what I believe they were initially intended for. Rather than 'setting an air' of chaos and violence, the scenes were simply too graphic and made me think ""why are they showing something so disturbing? - what on earth is the point to this?"". Safe to say, it ruined the rest of the film for me.",The Book of Eli

Take a look at whats going on today, war over religion and beliefs!!! every war since the existence of man has been about religion and beliefs!! In the movie, it got so bad to where it tore a whole in the ozone which nuclear war can do that! They ended up burning all the bibles because of the travesty it created and coincidently there is one book left which is the plot and basis of the movie. And guess what,? it's happening right now in the real world where people are going to the extreme and taking other peoples life's as well as there own for what they believe in! and the sad thing about it, it's only getting worse!Back to the movie, Eli (washington) is traveling to get that knowledge into the right hands after hearing the voice of God or (conscience) whatever you want to call it or believe in. Think of people in the past who have claimed they heard the word of God (which I believe in) who have done great things, what they were solely meant to do like Jesus, Moses, Joan of Ark, Noah, etc... Eli actually falls into that group for this movie.And him being blind just adds to the creativity of the director and a great symbol because us as people, we rely on our sight too much. Meaning that instead of letting God and our hearts guide us, if we cant see it then we don't believe it (not for everybody).

At least the apocalypse wasn't caused by yet another evil corporation.Just to correct something that keeps being repeated here. The movie doesn't say that the bible or religion started the war. It says that many people believed it started the war.Near the end of the movie Eli says that what he got out of reading the bible was to do more for others than you do for yourself. Not exactly a horrible message.Anyway, the movie isn't without its flaws. As someone else pointed out Eli's bow seems to be magically concealed somewhere. Throughout the movie I often felt like I was watching Mad Max. The plot was pretty weak and I could pretty much tell what was going to happen long before it did.Nonetheless I felt it was entertaining. Not the best movie I've ever seen, but certainly not the worst. I believe if you're a Denzel fan, enjoy violent action scenes and a post apocalyptic setting you should enjoy this film.",The Book of Eli
613,pbpauly,I liked it but??,6,15 July 2010,"I liked it. Apparently done almost entirely on blue screen, not so cool. I'm a picky person, so a couple of points. I like the premise that he is saving the last known King Jame's Bible in existence, and trying to get it to a safe place. BUT, if it was a King Jame's Bible in braille, it would have been MUCH larger than it was depicted, the book shown was the size of a printed King Jame's Bible. Next, Solara who couldn't read, seemed to be able to drive a car just fine?? And when the bad guys returned to their town, they were almost out of fuel, so how is it, that Eli and Solara were able to drive all the way to the west coast and San Francisco?? Another thing, it might have taken a year or more to recite, and have copied the whole bible, so why was it that Eli had to die?? Seems he would have most likely recovered from his wounds??BUT, I did like the idea that Solara was returning home, which opens the possibility of a sequel. Sorry, but I did say I was picky, and sometimes, little flaws or inconsistencies detract from movies.

614,atticult,"The Book of Eli is NOT religious propaganda, it it a metaphor for Faith.",8,16 July 2010,"I signed up to write a review for this film after seeing how many people were claiming ""religious propaganda."" Different opinions are great and I respect them, but I think those people are completely missing the point. ""Faith"" does not necessarily mean ""Christianity."" I actually don't remember anyone saying ""the Bible"" in any scene either, making it ambiguous as to which religious book Eli had in his possession. It's better actually to look at the book itself as Faith, rather than trying to label it, which is sort of a beautiful allegory about spirituality. We, as a society, have indeed labeled and separated ourselves instead of realizing the bigger picture, whatever that may be. The movie also made a metaphor of the way corruption works with power. Eli was a humble servant of his beliefs, while Oldman's character only wanted the same power for selfish reasons... an old plot device, maybe, but this movie pulled it off with such finesse. The Book of Eli is about realizing the bigger picture, I think... I wish people wouldn't automatically attach religion and Christianity to things so quickly when God or beliefs or faith is mentioned... Religion is smaller than that, and more bleak. Instead look at how beautiful the feeling of purpose is versus satisfying ones own primal needs.",The Book of Eli
615,csnelson2430,God is always present in every situation no matter how hopeless it may be,10,27 July 2010,"Eli, (Denzel Washington) travels for years protecting at all costs a book which is precious to him. The villain in the movie Carnegie (Gary Oldman) attempts to steal the book from him at all costs. All this going on in a post-apocalyptic setting colored with dim grays, dust and dirt in a seemingly hopeless and destitute land. Eli is willing to give his life to ensure this book is delivered to the right hands for reprinting. The villain knows just how powerful this book is. He believes whoever possesses this book will be able to control the remaining and future inhabitants of the world. Eli also knows just how powerful this book is. In his eyes this book means the difference between a world of savages and deliverance for the souls of the survivors of the ""apocalypse"". Carnegie goes as far as to temp Eli. He uses his girlfriend Claudia's (Jennifer Beals) daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) as the bait. Carnegie sends Solara to Eli's room in which he was forced to spend the night in Carnegie's town, to offer him sex. Eli doesn't fall for it, but honors Solara's request to let her spend the night in the room so Carnegie won't physically harm her mother for not carrying out his plans to reel Eli in. It was Eli's faith in God and belief in his divine power and protection which assisted Eli on his journey. God also provided for Eli along the way. Eli trapped whatever little animals he could for food and salvaged what he could from dilapidated houses along the way of his journey. I found it interesting Eli possessed an Ipod which ran out of juice. This for me represented how we must keep some things from our past to help us along the way and guide us to our destiny. Eli was given an assignment as a soldier in the army of the Lord. Once his mission was accomplished and assignment complete. He was called home by God. The setting of dull, dark bleakness all every scene worked together to form a motif representing despair, hopelessness and misfortune. The lighting, dim even in the daytime, symbolized the ignorance and uncertainty of the characters. Eli's willingness to take his assignment without complaining and without pause proved God is still present even when it seems he's not and every soul is worth saving.

There is a Bible in virtually every hotel room in America.

618,drewa2,Good thoughtful post-apocalyptic adventure,7,1 September 2010,"This film is neither as good nor as bad as the extremes of the IMDb reviews suggest. It is thoughtful, uplifting, and exciting, despite being flawed with plot inconsistencies. Denzel Washington has the screen presence to portray the martial-artist hero of the story. His acting is probably the best quality of this movie. His Eli is a simultaneously ruthless but compassionate killer, a man on a mission who will not be swayed from his pilgrimage. It is his singularity of purpose that keeps the movie coherent. He has been walking for 30 years secretly carrying a book to a destination somewhere west. Unfortunately for Eli, he must pass through the anarchic shanty town with its villainous mob boss and obligatory henchmen. The boss is well played by Gary Oldman in the familiar role of amoral sleazy murderer. The town is familiar as a type of wild west or Mad Max Bartertown location. Many of the themes in this story are familiar including the zen-like martial artist monk character of Eli himself. What also saves the movie from formulaic disaster is that it makes you think and feel. There is a twist or two at the end, now rather famous, which are ironic and lend a feeling of sincerity to the movie that is typically lacking in the post- apocalyptic genre. I don't feel that the plot twists work, exactly, and I will discuss that below. I thought the dialog was well written but there were scenes that did not make sense exactly, and I suspect the movie was re-edited more than once.Tom Waits has a nice cameo. Mila Kunis is adequate if maybe a little too good-looking for the role. Jennifer Beals is good. The henchmen were generally pretty well cast.The movie looks pretty good with its bleak if familiar post-nuclear-war type landscape. The casting was good, the acting was excellent, and the script was superior to more ordinary sci-fi thrillers. The movie is worth seeing despite its flaws, primarily for the subtlety of Denzel's acting, but also for the successful treatments of its themes of redemption and morality in the face of extreme adversity and stress.***/4Spoiler alert: This discussion is for those who have seen the movie.So I think the filmmakers were aiming for something like the Sixth Sense but it fell short. The blindness issue is not dealt with successfully (aside from the foreshadowing which was well done). There is no indication that Eli was blind despite his reliance on sounds and smells, using the word ""feel"" rather than ""look"", etc. Braille, I suppose, can be read by sighted people as well as the blind, although not many. A second viewing does not hold up as it did for the Sixth Sense.Also what was up with the scene at the spring? I did not even notice this the first time through, but there was somebody struggling, bound and gagged on the ground outside the door to the well. The final edit left me feeling that there were a lot of deleted scenes to see on the DVD.The religious issue also was inconsistent. Granted, they wanted to show the dangers of organized religion (the war, Carnegies motivation) versus the virtues of a personal, moral faith. The shelving of the Bible in the library undermined its significance in that if Eli were blind, it would prove the existence of a God who really cared about the Bible for more than its historical value. There were three other significant plot holes that I observed. How Eli escaped his confinement was not explained. It did not seem that Solara let him out but the guard was just shot on sight without word. The hijackers were operating inexplicably both east and west of town. And what was Solara heading out to the shanty town at the end for? To retrieve the braille book? She can't read, and with Eli gone and her mother having forgotten how, there is probably no one left to read braille. But it looked inspiring for her to don the sunglasses and have her own mission.",The Book of Eli

And though the contrast in the performances was obviously deliberate, it didn't take away from my enjoyment. One at the height of peace, one at the height of desperation. But I really don't appreciate being hit over the head with religious symbolism. It wasn't even subtle. However, if we're meant to view this movie as irony or satire, I give it 8 out of 10. I'll get right to the point: perhaps we're being told that unless we dig down to the root of many evils, we are doomed to be forever cultivating beautiful, but poisonous gardens, regardless of our good intentions.",The Book of Eli

Hollywood produces a myriad of action packed adrenaline full of sex without even forgetting the porn industry and the way music clips look like nowadays and for some people to have the courage to complain that once in a blue moon Hollywood decides to produce some decent art it is incomprehensible. Watch the movie, I'm not saying it will change your life, but watch it at least twice so that it can sit in.

WHAT - THE BOOK IS A BIBLE - Yes...of course it is, and for all the people who didn't see that coming you should probably stick to watching less complicated films...like Finding Nemo.This movie has a central theme of religion and, because I knew this going into the movie, and wanted to see it partially because of this, it was a really enjoyable film. The action sequences were fun to watch and it had a very captivating story with a shocking (and to me very strong) ending.I wish that people would see this for the solid film that this is instead of just bashing it for its religious themes.

I am an agnostic but that doesn't make me automatically hate anything that has a reference to the bible. Saying that the bible hadn't influenced the world is pure stupidity.Aside from my ranting, this movie was a beautiful movie (and i don't usually describe movies that way.) It was a perfect mix of action and drama. the only thing that kept me from giving it 10/10 was a few inconsistencies. It is one of very few movies that left me satisfied at the end. In most movies there are loose ends not tied up at the end or places left open for a sequel (I'm a sucker for sequels.) It was completely satisfying in every way. When Eli died it wasn't sad it just made me feel like he had rest at last. You should definitely go and see it if you have the chance.

Doesn't matter that the ozone layer is gone and its hot as hell in the sun, water is more scarce and valuable then gold -he keeps on walking. No explanation to how a hungry and severely thirsty main character is able to successfully fight and kill a dozen fully armed and well fed thugs in a few blinks of the eyes, only using his knife. The script is full of holes and inconsistencies, sometimes unintentionally hilarious (house shoot out), Solara's lip gloss and clean model look, her silky smooth hair when earlier we learned that shampoo wasn't around anymore etc.Conclusion: a B-movie with a nice premise and an OK setting with Denzel in it. A movie with a similar premise and setting: The Road is much better (yet more depressing which is realistic given the circumstances) and shows that the dumbing down trend in Hollywood is mainly reserved for the big productions (Avatar, need I say more?)",The Book of Eli

The impression of bright sunlight and heat was always present through the whole movie, as was the Wild West styled scenery with some classic camera angles and conversations. In general, I didn't mind some obvious logical flaws like ""a blind guy can't do this or that"" But what I did mind was the irritating way the movie wanted to make a statement about the importance of the bible. Until the first three thirds of the movie were over, I did not know what the film wanted to tell me so desperately. Is the bible a dangerous book that mankind simply fails to understand or is it so valuable that one must save it even by completely pervert its content? Later on, the second interpretation seemed plausible as Eli did not turn the other cheek but cut off the whole hand and I was looking forward to more sublime black humor In the end I was completely confused by the message it obviously tried to get across. ""The bible is a super important and wonderful book"" just makes no sense in context of this movie. I would suggest reading the New Testament before writing a story about the bible.

I had no trouble with all the flaws in the story. They don't matter. Tom Waits and Jennifer Beals, Francis de la Tour (Madame Maxim of Harry Potter), Michael Gambon as George, her husband, added rich touches to a great cast in very minor parts.

628,steve-knox,I want my 2 hours back,2,12 April 2011,"It's Mad Max's fault. Since Mel Gibson demonstrated that the only things likely to survive an apocalypse are gas guzzling V8's and matt black paint, every film since has adopted the position of, ""well Mad Max did it, so we can too"". If nuclear missiles start raining down, I'm going to hide under the nearest Aston Martin.But it's not just that with the 'The Book of Eli', it can't be, because I saw that my V+ box was 47 minutes behind by the end of the film as I had paused it so many times to rant about things that offended sense.It's 31 years since 'the event' (or 'flash' or 'war' or something), and since then everyone has to wear sunglasses or they'll go blind because 'the sky opened' and 'the sun burnt everything'. I'm going to need to take a breath here... people are just wearing pristine sunglasses for protection (everyone's got a pair and none seem worse for wear after 31 years). Some even go round wearing just an amazon warrior style furry bikini (and shades) as presumably in the 31 years since the enormous war that people can't really remember, everyone has developed a resistance to skin cancer - although chapstick and 'cat oil' appear to be worth killing people for, perhaps lips are still vulnerable after all.Other things to survive are of course vast supplies of bullets, guns and blow torches to weld together the battle trucks, as well as oil refineries and all their technicians to keep the wagons fuelled up. Understandably, the nukes didn't hit any of this and neither did the Sun burn any of it. It was more of a tactical burn. Cheeky Sun.There's almost no water though....and it doesn't look like there is any vegetation left either. Lots of people left though, apparently just eating other people or maybe, although it's not mentioned, I suspect people have evolved 'dust gills' on their feet to suck nutrients out of the floor. A bit like Waterworld, but Dustworld.Oo! Top tip - don't eat too much human, it gives you the shakes and turns you mental. Who'd have thought?1st generation iPods last forever too. So do really cool expensive headphones. And clothes. Jeans barely last me a year before they get a bit ripped.And I want one of Denzil's magic rucksacks that stores a massive bow and arrow that keeps appearing out of nowhere. Some people don't even know what TV is, and almost no one can read. It's like the directors purposely kept sticking bits in the film 'cause they knew it would wind me up.I did like the bit when Mila Kunis got shut behind the door, 'cause when you can't see her, it's easy to believe Meg Griffin is shouting at Denzil, and that bit I liked.In summary, as the 'twist' at the end unfolds, I felt like the film took a run up and kicked me in the balls. Denzil, you owe me nearly 2 hours of my life.Look, I'm not going to ruin it for you, I've hardly even mentioned the central premise - to be honest it hardly matters - so if you happen to see it's on, give it a go, and if it turns out you like films about unbelievably tough blind ninja disciples with photographic memories, then you'll find this film rocks.",The Book of Eli

He can smell the band of thugs waiting for him. Denzel starts kicking ass as a band of idiots try to take his pack. He quickly, too quickly in fact, takes his knife and chops off the man's hand. It was life he moved faster than humanly possible.He kills all of them except for the woman who was there to set him up. He keeps walking and ends up in this town that is run by Gary Oldman's character. He's in charge of the town and has a blind women and her grown daughter who he keeps as his property.Denzel goes into the bar to get some water and pisses off one of the guys in the bar by shooing away this nasty white cat. Denzel again ends up killing just about everyone who tries to stop him from leaving the bar, which is a whole handful of people.Gary Oldman's character is sending his thugs out to look for a specific book that we later find out Denzel's Character, Eli has. We don't find out that the book is actually the bible until about half way through the movie.Eli makes it to where he says a voice told him to go. Are we to believe that the voice of god told him to keep going west for 30 years? He's been walking for 30 years before he finally makes it to the island of Alcatraz and finds people that are starting over by using a press to make books and keeping treasures like paintings and such things.The bible Eli has is given to Gary Oldman's character after Eli is shot by him. But when he gets back and gets the lock undone, he finds the bible is in Braille and his girl that is blind won't read it for him.Eli has memorized the entire bible and tells a man what it said as he writes it down and then Eli does.The other thing about this movie that made no sense what so ever was everyone made everyone else they came in contact with shows their hands didn't shake. because if your hands shook, it meant you were eating human flesh, but that storyline was never really given much thought and it was never explained.This movie was a two hour snore fest that left me feeling dirty because of the self righteous religious aspects being forced down my throat.All in all, this movie was a waste of time and I would give it less than one star if I could.

Most of them agree that the film got off to (at minimum) a good start, and in a lot of cases looked very promising..until it is revealed to them that the Book Eli carries is the Bible...no spoiler there really, you find out fairly soon in the movie and it doesn't hurt you to know it right off.Then, you'll find, all of these people on here begin bashing the daylights out of the movie in every aspect they can come up with. They slam the thing down like it was the worst trash they ever saw, they nitpick tiny details that they would easily let slide in any other movie. Why? Because the Bible has a power over them like no other book does...exactly the message conveyed through this movie.If this movie was about a man with special powers from outer space, nobody would care and they would praise the cinematography. If it was about a man following the orders of Zeus and the other gods who helped him along his journey, they'd nominate Denzel for every award they could think of. But the Bible...a movie about a man who has faith that God will protect him as he carries the Bible to some secret errand...it matters not how good the movie is, how good the acting is, this Book has a power over these people that they can never shake off. They must do everything in their power to make sure other people do not see this movie because the way they live their lives makes them an enemy to the book.You can ignore everything they say in their reviews after they find out the title of Eli's Book. It's all rubbish, this movie was phenomenal and became an instant favorite.Also I would just like to make a small comment on here to all the people talking about how the movie doesn't make any sense because Denzel is supposed to be a man of God, but he kills people in the film. You obviously have never read the Bible and don't actually know anything about it at all. Just stop with these comments, they are making you look like fools and invalidating all of your arguments. The Old Testament of the Bible is filled with wars and bloodshed. The Jews destroyed entire armies of nations that stood in their path to the land God promised to them. In some cases they were even punished for not killing enough of their enemies and letting some of them live.

In this Czech version of the genre people still miraculously have food, bullets and even petrol for their cars thirty years after the end of Western civilization.

He plays that silent hero character so well very much like he did in Man On Fire. Gary Oldman plays the bad guy equally as good. I would have liked to have seen a bit more character information. These can usually be achieved in only five or ten minutes of screen time. For example how did Washington survive, how did Oldman survive. What was the general state of the rest of the planet. Perhaps what started the war etc.The bad guys quickly realize that this book is all about power. He and Washington are living in a world where a generation have grown up without the ability to read or write. Murderous activity is a daily occurrence in peoples lives. Oldman wants that book because he knows he can use it and gain more power and control more people. He is right of course and it has been used in such a way. But he would be using it a political tool motivated by his lust for power and control over people. Of course Washington has other plans.If the world is still around in a thousand years or so we could be ready for a situation like this.

And if you have entered the recent Modern Warfare craze then you will enjoy shouting out the names of weapons with the rest of the audience. Though you will gasp in awe at the abilities of this man with heightened sensory perception you will laugh out loud at the cheesy apprentice he acquires. Though the legacy lives on after Eli himself is gone, it just isn't quite the same to see a young girl with an ipod and ray bans strolling down the street in what appear to be her late predecessors clothes. This movie loses points on inconsistency with times. It's post- apocalyptic America yet Eli's shirt stays sparkling clean with no soap and everyones sunglasses are shiny and new. Is Sunglass Hut the only survivor? So with awesome fight sequences and cheesy extras this movie gets a 7 out of 10.",The Book of Eli
646,povazan-jozef,Worth to see and think about WHY is world of these days heading to this EVIL like place...!,10,2 March 2014,"This movie is not a fairy tale, but the message of this epic is bigger then it seems to be. The world we live in right now could easy end up like this, because we do not care anymore where we came from ! Think. Live your day like it is the last one and leave your children knowledge that GOD is reason why we can live here.... Thank you for that. The book of books where all our history and future is described like nowhere else... Even though it might cruel to watch, the idea is spot on. I wish people could notice the inner lines apart from the shooting in it. But I guess without that action people would not even go to a theatre these day. Well played Danzel, and great scenario. A must see piece.",The Book of Eli
647,Dagon-6,Religious propaganda,2,6 June 2010,"Starting with the few good elements. The footage, the soundtrack and the scenery are all great. All made in a true post apocalyptic sense, which in another context could have made this to a more than fairly good movie. The over all statement tho, without religion we are all lost and little more than animals, really leaves a foul taste. Even this could have worked if you really could isolate it to a fictional movie, but as in so many movies from USA where god has any part what so ever, you just cant ignore that said statement.The feeling of religious propaganda ruins the experience, as would any other moral statement overcoming the experience of fiction. When art get tainted of religion, politics or any other non artistic idea too much, the magic is gone. That goes for music, movies, literature and art.As Richard Dawkins said, religion poisons everything.Last a few words on the acting. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure on the screen, the perfect villain. Denzel Washington is great as always, playing a believable character of faith. Surprisingly Mila Kunis worked out pretty good as well, having a bit hard to not see her as Jackie Burkheart, but she pulled it of decently. Ray Stevenson as a thug bare strong resemblance to his Rome character, but a thug is a thug, so why not. And of course Tom Waits, my personal hero, really should get bigger parts some day.",The Book of Eli
648,mered0,The Book of Eli,3,27 June 2010,"Bland and underwhelming at nearly every turn, this movie can be skipped, even as a rental. Even if you love Denzel and Gary Oldman, you probably will be bored one hour into watching Denzel wander around in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, protected by the power of his bible. Actually, that sentence almost makes it sound interesting. It isn't.On the upside, Mr. Washington can be seen kicking some serious @$$ throughout this movie. Which is still not redeeming enough a factor for you to see it, but it is cool.My suggestion? See almost any other movie set in a future dystopia; just off the top of my head some standouts are Serenity, Impostor, Deep Impact and Soldier, not to mention Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green and Children of Men (great movie). --mered.parnes@gmail.com",The Book of Eli
649,mosman-jason,"Religious, yes - see title.",7,28 March 2015,"I can relate to all the non-religious folks balking at a hard post-apocalyptic film with it as a centerpiece. But come on, it's right there in the title of the film. There are a few things to nit pick about regarding the plot, but that has been well covered. All in all, a solid entry into the genre as far as I'm concerned. Well acted, and well set. Denzel is, of course, on point, and Mila Kunis...well. Gary Oldman always has a way of making his characters seem exceptionally villainous. I wouldn't say I'm hard to please with regards to this genre, but I am definitely discerning, and appreciate well-made entries.This is a very solid 7/10 and I have to shake my head at the 1/10 reviewers that were too caught up in being anti-religious to give a nod to a good genre flick.",The Book of Eli
650,paugod-1,Another Apocalypse,4,22 January 2010,"This is a horrible movie which Denzel Washington or Gary Oldman simply cannot save. I simply do not know why I am giving it 4 stars other than Gary Oldman does his usual good job. The plot is simplistic to non-existent and just offers a vehicle for unremitting violence. I love both actors and thought the ""Man on Fire"" was wonderful albeit violent. Their the violence had a meaningful part of the story. Here it was just an excuse. All well. Denzel is almost always fun to watch. I am not familiar with the Hughes brothers but this does not lead to any sense of confidence that they can produce good movies. The special effects are bleak, consistent with the story and understated for the most part which I like. I also liked seeing Ray Stevenson in this film who I think is a talent.",The Book of Eli

653,movieman52,Great to be surprised,10,16 January 2010,"Going into this movie I expected just some great fight scenes and Fallout 3 scenery. This movie from beginning to end held my attention and kept me wondering what and why all the way until the end. I take pride in my ability to see foreshadowing, but this movie did it so well that I got shivers at the end. The fight scenes and battles were creatively done, and the acting allowed the story to continue flawlessly. Those who said that these actors would not fit right in this movie were wrong, every actor had a real character and executed the script perfectly. The production value was high, every scene I believed existed and not just a CGI drawn background with fake lighting.I recommend this movie to people who are use to the normal story, and have not been surprised in a movie in a long time. I recommend this movie to anyone who has played Fallout 3. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie, and escape Avatar's amazing, but huge shadow.",The Book of Eli
654,roger_powell,Eli is in Possession of a KING JAMES BIBLE???,5,30 March 2016,"Here is a tip. If your whole movie revolves around a KING JAMES BIBLE and you make such a point about it, then Denzel how about quoting from a KING JAMES BIBLE!!! All the Bible quotes were just stuff Denzel made up. It was NOT ""word for word"" KJV. No big deal if you are someone that doesn't care, but the whole PREMISE of the movie is he memorized the Bible ""WORD FOR WORD"". Funny, Denzel couldn't even memorize the few verses he spoke in the movie (word for word KJV...). Stuff like that drives me bonkers. It is the little stuff that makes a film. I know there are going to be some that say I am nit picking, but if you saw the film it is VERY IMPORTANT part of it. The WORD FOR WORD memorization of a KJB!! Just my 2 cent...",The Book of Eli
655,apmega,The 'oh-my-god' movie,3,7 December 2010,"The book of 'my god' (Hebrew for Eli) starts as just another apocalyptic trailer, but quickly evolves into a religious/epic mission tale that makes very little sense. For some reason, the evil needs the bible to rule the town. Why???? Have the writer never heard of minor religious sects like the Catholic church, where people would come every Sunday to hear the priest reading verses in Latin? As far as they new he could have been reading the Koran or a roman cook book. You really don't need the bible to establish a religion. You really don't need anything to keep the existing religion. That's why it also doesn't make sense that people somehow forgot Christianity. If anything, religious spirit only increases during crisis. Oh, yes, there is Eli, bullets and swords don't harm him as he protected by god. If only god could really protect his prophets like that, that would make bible stories rather different.",The Book of Eli
656,ruplingetrevor,Review,5,4 October 2016,"From the worn-out clothes the actors and actresses wear to the fact that they don't have money, instead a bartering system convinces the audience that the setting created in ""The Book of Eli"" is a poor and dystopian world. The movie is even mostly in black and white with limited color on the screen. However, the setting of the movie, although convincing and well done, is one of the few things the movie does right. The plot circles around Denzel Washington as Eli who has this book, and despite the fact that it's not clearly stated at all ever in the movie, it is a bible. He is walking, and multiple times throughout the movie different people ask him where's he going and he replies with the same one-word answer every time ""West"". The movie does a lousy job of giving the audience all the info to put the pieces of the puzzle together, the audience is forced to infer a couple things to understand the movie. Eli has a bible and it is highly coveted between him and Carnegie, so the audience must infer that this is the last bible left or one of few remaining, also Eli says he's headed West, the audience must infer he's delivering the bible to someone who needs it and can make good use out of it. The conflict in ""The Book of Eli"" doesn't start happening until 40-45 minutes into the movie, when Carnegie, played by Gary Oldeman, who wants the bible bad finds out that Eli has the book (bible). Carnegie and his men only rule one town, and he says that with the book him and his men would have lots of power and could rule more towns Then the rest of the movie is Eli not willing to give up the book to Carnegie, and Carnegie trying to get it from him by chasing him and trying to capture him. As stated earlier, this plot is slow, there aren't a whole lot of things that go on. In other action-type thrillers you could point to 6,7,8 or even more major events that happen in the movie. In ""The Book of Eli"" I would really only point to a couple main events.However, the acting in this movie can't be overlooked in particular from Denzel Washington as Eli. What he brings to the table as this character is one of a kind, the way he states his lines with such persistence and his body language of a confident, almost arrogant man. Then there's Gary Oldeman as Carnegie, who does an excellent job convincing us of the power of the book by sending lots of men and vehicles to go find Eli after he escapes his town and how he gets livid when his men return with a bunch of books, none of which is the one he is looking for.The one character that doesn't fit in this movie is Mila Kunis playing a girl named Solara. Solara lives with Carnegie in his town and is the reason Carnegie knows that Eli has the book he desires. She tags-a-long with Eli after he goes thru her town and is with him most of him journey West after he meets her, they talk loads about the book and its meaning, and Eli's journey West. Solara asks Eli lots of questions that helps the audience understand why he's traveling and why he has the book, but besides that she doesn't contribute to the plot at all. It seems like she's just in the movie because she's a familiar name and face that will get people to go see the movie. Overall, ""The Book of Eli"" was a boring movie with little to no action at all. This movie doesn't belong in the action/thriller movie genre because there just wasn't that many action scenes, as they were unrealistic. There's one scene where Eli walks upon some hijackers, who are going to steal what he has in his backpack, but instead Eli fights them all, killing all of them. Instead I would put it in the adventure category, as you're experiencing this whole new look on the world. Denzel Washington and Gary Oldeman do their best to bring the plot to life, but it's hard to rescue a boring and slow plot that ""The Book of Eli"" has.",The Book of Eli
657,mmetz105-1,Most disappointing film i've waited to see,2,16 January 2010,"I have to agree with one reviewer that stated the movie should have ended with the shot of Eli's eyes. Solara becoming the next warrior is ridiculous. The actors were fine but why doesn't Denzel Washington realize that most of the movie doesn't make sense. He uses his bow in the first scene and takes the arrow. After that we don't see where he carries his bow until he needs it later in the film. He has his backpack emptied a couple of times and no shells for his guns or bow is seen. After killing the 2 guys he didn't take his arrows. Eli then tells Solara to take down the bow and wind up the bowstring and he is carrying 1 arrow. In the next scene the bow and arrow are absent. In the opening scene the sky is ominous and an eerie green with particles falling from the sky. At the end of the movie Alcatraz has blue skies, clouds and grass. Am I expected to think it took Eli 30 years to walk across the US? Were those plastic wrapped twinkies that he was sharing with Solara? How would they have tasted 30 years later? Would someone explain how he got out of the locked room (I missed that part)? The house where they were in the shootout with Carnegie and his henchmen was completely full of bullet holes except where the old couple and Eli/Solara were standing. When Solara causes the vehicle she's in to crash how does Eli's blade (which was on the dashboard) get embedded completely to the hilt in Redridge's chest? Is the woman hijacker (with the grocery cart) the same as the second one nearer to the end of the movie? If so how does she get a new gang (since Eli has killed all of her first friends) and get further down the road towards Alcatraz for Solara and Eli to meet again? To have the same ambush using a woman crying with a grocery cart seems lazy to me. Now after dictating the entire bible (with a big hole in his gut/chest) the bible is printed, leather bound and gold leafed only to be placed on a shelf where no one is going to read it. I'm glad for those who enjoyed the movie. It just has too many questionable and unbelievable scenes which caused my frustration. And I wish people would stop comparing this sham of a movie to 'The Road'.",The Book of Eli

I now own the DVD and would recommend this movie as a ""MUST SEE"". My favorite quote from the movie is when Solara ask Eli what was it like before, Eli answers, ""People had more than they needed. We had no idea what was precious and what wasn't. We threw away things people kill each other for now."" I also enjoyed the post apocalyptic society which I find more realistic than the Jetsons.

Well, actually I asked my dad for $20 for ""groceries"" and used the movie for the movie instead. Having seen the movie, I am happy that I did not put up any of my own hard earned brix since it was that bad.On with the movie...there were many things that bothered me (here be spoilers): - the chairs did not recline and squeaked at the slightest movement - the speakers were waaaayyyy too loud. I mean it's not like people were in the theatre for anything other than seeing the movie. You already have their attention, why be so loud? - the guy behind me was a loud breather and kinda bugged me - I had picked out a seat where no one was sitting in front of me since I like putting my feet up. At the last second, some guy and his fugly girlfriend sat right in front of me. I hate keeping my feet on the ground. - None of the previews were interesting in the slightest.I would have given the Book of Eli only 1 star, but since the popcorn girl at the concession stand was pretty hot, the movie scored a bonus star.I did not see the prequel, ""Stuck on You,"" which might explain why I found the plot line so hard to follow.A.W.",The Book of Eli

I didn't think about it until later but it was about water and how they were all seeking it. Jesus said to the Samaritan woman Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again. But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life."" In the movie I believe that Eli was entrusted and sent by God to ensure His word would never be forgotten.

I've got to this movie accidentally, we just saw a poster and bought tickets at last minute, and haven't regret it. I must say that the overall atmosphere of deserted post-nuclear world was quite realistic. There were not much large scale decorations and graphics as you can usually see. It was closer to simple human life in details: all their struggling and fighting for water, the value of simple clothes and other general things.But there are some desert and steppes views too, lone houses, industrial ruins - all that looks pretty nice, especially with help of pale colors. I liked camera works too, especially on dynamic scenes. There were some fresh ideas without excess in graphics. There is no much camera ""shaking"" effects that you can see these days - that is what I personally liked. Denzel in the role of some kind of tired hero again, fighting for his idea. His performance was pretty well as always. But I would not say that this is his best role, comparing to the previous movies. The plot is stuffed with holes. I will not say much to spoil it, but overall idea feels pretty weak, and at some points it just doesn't make sense. There are some funny moments too. Generally, I don't think I will want to see this movie again.I'll give it 6 of 10.",The Book of Eli
