0,MartinHafer,A cute film about doggies....and a vet who wants to shoot the family pet in the head with exploding bullets!!!,4,19 October 2021,"""Beethoven"" is a film that easily illustrates that some folks in Hollywood just ain't right! After all, you have a family film with an adorable dog and cute kids....and a plot involving an evil vet (Dean Jones) who wants to earn money by testing out exploding bullets on their pet's head!!! What were they thinking?!?!?!Now, had they made it a cartoon (like the original ""101 Dalmatians""), then it would have seemed cartoony and unreal. But here, you take a beloved Disney actor and he really likes to make money torturing and murdering dogs...and for younger kids especially, this IS real. I am so thankful that I never showed this to my kids when they were little.... I would probably STILL be paying their psychotherapy bills if I had!!The bottom line is that if you have older kids, you can laugh off the plot and enjoy the film mostly for its puppy scenes at the beginning. But I would NEVER show it to younger kids (perhaps 7 and younger)...never. A clear case where the sequels couldn't help but be better...unless they, too, are about vivisection!!By the way. All this is a real shame as the cast was good and Beethoven lovable. But the script was just perplexing.",Beethoven
1,TheLittleSongbird,5.1??? As bad as all that? I don't think so!,7,10 October 2009,"I really liked Beethoven. Of course it isn't perfect, it does have a silly ending, the plot does have its low points and the script was a tad weak in places. However, it is a charming, fun and entertaining family movie. I myself am mortified at the 5.1 IMDb rating. I seriously don't think it is as bad as all that. It isn't perfect, but it has a sense of fun. The cinematography is lush and very beautifully handled, and the direction was secure. Charles Grodin is an enormously talented actor, and I enjoyed his performance here, and Dean Jones seems to be having fun too. The child actors are appealing, and the music is lovely. I think the real star is Beethoven himself, whoever trained that dog should be told he/she did a wonderful job. With Beethoven, the film is fun, charming and very entertaining. And there are many memorable moments here. All in all, a very pleasant family film, I recommend it. It is not perfect, but it is one of the better family films out there. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Beethoven
2,bkoganbing,Roll over you St.Bernard,6,3 March 2016,"A lot of critics didn't like Beethoven, but they must be Scrooges. How can you not love this big, ungainly, lovable beast? At least the movie going public certainly liked him.This St.Bernard puppy escapes from dognappers who take him and others from a pet shop. But even as a puppy he's resourceful and he wonders into a typical suburban home and is made welcome by the family and I mean the kids Christopher Castile, Nicholle Tom, and Sarah Rose Karr. Even their mom Bonnie Hunt kind of takes to him. What's a dad like Charles Grodin to do.But as Beethoven grows older his clumsiness causes a lot trouble. He does have an instinct for sorting out some bad people and dealing with them. The kids get it, the parents don't.Dean Jones is the villain here, a veterinarian who 'kills' his charges but secretly uses them for mad scientist like experimentation. Jones who was the all American hero in so many Disney films in the 60s and 70s looks like he's having a great old time as the Snidely Whiplash of scientists. He's got a pair of mooks for henchmen in Michael Tucci and Oliver Platt. In the old days they'd be played by Allen Jenkins and Edward Brophy.This movie has little kids and a big dog in it. Now only the most hard hearted could resist that.",Beethoven
3,SnoopyStyle,Marginally funny laughing at Grodin,6,27 July 2014,"Beethoven is a St Bernard puppy who escapes from a couple of dog thieves (Stanley Tucci, Oliver Platt). He follows George Newton (Charles Grodin) into his house. The kids fall in love with him and his wife Alice (Bonnie Hunt) wants to keep the puppy. It's a battle between George and Beethoven for the run of the house as he grows into a giant dog. He's trying to sell a business deal to Brad (David Duchovny) and Brie (Patricia Heaton). The dog is super smart and becomes the family's best friend. Evil vet Dr. Varnick (Dean Jones) has a sideline selling dogs for evil experiments while working with the dog thieves.It's the grumpiness of Charles Grodin that makes this marginally funny. He allows the audience to laugh at him and there are some pretty good slapstick fun. It's mostly good family fare with a really evil villain. The bad guys are a little too ridiculous. That takes a little bit away from an otherwise fun family movie.",Beethoven
4,Hitchcoc,Nothing New or Exciting,5,6 January 2017,"Sometimes movies are made to make a few bucks. This film was one of those. It includes cute kids, a cute (big) dog, Charles Grodin (who can do some great takes), and a villain. It has a series of contrived scenes of destruction and mayhem caused by a nearly 200 pound St. Bernard. Of course, the dog is really a destructive element in the family but ultimately you gotta love him. I have nothing against this kind of movie, but it follows about the same formula that a hundred other animal films follow. There is always some fly in the ointment that causes distress for the family, usually some evil old guy, and the troops must rally to defeat things, and Old Shep gets to sleep on the couch.",Beethoven
5,kosmasp,Dog alone,8,17 January 2021,"If something like Home Alone is considered a classic, so should this, yes? Ok you may not feel that way, I just put it out there. Yes this is predictable to more than just one degree. But it still is a lot of fun to watch. And a family film if there ever was one.You have to love animals/dogs/pets of course. Even if the dad here doesn't ... but you need that conflice. If you've seen more than movie in your life ... actually you understand that no matter what. It depends on how brazenly open a movie is about its intentions. This is quite open and it has villains that are comically in their stupidity. But this is not meant to be taken seriously ... this is supposed to entertain you ... and entertain you it does ... a lot! Good dog(s)!",Beethoven
6,lee_eisenberg,What must the composer think?,5,8 October 2006,"OK, when we were younger, we all liked it when movies portrayed families buying unusual pets who proceeded to trash everything. Back in the early 1800s, when Ludwig van Beethoven was writing and performing his great music, he probably never suspected that such a movie would carry his name.So, ""Beethoven"" is cute, if nothing else (actually, there really is nothing else). Aside from the main cast of Charles Grodin (when was the last time that he starred in something really good?), Bonnie Hunt and Dean Jones, there are also some people who got really famous within a few years: Stanley Tucci, Oliver Platt, David Duchovny (is Mulder investigating a conspiracy here?) and Patricia Heaton.",Beethoven
7,jboothmillard,Beethoven,7,8 July 2005,"I had seen this family favourite many times when I was younger, but growing up it had perhaps faded a little in my memory, I was very much looking to watching it all over again, written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, 101 Dalmatians), from director Brian Levant (The Flintstones, Jingle All the Way, Snow Dogs, Are We There Yet?). Basically a large number of puppies are stolen from a pet shop by thieves Harvey (Oliver Platt) and Vernon (Stanley Tucci), but a St. Bernard puppy manages to escape, and the following morning he sneaks into the house of the Newton family. Workaholic father George Newton (Charles Grodin) does not like dogs or the responsibility they bring, but he is convinced to keep the puppy by wife Alice (Bonnie Hunt) and their three children, youngest daughter Emily (Sarah Rose Karr), teenage daughter Ryce (Nicholle Tom) and son Ted (Christopher Castile). They find the name for their new St. Bernard dog from a portion of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, they therefore name him ""Beethoven"", and as time goes the dog grows up quickly with filthy habits, including drooling in places, eating heavily and sloshing water and mud everywhere, these negatives George focuses on, but the rest of the family embrace him. Beethoven may be trouble, but he also proves to be a good addition to the family as he helps the children overcome problems, including Ryce trying to talk to her crush, he scares off bullies picking on Ted, and he saves Emily from drowning in an irresponsible babysitter's swimming pool, George is becoming increasingly jealous of the affection Beethoven is receiving. An incident pushes George close to the edge, when Beethoven spoils a barbecue where George is almost unknowingly swindled by venture capitalists Brad (The X-Files's David Duchovny) and Brie (Patricia Heaton), and then the dog is taken for a routine medical check, Dr. Herman Varnick (Dean Jones) is secretly experimenting on animals, and Harvey and Vernon work for him, he wants to use the St. Bernard for an ammunition test. The next day Dr. Herman visits the Newtons pretending to follow up on the medical exam, with some fake blood and hitting Beethoven he convinces George he was attacked, only Emily saw that the attack was faked, fearing the family's safety George decides that he should take him to Varnick's office to be put down. George realises his own affection for Beethoven, and he knows that the family will hate him for having the dog put down, he is convinced to go with the family to find out what really happened, the doctor claims the dog has already been destroyed, but George notices his arm is not injured, before leaving George punches the doctor in the face. The family notice Varnick getting into a van and decide to follow him, they are lead to a warehouse where Beethoven and many other dogs are being held captive for experimentation, all the family end up inside the building and following various wacky incidents the bad guys are defeated, and all the dogs are freed from their cages, and in the end George finally accepts to liking Beethoven. Also starring Laurel Cronin as Devonia Peet and O-Lan Jones as Biker Woman. The human characters obviously help the story flow, Grodin being the frustrated father who is easily maddened and despises the dog for most of the film, Jones is a good sinister villain too, but the St. Bernard dog is the undoubted star, as he slobbers, eats and shakes his way into the hearts of the viewers, the majority of laughs come from his messy behaviour and the bad reactions from it, and there is the heart to the story as well with the dog bringing everyone together, all in all it is a funny and adorable family comedy. Very good!",Beethoven
8,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'Beethoven',7,1 December 2006,"This was almost like an old-fashioned type of nice movie ""the whole family will enjoy,"" as the stupid trailers used to always say. They aren't always right about that, but they are with this one.BAD NEWS - The ""bad news"" was (a) the silly ending, (b) some silly-stupid scenes earlier in which what you saw could never really happen, and (c) the three kids were annoying and bossy at times.GOOD NEWS - The ""good news"" is, of course, ""Beethoven,"" the lovable Saint Bernard who is a lot of fun to watch, especially with all his facial expressions. Also, it's a very entertaining story and there is absolutely nothing offensive, language-wise, in here.OVERALL - This was popular enough to spawn some sequels, none of which were close in caliber to this one. A good family film worth viewing, but mainly if you like big, lovable dogs.",Beethoven
9,studioAT,Average family fare,3,4 January 2020,"Despite a nice script co-written by Edmund Dantes (John Hughes' pen name) this film didn't do a lot for me, with the main appeal being seeing lots of famous actors looking a lot younger.Funny and sappy it may be, but there are still some lovely moments, and Charles Crodin is the best owner Beethoven ever had (sorry Judge Reinhold).",Beethoven
10,bevo-13678,Slobber,10,4 October 2020,One of my favourite dog movies of all time. Unlike Marley and me the dog lives,Beethoven
11,Hey_Sweden,Watching it does make me want to give my dogs a great big hug.,7,5 March 2015,"The title canine is an adorable Saint Bernard puppy who escapes when bumbling, idiotic criminals Harvey and Vernon (Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci) rob a pet store of their inventory. Beethoven makes his way into the house of the Newton family, immediately endearing himself to the children (Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile, Sarah Rose Karr) and wife / mother (Bonnie Hunt). The dad (Charles Grodin) is another story. He's not a real dog person, but reluctantly agrees to take on the pup as a pet. In your typical Hollywood fashion, havoc ensues, as the puppy grows into the destructive, messy (but also very loving) big brute that Grodin knew would result. The main plot concerns a thoroughly evil veterinarian (Dean Jones, in a hilarious performance) who collects dogs for test purposes.Watching this as an adult, you can see the flaws more clearly. Sometimes this is genuinely groan inducing, sometimes predictably silly. (You can tell that co-writer John Hughes, who uses his pseudonym of Edmond Dantes, was still getting Home Alone out of his system.) It's also easier to sympathize with George, even though Grodin brilliantly portrays him as a fastidious grump who craves order in his life. He actually makes his family get up at seven in the morning on Saturdays. Another word of advice is that this isn't totally harmless; some people, not just the younger children, might find certain scenes objectionable.Overall, though, ""Beethoven"" is passable family entertainment without being exceptional in any way. It may hit you where you live, however, if you're a dog person like this viewer. The perfectly cast Grodin is well supported by a cast that also includes TV stars David Duchovny and Patricia Heaton as a snotty yuppie couple, and familiar character players like O-Lan Jones, Nancy Fish, and Richard Portnow. A 10 year old Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his film debut as a schoolchild. It's particularly fun to see Jones playing the raspy voiced bad guy. Beethoven himself is quite engaging and sweet; some of the best scenes here have him making little journeys around town.Followed by a mind boggling SIX sequels.Seven out of 10.",Beethoven
12,Calicodreamin,Roll over Beethoven,7,1 August 2021,"As a personal childhood favorite, I am a big fan of Beethoven. The storyline is basic and fun and that dog could not be any cuter if he tried. The cast have great chemistry and acting is decent. All put together it makes for an easy and fun watch.",Beethoven
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,Cute little family film,4,2 April 2004,"As far as family films go, this is definatly a movie for them. If you are watching ""Beethoven"" on your own, you won't find anything special. Basic plot of there a villians trying to kidnap dogs to do illegal experimental tests. One of the puppies escape the villians. The puppy runs to a home with a dad who refuses to have pets. But when his children beg and beg, he lets them have the puppy they name ""Beethoven"". The main villian comes back to get the puppy once again. But will the father save the dog he hates in time? You'll have to find out. :-DNot my type of movie, but show it to your kids or family.4/10",Beethoven
14,MovieAddict2016,"Roll Over, Beethoven!",7,8 April 2003,"""Beethoven"" isn't a great family film, but it is surprisingly sweet and amusing. It's one of those films that is strangely attracting, though you can't really understand why. I think a lot has been built up on this film just because there were some sequel spin-offs that were more than horrible. (The 3rd and 4th sequels with Judge Reinhold were some of the worst attempts at comedy. Ever.) But the original was a nice, family-friendly film that accomplishes what it promised.Charles Grodin plays George Newton: Family man, businessman, NOT a doggy-man. But things change rapidly when a runaway Saint Bernard named Beethoven comes to the Newton residence. Newton's children immediately get attached to the animal, but Grodin's character doesn't exactly like the fact of a big ol' slobbering dog being around his house. So there are some gags as Grodin gets mad at Beethoven for certain things he does throughout the film. But then, evil animal vet Dean Jones tries to take Beethoven, and Newton decides to fight back for his family and bring the doggy back home.""Beethoven"" isn't anything very original, and it isn't anything very memorable, nor is it excellent quality gags. But it's a surprisingly pleasant and good-natured family film that doesn't resort to crude humor or language like other so-called ""family films"" out there.Ivan Reitman, who has brought us ""Ghostbusters,"" ""Kindergarten Cop,"" and ""Stripes"" co-produced this film. He's a talented director, even if he sometimes makes average films. The thing about his films are, that even when they're average they are still pretty funny and strangely watchable. And though I'm not sure what all a producer does on a film, I think he probably did a good job with something on this film. :)Charles Grodin is one of those actors that I've always liked because he seems very down-to-earth and regular. He is a subtle comedian that never goes OTT and doesn't come off like ANOTHER Jerry Lewis-Jim Carrey hybrid.
""Beethoven"" isn't anything great, but it's strangely likable and enjoyable. When compared to other so-called family films, it's pretty nice. It doesn't skimp on the gags (even if they're not very great) and it never turns stupid (like the 3rd and 4th film). All in all, ""Beethoven"" delivers what it promises, and it does it pretty nicely.3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",Beethoven
15,cricketbat,Definitely dated and I remember it being funnier,7,11 October 2018,"I watched Beethoven many times when I was younger, and it's funny how familiar it still is to me as an adult. However, this movie is definitely dated and I remember it being funnier. My kids liked it, though, so it seems that this simple, silly movie still hits the mark for its target demographic.",Beethoven
16,lesleyharris30,"A Basic Family Film that offers Little for Adults,",5,23 August 2015,"Beethoven is a very mediocre film with an extremely basic storyline that lacks originality and an average cast. It's reasonably enjoyable, Beethoven is certainly a very lovable dog, and having him in the title role definitely helps the film, the dogs are of course the main thing that makes this watchable. My biggest issue with this movie is that there is absolutely no bit of humour for adults to laugh at, all of the comedy is aimed at children, I felt Charles Grodin's character had great potential to make the older audience chuckle, but sadly even his lines and antics were all just to make the kids giggle. I think the films villain is terrible, he isn't isn't properly introduced until about twenty minutes before the movie ends and we are never made fully clear of his motives, he was certainly borrowing a lot of traits from Cruella De Vil, it was also a very unusual move to make a veterinarian the bad guy and I found it to be somewhat offensive towards people who are saving animals lives on a daily basis, they should have just made him a regular dog thief. Little laughs for an older audience and a straight forward story that you barely need to follow, kids will certainly enjoy it, but I couldn't possibly recommend Beethoven. An family adopts a lovable puppy that grows into a large St Bernard. Best Performance: Charles Grodin Worst Performance: Dean Jones",Beethoven
17,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,17 April 2015,"BeethovenIf owning a dog is such a huge responsibility, why does every homeless person have one?Thankfully, the tentative dog owners in this family-comedy are also homeowners.Fleeing from two inept thieves (Oliver Platt, Stanley Tucci) during a pet store robbery, an ill- behaved St. Bernard sneaks into the Newton home, where everyone (Bonnie Hunt, Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile, Sarah Rose Karr) except the grouchy patriarch, George (Charles Grodin), welcomes him.Christensen Beethoven, the accident-prone puppy helps the Newton kids with their adolescent issues while aggravating George with excessive drool and damage to his property. Meanwhile, an unethical vet (Dean Jones) schemes to dognap Beethoven for one of his twisted experiments.Despite a derivative script by John Hughes, Beethoven still manages to be an enjoyable but flawed feature, saved only by Grodin and the dog's interactions.Plus, drivers are less likely to run you over if you're walking with a dog.Yellow Light",Beethoven
18,John6Daniels,Another mutt movie,6,11 September 2020,Despite being a movie about an ugly ol mutt it was pretty good back in the day.A Good family film great for the 90s. Rotten in 2020.,Beethoven
19,pmtelefon,A minor classic,9,23 October 2021,"I first saw ""Beethoven"" in the theater (Fresh Meadows, NY). I've seen it quite a few times since. It's a great movie.

20,lisafordeay,Cute dog movie starring the late Charlie Grodin,7,16 July 2021,"Bethoven is a 1992 family comedy directed by Brian Levant and stars Charlie Grodin,Dean Jones,Bonnie Hunt, David Duchovy,Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt. A St Bernard pup is stolen by two dognappers (Platt and Tucci) and escapes. He stumbles on a house owned by the Newton Family who rear the pup until he turns into a fully grown St Bernard. Of course an evil vet played by Dean Jones wants the dog back as his working for the two dognappers.Will George(Grodin) get Beethoven back?Overall I really enjoyed this film mainly cause I'm a dog lover and have been all my life. Whoever gave this film a 5.4 out of 10 must really hate dogs in general.",Beethoven
21,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Cute movie,9,17 November 2005,"BEETHOVEN, in my opinion, is a cute movie. I thought that George (Charles Grodin) was a little cold-hearted, but Alice (Bonnie Hunt) and the children (Sarah Rose Karr, Christopher Castile, Nicholle Tom) were very nice people. Beethoven was a sweet dog, though. He even saved the Newtons in times of trouble. Way to go, Beethoven! Dr. Varnick (Dean Jones) was a little scary to me, but I thought he gave a smashing performance. I thought that Emily (Sarah Rose Karr), Ted (Christopher Castile), and Ryce (Nicholle Tom) looked nice in the clothing they wore when they served George his breakfast. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to all you dog lovers or Charles Grodin fans who have not seen it.",Beethoven
22,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Corny but not as bad as I expected,4,18 November 2014,"This movie has various elements and themes that are not only annoying and pushed way too far, but also not the best acting. It's a very melodramatic movie, dose have some crude humor and mild swearing, and isn't really appropriate for its intended audience.Flaw 1: The little girl, Emily (played by Sarah Rose Carr), was almost as much of a spoiled little brat as Drew Barrymore or the Olsen Twins! She's one of those, ""aw, so sweet cute little kid"" characters, fake and makes you want to run off and puke in a bush somewhere. She says various annoying lines in the film, such as yelling ""dog killer!"" at her father for supposedly putting the dog down because it was considered a threat. One of the most annoying characters in a movie I've ever seen! Flaw 2: It's one of those ""dogs are a member of your family"" movies... DOGS ARE NOT PEOPLE! I can't stress this enough! Lately there's been this trend with fat women who call their dogs their ""fur-children"" and treat them like people... ugh. Dogs are dogs. I'm not saying it's right to be cruel to dogs but treating them like humans, especially considering the various activities dogs do every day, is just messed up.Flaw 3: The anti-animal testing stuff could seriously scare kids. The vet, played by Stanley Tucci, is selling his patients to animal testing laboratories. I don't honestly care about animal testing and kids won't either, but if you ever have to take a family pet to the vet, and your kids have seen this movie, you'll have to burden yourself with explaining to them that vets are not monsters who sell pets to vivisection projects.Flaw 4: The eyes on the dog look fake, is the dog a puppet at some parts? There are various others, I just figured I should list off the worst. To be fair, Beethoven had one or two funny moments, okay soundtrack and an original plot. But it's so damned corny, with the picture-perfect, pastel family in the suburbs. Beethoven was probably the worst movie off 1992 - actually Ferngully: the Last Rainforest was - but there are worse things you could be watching, like The Hunger Games or An Inconvenient Truth.",Beethoven
23,IonicBreezeMachine,A servicable family film that does its job.,6,2 April 2021,"After a St. Bernard puppy is abducted from a pet shop by animal abductors, the puppy escapes and finds its way to the home of the Newton family. Mother Alice (Bonnie Hunt) and children Emily(Sarah Rose Karr), Ted (Christopher Castile), and Ryce (Nicholle Tom) all immediately take to the puppy whom they name Beethoven, however father George Newton (Charles Grodin) is less enthused by the idea. While Beethoven enjoys the comforts of living with the Newtons, the animal abduction ring, run by sinister vet/black market animal tester Dr. Herman Varnick (Dean Jones) sets his sights on Beethoven as a test candidate for testing a new type of ammunition.Released in 1992 to rather mediocre reviews but very healthy box office, Beethoven certainly fits well within the oeuvre of 1990s post Home Alone/Uncle Buck family comedies that ended up defining John Hughes career in the decade. While Beethoven is still a very early revisit of Hughes to the successful formula, it is quite noticeable that Hughes is setting the foundation for common place tropes that would reappear in further films. With that said, the movie is actually quite charming thanks to a well trained dog serving as the titular character, and Amy Holden Jones balances out the Hughes' tropes with some charm and edge that help the film to keep from going overboard with formula.The best scenes in Beethoven are just watching the dog interact with people. The filmmakers do a pretty decent job of given Beethoven a personality as the gentle giant who's full of energy and intelligence but lacking in self awareness or grace in his movements. The scenes where Beethoven casually escapes his backyard enclosure are quite fun and there's a nice small town/Disney type vibe as he meets the Newton children around town and helps them deal with bullies, getting the attention of crushes, or in one instance engaging in a Lassie type rescue during a close call. The scenes with Beethoven frolicking around with the family or various people in town (firefighters, small business owners, etc.) are charming and make the film a pleasant enough sit.The actors are perfectly servicable. Charles Grodin is perfectly fine playing an overworked, overstressed, father (even if at points it feels like he's doing a Steve Martin impression), and the rest of the family is perfectly fine as well. Some performances unfortunately go a bit too broad for my taste, such as Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt playing a rehash of the comedic crook duo a la Horace and Jasper or Harry and Marv, or David Duchovny and Patricia Heaton playing a pair of snobbish DINK(Dual Income No Kids) who are basically insidious versions of Todd and Margo from Christmas Vacation. The real standout in the human performances is Dean Jones who washes away any history of light hearted Disney comedies and away and gives a fittingly sinister and slimey performance that honestly wouldn't be out of place in a straight thriller. It's a terrific villain performance and allows Jones to lift a bit more weight than he usually is allowed and he does so quite well.The movie in terms of the movie itself it's perfectly fine. It doesn't reach the gold standards of Disney animal movies like '67's That Darn Cat or either of The Incredible Journey movies, but it also doesn't embarrass itself as seen in cases like C. H. O. M. P. S. or Bingo. Beethoven rests comfortably around the level of a Benji movie but with a bigger budget and more polish. The direction by Brian Levant is very exaggerated and lacking in subtlety or restraint, but unlike his other movies he tries to resist the temptation to go full cartoon logic (save for one scene with Duchonvy and Heaton). The movie is very much a collection of character based plots in the first half loosely connected with the second half being more based around the animal abduction ring. There's not much in the way of surprises, but it's all done well enough.Beethoven is an above average family film anchored by a good performance from its central dog. The movie does a good job of making Beethoven feel like a character, and while the script is certainly formula its at least well done formula that moves at a good pace and doesn't linger on any point long enough to drag. Beethoven is the kind of movie you can watch with your kids and they'll enjoy it while you'll smile once every so often. It won't stick with you, but as family films of this type go it's one of the better ones.",Beethoven
24,Beta_Gallinger,"A lovable mutt, but pretty much a mediocre animal movie",5,29 March 2011,"I was less than six years old when this successful family movie came out, and clearly remember knowing that there was a movie about a dog named Beethoven around this time. I even had the feeling I had seen this film, or at least saw some of it, back in the day, but I guess I was wrong. 1992's ""Beethoven"", which was followed by ""Beethoven's 2nd"" in 1993 and several direct-to-video sequels in the 2000's, was only brought back to my attention recently, when I learned that it was co-written by John Hughes, as I have seen a whole bunch of movies from him. When I finally watched this one after nearly two decades, none of it seemed to ring a bell, so I am now convinced I had never seen any of it before. I knew this wouldn't be an amazing film, but maybe it would still be above average to me. However, even that didn't happen.One night, two criminals break into a pet shop, kidnap all the puppies, and take them away in a truck! The puppies soon manage to get out of their cages and escape from the truck while it is in motion, and one of these puppies is a St. Bernard, who hides in a garbage can in a suburban neighbourhood for the rest of the night. Early the following morning, this puppy sneaks into one of the houses in this neighbourhood, which happens to be the house of the Newton family, and this happens while most of the family members are just getting up. The father of this family, George, does not want this St. Bernard puppy to stay here, but his wife, Alice, and children do, so he reluctantly decides to keep the dog until they can find his owner, not realizing that this animal doesn't have one. When Emily, the youngest child in the family, plays a piece by Ludwig van Beethoven, the dog barks along, so it is decided that the dog's name will be Beethoven. Beethoven grows up living with the Newtons, and makes George miserable but the rest of the family happy. Meanwhile, Harvey and Vernon, the two criminals who kidnapped Beethoven from the pet shop, are still on the loose! Herman Varnick, the veterinarian the Newtons take their dog to, is secretly collecting dogs for cruel animal experimentation, and Harvey and Vernon are working as his two henchmen! The main dog in this movie is a cute and lovable mutt, but the human characters generally aren't so outstanding. I especially didn't care much for the irritable father of the Newton family, played by Charles Grodin. He really gets unlikable as he gets so concerned about his business and says some foolish things. Ryce's (the oldest sister) crush on a boy at her school named Mark, and her attempts to get him to notice her (which Beethoven helps her with) are cheesy aspects of the story. It's also not very pleasant watching Ted, the middle son, facing several bullies at school. As a comedy, there are sporadic laughs, with some of the trouble Beethoven causes for George, certain scenes featuring the two kidnappers, Ted thinking he's scaring off the bullies with his fists when it's actually Beethoven scaring them off from behind Ted, etc., but these generally aren't very big laughs, and there aren't enough of them. There are also some completely failed attempts to be funny, such as the ""Biker Woman"" near the beginning and the part with the irresponsible and annoying babysitter. I also usually found the plot boring, though there certainly are some tense moments towards the end.This early 90's animal movie does have its admirers, but I still can't say I liked it, and since I found it to be so mediocre, I don't intend to watch ""Beethoven's 2nd"", the theatrically released sequel which came out the year after this first installment in the franchise, and certainly don't intend to watch any of the direct-to-video sequels, either, all of which were made years after the two theatrically released films and were likely just done for money. None of them appear to be popular at all, and I'm sure many fans of this original ""Beethoven"" movie hate them, or haven't even seen them and don't see any point in doing so. These films are probably a lot like the usually lacklustre direct-to-video sequels to Disney animated features, and I've seen a lot of those. Anyway, this 1992 film that started the franchise and is significantly more popular than all the other installments is probably very entertaining for many kids and their parents, and probably best for that type of audience. Certain others might like it, but that's probably less likely.",Beethoven
25,Atreyu_II,Sympathetic family movie,7,7 January 2009,"For those who have no idea what this movie is about, they may think this is a movie about the famous classical music artist. Well, it has absolutely nothing to do with it. ""Beethoven"" is not even a biographical or a musical, it's a family movie about a St. Bernard named Beethoven after a portion of Ludwig van Beethoven's ""Fifth Symphony"" is played and the puppy barks at the same time, as if he was telling how he wishes to be named.Anyway, generally speaking, this is a sympathetic family movie. Nothing super or tremendous, but a simple and enjoyable movie. Of course, the lovable St. Bernard is the main star and adds a lot to the movie. And anyone who loves dogs has got to love this gentle giant, if not the movie.I am a dog lover and St. Bernards are one of my favorite dog breeds. They're huge, beautiful, affectionate and sweet dogs, although they drool at lot!The story focus not only on our fluffy friend, but also on the Newton family: George (the father), Alice (the mother), Ryce (the oldest daughter), Ted (the middle son) and Emily (the youngest daughter). They're a nice family, but George isn't minimally interested in the dog, unlike the rest of the family (although much later in the film he has a change of heart and helps saving the day). Ryce... what kind of name is that? I hope it's not related to rice (the food). Emily is a lovely little girl and the cutest of the Newtons. Ryce, despite being so thin, is pretty in this film and I don't think she is a tomboy.All the actors who play the Newton family are good in their roles: Charles Grodin, Bonnie Hunt, Nicholle Tom, Cristopher Castile and Sarah Rose Karr. And, of course, the dog that plays Beethoven is also a great ""actor"".One word about Charles Grodin: although he was in his late 50's when the movie was made, he looked as if he was about 35. Amazing how someone that age can look so young.In the cast there is also an actor who is familiar from some old live-action Disney films: Dean Jones. Here, he portrays a villain - the wicked veterinarian Dr. Varnick, owner of a Porsche 911. His role is small, nevertheless he's in great shape. Actually, his role is meant to be minor. I don't think it would be necessary to make his role bigger.",Beethoven
26,grahamsj3,Pretty decent,6,13 February 2004,"There are enough laughs to keep you chuckling and just enough suspense to keep you interested. This has all elements and works pretty well. Beethoven, a St. Bernard, upsets an entire family's lives from the day they acquire him as a puppy. The father, George Newton, played by Charles Grodin, can think of nothing other than getting rid of the dog. Then, the suspense kicks in when the evil vet, played by Dean Jones (YES! Dean Jones is a bad guy!!) grabs Beethoven to use in (fatal) experiments. The only one who can save Beethoven is the man who hates him - George Newton. A good film that I believe deserves better than some reviewers have given it.",Beethoven
27,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,10,31 March 2014,"Classic '90s family comedy that is a little bit cookie-cutter, but too charming to pry too much. The Newtons, an upper-middle class Californian family, take in a stray St. Bernard puppy that escaped kidnapping for cruel experimentation. Conflict involves the gentle-giant dog winning the heart of the family's strict and materialistic father (played terrifically by Grodin), topped with staying a step ahead of the evil vet (played by a clean-cut Dean Jones) who is trying to track down his escaped canine. Platt and Tucci are funny as Jones' henchmen, but their effeminacy doesn't seem fitting—would have worked better if maybe they paid a little more homage to Jasper and Horace Badun from ONE HUNRED AND ONE DALMATIONS. Bonnie Hunt couples great with Grodin, but is perhaps slightly underused. All three children are intolerable. Still enjoyable despite its flaws; its replay value can be attributed to Grodin and Dean's performances, plus the story's pet-is-a-member-of-the-family philosophy.*** (out of four)",Beethoven
28,TheOtherFool,Gotta feel sorry for the guy,3,30 May 2004,"George Newton (Charles Grodin) is a loving husband and father. He works his ass of for his kids and has nothing but love for his wife, getting up early every day for them. So what do they do in return? They yell at him, treat him wrongly and when he tries to get rid of their dog for completely legitimate reasons, the kids think he's a dog-killer and his wife complains 'all the joy is left from the house'. If anything, 'Beethoven' is the story of a man abused and mistreaten. There, I said it.Let's begin with the beginning though. 'Beethoven' is a dog (in case you didn't know yet), wandering the streets of some suburban clean cut picked fenced community, where life is nice and rich and even the bullies have their certain charm. Beethoven winds up in the (big) house of the Newtons, where the three kids (puberty-girl Ryce, nerdy boy Ted and sweet young Emily) embrace him with all they've got, as probably, there isn't any 'joy' in the family at that time. What better way to bring it than a dog!But Beethoven isn't just fun, as he pies all over the place, drewls on the food and drags mud all over the expensive carpets. You guessed who can clean up the mess: it's old daddyo George, as the spoilt kids only want to have fun with the animal. So we see him as a match-maker between Ryce and the boy she likes, as Ted's saviour against bullies and as hero of little Emily, who almost drowned when not attended by her baby-sitter.George, as I said, is busy with his work. He's got a company of his own (something to do with air-refresheners in cars, or whatever), who is on the brink of a crucial deal which will expand his business. But he is being conned. Enter a crucial scene: nobody knows he's being conned by his two business partners, except 'Beethoven' (yes people, this dog knows how to read those little words at the bottom of a contract). So he takes the two evil genuises for a ride, basicly ruining the deal. Now, WE know Beethoven did well, but as far as George, his wife or the kids are concerned, 'Beethoven' just cost them a serious amound of dollars. But, never mind, as wife and mother Alice says 'I never liked those two anyway'. If that would've been her spirit over all those years, the family probably would've lived in some trailerpark somewhere, without a pot to pie in and regulars on the 'Jerry Springer' show. But as long as we, the audience, know that Beethoven really saved the family, we're supposed to be OK with it. Well, for one, I'm not!There's another story in here involving 'mean guys', as Beethoven's vet thinks he will be perfect for some sick experiment involving exploding bullets, so the vet pretends he was attacked by Beethoven, so that he can bring him to his secret lab. The same problem here occurs as in the previous scene: WE know the vet is mean. WE know Beethoven meant well. But the family DOESN'T. So when the kids, as I mentioned before, say dad is a dog-killer and mom thinks all the joy has just left their lives (take THAT, you mean father!), that is just cruel and unjust. As for all THEY know, 'Beethoven' is a pretentious danger for the kids. In particular the mom should know better!Now, you'll probably say it's a kids movie and maybe you're right, but this movie is sending all the wrong messages into the world, and should be slammed for it. Only the decent acting by Grodin (who was 57 when this was made... he looks more like 37!) and some sweet puppies make it worth the 3/10 I gave it.",Beethoven

30,Min111,The dog's name is Beethoven,6,21 July 2017,"That's the dog's name - Beethoven. It's a good movie to watch if you're a fan or like dogs. It's a movie made for the family. A family movie. Beethoven was a puppy when the Newton family decided to keep him. The puppy looks so adorable by the way. It has now grown into a full adult. The father, George Newton, doesn't like dogs, and doesn't want anything to do with it, but the rest of his family members persuade him to keep the dog. Beethoven now happens to be a part of the Newton family. Beethoven is a St. Bernard dog by the way. What made the movie so interesting to see were the bad guys. There were three of them. They were a bunch of bad men. They were nothing except crooks. It's a movie where you're supporting the Newton family to stop them. Beethoven has to take them on as well as to protect the Newton family. The movie also has some funny moments. It's suppose to be a comedy movie, but it's more of a family movie than anything else. I like how the movie ends. The movie also runs for a short time, so that's good to see. It's something you can enjoy watching very quickly. I like that dog Beethoven. I think it's all cuddly and adorable. I like to have a smart dog like that in the house. There's also a sequel called Beethoven's 2nd or Beethoven 2. No need to worry. The cast is exactly the same like the first one. Be sure to check it out.",Beethoven
31,jhaggardjr,Hilarious family fun,8,13 November 2000,"I'm a dog lover. I am currently the owner of a 6-year-old yellow lab/beagle mix and a 3-year-old black lab. But I don't know if I could handle a St. Bernard. One thing I do know, I couldn't possibly handle a St. Bernard that wrecks the house up and slobbers all over the place. But we enjoy it when it happens in a movie, and that's precisely what the St. Bernard does in ""Beethoven"". This is a often very funny comedy that's perfect for the whole family. Charles Grodin, who I never thought of as a comic actor, gets to be hysterically funny in ""Beethoven"" as George Newton, a successful creator of air fresheners who has a wife and three kids. One day a St. Bernard puppy wanders into the Newton household and the kids quickly start to get attached to the pup. Grodin doesn't want the pup, but the kids talk him into keeping the canine. It doesn't take long for the big pup to grow to enormous proportions. ""Beethoven"" at times is pure nonsense to be sure but it's just too enjoyable to dislike. The dog is wonderful, and there are many good performances throughout. In addition to Grodin, there's Bonnie Hunt, who's delightful as Grodin's wife Alice; Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile, and Sarah Rose Karr as their three kids; Disney veteran Dean Jones in a surprise villainous role as Dr. Varnick, the evil veterinarian; Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci as dognappers working for Jones; and (before becoming TV stars) David Duchovny (""The X-Files"") and Patricia Heaton (""Everybody Loves Raymond"") as a business-like couple who secretly plan to take over Grodin's air freshener business, until Beethoven gives them the ride of their lives (literally). Kids will love this if they can get by the little amount of comic violence and animal abuse. The violence is slight so I don't think real little kids will get scared. Although the movie does lose a few points for the violence. And a few scenes are a bit ridiculous. Nevertheless, ""Beethoven"" is alot of fun for young and old alike. A must-see if your a dog lover like me. *** (out of four)",Beethoven

In this popular family comedy from 1992 Grodin plays a beleaguered dad who reluctantly lets his kids keep the lost puppy they've adopted. The dog quickly grows into the huge and clever hound named Beethoven. In a marked departure from his nice-guy roles in several Disney comedies from the 1960s and '70s, Dean Jones plays the villainous veterinarian who abducts Beethoven to be a subject in his sadistic animal experiments. The kidnapping sets the stage for a raucous rescue and, of course, an inevitable sequel.

Then an evil vet comes and frames Beethoven for being aggressive and tells the family to destroy him. The father tries to but the vet doesn't destroy him at all.

39,Snowgo,An Evil Comedy,3,29 January 2015,"This movie is an otherwise delightful comedy, but its major theme is the abduction of puppies for ""scientific"" experimentation. This is not suitable material for children to see.A movie should not start out with me wanting to put a bullet through someone's brain: Dean Jones as Dr. Varnick. Beethoven reminds me of something Stephen King would do: Candy coat something gruesome like he did with Christine or The Green Mile. Why did John Hughes find it necessary to subject us to animal experimentation and probably torture, and wrap it in the disguise of a comedy? Why?Both he and Amy Holden Jones have written in pictures that I have liked and that I deem respectable; Breakfast Club, Mystic Pizza, so I have no idea where they were coming from by adding this warped, malevolent current into Beethoven.Certainly the picture could have done without it and only suffered from its inclusion. It would have been easy to like Beethoven. Had it been a simple comedy with some adventure, I probably would have given it a 7 or an 8. It's a shame that someone with immature, Satanic sentiments had to spoil the picture.",Beethoven

Music by Randy Edelman, he of the worthy GETTYSBURG score of a year later.Beethoven dominates the screen, so much so that you don't really get to know the human characters very well, and one feels somewhat disconnected from them. Surprising to see Dean Jones playing a bad guy.For the most part, this is a gentle, inoffensive story. It got a little gross sometimes with Beethoven slobbering all over everything and urinating in George's briefcase, but I guess that's just kid humor of the nineties. I still don't know why they had to name him Beethoven. Just because he barked when she played BEETHOVEN'S FIFTH on the piano? Maybe he was trying to tell her something.

43,jjgooner,Unfunny but warm family film,6,10 July 2013,"Beethoven**1/2 (out of 4)87 mins / UCast: Charles Grodin, Bonnie Hunt, Dean Jones, Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile, Sarah Rose Karr, Oliver Platt, Stanley Tucci, David Duchovny, Patricia Heaton, Joseph Gordon- LevittDirector: Brian LevantPlot: A family adopt a big St Bernard dog only for it to cause complete havoc for the dad but endless fun for the kids. JJ's Verdict: Beethoven is a warm, big-hearted film for all the family but as a comedy fails to actually hit some funny moments – unless you find a massive dog running round a house and weeing everywhere funny.It centres on a young family led by a grumpy Charles Grodin, which also includes caring mother Bonnie Hunt, and dog-loving children Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile and Sarah Rose Karr. When a small puppy appears in their house unattended, the family decides to adopt it (after some arguing) and name it Beethoven (again, after some arguing.) What they don't realise is that the dog will grow into a huge slobbering St Bernard who will steal everyone's food, wee all over the house and cause depression for Charles Grodin's George Newton. However lovable the dog is, you can't help but despair as the dog runs round causing havoc to people's lives and destroying their home. The dog is completely unrealistic, as it seems more intelligent than any human being. There is however, a nice montage of the dog causing mess to the backdrop of 'Roll Over Beethoven', which uses good camera-work from the dog's perspective. Charles Grodin puts in a fine portrayal of a strained father trying to please his family and the child actors are surprisingly good. Dean Jones, who plays Herman Varnick, an evil vet who wants to kill Beethoven, is a good cast but plays his villainous character very over the top.The constant slapstick humour and violence can be annoying, and the dog just leaves dreadful destruction in its path, but Beethoven is a warm family film with strong themes on looking at the bigger picture and doing the right thing.",Beethoven
44,CMUltra,"Fun, with a GREAT dog!",7,8 November 2005,"We are dog lovers and had been meaning to watch some of the Beethoven series for quite a while. We found a DVD collection of all five at a good price so we snapped it up and sat down for the first installment.We honestly didn't know what to expect so, to minimize our risk of disappointment, decided that we were only watching to enjoy the St. Bernard. The movie turned out to be a very pleasant surprise, easily exceeding those expectations.Beethoven is the star, as he should be. The human cast, however, perform wonderfully in providing the light framework required to string Beethoven's scenes together. Charles Grodin especially shines as the dad who is, at first, not exactly enthused about getting a dog. Much less a monster dog who only drools and sheds and eats.So, if you enjoy dogs and light-hearted fun, Beethoven won't disappoint. There are no Machiavellian plots or cruel content. The family is wonderfully good, the villains are comically bad and the suspense of their threat is enjoyable because you know, Beethoven's gonna win in the end.Overall, very charming with a good, wholesome sense of humor. 6.5 out of 10.",Beethoven

He reluctantly agrees, but doesn't exactly forge a friendship with the growing St. Bernard. Meanwhile, Beethoven does his best to endear himself to the rest of the family, helping big sister Ryce attract the attention of a boy that she likes, scaring off bullies that harass brother Ted, rescuing little sister Emily from a swimming pool and giving a couple of sleazy con artists ""the ride they deserve"". After Beethoven misbehaves one too many times, Dad takes him to a veterinarian who, unbeknownst to him, is actually an evil scientist who uses dogs for lethal lab experiments. This doctor wants very much to get his hands on Beethoven. When he pays a house call to the Newtons, he stages an incident where, after tearing his clothes and smearing red dye all over himself, he provokes the dog so it looks like he is being attacked. This causes Dad to waste no time taking Beethoven to the doctor's office to be put to sleep. His wife and kids, suspecting the doctor is lying, go to his office, where Dad finally discovers the doctor's true activities.

Although i am not a dog person i love Beethoven who is a lovable dog who has nothing but love for his family though the father of the family George Newton played buy Charles Grodin for some reason hates him, sure he made a mess every where but i guess all dogs can be a hand fall. In the movie he helps one of the kids to meet this boy who she's in love with, then he saves one of the kids from bullies, then he saves the sweet little girl from drowning, and at the end he and his family save other dogs from an evil vet. If you ask me he is the perfect pet.I definitely give this one 10/10 basically because it was fun all the way through and as the movie went on it just got better and better. a simply great movie.",Beethoven

65,alancitolee,I agree,9,13 July 2021,I agree with you Michael d Murrell.Saw it first time with my nieces and nephew. Great family film.,Beethoven
66,michael-d-murrell,Brilliant Family Film,10,5 May 2014,"I do not how the hell one of my all time childhood favourite films is rated 5 but I can tell you this film is one of the greatest family films of all time even watching it again all these years later. Great film about family love, awesomeness and man's best friend. I made an IMDb account just so I could make a review to defend this film as I was shocked to see it had such a low rating when in reality this film is an all time classic. Understanding the bond between man and animal really helps you tie into the emotional connection the family has with the dog.10/10 as a family film / comedy. Will be watching with my kids for sure and you should too.",Beethoven
67,lordvader-8,Filmmakers promote Sex,9,14 April 2009,"The movie overall is an enjoyable one with a good family message. However for some reason the filmmakers decided to throw in sex for some reason. I caught this in the theater and thought that perhaps it would be pulled out when it went to video. It wasn't however. When the father is going to get rid of the dog and so the kids get up very early - at 6:00 AM according to the bedside alarm clock - to give him a bath. Pause when it shows his alarm clock. This clock is featured center in the shot as focus. On one side however is a money clip with a wad of cash and on the other side is a peeled roll candy package. The name is not one we recognize as candy, but rather it is sitting with the letters upside down and spell SEX.",Beethoven
68,saruna1,Roll Over Beethoven!,9,29 May 2006,"This is a great little movie - full of slapstick laughs and some real weepy moments.I'm surprised it hasn't got a better overall rating here: it's one of those movies I saw many years ago at the cinema and when it recently came on television, some 13 years later, it had been so memorable, I recalled every little thing about it.A real family treat, particularly for dog lovers. The plot is simple enough for younger children to follow and enjoy and the laughs are good enough to keep the parents entertained.X-Files fans should keep their eyes open for David Duchovny!",Beethoven
69,aazamaraeva,One of the best family movie!,10,21 July 2020,"It's a really good, kind , wise family movie. The cast is perfect, the dog is adorable! Nowadays its hard to find something as warm and bright as this one.From this movie I've learned that parents should trust their children more. Not all doctors are kind and want to help you. There are a lot of people who don't care about your feelings, your children they just want to make a profit. That the family is the most important thing!I've been watching this movie since I was a little girl and I would love to watch it with my kids.",Beethoven
70,rasta17-445-275457,Great family movie ever!!!,10,19 January 2021,This one is the best example of a family movie. I don't understand why the rating is so low. The dog hunters/haters decreased the rating. Please don't be such angry people. This movie can push unhappy people to stand self confident.,Beethoven
71,rholton2,Great Family Film,10,27 September 2005,"If you love funny animal films, you will laugh till you cry at the antics of Beethoven and his human companions. The scene where the children are trying to find a name for the dog is cute and if you like classical music you will appreciate the humor behind how the name is finally derived. I was rather surprised to see Good Guy Dean Jones, star of many Disney films, in his portrayal of the dastardly and evil Vet. I almost did not recognize him with the thick ""soda bottle-bottom"" glasses, but as always Mr. Jones gave a stellar performance. X-Files star David Duchovney plays the part of a company representative who wants to try to take over the family's business, and only Beethoven sees him and his female partner for what they are and takes them on the ride of their lives (one of the funniest scenes of the film). I generally find sequels are not as good as the first, but in this case the humor of Beethoven's 2nd and Beethoven's 3rd hold true to first and are also worth viewing.",Beethoven
72,billingshannah,We all love this film!,10,11 November 2018,"I don't really understand why some people have given this film such low ratings. I loved it when I was young and enjoyed watching it with my 5 year old. I can see why it's a PG as my son was a bit unsure at the start when he saw the men being mean to the dogs but I was able to reassure him that it all works out in the end and they get what they deserve. There's a great sense of justice in the film with Beethoven becoming part of the family and everyone working together to ruin the bad guys plan. As dog lovers ourselves we loved it. The dad, George, is a bit annoying at times but likeable and he comes through for the kids and the dog at the end. It also reinforces the idea that you can't help but love dogs, even though they're hard work, as Beethoven works his way into George's heart. My son particularly liked the ending when all the dogs are snuggled up safe. My son proclaimed ""no one should ever be mean to dogs, you should always love them and treat them nice"" so if that's the lesson he got for it then I'm happy.",Beethoven
