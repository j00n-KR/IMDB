0,MartinHafer,Stunningly good.,10,26 September 2017,"""What Happened to Monday"" is something I never thought I'd see...a Netflix-produced film that is absolutely brilliant--perhaps perfect. The fact that it's good isn't surprising. Netflix has made many wonderful television shows and moviesbut this one...wow it's amazing and not to be missed.The story is set in the near future. The population on Earth has boomed,due, in part, to advances in medical science. But the problem with this is that with ten billion people and counting, there's a limit on how sustainable this will be. In response there is a radical new law thatfamilies will be limited to one child. And, if they catch any with more than one, the extra children are frozen...presumably to be revived at some date to be determined.The story now switches to a woman giving birth at some secret location. There's a reason she doesn't have the child in the hospital...she's having a multiple birth...seven to be exact! Soon the girls' grandfather springs into action, hiding the girls and concocting a strange and very elaborate plan. The girls will live in a hidden room and when they are ready for school, they will pretend that they are one child after all, they're all identical! In order to do this, the girls, who he names after days of the week, wear a body camera and at the end of each day there is a debriefing so that the six other siblings can learn what transpired So, after Tuesday, the child, Tuesday, returns home to show them her day. And, the next day, Wednesday plays this girl. In essence, there are seven Karens sharing one life. This works out remarkably well but at a cost. Not only do the girls exist outside their hidden room only once a week, but when one loses a digit, the other six also must have a digit removed in order to hide the secret! Such is the complexity and difficulty of the plan...a plan that works for many years. But one day a problem occurs...Monday does not return home. And, this occurs only halfway into the story...the rest is almost non- stop action and suspense.For a Netflix produced film, I was shocked at the casting of Willem Dafoe as the grandfather and Glenn Close as the woman in charge of this strange eugenics plan on Earth. It obviously cost serious money to get them. The film also looks great and is very ably directed by Tommy Wirkola. But the real standout here is the Swedish actress, Noomi Rapace, as the Karens. She is marvelous and managed to give a bit of a unique personality to each of the Karens. In many ways, this is reminiscent of Tatiana Maslany from ""Orphan Black"", another actress who masterfully plays many different identical characters each a bit different and unique.To me, however, the big stars of this film are the writers, Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson. The story never has any lulls and again and again the movie manages to surprise the viewer....all of which work together to make a truly exciting and chilling morality tale. I see that this newly released film only has an IMDb rating of 6.9.which is inexplicable considering how good the film really is. Overall, this is a truly terrific movie..one that is much better than you'd expect to be streaming on Netflix. So good, in fact, that I can't even think of anything I didn't like about it...absolutely nothing!",What Happened to Monday
1,Leofwine_draca,"An engaging premise, well handled",7,14 March 2018,"WHAT HAPPENED TO MONDAY is a Netflix-produced science fiction thriller with the usual dystopian future premise. However, it also has a very interesting storyline which makes it feel fresh and unique. The narrative takes place in a world where an evil corporation (headed by Glenn Close on typically creepy form) enforces a one-child policy. The always-interesting Noomi Rapace plays seven identical siblings who hide out in an apartment and who each venture out on the day of the week they're named after. Inevitably they get exposed and action ensues. This kind of film works well because the action scenes compliment the story. It's a little rough around the edges at times but generally works well and keeps you guessing as to the outcome. The action is violent and fast paced and includes a lot of chasing around which I always find exciting, and Rapace does well to convince as seven individual characters rather than seven lookalikes of the same character. Occasionally cliched but always fast-paced, this is an engaging feather in Netflix's cap.",What Happened to Monday
2,SnoopyStyle,manufactured nature,5,29 March 2018,"In the near future, the Child Allocation Bureau led by Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close) implements a global one-child policy due to overpopulation and dwindling resources. Terrence Settman (Willem Dafoe) welcomes his identical septuplet granddaughters and decides to raise them in secret. He names them after each day of the week. Thirty years later, the girls go out on their day of the week sharing their common identity banker Karen Settman (Noomi Rapace). When Monday disappears, the girls find themselves in danger.The 7 girls named for each day screams manufactured sci-fi. It's an artificial construction like the premise itself. I'm willing to go with it until the finger incident. The obvious solution is to keep that one girl inside or make her wear gloves. It's another artificial construction to make a scary point about their situation. The simplest movie construction is to allow each girl to have her own look which actually makes no sense. They risk discovery for the superficial need to have different hair styles. Once all that is accepted, this is a fine little action thriller premise. I would go with an evil Monday trying to kill her sisters but this plot is fine. Rapace has enough range to do 3 or 4 sisters but 7 is a little too much. There are some fun action and the story almost works. Its manufactured nature and a few plot conveniences do irk me.",What Happened to Monday
3,nogodnomasters,She's my Sister,8,28 August 2017,"In the future, a world wide one child policy is instituted by Glenn Close who has gone from running the galaxy to just one planet. During this time period septuplets are born and are named for the days of the week. They are home schooled and learn to work as a team.As adults they ""share"" a job at the Eurobank, but when Monday doesn't return home from work, the remaining siblings become concerned and daringly venture out.We already know the final girl is Noomi Rapace who plays all seven roles. The film has a couple of formula twists and a plot that was likewise expected. In spite of that, Noomi made the film a worth while watch, catching seven personalities.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Noomi Rapace)",What Happened to Monday
4,kosmasp,Every day of the week,8,17 September 2017,"I like the new title better. Though the Question about one of the sisters (by name) was fine too. But this way it's more open to interpret and maybe not guessing one of the things that will happen. If you catch my drift ... then again the movie has more to offer than just that. And it does deal with one of the most important issues the future seems to hold for us: how will we be able to feed the ever growing population? Of course this all is used to make a really good Science Fiction story, that is filled with tension for your viewing pleasure.The girl formerly with a Dragon tattoo (from the Original European thriller that is) has really set her mark in Hollywood. And while this particular movie may only be shown on Netflix in America, it will get theatrical release around the world. Try to watch it on the big screen and enjoy it. Even if things may be predictable for you ...",What Happened to Monday
5,lee_eisenberg,here's a creative one,8,22 October 2018,"Although dystopian futures are a common motif in cinema, ""What Happened to Monday"" manages to add an extra dimension by depicting a future in which a one-child policy gets enforced worldwide to prevent overpopulation. When septuplets get born in a particular family, the grandfather decides to have them pose as one person, with each sibling leaving the apartment on an assigned day of the week. It works perfectly. That is, until one of them doesn't return.Netflix has been turning out some interesting work in the past few years (Stranger Things, Mudbound, and now this one). I recommend it. There are some real shockers in store here.",What Happened to Monday
6,Tweekums,Impressive dystopian sci-fi with Noomi Rapace playing seven septuplets,9,23 October 2021,"Set in the near future, where certain genetically modified foods have led to a massive increase in multiple births, there isn't enough food to feed the increasing population. To counter this a strict one child policy is enforced; younger siblings are placed in cryosleep to await better times. When Karen Settman dies giving birth to identical septuplets they are raised in secret by their grandfather; he names them after the days of the week. When they are old enough he lets each one out on the day corresponding to their name... on that day they are Karen Settman.Thirty years pass and 'Karen' is working at a bank. As before each is Karen for their one day. Everything goes well until one day Monday doesn't return home... is she just late or has something happened to her? Tuesday tries to discover what happened but when she too disappears the sisters realise they are in real danger; somebody wants then eliminated. The remaining sisters will have to work together and face danger many times before they learn some shocking truths.I really enjoyed this dystopian sci-fi; I couldn't help thinking that is was like the series 'Orphan Black' crossed with the classic film 'Soylent Green' without ever feeling like a rip off of either. There are plenty of twists and turns. We get lots of impressive, sometimes gory, action and a real sense of danger for our protagonist sisters. Noomi Rapace is great in the role of all seven sisters; each subtly different in look and behaviour. The supporting cast, which includes Glenn Close and Willem Dafoe are solid too. The film raises interesting questions; if the population continues to grow will limits on children be legally imposed or will it just be accepted that people won't get to eat as much... assuming new farming techniques don't solve the problem first. Overall an impressive film; I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre; I'm surprised it isn't better known.",What Happened to Monday
7,CinemaSerf,A creative sci-fi fantasy that moves along Rapace....,7,24 January 2021,"What has happened to Glenn Close? These days, she seems quite content to take these increasingly sterile roles as at the incredibly well coiffured leader with megalomaniacal tendencies but that really don't offer us much chance to enjoy her acting skills... This is another one: she leads a bureau responsible of preserving the future prosperity of the planet by restricting the number of children permitted. Willem Dafoe has to devise a scheme that allows his seven grandchildren to stay free, and one step ahead of the pursuing ""Child Allocation Bureau"". His solution is innovative. Each of them (at home they are all named after the days of the week; at work they are named after his wife ""Karen Settman"" - and all are portrayed by Noomi Rapace) is permitted one day out of the house, the remainder must be spent incarcerated at home - and that existence is still not without even greater sacrifice. As they age, however, frustrations with this regimen grow and one day, Monday just doesn't return... What ensues is quite an action-packed adventure with the sisters trying to track down their sibling at considerable danger to themselves, and uncovering a sinister plot en route. The story recycles itself a bit, and it can be a little difficult to keep up with which Rapace character is which, but she carries off the multiple roles well and the idea holds water rather better than many in this future-apocalypse genre, and, though it drags a little (2 hours is too long), is still worth the watch.",What Happened to Monday
8,neil-476,"Strong, but pretty good",9,24 January 2021,"In the fairly near future, overpopulation has resulted in strong population control measures, so identical septuplet sisters, named after the days of the week, have lived in hiding all their lives, going out one day a week each under a shared identity. Then, one day, Monday doesn't return, which means the other 6 are in jeopardy.I don't normally like Noomi Rapace very much, but she is absolutely phenomenal in this as the 7 siblings, as are the special effects bringing them together in the same shot. The story is good, there is a lot of action, much of it pretty violent, and a constant sense of jeopardy.I had never heard of this Netflix original, but I'm glad I caught it.",What Happened to Monday
9,deloudelouvain,"One child policy, the only solution to save our planet",8,4 July 2018,"IMDb should definitely put this movie in the sci-fi genre as we are in the future with special gadgets, and with a story that completely looks sci-fi even though this might become reality one day. The planet is already overpopulated and the future isn't bright if not disastrous. A one child policy will one day become inevitable if you like it or not. That's what I liked so much about What Happened To Monday, the well brought story of a near future, and all this with a good twist. The main actor is Noomi Rapace, who could it be else as she plays seven different characters, and she did an excellent job doing that. The rest of the cast was also good. It is a long movie but you never have a dull moment or a boring feeling, and that's already exceptional for a movie that lasts more than two hours. Good action combined with an interesting story, what else could we ask for?",What Happened to Monday
10,Hellmant,I enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure.,8,15 November 2017,"'WHAT HAPPENED TO Monday': Four Stars (Out of Five) A dystopian sci-fi thriller released by Netflix, through their streaming site. It tells the story of a future world where overpopulation has caused a strict one-child law. When identical septuplet sisters are born in secret, their grandfather raises them in isolation, allowing each one to only leave their home on the day of the week which they're named for. When Monday goes missing, the others must find out what happened to her. The film stars Noomi Rapace, Willem Dafoe and Glenn Close. It was written by Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson, and it was directed by Tommy Wirkola (who's also helmed such sci-fi cult classic hits at 'DEAD SNOW', 'DEAD SNOW 2' and 'HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS'). The movie has received mixed to positive reviews from critics and fans alike. I enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure.In the year 2043 overpopulation has reached an uncontrollable level, and in order to maintain suitable living conditions the government enforces a strict one-child law. Any siblings born, in addition to the first child, are reportedly put into cryo-freeze. When septuplet sisters are born in secret, and their mother dies giving birth to them, the girls' grandfather (Dafoe) decides to raise them all in secret as well. He names each one after a day of the week, and he only allows each child to leave the house on the day of the week they're named after (making them all act as one person). When Monday (Rapace) goes missing, as a business woman adult, the other sisters must spring into action (for the first time) in order to defend themselves and find out what happened to Monday. Things get very violent and extremely bloody very quickly.The movie is a pretty routine dark dystopian sci-fi thriller, but I really like the premise of this one. The action scenes are also pretty well done, and extremely gruesome. Rapace is a great action heroine lead as well, in anything she does, but I wish her characters here would have been a little more developed. There's not really anyone to relate to in this film, but if you're just looking for action, and a good dark futuristic sci-fi tale, than this is a pretty fun movie. Wirkola is an expert at directing this type of action flick too, and he doesn't disappoint here either.",What Happened to Monday
11,FeastMode,my notes,7,26 July 2019,"This movie has a great premise and goes in lots of interesting directions. very enjoyable and entertaining. it also has some very questionable parts, but if you can get past that, this movie is a great time. good music, lots of excitement, good action and suspense, good emotion.

the reveal about monday being pregnant super owned me. got goosebumps and teared up. a few seconds before i absolutely loathed that traitorous scum, after finding that out, what she did is still despicable, but you at least see motivations other than pure selfishness. and you go from being cool with her dying to omg no please don't die. really great moment that pushed the movie from a 3.0 due to questionable parts to 3.5",What Happened to Monday
12,secondtake,"Really good overall, with Rapace impressive and fun in seven roles!",7,2 September 2017,"What Happened to MondayMost futuristic movies seem to push what is possible, and this is no exception. That seven sisters are hiding in a world where everyone is individually tracked and no siblings are allowed makes for a bit of fun implausibility—but it stretches the limits from the get go.Still, the fact that one actress—Noomi Rapace—plays all seven parts, each deliberately distinctive, is pretty fun and amazing. And sometimes over the top—the seven personalities are radically different in caricatured ways. But so what? It's fiction, and a loose version of a dystopian future that is believable enough to fly in a movie. And there are enough twists and surprises to keep anyone awake and alert, many of them plausible once the overall setup is accepted. That is, the game of taking on roles, and of deception all around, is interesting and well done. The complications get more and more intriguing, and the surround cast is solid and well chosen. Glenn Close and Willem Dafoe and both great but in limited appearances. This is Rapace's movie.I say give this a go and let it entertain. And eventually sway you and suck you in. It's a convincing collaborative effort.",What Happened to Monday
13,851222,Great and fresh idea and not bad movie overall - could have been great,7,4 December 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""What Happened to Monday"" (2017) is a nice sci-fi thriller with some great concept and not bad execution. Although its hard talk about this movie without going into plot details and spoilers, i will avoid them because i myself watched without even knowing what it will be about nor anything about this movie - that the best way to enjoy it (as most of the movies actually).Although i did enjoy ""What Happened to Monday"" for what it was, i couldn't shake the feeling that this could have been a great movie - only if the could have gone in a bit different direction when setting the story - make no mistake - the concept and the idea behind this story is a really interesting and fresh one (as it can be in this day and age). But the story later started to take more and more predictable pats, end near the end of the movie you could literally say how it will end. Even if for me movies are about the journey rather then destination, this journey could have been great one instead of being just nice one.Overall, if you love sci-fi movies you should definitively check ""What Happened to Monday"". It has very intriguing concept and idea, good acting by basically one actress and nice execution. Sadly its not as great as it could have been given the great idea behind it.",What Happened to Monday
14,Bored_Dragon,"More than it seems to be, don't miss it",8,8 April 2018,"Based on the summary I expected dumb SF, based on the beginning of the film - boring drama, but this movie is much more than that. The story is very well written, opens up great life and moral issues, but it also offers top entertainment with its unexpected development and twists. It doesn't follow the Hollywood cliché in which ""good guys"" are essentially safe, and where, although they pass through temptations, we know all the time that they are not in real danger and will ultimately take the victory. Here the story develops rapidly and brutally, and the twists and the end of the film are quite unpredictable and powerful. The main trump of the movie is Noomi Rapace, who plays seven identical sisters so convincingly that after a few minutes you forget that it is the same actress. And considering that in many scenes there are few or even all of them at the same time, we must give recognition to directing and editing. By genre and production, this movie is not an Oscar-winning material, but honestly, it deserves at least some nominations.8/10",What Happened to Monday
15,briancham1994,"Amazing acting, dubious world",7,28 February 2021,"This film's strengths are its acting and action. Noomi Rapace does extremely well playing seven different characters all interacting with each other. The filmmakers make this feel completely natural the whole way, like The Parent Trap but further beyond. The action scenes were also quite riveting as there is a lot of desperate tension and we don't always know how anything will turn out. However, the future world doesn't seem plausible as it appears to be constructed just to feel dystopian in a very obligated way. The future government in this film is ludicrously hamfisted and does everything in the most blunt, thoughtless and loud way. This makes for dramatic action scenes but it detracts from the verisimilitude of the scenario, alongside other plot holes and contradictions.",What Happened to Monday
16,leplatypus,"A hit in China, India ... (screen)",10,15 October 2017,"... but not in France according to the worst critic ever: Nicolas DIDIER from the famous elitist magazine Télérama! While this is the best movie Noomi gives us since Prometheus, here's what wrote this brainless idiot (and he is paid for that!): "" caricature Dystopia, dubious ideology "" - as often, an official propaganda is put into light because it starts like this Every material that get close to what should be buried is always teared apart. "" the seven sisters are limited to seven looks "" - Did he get into the projection room? I was and I saw an incredible actress killing herself to impulse life into 7 different characters Maybe this critic is too fed with awful (but always praised) french movies in which french icons do barely over and over the same part all along their whole career (Deneuve, Cotillard, ) And what about the young sisters ? I found that this kid was really good because she gave us the perfect care for the family, helped by a really supportive and warm Dafoe as usual..."" Displeasing Malthusian "" - ah, ah, at least a movie that tackles the problem of overpopulation: Asimov warned about it in the 60s, the 70s were aware (Soylent Green) and now that population has nearly DOUBLED, no government speaks about it! In France, we are still saying that government should give public allocations even to the most rich to dope birth rate! This thematic was depicted in Dan Brown Inferno and strangely, his book and the movie didn't get a lot of hype! This is clearly the n° 1 issue that world leaders should address but they rather divert us to climatic change and others toys "" the lack of care of the director to the lives of the characters who dies one after the other by rough killings "" - one more time, did he actually see the movie? Actually, all action movies are gratuitous violence! For one time, we have a movie that manages to move us after each violent attacks, that breaks our heart and almost make us cry because it is indeed hard to watch Noomi suffer and suffer but this guy wrote that nothing happens! "" the child Cryopreservation is for sure a State lie and the machine is revealed, in an abject scene, to be a crematorium. This is not the first that a futuristic movie recycles unscrupulous the Shoah to serve a questionable thriller "" - This poor guy is completely paranoid! This movie is about a police state that wants to check everyone everywhere, all the time but in the name of a better way of life! This is exactly what happens today! Every state calls for public order, security, caution about dangerous terrorists everywhere and bad countries outside to crush civil liberties and individual rights at home! For one time (and a bit like the classic trilogy), the rebels are the simple citizens and the bad guys are the government, police forces In how many actual movies do you see that reality? None except this one: so for sure, when the expected slave gives you a kick where it hurts, the master is not happy! If he is disgusted, what about the classic movie I have talked up? At last, we find the usual limited argument of french intelligentsia about evil: Bad = Nazis = Hitler  I live in a country totally blind, ignorant, mischievous as we faint to believe that nothing bad happened before Nazism and everything that goes wrong since is fascism!

But that doesn't stop Karen Settman, who bears 7 daughters (and dies in childbirth). Karen's dad Terrence is determined to raise his granddaughters ""the right way"", naming them after the days of the week, and composing an overall ""Karen Settman"" composite, whereby each of them is allowed to leave the house on the day of the week they are named after. Then one day Monday doesn't return home... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola, best known for ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" a few years ago. Here he goes into the sci-fi direction , playing out what happens in 2073 when society allows only one child per family and other siblings are put into a ""cryosleep"" until one day things hopefully get better. The movie's overall feel is quite original and imaginative, even if there are plot holes the size of Manhattan. But much of that is compensated by the dazzling performance of Noomi ""Girl With Dragon Tattoo"" Rapace, who plays all seven sisters, doing it with nuance and fervor. The action scenes are at times way over the top, but always entertaining. Glenn Close has a small role as the ""baddie"", while William Defoe has an even smaller role as Terrence Settman. But in the end, it's all about Noomi Rapace and her amazing performance.I caught ""Seven Sisters"" in the theater recently while on a family visit to Belgium. The matinée screening where I saw this at in Antwerp, Belgium was attended nicely.Upon my return to the US< I noticed the movie has been renamed ""What Happened to Monday"" for reasons I cannot phantom (""Seven Sisters"" seems so much more appropriate). THe movie has been streaming on VOD, and hence I don't know that I will get a theatrical release in the US, which is a shame.

time, on the street in the Univeristate area, and asked her for a role in the film. But things do not work that way in the movie business, the roles are pre-distributed. Still, she was kind and guided me to a Romanian lady who was coordinating the extras. I did not wanted to be an extra, my aim was to act
alongside Noomi Rapace and Glenn Close. I did not imagined then that the film would be so good. Usually, foreigners come to shoot in Romania because it is much cheaper, Romania has all possible forms of relief and local teams are very good professionals. And usually movies are of inferior quality because the subjects are of poor quality. The subject of this one leads me thinking of a Chinese law about how many children any couple in China can have. (""In November 2013, following the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, China announced the decision to relax the one-child policy. Under the new policy, families could have two children if one parent, rather than both parents, was an only child."")

It was a mix of some great sci-fi like Children of Men, Blade Runner, Never Let Me, Orphan Black, Snowpiercer and Minority Report and there were similarities to the Netflix film Mute. The monitor watching and the score were a lot like The Matrix. Most of this is stuff I like.What Happened to Monday had a cool premise for a dystopia and a sci-fi mystery because it was set in a world where people can only have one child and a set of septuplets live in hiding. One of those sisters goes missing and the rest of them try to find out what happened.Tommy Wirokla came from a schlocky background and because of this, he was allowed to go to some dark places. No one was safe in this film. For a film that was made on a budget of $20 million, it looked like it cost a lot more.

23,alindsay-al,An average film that had potential to be a lot better,5,12 September 2017,"This film just arrived on Netflix and I found the premise quite interesting so I gave it a watch and it is really quite bland. The premise of the film sees a family of seven identical daughters going about there lives in a world where being a sibling is illegal. When one day one of them doesn't return home. Noomi rapace plays the lead 7 roles in this film, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday and she does a great job in these roles. She gives different characteristics to the different characters and you can see there different personalities shine to make them distinguishable. Willem Dafoe is in this film in flashbacks as the girls grandad and he is also really good in the film even though he isn't in the film that much overall. Glen close plays a corporate person in this film and I found her character very flat and bland which is disappointing because with more screen time and better writing I feel like she could have been an interesting character. I also found the love interest security guard was a waste of a character that was unnecessary. The story has interesting potential but I feel like this film misses it. I liked the relationships between the sisters but I feel like the film misses the boat when it comes to its wider more complex themes. The script is very forgettable though, the humour is non existent and the drama does feel cliché and falls flat. The style of the film has some decent action scenes in it that actually were pretty hard hitting. But I found the films pacing a bit messy with them breezing over things a bit too quickly for my liking.

From Prometheus to Passion she's hooking up w/the right talent, Ridley Scott & Brian DiPalma to name a couple, but something happens when whatever sparked interest in said project gets warped traveling from the printed word to the filmed final result. I wish Monday would be the cure here but alas it ain't. Starting off as an interesting possible double bill to the excellent scifi'r Children of Men, this dreck devolves into the empty action set pieces of the Total Recall remake. People love sci-fi but that sci-fi has to be good. Some quirky car & set design can only go so far.",What Happened to Monday
26,s3276169,Wow......,10,9 October 2017,"How often do I get to say ""wow"" when I see a movie? Let me tell you, rarely......What Happened to Monday is really quite brilliant. It takes the serious real world issue of overpopulation and pits it against the intrinsic human imperative to protect its offspring. The inevitable collision that takes place when the need to see the species thrive at the expense of the individual, is the starting point of this film. What happens in between is a cleverly crafted mix of sci fi, masterful storytelling, well executed action with a emotional component that's genuinely touching. Noomi Rapace of ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" fame hands in yet another show stopping performance, nimbly and ably playing multiple characters, seemingly with ease. That's not to dismiss the performance of other cast members. This is a collectively polished affair. This is, for me, a ""must see"" and possibly even ""see again"" sci fi.

27,peterp-450-298716,Got the hots for Noomi Rappace? This movie is made for you!,6,18 January 2018,"""We are one human family sharing this Earth.
Today, together, we make history.
The Child Allocation Act is the first vital step towards preserving our planetand making a better future for our children.""After reading the synopsis of this film I was instantly excited, because the concept appealed to me enormously. When I looked at the film ""The Thinning"" exactly one year ago, I was also curious about the end result because I thought the basic idea was masterly. Unfortunately, in my view it was a failed attempt to launch it as a pilot film to add some brainless sequels. I'm sure they've cancelled those plans. Also in ""Seven Sisters"" (or ""What happened to Monday?"" as the movie is called in the US), the overpopulation is again affecting mankind. Even worse. Due to climate changes, extreme drought causes a shortage of food. A genetic intervention by science brings solace but has one annoying side effect. The number of multiple births increases drastically. The solution of one problem is detrimental to the other major problem. A new law is being voted allowing only one child to be conceived per family. The illegitimate children are stored by means of a cryosleep until better times ensue, so they could have a future in our world.But that's not what happens to the Settman family. The grandfather (Willem Dafoe) ensures that seven sisters grow up in great secrecy. For practical reasons, he names the sisters by the days of the week, so they know at a later age on which day they can leave their home. So seven persons live the existence of one individual. The principle of the notorious three musketeers ""One for all and all for one"" falls into nothing. Are you an avid fan of Noomi Rapace? You'll see. This film is the fulfillment of a wet dream. She plays every sister in this family. Each with her own appearance, character, quirks and intellect. You can expect a lot of scenes where she duels with words against herself. A monologue actually made possible by special effects. It reminded me of the tomfoolery Eddy Murphy already demonstrated in ""The Nutty Professor"". Though this time it's not so hilarious and without silly jokes about flatulence.Noomi Rapace played a dazzling role in ""Män som hatar kvinnor"". She was captivating in ""Dead man down"" and impressed in ""Child 44"". Here it's not her acting which is a prominent aspect. It's the technical high-tech wizardry that ensures that she plays a memorable role. The perfectly edited dialogues and ingeniously put together fight scenes, ensure that she shines on the big screen (in sevenfold). Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make an impressive film. In the end it's nothing more than a thriller with science fiction elements. For me, there was only one breathtaking fragment and that's the first confrontation between a part of the sisters and those who want to destroy this long-kept secret. Furthermore, it was a very entertaining film. But, and I'm repeating myself, it wasn't impressive.The decors looked futuristic enough and reminded me of ""Blade Runner"" sometimes. The overall setting was perfectly taken care of. Obviously, Noomi Rapace is mainly in the spotlight. As a result the part of Glenn Close, as a driving force behind the government apparatus CAA, and that of Willem Dafoe feel as additional. Especially Glen Close, who again behaves like a true Cruella DeVil, is a rather one-dimensional character. Furthermore, it wasn't that difficult to guess how the film would end. All in all it felt like the whole film was draped around an ingenious concept and a cleverly thought-out gimmick.",What Happened to Monday
28,Enchorde,Sci-fi thriller with good suspense,8,31 July 2018,"In a future where overpopulation is the major threat to civilization, having more than one child is a major crime against humanity. To enforce that CAB, Child Allocation Bureau, starts to hunt all and every sibling around. Siblings are processed in CAB's headquarters, and CAB quickly takes the form of a oppressing agency that stands above the law. In this world Terrence Settman secretely raises his seven grandchildren, all identical girls, that his daughter left after dying at birth. He names them for the weekdays, and when they get old enough they can only go outside on their day. One day Monday doesn't come home.A good thriller with quite a bit of action and sci-fi in it. And to be honest, some pretty gory and gruesome moments. There are several twists and turns in a pretty good plot. The premise is interesting, even if not really worked through. Some of the twists are quite obvious and easy to predict. Others are harder to guess, foremost what really happened to Monday, and that is what carries the suspense throughout the movie. Because, even though there are some errors, this is a good thriller.Noomi Rapace acts very well against her self. I honestly didn't feel her acting against six copies of herself stuttered or forced anytime. They interacted as if there really were seven siblings there. The other bid names, Close and Defoe, has just small parts actually. And even if they act well, as always, they don't contribute to the important parts.8/10",What Happened to Monday
29,invisibleunicornninja,A fun film.,5,4 March 2018,"I enjoyed this film. It wasn't perfect, but it was entertaining. Effects and Technology - I thought that a lot of the technology looked realistic and like something that would really exist. There were very few devices that looked inconvenient to use. There were also a few devices that looked a little TOO convenient. Most of the practical and CG effects look pretty good. The lines that are drawn between what kinds of violence and blood and wounds that are shown onscreen and which ones aren't are a bit bizarre, but its not too much of a problem. Its just a little weird. Action - The action is well done, though the logic behind it is not. Though not all of the characters end up surviving, some of them stay alive a bit longer than they should. There are lots of bits where government officials are shooting at *cough* main *cough* characters in public areas with civilians around. There are a lot of ex machina moments where one of the sisters (I think Friday) keeps pulling tech out of her ass that is super convenient.Plot - There are some minor plot holes. Most of them can be overlooked like how it seems like there's nothing being done to prevent too many pregnancies and how people are checked to make sure that they aren't a sibling ridiculously often. Mostly its a fun dumb movie. Also, though I'll admit I did predict two reveals, there are a lot of twists in this movie, making it incredibly unpredictable. Not in a bad way - it just makes it more interesting. Characters - Most of the acting is pretty good. The characters are believable. There's some bad dialogue, and most of the characters are complete idiots, but I actually cared about the outcome of the lives of fictional stupid people. That is a true feat. I mean, yeah I was mentally screaming at various characters for making incredibly stupid and/or cringeworthy decisions, but I kinda cared about them. If some slightly more talented people had gotten ahold of this script before the ones who did, this could've been a lot better. Many elements of the plot are actually pretty realistic and interesting. With a different approach, this movie could've been amazing. I think the main reason why I enjoyed this movie so much is because the concept is so good. What I'm saying is What Happened To Monday gets an A+ for effort.",What Happened to Monday

This is an appealing and new story of its kind. Movie starts with interesting drama and goes further with forcing you to connect. But there is an end which is not impressive or suit for such good plot. Story of seven sisters should be shown in details like how they face difficulties in daily living, education, doing job, their boyfriends etc. It would have many interesting situations to stick you with seat. But unfortunately director did not take advantage of the story and other hand he wrapped the movie in a hurry. A sequel or rather trilogy would have worth for it. I missed where is Willem Dafoe goes after growing his 7 daughters? However movie is watchable especially for Noomi Rapace. She is perfect for such types of roles since 'Girl with Dragon tattoo' to 'Close'. I see her next Alice (Resident Evil series) for rebooting Resident Evil. The story has many twists only climax is dull and below expectations. Otherwise movie would be best of its genre.

40,SoumikBanerjee25,One of the Better Netflix Originals!,7,14 April 2020,"The concept was fresh, focusing on a real issue of overpopulation here! With a bit more sincerity and efficacy, it would have been an awesome film. But some aspects of it didn't turn out well. Let me start with the Pros. The most positive point of the whole movie should be Noomi Rapace and the way she handled seven different characters who have different personalities with so much ease. She shines even more in the action sequences as we all know how good she is particularly in those. No surprise there! But to see her acting out wholeheartedly really put a smile on my face. Other than her, The soundscore matched pretty well with the fast tracked action scenes alongside some fine settings and scenical choices. Dystopian future, could have looked even more detailed but the efforts are worth applauding considering the limited resources it had. Now let's come to the negatives. The side characters haven't had much depth, they seemed exhaustively one dimensional. The storyline grips you from the very beginning but slightly loses the grasp right in the middle and then picks up right in the end. This rollercoaster of a journey lacked that essence of integrity that a Thriller should have. And the character arc of the Main Villain, underwhelming to say the least. Overall it's a fine action entertainer with a fresh plotline that could have been a blockbuster, if not for the weaker screenplay and sluggish writing.",What Happened to Monday

42,phenomynouss,"they lost me at the ""residents or visitors?"" scene",1,8 February 2018,"It was an intriguing enough concept, though not very believable (somehow GMO crops lead to a huge increase in siblings and genetic mutations and such). Instead of doing the obvious thing and changing the type of modification in order to feed the incoming identical siblings, they come up with a just as wasteful, stupid idea of ""let's put them all in cryosleep until we come up with a solution in the future""so Europe, adopting a One Child policy like old china, inexplicably becomes a dystopia where people roam the streets and the Child Allocation Bureau, like ICE, basically kidnaps children to put them into cryosleep while an angry mob watches and inevitable violent revolution creeps ever closer.The protagonist siblings have a system come up with by their grandfather to let them all go out one day a week, corresponding to their names as they are named after days of the week, taking on the identity of a fictitious single child that is all of them.
Somehow this all gets revealed in the first 30 minutes as CAB kidnaps two of them, then sends an ugly goon squad to capture the others. This goon squad enters the public apartment, and for absolutely no reason, murders the front desk doorman guy.
I completely stopped caring about this film at that point. The sheer level of hideous stupidity and pointless dystopia is in no way backed up by the movie's plot. This completely pointless act of vulgar cruelty sufficiently drew me out of the immersion enough to begin to realize just how impossible the movie's setup is. I'm not even half-way through the movie and I'm willing to bet it's revealed the CAB just kills all the children they capture and ""cryosleep"" is a lie, because that's exactly the sort of meaningless cruelty this film is going for to give a pointlessly noirish tone to a story that could've taken place in 1980s China without the pointless murder and abuse of children.
As the film trudges along in the vein of a cheap action thriller, with CAB inexplicably having possession of military-grade weaponry like high powered sniper rifles to randomly murder any civilian even remotely in their path, regardless of whether they know or are helping the siblings, more and more questions start to be brought up about this ridiculously pointless tyranny.
If the GMO crops are causing an increase in siblings being born, while ALSO being necessary to feed the overpopulated Earth, why is nothing being done about the excessive births? No mention is made or shown of any sort of drug or medical treatment to try to mitigate the effects of the GMO making tons more babies, and given that CAB is on a daily basis kidnapping ""excess"" children to freeze or murder, they apparently aren't doing anything about prevention OR early intervention, whether by killing the siblings as babies or ""humanely"" freezing them as babies so they don't have to go into the streets and make people want to kill them for tearing families apart.
Why not change what kind of genetic modifying the food undergoes? We've got GMO'd food today that does just fine in feeding billions of people without every single one of them having 8 identical children each. What changed between, based on the intro montage, the Obama administration and the future time this movie is set in that they can't use it again?
How in the hell is ""seven identical siblings pretending to be one person"" a crime serious enough to allow for them to randomly murder innocent civilians AND OPEN FIRE ON A PUBLIC CROWD WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS?! Arguably, since these idiotic tyrants at CAB have already killed at least 4 or 5 innocent civilians just trying to capture these siblings, they should just let them go since they've already balanced out the food/population problem. If the whole point of the One Child policy was to be able to properly feed everyone, then they've already killed off enough random people to be able to spare for the siblings.
and we're just over half-way through the movie.
EDIT: Having finished the movie, I cannot believe I was completely right about the ""cryosleep"" thing being a total lie and them just mass murdering all the children they come across. The woman in charge of CAB played by Glenn Close comes across as such a moronic cliché with a (debunked) Malthusean mindset and such ""whiny teenage angst"" lines like ""Humanity is a failed species"" that seem to come out of nowhere, and which she delivers all the time all around employees at CABWhich makes you wonder just how moronic the people around them are that their boss, who is supposedly a big huge hearted person who loves children so much she is freezing them so they can live in a better future, is roaming the halls mumbling about how much humanity is evil and parasitic like a teenager that just watched ""The Matrix"" for the first time and gushes to anyone who will listen about how right Agent Smith is don't talk to their friends or family or each other about what a psychopath this woman is. 
If I worked at a pet shelter with a highly controversial system of ""saving"" lost pets and my boss was talking about how miserable pets are and how pets don't deserve to live, I'd be majorly concerned about their well-being and/or what the company is actually doing. It wouldn't take a Jason Bourne-esque action-packed chase plot culminating in a single video release to bring them down, so much years of rumor, innuendo, and inevitable insider whistleblowing and investigations.",What Happened to Monday

The proper one is ""What Happened to Monday"") Angelina Jolie in Silk"". Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde"". Noomi Rapace in Seven Sisters"". There's something about good-looking female movie star killing hordes of enemy soldiers in the name of truth and justice that just feels right. Especially when she's been multiplied, eh? In a world where families are limited to one child due to overpopulation, a set of seven identical sisters (all seven played by Noomi Rapace) avoid being put to a long sleep. They mostly hang around at home and visit outside world one at a time but then one goes missing. As already hinted, there will be blood. Lots of it. Also starring: Glenn Close, Willem Dafoe, Marwan Kenzari, Pål Sverre Hagen, Christian Rubeck, Tomiwa Edun, Cassie Clare and the others. There's lot to like about Seven Sisters"": * the effective use of dystopian future genre clichés in the first third; * the dystopian theme gains extra depth thanks to clever ways of showing how modern technology and it's shadow side involving the death of privacy is suddenly everywhere, and the line between digital and real is blurring – for example, are the palm computer physical or are thet holograms?; * the story often finds ways to avoid common clichés and solutions found in action movies, resulting in more than one little surprise; * the story changes as it progresses, from cautionary future tale of the first third to all-out action in the middle and ending with another flavor of dystopian society tale. A bold move for sure; * interesting supporting characters played by cool young European actors – Kenzari and Hagen are my favorites here, both turn out much more intriguing than they must have been on paper; * Noomi Rapace in what's by far her coolest movie role ever. As an actress she doesn't have much of a range but she's near perfect here, especially as the story encourages overplaying everything a bit. Don't quite understand why every sister has to talk differently if they're identical in every way, but whatever. Guess she liked a challenge; * action is good too although there's more shooting and less physical fighting than in Salt"" or Atomic Blonde"", just to be clear; The problem is that although the components are promising, the director Tommy Wirkola is not quite able to tie all the different approaches together nicely and 123 minute epic gets tiring in the end. I should blame the last third which gets progressively sillier and raises questions that make the whole inner logic of the story crumble. Starting from making one of the important characters a bad guy all of a sudden and never acceptably justifying the happy ending. Still, it's a pretty cool project, and the first movie role by Noomi Rapace that I have actually liked. And it is certainly much better than young Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola's first big mainstream project, 2013's Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"", which was so painfully crappy that I could only watch half. (I have also seen Død snø"" which is OK but not really worthy of being called a cult classic as the authors surely would like.) PS Dafoe is cool too, as always. He somehow manages to give the movie most of the warmth the depressing beginning has.",What Happened to Monday

59,Jerghal,Another mediocre Netflix movie,6,20 August 2017,"The subject of overpopulation is one that has been brought up in many scifi movies but most just use it as a situational backdrop and don't really address the problem per se. And for this movie it's the same. It quickly falls back to the cliché good (here the 7 sisters, the one's adding to the overpopulation problem) versus evil (the one's actually trying to do something about the overpopulation problem).The plot is rather thin and has a little 'twist' in it at the end but for the rest just falls back to all the standard scifi clichés. A large part of the film is dedicated to the sisters being chased by the bad guys (you know the scene where the bad guys get out the the SWAT team truck and the main gorilla says 'find them'). This would not be a big problem (in The Matrix for example there is also a large 'chase' part) if the chase scenes were done well and had interesting action in them but unfortunately you feel like you're watching scenes you have seen many times before but done better in other movies.Noomi Rapace does an okay job making us believe these 7 sisters have different personalities but because of the aforementioned chase scenes there isn't that much time dedicated to the development of these characters.The cast is padded with Willem Dafoe and Glen Close (who looks very weird and artificial, she looks CGI even when she's just there :)). The presence of these actors is supposed to add more weight to the short scenes that they are in but it only partially works because the script only gives them superficial dialogue to work with.So what could have been a more cerebral scifi movie just turns out to be a overly long (124 mins is too much, it should have been cut down to 100 mins) standard action/scifi flick that's an okay watch but nothing I would wholeheartedly recommend.",What Happened to Monday

However, the story and writing is so bad, illogical, implausible, full of holes and contradictions that i several times had to stop watching. Even the scenery makes no sense, going from total hi-tech SF to east European remains from some past behind-the-iron-curtain era (movie has been filmed in Romania). Actually, nothing makes sense in this movie and it is a total mess and waste of great talents, simultaneously forcing to participate people that have no clue and/or talent (especially script).

62,bastos,Disappointing,6,29 October 2020,"This is a bit of a bittersweet movie, as it is really well made but the screenplay is lacking. First the good things, Noomi Rapace is once again excellent and she fills the screen with her presence, both literally and figuratively, playing seven different characters. It is so well made, acting and directing wise, that as the movie goes on you totally forget it's only one actress. The setting is an intriguing one, and works on a sci-fi dystopian level, but the screenplay is very disappointing as it deals more with real life politics than with serving the story. The thing is that this is presented as a dystopian future, but I'm sure that the creative team knows this has already happened in our time when China took a very similar approach to what is shown in the movie, and although a harsh decision, it is at least arguable that it is a correct decision, and even in China they would allow for twins to be born so I don't think the situation presented in the movie is even believable. Adding to that you have the Glenn Close character that is presented as a James Bond villain without having done anything to really deserve it. Only by the end you see a truly evil act, in what is a Soylent Green/Logan's Run moment, and that should have been the basis for the movie, not the politics, which in my opinion is a cheap attack to China and ruins the viewing experience. Still the acting, directing and overall feel of the movie are enough for a very light recommendation.",What Happened to Monday

64,jackgdemoss,A visceral film that does more right than it does wrong,8,8 January 2019,"Netflix shocked me with this one. I had no idea that they would be willing to be so brutal in a Netflix original. What Happened to Monday was such an impressive film in so many ways, but it also had some severe drawbacks. The cynic in me will address the negatives first. The antagonist (and really all of the characters) had no believable motivations. The ending was just silly because it completely defies how humans would handle the plot emotionally. The primary issue, however, was that meaningful characterization was impossible because it was too hard to tell the siblings apart. I would normally let this one slide given that being identical siblings is the premise of the film, but the most potentially powerful moments in What Happened to Monday are unable to reach their true potential because I don't have a good feel for each character. Now we can get into what the film did right. Firstly, it was outright brutal. The fight scenes felt so violent and realistic. If the director was able to paint me a better picture about who each sister was, than their deaths would have been an absolute stunning gut punch. This is magnified by how well Noomi Rapace portrayed the emotions of losing siblings. What Happened to Monday is a violent and gripping Netflix film that will not leave you disappointed.",What Happened to Monday

I lied beside her, trying to fall asleep, but just couldn't. 'What happened to Monday' couldn't let me go.I think the movie succeeded on all levels. Great concept, and overall a very well written story. The execution is quite awesome as well. With the amount of stunts, action, spot on CGI and it's 2 hour runtime it looks much more than it's 20 million dollar budget.The technical aspects are great. The action is well choreographed. It looks real. It's violent, though without being too graphical about it (as is trended recently). The pace is perfect. Not one boring moment, having a clear progression of the events.However, the best part is the intensity of the characters. At first, I wasn't sure, Noomi Rapace is the right actress to play the siblings, but after 30 minutes I was so immersed within the movie that I really forgot about it. I started to care for each of the siblings and more than once I was at the edge of my seat as to what happens next. By the end of the watch I couldn't think of anyone else pulling off this kind of role.There were some discrepancies that I though as rather illogical, though they couldn't hurt the emotions I was having when watching the movie.

And other movies from 70s 60s did similar plots of having people believe they was moving on but were in fact being killed at a certain age, all to with stand the future, what grabs me about this film that we would once call a dystopian future film is, it's not really that far of, we've lived with child services that have been snatching kids from parents for decades ( first profit) whilst others are told to abort or theres contraception all in the name of keeping a population low while satisfying a childless market. We have us on automatic donor lists even though we didnt chose and us turning on eachother over the recent not that harmless virus. Which everyday makes me sadder of how easily hans are giving away any of our freedoms and humanity. The actress has done a amazing job to pull off 7 siblings at once, absolutely outstanding and I had no idea that was coming and now about the names. This is a fast action movie and felt gripped watching each one fight for survival. I have to admit though I half way through knew what was going on with monday, but still entertaining still, glen close really gave me the creeps. Just looking at her.

(paraphrasing), I thought that meant that if, for example, one gets a cut in the arm the rest of the siblings does. That was of course not the case when I watched the movie. If that was the case, the movie would be much shorter and illogical.This movie made me impressed with Noomi Rapace's range as an actress. Two of the characters she played had similar characteristics, but the rest were unique, which is incredible when you think about it. It never felt as though I was watching a movie that existed with one actress playing different characters, it was like watching a movie with different actresses playing different characters. Major kudos to Rapace.The plot is pretty strong, weak in some cases, but it did come full circle in the end. There were some surprises that I wont spoil, and some surprises that was predictable. One thing I didn't like was that we have to assume that Dafoe's character died, we never knew what happened to him, he just disappeared when the ""30 years later"" text popped up. Maybe I missed something, but that's because of my attention seeking puppy, and if I did miss something, then you will probably notice that when watching it yourself.I really recommend anyone watching this as this is not simply a ""Sci-fi"" movie, it's a ""Thriller"", ""Crime"" and some ""Drama""-ish moments which made me tear up.

81,punisherversion1,An idiotic mess,2,30 November 2017,"244: What Happened to Monday. Now here was an interesting idea that they slapped a half baked action movie onto. The world is in dire overpopulation. It has expanded double the 7 billion it is now in 50 years. Wait...wait...wait a minute. Even if everyone procreated and had a ton of children, that would be extremely difficult. But that's okay I'll go along with it for now. We're introduced to seven identical children forced to go into hiding due to the child allocation act and live as one person. This takes brutal tolls on the seven people living as one. Until one day, Monday disappears forcing the other six to find out what happened. As mentioned before this is an inherently interesting science fiction idea that has been used before in films like Soylent Green. But then the action movie seeps in. The Child Allocation Bureau is a government entity that is designed to hold people accountable to the one child only law but they seem more like a big brother totalitarian regime. It doesn't quite gel. They also are extremely brutal in their search. It is quite the head scratcher. The agents come off as vicious psychopaths and they relish in beating the women and violently killing them. It seems all so unnecessary. This movie was floating around in C or D territory until we come to the end. The end of this movie was a swift kick to anyone with a semblance of logic in their brains.

82,voyou-703-655350,Recreation with week spots,6,21 August 2017,"As science-fiction, this is pretty fine when it comes to technology, worthless when it comes to the story. This is because social and political elements are set as a plot device only, or maybe as an attempt to be Orwellian for the sake of being Orwellian, not as a coherent and clever vision of the future. Why a fascist regime, for example ? (With a parliament, to make it more awkward.) Why the checkpoints ? Why the repression but obviously no sensible measures to actually reduce births ? This world is all half-assed.The best example is what the state (or is it a private company ? Not even clear) does to the children. Nonsensical, counterproductive in fact. The opposite of Logan's Run simple and clever take on the subject. Anything but what they do would make more sense, like sterilising parents after their first child, or killing them after their second and confiscating the babies. Or right after the first, why not ?As entertainment though, the film works pretty good. Contrived but fun. I would give all the credit to the great Noomi Rapace, but several of the scenes are actually quite well shot, with fair bits of tension and suspense. The action becomes overdone, with fight scenes way subpar to others, while the story stops following its own silly rules (sneaking commandos soon replaced with an urban war zone.) However, time flies rather pleasantly.The rest of the cast is forgettable, particularly Glenn Close who, in addition to looking freakishly out of place as the only old-timer seemingly left in the world, reprises her role from the excellent Girl with all the Gifts, possibly line for line. Here also, she tries to show some humanity. To justify her ""hard decisions"", hard to someone else of course.

It's a prime example why great idea doesn't equal great execution, because there are some fantastic concepts in there that didn't reach their full potential. This may not be a mindblowing sci-fi but produces entertainment without the braindead feeling of many modern movies.The spotlight is on Noomi Rapace, a very talented young actress that keeps producing quality stuff and giving great performances. Here, she exceeds any expectations by portraying seven different characters and she did extremely good on that. By making each one of them look different to the viewer it actually helps the story to be more believable, it adds to the whole illusion of this sci-fi scenario and definetely makes the movie way better.The story had great potential. Although the idea is already a little over the top, due to their concept that could be prevented by birth control or something, I will not nitpick this and I will go straigh into the actual plot. There are a lot of stuff going on, there is mystery at first, then drama, action and almost everything the audience would ask. There are a few questionable choices but for the most part, everything that's going on feels reasonable and achieves the goal of the creator to keep the attention of the viewer. The only part that fails is to bring emotion and clever thinking into the equation, mostly because there isn't enoughn time to develop all those characters in depth without making it boring.Visually, the movie was shot with the classic netflix feeling but actually gets way more bloody way too quickly. There are very intense scenes with fighting, gunshots and many other stuff that might disturb some who don't appreciate violent images, but for me it was spot on. The only problem I could pick is the director's choice of camera shots during fighting and the excessive editing. Action movies get more and more confusing when it comes to fighting and sadly this one was another dissapointment on that, they should really spent more time on doing scenes that are clear and enjoyable that cutting every 2 seconds because they won't give more time on action in an ACTION movie. That was actually my only big problem with this.I can't understand the bad reception this one had. Sure, it's not fascinating and it will probably not be something I will revisit or think about for days but I did actually have fun and I think it did enough to deserve a chance especially when it comes to great acting. It's junk-food sci-fi but if it's tasty, why not give it try?Conclusion:I had some expectation that this movie matched but sadly didn't surpass, it's a standard sci-fi action movie and at least it's a creative step for the genre. It could've gotten a better execution if they were more carefull but it still manages to do enough to entertain, just not to make you think or feel.Rating: 7/10.",What Happened to Monday
84,antoniokowatsch,"Enjoyable action movie, despite logical inconsistencies",6,23 August 2017,"I think the movie was quite OK but I have to say that many aspects of the movie were too predictable. First off; with 7 biologically identical protagonists the movie had a certain base redundancy built in by proxy. That was just a given fact and became really clear once the movie progressed. Also, naming your children after days of the week is just way too unbelievable. No sane person would actually do that. So right from the start I had a very uneasy feeling about the ""movie logic"" in this particular flick. Also, since we're on the topic of logic; how the heck didn't they get mad that they were named after the respective days of the week? That's impossible (How would you feel if your Dad named you Monday? Exactly!). Storytelling-wise there were a couple of holes which I would like to address here. 1.) What happened to the father of the seven sisters? I mean, he didn't really do much in the movie except for naming his children after days of the week and the one ""finger-incident"" but still. I feel like his children didn't even care about him once they grew up. I mean, there is this giant hole in the timeline; they were children and then they were adults (and Dad was gone). And they never reflected on their teenage years... weird. Weird as in unbelievable.2.) Realistically speaking it would've been impossible for Monday to have that one affair with the guard. Think about it; Everyone of them can be tracked via the bracelets which means that if she were to wander off her sisters would've noticed it. Also, since they're on the exact same schedule they would know her working hours ergo start asking questions should she arrive late etc..Overall, the pacing is way off. The movie starts out with one of the sisters disappearing. Before we're even able to ""form an emotional bond with the protagonists"". So what ends up happening is that we just start to think ""Hey, there are six more. No biggie... It's not like they're going to run out of doubles any time soon"". That in a nutshell is the movies biggest downfall. I can guarantee you that the movie would've been just fine with triplets.",What Happened to Monday

There are a couple of scenes that actually work, but the dialogue is far too wooden. The ending's predictable, even the twist with Monday. There are so many flaws in this movie. It's full of missed opportunities too make it better and it's far too long, due to misguided dialogue and ultimately, a more than dull story line development. The real problem here is the script. The performances by the Scandinavian actors in supporting roles are also not the cream of the crop. I like Rapace, Defoe and Close, but they obviously didn't have enough to work with here. I don't know the actual budget for this movie, but I imagine it wasn't cheap, since Netflix is a billion dollar company.

👨‍⚖️ Review : Directed by Tommy Wirkola and starring Noomi Rapace this action sci drama has a very promising premise unlike anything you have seen before. The Premise sets the tone of a brilliant and engaging flick.The Action Sequences are overwhelming and tightly edited screenplay makes it worth a watch. The Direction is brilliant.Noomi Rapace is a gifted actress and she once again proves this. She offers each of her characters their own identity, personality, flaws, and strengths. I can't imagine how she played so many roles in a single movie so perfectly.Overall , With many dystopian futuristic movies What Happened to Monday stands out due to its uniqueness. What it on Netflix now to know what i mean.

89,bellab1972,Noomi Repace must be related to a director!,1,5 May 2018,"I have now seen two movies with Noomi Repace, not by choice, and both films are very similar. They were both idiotic, full of holes and futuristic, one with aliens and one in the future. Noomi Repace is a one dimensional actor who was cast in What happened to Monday, playing seven people, and can only manage one look. I am convinced she is related to someone who is giving her these parts because there is no way she got the roles because of her so called 'talent'. Both films make no sense so I assume they were written by the same person. What happened to Monday is supoose to conjure up the debate of restricting population growth by outlawing people having more than one child. It happens that nobody noticed someone having 7 children. Honestly, I can't be bothered going into the story because it's just too stupid. How glen close and Willem Dafoe agreed to be in this film is a mystery. There are so many shockingly bad actors around at the moment which makes me think who is casting these people. I assume there are thousands of aspiring actors with genuine talent who would jump a team the chance of being cast for a film and yet the powers that be allow untalented people fill our screens. Maybe they can't distinguish between someone with genuine talent from someone who can simply read a script. I'm also wondering why the general public can't tell what a good actor looks like. Maybe it's because I'm older and grew up with the classics and seen the transformation of generations of actors and film types. Please, no more terrible actors!",What Happened to Monday
90,carolrmag,Wasted time for me,3,1 September 2017,"I am giving it 3 stars because the acting is great. Other than that, the story really didn't appeal to me. Being from a large family, I think the story actually sucks. Perhaps it is because I don't have a psychopath for a sibling. I do agree we humans are too many and are destroying the planet. And that will happen until nature wins, because we forget but we do need it to survive. The solution provided in this movie is too horrific (characters don't know what really happens until closer to the end). But basically you have a sweet grandparent that goes beyond efforts to keep his 7 granddaughters safe in a world where one child per couple is allowed. They grow as team, being stronger when working together. In the outside world they share the same persona so they are not discovered.There is too much fighting and visual, which seems to be in fashion this days.Now for the MAJOR SPOILER... Don't read ahead if you don't want to:One of the sisters falls in love and gets pregnant, hiding it from her other sisters. Onde day she disappears. All sisters work together to find and save her, 4 dying along the journey and one being brutally stolen an eye.What we find out is that the first sister to disappear basically condemned her 6 sisters to being aggressively persecuted, like I said, most die, only she could have her happily ever after with the man she loves and her unborn children. To me, that woman is a psychopath. Even though the surviving two sisters understand her choice and are set to take care of their nephews (all OK in the taking care of the nephews, but what their sister did has no excuse in my opinion).",What Happened to Monday

92,ElliesWonder,"Impossible arisen future, and reasons",9,23 August 2017,"This is an trilled and attractive movie, excellent story telling technique. I can't quit it until I finished, and all my logics came back. This sci-fi movie setting in future where families are limited to one child due to overpopulation, but baby booms still coming even under strict government control. Yet to real world, this situation can never stand!Firstly, there is a surgery calls MFRP, multifetal pregnancy reduction. This practice reduce the number of fetuses in a multifetal pregnancy, best surgery time is between 8-11 weeks pregnancy. But I am sure future science will improve. Secondly, China had one child police for 30 years. Birth Control Policy doesn't only change population, it dramatically change society structure, culture tradition, economic and national security. In China's situation, it definitely decreased birth rate, yet aging issues arise now after 30 years from it, and new baby's gender ratio is terribly imbalance because the boy favor. With imbalance gender issues, fewer girls with more men, marriage will become difficult. Furthermore economic will change if China and India population decrease, right now cheap overboard factories are building on their enormous population. Lastly, national security, low population means less soldiers and army volunteers, Japan and Korea already have such issues.Third, future is build from the past, with Chinese one child success and failure, I can't believe future society can be worse, especially under enforced law, high tech equipment and strict security checks.Fourth, personal thoughts, with a better future tech invention, I thing people will have lower procreate, and selective eugenics. Statistics shows, developed countries family mostly have limited kids, and process caring education; yet poor countries family want numerous children because tradition requires descendant. Beside, everyone gets 24hr/day, with more kids to handle, each kid get less attention from their parents. Educated parents know their capabilities, and future people should be widely educated on Earth.As above, that is why the future of the movie will never come true.Yet I doubted does this movie mean to target the refugees and illegal immigrants in Europe? ""Siblings mostly came from the poor unqualified parenting families, siblings live in bad condition. "" The lines from movie mostly gave As my quotations. Anyway, I like the movie in that watching moment. My logical thoughts and research are only afterword. It was a nice movie, it worth my time to watch. It has a well knit plot, setups and characters are packed, also excellent actor. A person performed 7 different persons, the difference not only apply on hair and clothing costumes, the difference also apply to personalities. It just simply amazing.9/10 check.",What Happened to Monday
93,dogonlion,"Good ideas, bad screenplay",3,19 February 2020,This movie started well and after about 40 minutes turned into a B rated horror movie I could not watch anymore. I think Noomi Rapace was overwhelmed playing 7 people. Her acting was really bad at times and she of the characters she acts better than others. When Glen Close seems like an average actress because of the poor execution of the movie.,What Happened to Monday
94,criscal,Better than expected,8,26 August 2020,"The production value seemed a bit low, shooting that movie in Romania for budget reasons. The actors were doing their job well - foremost Rapace having to play 7 different characters. I like it, that they didn't make the siblings totally alike - like twins are often portrayed in fiction. They went a bit overboard though to make them as diverse with hairdo and personality as possible so that it is easier for the audience to follow the different siblings. This is of course is hardly realistic, but makes it easier on actors and script writers.
The exposition of the movie - the harsh one-child policy and 7 siblings having had to hide since childhood is done well enough and the special problems the siblings face, when one of them vanishes.",What Happened to Monday

96,FixedYourEnding,A lot to like in this one!,7,16 February 2021,"I was pleasantly surprised with this one, was not expecting too much but turns out to be an actually good sci-fi movie. Not pushing the envelope too much, but enough to keep the tension going throughout the movie and the story makes sense, people do make mistakes and pay for them or for trying to cover them up. Without giving too much away so not to spoil the movie for you - if you like sci-fi psychological movies in an ""alternative reality"" setting, this one might be the right movie for you, so give it a try!Exact score: 72 / 100",What Happened to Monday
97,tdwillis-26273,"Bare Bones, No Meat",5,19 August 2017,"The premise of this story looked interesting and had the potential to have a lot done with it. But this movie was bare bones. No Meat. Maybe even missing some of the bones.....The story felt too simple and ""spoon-fed"" for me. There was little character development. When things started going bad for all the sisters, I had no emotional attachment to them to care. There was a sex scene (a little too over the top for no reason at all)that really did nothing to add to the depth of the characters or the meaning of the film in any way. It was as if they stuck it in there to check off that box of ""scenes you have to have to attract broadest target audience"" And I think that includes people with IQ's below 70.The acting was well done and the production and technical parts of this movie were average/decent enough but with such a simple script the only strong emotions this movie brought out in me was boredom. I made it thru the whole movie. Barely.",What Happened to Monday

Girl can act!! Seven Sister, known as What Happened to Monday in north America, is a B-grade sci-fi flick. It's non stop action as the sisters try to figure out what happened to one of their sisters, Monday. I wasn't bored. I look forward to all films with this immensely talented actress.",What Happened to Monday
100,jdiz115,Decent Film,6,25 May 2020,"Film is decent. Acting is good for one person playing 7 roles but still nothing amazing imo (Orphan Black blows this aspect out of the park). There's some plot holes and alot of things you just have to fill in for yourself or just turn your brain off which didn't bother me that much with the type of film it was. Still how do they solve the overpopulation issue? I found myself agreeing more and more with the ""villain"" of the film than the ""good"" guys. Yes they ""won"" but in the long run they basically destroyed the planet.",What Happened to Monday

102,homeflash,Almost Perfect.....but..,9,14 February 2021,"This movie may have given you some fresh idea. However, the ending is typical. The bad guy gets captured with proven video.., blah blah blah. Kind of reminded me of Arnold schwarzenegger in the Running man (about the ending)Of course, there is another twist about the ending as well. You will have to guess or watch to find out..However, there are three things I found flaws of this movie..
Spoilers Alert!1. With all these years, one person goes out and comes back in, there is enough food for 7 siblings?!2, The explosion that one sibling died, why didn the bad guy die?! That really puzzled me?!3. At end, i know plastic eye is available, i think they should show one of the Karen's eye being out instead of putting two perfect eyes at the end.Other than above, The movie is quite enjoyable.!",What Happened to Monday

106,english_artist,Really cool enjoyable movie,8,1 July 2018,I really enjoyed this movie. I must admit I was a little hesitant at first to watch it as I thought it would be to political and boring but it was anything but.The idea of limiting the amount of children people can have is a clever idea and makes the movie more believable as you can imagine this happening in real life.The movie was well acted and well directed with some good tense scenes like the characters going through check points etc and some clever plot tactics like sending you off in one direction while it goes another way making it hard to see the final plot. The effects were also excellent with great action scenes and some tense stand-offsThis has to be one of the better sci-fi movies I have seen in a while with a clever well written plot which is also original and great characters. There were some holes in the plot though which did leave me confused but a great movie and worth a watch,What Happened to Monday
107,sueharriz,STUNNING! I will watch this over and over again!,9,12 April 2018,"To be honest, I hate sci fi movies. However, this one is an exceptional. I should have watched this earlier! I wonder how they filmed this, with 7 identical girls on screen when we know theres only one female actress playing for this role. all salute to Noomi Rapage, her acting is damn superb!!! 
After the first 20 mins, the plot gets thicker and more thrilling, every scene counts. The scene where they had to fight for their lives (in the house) made my heart stop a few times, and I got teary eyed when Sunday died. I feared for Wednesday's life when she has to go out investigating. Later I learned that she too, did not make it. I cried everytime a sister dies.

I can't fathom how low the typical viewer's standards have sunk for garbage like this to score a 6.9 average, but then, a lot of you have very poor taste and even worse imaginations.

I started watching it and I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't what I watched. I have to give it to the writers and producers of this show. The story-line was incredible and the acting of these ladies, amazing. I was so surprised by this one. Again no over sexualized show, just a good story to watch. The ending is what I have to give (STARS) and (2 THUMBS) up! I didn't see that coming and it makes you sit up and say (WOW)! I can't say much more but I wish there had been more to watch.

110,mshavzin,The worst kind of disingenuous drivel,1,18 August 2017,"It reflects the way people overlook the very real dangers of overpopulation very well, but that's about it. First we are introduced to a world where medicine and food are scarce, no nature exists, and people eat rats, all because of overcrowding, and there is no end to the city, it goes on everywhere there is land. Then someone comes up with the idea of cryogenic putting to sleep kids with siblings. Why? When they could just do what China did, and simply mandate a one child ruling( it saved China from starvation btw)...well because they want to show you big bad soldiers taking away cute little innocent children. Never mind the fact that it is the children that would suffer the most in an even MORE overcrowded world, and then eventually their grandchildren would simply die from starvation...Basically its the same stupid idea that if people are not allowed to have twenty kids, then maybe its the twentieth kid that could figure out a way to cure overcrowding...never mind that we have a solution; Have less kids. And the whole thing sounds like 30 people ona raft that can only hold fifteen in the middle of the ocean seeing people treading water, and instead of realizing that the raft will sink if any more people come aboard they say ""Oh good! Lets get them on this raft, because then we will have more people to row the raft!""",What Happened to Monday

Noomi Rapace in her roles was very good, but not great. Distinguishing characteristics in her role(s)could have been better. But nonetheless, it was a believable performance. The politics of the main issue surrounding this film, was successfully blurred by the screenwriter, not to skew either way. Hopefully, viewers wont let their own ideology skew their own view of this film, and instead enjoy it for its merits. I give it a non partisan 7 of 10. Production values, score and improvement on believability in the action sequences, could have upped the film's game a little more. But its worth the watch.",What Happened to Monday

113,richard-fieldhouse,Monday's child is full of full of... Full of what?,7,22 October 2018,"In a near-future dystopia where a super-strict one-child policy has been introduced to combat shortages and an epidemic of multiple births, septuplet girls live a strange existence with each only allowed out in the open on the day of the week they have been named after. And on that day they share in the persona of Karen Settman. For the rest of the time they live out a shadowy, Ann-Frank-like half life couped up in a flat equipped with hiding places and high-tech gizmos that help with the deception.The film sets itself the immense technical and acting challenge that all seven of the Settman siblings are played by one woman - Swedish actress, Noomi Rapace. And they almost pull it off. Only occasionally does it get a tad confusing.The plot is pretty far-fetched and to be honest it does not stand up to close examination in a few areas. But if you're prepared to go with the flow you're carried along by the pace of the story. It's a little bit gory in parts and not suitable for those who don't like coping with plenty of fake blood, but most will probably be OK with it.Behind all the action sit the disturbing ethical questions surrounding a one-child policy - remember that there actually was such a policy in China for many years, although nothing like a strict as the version depicted here. So it's a good film - a fast-paced story together with some thought-provoking ideas. 7/10.",What Happened to Monday

115,heykateforever,Questionable Sci Fi,4,4 May 2018,"**** SPOILER ALERT***** This is sort of a difficult movie to review for me because it had many redeeming qualities. Noomi Rapace is quite good in her role as Karen Settman, playing grown septuplets in some future world where humanity has reproduced to the point of self destruction. An interesting premise for sure. But as I watched this sort of a mess of a story play out, all I could think of was, what about Montana and Wyoming and many other places on earth with millions of open miles. They show a world in a city in shambles, where you can barely walk down a sidewalk because people are so crushed together. The solution? To institute a one-child per couple LAW, whereby siblings are taken away to supposedly be cryogenically frozen for some unknown future time. In reality, which I assumed from the beginning - it didn't take a rocket scientist to wonder where the money would come from to freeze these many possibly millions of extra children and store them where? The movie was actually good, lots of action, Ms.Rapace is a gifted actress and Glenn Close made a suitable bad gal. But for me? There were just too many unreal story holes to enjoy it. I would have given it 5/10 just because the questionable plot holes were distracting. Plus the thought of all those children, with loving parents, dying on a sort of mindless conveyor belt, how would the Glenn Close character get away with it for the thirty years this law was in place. Her organization was filled with seemingly endless people who were well aware what was really happening, but nevertheless protected the organization with a Nazi-like zeal. I kept thinking that the psychopaths had taken over. They were killing babies right out of the womb and children of all ages as I said in the millions as time went on. I cannot imagine they would be able to get enough people to go along with it without leaks to the press shutting it down in due course. So, the acting and action was compelling and it plays like a good thriller. But I am hopeful for the future. I am a fan of Star Trek with it's possitive message for humanity. This was just depressing and I did not like the violence perpetrated on the children. But still, five stars for a good thriller. Then, Noomi Rapace with Willem Dafoe playing her grandfather, never bothered to learn the accent of her grandfather who raised the quintuplets. She is has a distinct Norwegian accent which also annoyed me. So, in the end, this movie probably never should have been made without major changes, but it was, and I really cannot recommend it unless you are just curious. I subtracted a star for this easily fixed mistake. Noomi Rapace, do your homework next time please? You are way better than this material and when in Rome and all, adopt the accent to fit the role!",What Happened to Monday
116,SnigBhaumik,Afraid that day might come,9,4 December 2019,"A brilliant piece of storytelling, a masterful example of emotionally crafted sci-fi movie, and of course amazing case of acting skill of Noomi Rapace.In the end, you ask yourself ""Was Nicolette Cayman really wrong in her doings?"" I'm afraid that day might come soon when the enforcement of one child policy might go to this extent, before the human race is threatened to be extinct because of over population.Congratulations Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson for the intense story and Tommy Wirkola for the vivid presentation.",What Happened to Monday

This movie could've been mediocre at best with anyone else but as with everything else she's ever been in Noomi Rapace elevates the hell out of it. She truly is one of the best and possibly most underrated of this current generation of actors/actresses. I have yet to see a performance of hers that didn't move me. The idea of the film is cool but when it comes to sci fi its near impossible to feel original in any way.

At the end though, it seems the story is more about the jealousy of one of the seven sisters who has made a pact with the devil to become the only surviving sister. Enforcing population control seems to be just a side story, while the Glenn Close character seems to be just another Donald Trump-like overly ambitious politician with delusions of grandeur.

122,cguldal,Leaves a lot to be desired,6,4 September 2017,"The premise (how will the 6 sisters find out what happened to number 7 while avoiding getting caught in the near future where siblings are not allowed to live?) is interesting. Like many movies or books, it is not enough to carry the whole thing through. Rapace and others do a decent job with the script and the action is certainly fast-paced. Some of the character development for the Dr. Cayman (Glenn Close) is confusing, giving off mixed signals: just when we think she might have a conscious or she might actually be a puppet for other invisible powers, the ending throws this off and says ""no, she knew all along."" While the story arc of the siblings is more satisfactory, the ending is problematic, to say the least. Although the world's population is a huge problem, the film ends with ""hurray more babies"" (not that we needed any of this kind of stuff in the end; the emotional end for the characters should have sufficed, the rest just seemed unnecessary and took away from the emotional cohesion.)Beyond these overarching issues, there are many things that could have been different, some of which would have made the film better. The fact that the siblings insist on remaining in their apartment after the first invasion is too stupid and convenient. The fact that none of them ever (in 30 years) had fallen in love before or had done stupid stuff they lied about before (or not enough to get them in trouble) is rather unbelievable. The fact that all that time the apartment next door was empty and the siblings did not take advantage of this is unbelievable. The fact that after being ordered to keep things under wraps, the henchman decides to send armed guys who kill indiscriminately and blow up stuff is also unbelievable. And the list goes on...This film is a Netflix original, so it is hard not to notice the similarities in plot points with another Netflix production, Okja. In a problematic near-future, evil woman promises world she will solve their problems with (insert solution) and girl/women fight against evil woman with the help of a bunch of guys and expose her for a liar... What Happened To Monday is still worth watching, especially for sci-fi and Rapace fans. But it leaves a lot to be desired.",What Happened to Monday
123,brooks250,What Happened to Two Hours of My Life,6,22 October 2017,"I'm a big sci-fi fan and will allow loads of poetic license with the science in service of an engaging plot. This movie has an interesting premise and a few exciting twists. Not to mention some decent acting by A-list stars Dafoe and Close along with the admirable attempt by Rapace to create seven different characters. But, soon after the setup and Dafoe's departure, the film shoves aside the intelligent sci-fi drama of a ""Gattaca"" and opts for endless chases and silly fights like a dumb Fox sci-fi show (and, yes, I've watched many in vain and never learn from the inevitable disappointment). Here are a couple of glaring examples of the unfolding silliness. Close directs her lieutenant to keep a low profile and not let news of these septuplets get out as they hunt them down. So what do we see?Dozens of militarized cops assaulting a building in a scene that starts out with them shooting the door man in the head. Doesn't the doorman have friends and relatives? How is killing him keeping things quiet? Yes, it sets the tone for the ruthlessness of the CAB organization, but it makes no logical sense. Sadly, from there we get multiple explosions with no injuries to the chief bad guy. Women jumping off three-story edges into empty dumpster-again, no serious injuries. Just too dumb to be taken seriously. And the end with its procreate freely in the midst of crisis message is hardly uplifting.",What Happened to Monday

In finest 70's and 80's SciFi tradition 'What Happened to Monday' shows us the future that we don't want. If you like genre classics like 'Soylent Green' and ""Logan's Run"", 'What Happened to Monday' is for you.Acting throughout the movie is superb, but best of all we get to see Noomi Rapace in top form. Noomi's energetic performance totally steals the show. Music in this film is great too and complements the emotional story really well. Lighting and editing is decent.

126,MoviesRT,Well worth watching,7,13 December 2017,"Pretty good idea for a movie.I takes place in a dystopian future where Europe is under socialist totalitarian rule. Everyone must abide by the state, are routinely inspected and must go thru check points throughout the day to get around in the city. It's basically a fascist police state. Interesting that the evil ruler is a woman who looks suspiciously like Hillary. Is that a coincidence?Anyway, the main rule in this society is you can only have one child per family (kind of like China). They seem to think there are too many people and killing them is a solution. As the story goes, this one man tries to keep his 7 granddaughters alive under one identity. They are septuplets and he names them after the days of the week. Oddly, the state doesn't seem to catch on for 30 years.Nevertheless, Noomi plays seven roles in this and she does a damn good job at it. One puzzle was why each one had a different hairstyle when each day a different one had to go out and portray the same person. I guess we can overlook that flaw, or maybe wigs came in handy.The thing that always seems strange to me is just how powerful they make tiny little girls in movies these days. This 100 pound woman apparently has more upper body strength than numerous large burly 250 lb. men. Comical in reality, but common in movies of today. But I digress...Over all, it's a good action movie with an underlying abortion theme. Each must be aborted, even if it takes 30 years to do so. Most are aborted by the age of 6 through some bogus cryosleep method that really just kills them, as they find out later. (I guess they didn't know that cryogenics was proven a farce decades ago.)I won't deny there are lots of flaws in this movie but it's a fun adventure.Final spoiler: It ends up being a pro-life movie. That will probably end up giving it lots of low scores, but all in all, it's worth watching. Noomi was fantastic. She's a great actress. I loved her in the ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" series. Don't pass this one up despite your feelings about abortion.",What Happened to Monday
127,Aria_Athena,Really enjoyed this movie.,7,21 July 2021,"It is pretty straightforward, so I don't have much to say that someone wont get from one viewing. But I will say what in my opinion held this film back from being great.All siblings are played by Noomie Rapace, but they are different characters. My issue is that after getting to see them all together for a few minutes, we follow one and she disappears without a trace, we follow another which also gets grabbed and disappears for most of the movie. Then, when we start caring about a third one, she dies and the same thing happens with a fourth one right after. Plus one of the most important characters, the boyfriend, started being developed way too late in the movie. I feel that the film would have had more tension and more of an emotional impact, if the audience had a chance to connect with someone from beginning till end.",What Happened to Monday
128,PhilipGHarris,Good Concept with Flawed Delivery,6,8 October 2017,"I managed to see 'Whatever Happened to Monday' at a surprise screening and while the film kept me engaged it left too many questions hanging and, the title I saw it under completely gave the game away. If it had been called 'Seven Sisters' I may not have spied the twist so clearly.In a world where over-population has caused humanity to introduce a one child only rule their solution is to cryogenically freeze any further children until the world can be repopulated and one father manages to trick the system by making his septuplet daughters take one day each, making them each unique individuals and people. The children named Monday through to Sunday.What the film excels in is making them different and Noomi Rapace should truly be commended for her performance, as she takes all roles. With credits also given to Willem Dafoe who plays their father in the flashback scenes. With supporting actors providing enough gumption to keep the action going at pace.Monday doesn't return on her day and this sets the rest of the sisters into confusion, yet the way it is filmed it seemed obvious to me that the lost sister had double-crossed them. When Tuesday goes missing they know they have a problem and slowly the authorities try to silence the sisters before their existence is discovered.This raises the other real problem of the film, as the fact this has been going on seems to be a threat to the authorities, whilst really their discovery could be publicised as the fact no-one can hide. The other major point is why they're cryogenically freezing the children and not sterilising the mothers? As the space required for the first seems unbelievable - which then triggers you to the concept that they're being probably not being frozen at all. Making the reveal of this fact have far less impact. What you're left with is a film where you see much of what's going to happen before the 'reveals' show you. Things don't logically fall together and the script would have been given a good shake, before filming, as many of these issues could have been resolved.To its benefit, as it was made for Netflix, it stands up well on the big screen and, at the end, the script and direction comes to the fore. As the larger problem resulting from the conclusion is left deliberately unaddressed. Which shows the ingenuity available and means it's a shame the film isn't a little tighter.",What Happened to Monday

130,makka-00955,Entertaining but preposterous,6,26 April 2018,"First of all, let's start with the preposterous. Seven girls, all named after the days of the week, hiding from a large corporation that is doing away with children to save the planet, by limiting the numbers of children born to one family to one and removing further siblings. That in itself is lunacy. Imagine the numbers of agents, the logistics of doing that in just one city. Add to that the storage facilities of said siblings alone should lead someone to question that. Yet, seemingly a small team of security and two henchmen can adequately manage this job quite easily. No-one asks why, if the idea is to keep kids in a 'humanely' indefinite sleep, they keep shooting the hell out of everyone and chasing them with guns. Yes folks it's another ""the goverment might be lying to you ""movies! I'll leave you to work out the rest of the highly ridiculous plot as you go. So, why a 6? Well, it's well acted and it keeps you engaged, but slightly disconnected, as you tend to focus on how they are doing the 'one actress seven parts' scenes. I think they spoiled this by making all seven girls so different, it would have worked far better if the differences were slight. We have one girl, as a stereotypical geek, but they need one for the computers; one rough-and-tumble lady to do the fighting etc etc. The scenes where there are multiple versions of the lead are pretty well done, but are a bit obvious at times and because no character can speak at the same time, it becomes a bit disjointed and not believable at times. For any actor pulling that off deserves great credit however. There is action aplenty, which helps to carry you through those obvious plot-holes and it's not unenjoyable. The pace picks up as the 30 year secret comes unstuck when one of the siblings goes missing and the remaining girls are now wanted and being hunted down. The ending isn't entirely unexpected - I'll say nothing about that except 'Running Man'. There are a few pet-hates of mine, namely bad extras in crowd scenes, which when not properly controlled by the director just take away believability and also bad CGI and props. In the crowd scene during Glen Close's speech all the photographers have identical rubby dummy cameras and the CGI contains repeated faces. That's nit-picking I know, but I noticed it.

Too bad there were some confusing fighting sequences, there were some odd cuts now and then.

They really had a mix of rough, realistic and original with very cliche and somewhat predictable approach. That made It never really lift It to a the unique and raw experience It could have been.Also I got quite annoyed with the over-acting of Naomi Rapace. It was all a bit too much and too swingy.

Everybody is right in their own view under the most basic human race instinct: survival.As if it's not enough, I'll give you a more important reason than being good: it's original.

We believe that there are seven of her. We feel her fear, pain, sadness and love. And to top it all off, she's acting against herself. What do you think, the producers would pay GOOD ACTORS for her body doubles? Not a chance. She had NOBODY to counteract and enrich her acting. It's just her.

Half the score goes to her performance alone.Least memorable are the quickly setup one-child dystopia and the expected thugs and their masters who maintain the uninspired system. Glenn Close does what Glenn Close has done many times, and yet another movie fails to make up its mind is she really evil or profoundly right.

Besides, its just hard to stomach that they would be eliminated in such a brutal manner in public, when anyone else who falls in that category is handled with such discretion.

155,NormanCroucher,Noomi Rapace shines in this surprisingly good Netflix movie,7,10 September 2017,"Once you get past the unappealingly dreadful title and convoluted set-up, this sci-fi thriller is a surprisingly absorbing watch, anchored by the undeniable talents of Noomi Rapace, who plays seven identical sisters sharing one identity.We are reaching a point in the sci-fi genre where dystopian futures are all starting to look alike and the tropes are becoming rather tiresome. Overpopulated and overbuilt cityscapes? Check. Oppressive totalitarian government? Check. Police state armies indiscriminately murdering the underclasses? Check. It's all become par for the course and 'What Happened to Monday?' goes through the motions of establishing the same old world we've seen explored dozens of times before. What gives this film the edge is its concept of having seven identical sisters holed up in an apartment trying to maintain the illusion to the outside world that they are one person, with only one of them able to go out at any one time. This brings an interesting set of new ideas to the table, allowing room for some creative scenarios involving the sisters alternating in both their collective and individual (mis)adventures.The reason this film works at all has everything to do with Rapace. She manages to take seven roles and make each one distinct from the other and, while she is assisted by hairstyle and costume, it's an impressive acting feat. The best scenes are watching her play the varying assortment of characters in one room in seamlessly blended group conversations (kudos to the VFX team too). She is truly excellent here and deserves recognition for her multi-faceted accomplishment. Rapace also knows how to get down and dirty with the physical action sequences (which are well choreographed and staged), feeding her intensity into the overall thrust of the narrative. You also have seasoned stars such as Willem Dafoe and Glenn Close for support, both bringing some weight and shade to their generic roles of the mentor and the megalomaniac, respectively.The film raises some interesting questions about overpopulation and the idea of a 'one child per family' system, and manages to scratch the surface of its themes on identity and assimilation, but the script isn't really interested in getting too cerebral or provocative with its subject matter. It simply wants to tell an exciting story about seven sisters trying to survive in a 'no sibling' state. And director Tommy Wirkola delivers on that simple ambition with some inventive high energy set-pieces and surprisingly brutal violence, never shying away from the grisly details, even if he can't quite make the film look as big or as epic as its more expensive dystopian blockbuster kin.'What Happened to Monday?' is a nice surprise and you should see it for Rapace if nothing else.

159,criscrossin,Quite easily imagined near future,8,10 June 2019,"The name made me curious. Then the concept of Actress Noomi in 7 roles and Willem Dafoe with Glen close coming together, made it a must watch for me.
I love sci fi and I love action and I love intrigue. All of them are in equal measures available here.
The build up is slow but not sluggish. Perfectly positions the characters. The future is not something shown as completely unmatched with what we can imagine now. Tech is definitely developed but again correlated with what we see nowadays moving towards. We can immerse ourselves in the complexities of the lives of seven sisters and feel them like happening to our own family. Therein lives the triumph of the director and cinematographer.
There are many options available to them but they chose the ones which keep us on the track of the film's motion, wihout feeling contrived.
The music perfectly compliments the emotions and actions.
The acting of the seven sisters by Noomi was excellent. I started looking out for her since the days of the dragon tattoo. Most of the other actors are from Scandinavian origin- sort of sanitised looks , slight bluish, steely grey , impersonal looks- very suited for the futuristic movies we see and got used to. The sisters show classically , characters which are common but different and done so well that we don't think them as one person doing the same and sharing the same screen space at a time, not ever. Everybody did well. Glen close does the same conniving menacing act which she is known for, every time, became a bit boring for me. But done professionally.
There is no unusual twist. Only what we can expect. And during the tragic events , we don't get too emotional. It's usual in sci fi.
A great enjoyable experience. Go for it.",What Happened to Monday
160,FrostyChud,Feminist propaganda,1,4 September 2017,"The whole movie turns on the unbearable existence of men and, by extension, exogamy. For all of human history, exogamy has been the law: a mate must be found outside of the family unit. The problem with this family unit is that there are no possible mates: we have seven women and no men. This film is not about overpopulation. It is about the escape from the incestuous family unit into a society in which one can come to be as a sexualized adult. Quite unintentionally the screenwriter and director have given us an honest portrayal of a perfect feminist society: seven unhappy women bickering and insulting each other in a claustrophobic yet tastefully decorated apartment.Although there are seven sisters in this film, only two are real characters: Monday and Thursday. The others exist on a continuum between the two. Monday is heterosexual, sexually active and enjoys the outside world. Call her a conformist if you like. Thursday is homosexual and a fierce protector of the sisterhood. She is the guard dog of the group. At the beginning of the film, her job is to prevent any of the other sisters from leaving the clan. By the end of the movie, her job has become messianic: she is the New Woman whose emergence hastens the destruction of a corrupt society. The tall, blonde, blue-eyed uber-Nazi henchman, whom we know to be evil solely based on his Aryan physiognomy, at one point spreads his arms like Jesus on the cross, just in case we didn't already understand who the enemy is: white Christians. This henchman is not to be confused with the other tall, blonde, blue-eyed uber-Nazi sexual harasser from the beginning of the movie. The male sidekick and lover is of Middle Eastern origin: not a coincidence. The heavy-handed message: white men are irredeemable prima facie enemies. Immigrant men will be tolerated as sperm donors and loyal assistants. Note that instead of making love to Saturday, Adrian dutifully performs oral sex on her, proving he is a good feminist. Here something curious happens. His gallant ministrations bore her, and she asks him to take her. The sisterhood is betrayed. Her punishment for daring to enjoy straight sex with a man is immediate: a bullet to the head. Note too that Saturday is a mocking caricature of traditional feminine virtues: her blonde hair, virginity, and outmoded belief in the sanctity of sex are here shown as evidence of her stupidity and weakness. Paradox: if this is a feminist fantasy, why is the dead father figure presented as kindly, resourceful, and loving? Why is it Mother who is trying to murder them? Father is the only white man in the movie who is not a Nazi. Mother, on the other hand, is clearly supposed to be evil incarnate. What's going on here? The writer of the movie, too clever by half, has allowed the founding inconsistency of feminism to appear on the screen.Remember, all this is a metaphor. The whole overpopulation thing is a red herring. This is a movie about childhood Oedipal conflicts. Seven fairy- tale sisters trapped in a single house have come to view the outside world with hatred and suspicion. What Monday discovers is that the outside world is not bad at all. Sex with men is great. Work can be liberating. And Mother is quite right about overpopulation. Monday's liberation is intolerable for the other sisters because it endangers their incestuous community. The six betrayed sisters stand in for the grand metaphorical sisterhood that every non-brainwashed woman in the world knows to be treacherous. The caricatural villainy of the Glenn Close character is a clue to what's really going on. No real human being acts this way. It's a tell that we are dealing with a fantasy. When Monday escapes the psychotic aerie, she realizes that Mother is not a murderous deity but a loving protector. The six other sisters (federated around Thursday) cannot see this because they have refused the principle of reality (which is also the principle of exogamy). In their perverted, paranoid vision, Father and Mother are bloodthirsty Nazis. They must be ruthlessly exterminated and replaced with a New Man, a New Woman, and a New Race. Thursday's flight into eschatological delusion is a synechdoche for the regression of Europe in general and Sweden in particular.Willem Dafoe incarnates here a figure identified by Freud, namely the Father of the Primal Horde. He has sequestered his seven daughters: a symbol for incestuous possession. Contrary to appearances, Thursday the butch lesbian is Father's servant. Her job is to protect the integrity of the harem. Note that no mention is made of Father's passing: it is as if he were still in the apartment. Here is the embarrassing, politically incorrect illusion at the heart of feminism: worship of a fantasy Father. In reality, Willem Dafoe is not a brutal, incestuous, finger-chopping Primal Father. This is Thursday's unconscious fantasy. In reality he is a lonely man crying in his room because the weight of reality on his shoulders is too heavy for him to bear. Only Monday understands this. The other daughters wilfully misread his finger-cutting as sadism. They prefer the fantasy of a terrible, murderous dictator to the reality that they are free and have no one to blame for their suffering but themselves. It isn't Father who wants to possess them; it is they who want to be possessed by Father, and they will kill anyone who attempts to disturb this incestuous fantasy. And who is a girl's greatest rival for Father's affection? Mother, of course. Monday has, alone of the six, renounced her delusion of a primal Father and chosen a mate from another family. Because of this, she no longer sees Mother as a rival and can make a deal with her.",What Happened to Monday

There was a touch of cheesy agenda-pushing for the environmentalist crowd, but not enough to ruin the movie for me. Just enough to lose one star. Honestly most of the bashing was against politicians taking advantage of a bad situation for their own profit without having a real solution. The core of the movie was basically these sisters in a seemingly impossible situation trying to figure out how to stay alive. The props they use to fill out that premise were not the best ever, but I've seen worse, and the core tension combined with the acting of the main character(s) was enough to get seven stars from me.

174,samuellickiss,"Interesting premise never fully addressed, but still entertaining",7,23 May 2018,"What Happened to Monday, like many science fiction films, has an idea it wants to explore and portrays a future shaped by that idea, and little else. In this case the theme is overpopulation, and our future world is dominated by the CAB: Child Allocation Bureau, an organisation which brutally enforces a one-child policy. Apparently not a whole lot else has changed apart from some fancy gadgetry, so the film is at least focused if not especially deep. The setting is so vague I'm not even sure what country it's set in. I'm British, and many of the characters speak with various British accents, but then again many of them don't, including the main character(s). It looks Western European of some description, but I'm not sure. Perhaps this is the point: this could be anywhere, but I think a little more grounding would have been good. Overpopulation is something no one seems to want to talk about. It is a very real threat to our planet and yet it's hardly ever discussed by world governments. That's because it's an issue that throws up some very challenging ethical questions. It's not even an especially common theme in science fiction, especially film.The thing is, if you introduce a one-child policy, you have to be able to enforce it. China did, and it was controversial (for good reason) with all manner of human rights abuses stemming from it. Limiting a person's freedom to reproduce limits a fundamental part of what it means to be human. I'm not going to discuss this anymore here, but the conversation over how to deal with overpopulation quickly becomes complicated and controversial, and consequently no one does. What Happened to Monday portrays a future that feels very realistic and entirely plausible, which makes it all the more intriguing. The problem with the film is that it quickly becomes an action film. I like action, but in this case it's at the expense of storytelling and discussion of the theme. The film isn't sure what it wants to be: an action thriller or a more cerebral/philosophical sci fi. It's unfocused, and while the action is fantastically directed and entertaining, it feels out of place. I finished the film thinking: so...what? The bad guys are defeated, but the film has given me nothing to think about. I was expecting the film to throw up some interesting ideas surrounding eugenics, social engineering and other such controversial (but important) topics, and it doesn't. The best sci fis have people talking about their themes presented and the ramifications of them for decades to come - think Blade Runner, 1984, Brazil, Metropolis, etc. - but WHTM gives you very little to talk about. This may or may not be a problem for you depending on your expectations. If you want an action film, you'll enjoy it. If you want a Blade Runner-style cerebral sci fi, you won't. The problem is I think it set out to be the latter, but the writers gave up and shied away from it, which is a shame. The film just sort of ends without circling back to the premise and providing any alternatives to the paradigm established at the beginning. It's very odd. Overall, it's a solid film with a fantastic performance from Noomi Repace and a competent supporting cast. It just lacks ambition and feels a little rushed.",What Happened to Monday

183,marneederider,VERY Mixed Feelings,7,22 February 2020,"I debated giving it a 9. I also debated giving it a 1, because it was really well done and yet it was really just awful.I almost wanted to give this a 9 for realism and acting in all but the last 10 minutes or so.But there were a couple of problems. One was the inexplicable accent of the main character.The other was the overall message. Over population is a huge problem. We are using about 1.5 years worth of the Earth's resources every 1 years. Wishful thinking will not allow us to keep growing from 7.5 to 10, to 15, 25 billion people and somehow we will magically work. Reality does not work that way. Systems have limits. There is such a thing as cause and effect.So, what was the message here, that power-hungry people do awful things, or that awful people will seek out power so they can do LOTS of awful things? Neither of those seemed to be the message. The message seemed to be that it is just generally awful to try to save humanity from destruction, and if we'd just let people overpopulate the earth until we are stewing in our own toxins and starving, then we should allow that. Maybe we SHOULD allow that. But this movie was not about that debate.It was just a gut-reaction, mean-people-bad movie. Of course, there were mean awful people. We don't want the world to go that way. But this was not a good debate on the issue. I debated giving it a 9. I also debated giving it a 1, because it was just awful.",What Happened to Monday
184,smerph,A squandered opportunity,4,14 August 2018,"The setup for this movie is great. Due to the extreme rules governing a dystopian future's overpopulation, seven twin sisters (all Noomi Rapace)are forced to assume a single personality; Karen Settman.
Each of the sisters is named after the day of the week when they will face the world and take on the Karen persona. So Sunday is full of faith, Monday gets things done, Saturday is up for a good time and, well, the rest of them are not so obviously defined or developed in the limited screentime afforded them.
Were this a novel, I'd imagine that the characters and their distinctive personalities would be emphasised and explained. As a movie, we're reliant on Rapace's attempts to distinguish the characters. This never really works due to the way it's essentially splitting a protagonist into 7 pieces and using wardrobe and make-up to fill in the gaps.
My patience with the film lasted until around the 30th minute which was when the story ceased pretending to be intelligent. The interesting storyline of 7 sisters sharing a role is jettisoned when the charade is discovered, and the movie promptly changes direction into an action movie, with a succession of expendable heroes and a strange preoccupation with gore.
I love a good action movie, but this is far from one. I quickly stopped caring for any of the characters and wish it had chosen to be intelligent sci-fi rather than redundant, low budget action.",What Happened to Monday

Story and action are easy to follow, if not too easy, but OK. The message... not so much. I'd say Hollywood is struggling denouncing Orwellian side of its own. It would seem to be much easier attacking some right-wing ideology, but then again, Hollywood's vision of the right wing is equal to the Orwellian left wing utopia.

It's thought that the children might have horrible nightmares that last hundreds of years in their cryonic state.Because of certain biological contaminations, it's become more common for people to have more than one child at a time, so when seven girls are born -- all identical, instead of subjecting six to cryofreeze, a man sets out a plan for each to take on the identity of one person -- to share a life between the seven. There are hardships endured in only being able to leave the home one day per week -- and even then, only to play a role of a person that must be consistent from one day to the next as siblings switch out the responsibility of work, shopping, and possibly having a love life.

201,sentient-74528,"Good acting, bad script.",6,28 October 2017,"Let me start with the good part: Noomi Rapace portraits seven twin sisters in this film and their personalities are entirely different to the point you can actually remember which is which. This is some seriously good acting and she is the only force to keep this film going. The premise of the film is also good: the world population is out of control, a repressing government won't allow siblings and the artificial methods to produce food exacerbates the problem because as a side-effect people are more likely to have twins. The main characters have to survive in a world as a single identity of a woman called Karen Settman (curiosity: Settman is a word play that means ""seven persons"", ""man"" is an old English word for human (were- defined a male, wo- a female) and sett- is a play on Latin ""septem"" or Italian ""sette""). Each of them bears the name of one day of the week.Now for the problems and many spoilers: The government of the European Federation has this politician Mrs Cayman, the typical film villain. She is head of a group called the ""Child Allocation Bureau"" (CAB, a bad pun) and she decides that the world population crisis can only be solved by killing every sibling they can by burning them in a sarcophagus while the world thinks they are actually putting them into hibernation. How would that work? How come no one noticed the obvious fact that the bodies were missing? What about the people who projected the sarcophagus? Nobody questions anything. Anyway, Monday meets this guard who works at checkpoint on her day (this checkpoint is never explained), and they fall in love and she gets pregnant. One day she decides to betray everyone and get a hefty sum of money to live her life and raise her.. child(ren). The six sisters become concerned when she doesn't turn up. So Tuesday tries to backtrack her sister but is found by agents of CAB (told you the acronym was bad) and they keep her for no apparent reason, but they take her eye to be able to... open the door of their home? Weird. So they send uh.. two guys to take down the remaining sisters. They kill Sunday, but are killed in the process. They stay in the apartment, apparently it is safer to wait to be killed. Next day Wednesday decides to interrogate a workmate that looks really suspicious. She corners him in his apartment and he says that he read a contract she made with a big company and has a copy in his tablet, then he is killed by snipers. There is a squad after Wednesday. How did they find Wednesday? Apparently everyone uses a bracelet that can be tracked. Why the sisters never remove it? Go figure, it doesn't make sense. Wednesday sends the contract to her sisters and runs for her life with her sisters' support, Matrix style. All sisters carry cameras, so they can see all Wednesday sees, but at this point that guy Monday likes knocks. Random. His name is Adrian. The sisters hide while Saturday checks on him. Friday (the hacker one) tells her to synchronise her bracelet with his to hack into the CAB. So she goes with him to his place and Thursday and Friday witness Wednesday being killed after falling four floors on her back and running for hours! Saturday and Adrian have sex, she syncs their bracelets and next morning she finds out about him and Monday, Adrian goes to work and while Saturday tells all to her sisters some guys shoot her in the face. Then CAB finally sends a squad to kill the remaining sisters and they escape, but Friday gets sentimental, returns to the apartment, sends all photographs of their family to Thursday (they don't have any backups) and makes an explosive with the microwave and hair spray. Of course, the thing goes off when the microwave counter reaches 00:00, which makes no sense at all, and the bad guy survives pretty much intact while Friday dies horribly. Adrian hears about the fire on the CAB's radio frequency and drives there, and Thursday points a gun to him, explains all that happened and they set off to save Monday and Tuesday. She pretends to be the dead Friday and they infiltrate CAB. Apparently Adrian has total clearance because nobody asks anything. Thursday then witness a girl being incinerated in the sarcophagus and films everything with her super bracelet, kills both people working there while Adrian fights some bad guys. They use the lab computer to find Tuesday and free her (very simple). Then Thursday gets Tuesday's clothes to look like Karen Settman and then she is suddenly in a party to celebrate Mrs Cayman's candidacy to something unimportant. Thursday then goes to the loo and meets Monday, which explains her story and points a big gun at Thursday but obviously doesn't pull the trigger because they really need to fight and there is a shot and in the next scene we don't know who is walking out of the loo (of course it is Thursday, she is the good girl). Meanwhile Adrian is slapping some bad guys and Tuesday is hacking a computer to play that video of the girl being killed in the sarcophagus during Mrs Cayman event. Which happens, and she is arrested. Then Monday appears again, is shot again and uses her last words to tell Thursday she is pregnant. Somehow they get the foetuses out of her to be grown in a lab, Tuesday adopts the name ""Terry"", Thursday adopts the name ""Karen Settman"" and Cayman is sentenced to death. Before Cayman can be punished, though, she gives a huge speech in her best posh clothes to a big audience. That's a weird way of executing a criminal, but hey, this is just a film.

How rare that is these days.The film stars Noomi Repace in one of the best acting performances I've ever seen. Willem Dafoe and Glenn Close have smaller roles, but make no mistake about it, this is the Noomi Repace show. A tour de force performance that you won't soon forget.I won't go into plot, as that would be criminal. The film though, is at times, quite brutal, shocking and difficult to watch, but see the film.

At best, this was a ""made-for-TV"" movie, abounding in cheap production values, a ridiculous plot and just plain BAD acting.Let me say that I'm a big Noomi Rapace fan. From the Lisbeth Salander trio to Prometheus, I've always enjoyed her performances, and that's why I watched this movie in the first place. But this movie didn't show off her talent. She didn't seem to inhabit the characters in any real way--she put on a blonde wig for one, wore a pixie haircut for another, and used the old trope of a pair of eyeglasses to act ""the smart one."" I've enjoyed other ""overpopulated dystopia"" movies such as Children of Men, and even the first Hunger Games film. And The Handmaid's Tale on Hulu (as well as the Margaret Atwood novel) is one of my favorites.But if you're looking for an entertainment that includes one actress play multiple roles at once, lots of action and political commentary on everything from eugenics to the IRA, try watching Orphan Black. I don't normally recommend TV shows on this site, but Tatiana Maslany does a superb job creating completely distinct characters/clones without resorting to elaborate prosthetics or old tropes. Sure she uses cornrows for one character and a blonde wig for another, but the central core of each one consists in her fulfilling performances--each original, individual, heart-breaking and realistic as they come to grips with their fates as the victims of a power-mad corporation that believes Eugenics will save the world.As for ""Monday"" the premise is stale and cheesy, and the script and acting don't measure up. Try Elizabeth Moss as Offred in The Handmaid's Tale or Maslany in Orphan Black, and you'll want to delve into the real politics of overpopulation in the world today, because they make it so pressing.",What Happened to Monday

I haven't read the book and the story is not so distant. At first seems kind of boring but then gets quite intense and thrilling. The final is not what you'd expect. Maybe the story is not so accurate with real problems, but come on! it's Sci-Fi, not a documentary. The acting is wonderful, if Oscars were not preconfigured to drama, Noomi Rapace at least would be nominated. She portraits seven different personalities, seven different aspects, virtually seven different personas in one set. Which even though has some slight flaws is quite an acting showcase. And that needs to be applauded. (Trust me she did better than Legend, the Tom Hardy one with the twins). Directors, editors and photography did a great job mixing one person into seven, again, had some flaws but was good work and needs to be applauded.

The premise is a near future where over-population has lead to a shortage of resources. In order to remedy this a world-wide policy of one child per family is introduced. The story begins where identical septuplets have managed to fool the Child Allocation Bureau for 30 years and then one does not return, hence the title of the film.One of the failures is the characterization, there are 7 distinct personalities in play but the differences are so extreme that it is implausible that to think that to the outside world they would seem like one person and for roughly 23years keeping up the act.Maybe it was supposed to be an action movie, but the action sequences are not well planned and also many of the scenes lead to dead ends so you feel you wasted some time following a particular plot path.Thus (5/10)",What Happened to Monday

Acting from Noomi is just excellent. One time she is hot, and some scenes later repulsive. Rare when a woman can be beautiful and ugly at the same time that well ;)Let's get to the message that bothers me a lot. In a future where cities are boundless, pollution, starvation, nature is eviscerated to its final boundaries but ohh the children!

And what a better way to demonize the communist one-child policy than weaving it in a gloomy story where 7 female siblings have to hide their existence forever. I have to say that the story of this movie is unique, for it invokes your sympathy with the 7 identical siblings. The fact that you must hide all your life with no real identity, and are only allowed to go out once a week on the day you're named after, is pretty painful and depressing. Noomi Rapace's performance was incredible. It reminds me of the talents of Uma Therman in 'Kill Bill' and Sigourney Weaver in her epic days. The movie raises an indirect question. Is it true that love can conquer everything? We see that the CAB officer gets attached to one of the siblings, that's Saturday. Although we didn't see enough of what urges him to risk his life in order to save her, he defies everything for her. Perhaps it proves that love is blind. It sure is in this case.

The dialogue is wooden and bland at best, most times is quite horrible.
Noomi has done some great performances, this is not one of them. Maybe she did the best with the script, dialogue and the direction she got, I don't know?Sometimes she is doing an ok up to fine job and other times it's a bit cringeworthy and mediocre to be honest. It doesn't help that her english still after all this time has a big shining sign connected to it that says: ""Hey, I'm from Sweden"".
The twist and the mini-twist are so easy to spot you could be sitting playing something on your phone half the time and still see it coming a mile away.
Everything is glossed over and rushed through, so you don't have time to get to know any of the characters, therefore i'ts hard to really care that much about them.

225,MarcoOkka,2 in 1 = 5,5,14 December 2017,"This movie I have to judge as if it was two movies in one. One that gains 10 stars out of ten and another that only gets one. Why?The good part of this movie is the idea, Noomi and the technical execution. The bad part is the unfitting depiction of the society and its problems.
The ""one child"" theme is oversizes in the backdrop of the movie. Unrealistic and sloppy depiction of a society that have been facing child birth restriction for more than 30 years. It should be more subtle reality, not so ""in your face"" as the makers made it. The ugly van for example takes me back to futuristic depictions from the 80's. I feel sorry for Glen Close, a totally unrealistic political villain with amateurish lines. The ""villains lair"" and its props are once again a trip back to the 80's futuristic cliché or a Austin Powers movie. Based on this I would give only one star out of ten but I don't.The good part is the other story. The siblings, their ordeals and how they cope with a for sure unrealistic'ish situation but still interesting. It opens up a intrigue that frames the real good action parts. Noomi Rapace is given an exiting role (or actually seven roles) to interpreter and this is what makes this movie worth the effort to watch. It feels effortless and simple, easy bought, which makes it believable but that is an illusion. Noomi's acting skills and likely the directors focus on her roles and their parts in the story is brilliant. It could be a problem for the audience to separate the siblings, all played by same actor, but not in this movie. Watching this movie it IS seven different persons in action. Not over played and not to much based on props etc. Noomi works hard and does it right. The acting of the other actors becomes unimportant except for Close's poor performance/direction/script. Willem Dafoe delivers but on the other hand, not the most advanced part. Marwan Kenzari is a side-side kick so expectations not that high and his acting works though it is some times fumble except in the action scenes.
Taking away all the scenes where ""one child"" theme is over represented and sketchy depicted the movie would be much better. If the director had put some creative elbow grease in to the visualization of the world the siblings lived in the movie would have been a masterpiece. The action and the story about the siblings got all the gas while the story's biotope got only fumes.
I hope some one in the future picks up on this original story - its possibilities - and produce a remake where the whole story spectra is granted the same craftsmanship in its making that this movie only got parts of.I award this movie five stars out of ten but I still recommend it.

The film is in a sci-fi setting but the story is more of a philosophical one. There are no true heroes or villains in this story, only people doing their best to survive in the world they're put in. We get to see this story unfolds in the views of 7 sisters all played brilliantly by Noomi Rapace, she made me a fan in this movie. The movie makes you questions yourself on what is right and wrong. What if you're born into a world where you're a criminal just for being born? What if you have such a child? What if you have to enforce cruel laws for the survival of the specie?

I am a man and I enjoyed this.
Firstly, the two actresses, the adult and female actresses who played the respective sibblings as a child and as an adult, are truly gifted actresses.Playing 7 individual characters in one film is no easy feat !!!Next is the action. The action directing was FANTASTIC !! Finally a movie with an average sized woman, where she doesn't unrealistically beat men twice her size. Here we actually see the women struggle as they try to escape the highly trained mercenary men sent to eliminate then. They get tossed around, beat up, injured, and you can see the sheer fight for survival and teamwork keeping them alive.
Feminists need to realize that, whilst it may be empowering to show a woman with no powers somehow defeating trained soldiers....its totally unrealistic and fake, it makes the movie stupid.But when you make the fight realistic, showing the actual strength difference between men and women, and show how your female hero accomodates for it....then....that makes for great action.I wish all 7 sibblings survived the film. That's to show you how much the actress made me feel I was watching 7 different people (even if I knew it was one actress)....but she gets in little nuances that shows the individuality so flawlessly, she makes the audience believe that she is 7 people.",What Happened to Monday

But one day ""Monday"" doesn't come home from work...Starting brilliantly as a simple mystery, then switching to complex thriller, the pace doesn't let up as it consistently ramps up the action. Brutal at times, this is not a movie to cut away from the action when many others would. Blunt comparison?

235,tsode,What happened to my two hours?,5,4 March 2019,"A far-fetched, though somewhat interesting concept is marred by artless direction and plot holes galore, in this dystopian overpopulation potboiler.Looking every bit a made-for-TV movie, What Happened To Monday is violent, ludicrous and only occasionally thought-provoking. But only if your brain comes pre-formatted with low expectations, and free of critical thought.Willem Dafoe is the father of 7 identical daughters, in a world where siblings have been outlawed due to dwindling food and resources. Managing to raise them in secret, we flash forward to the 7 adult women (all played by Noomi Rapace) spending their lives hiding in an apartment with only 1 venturing into society each day, and always under the same shared identity.This silly, though superficially amusing ""what if"" quickly descends into a dim-bulb action farce once their secret is found out, and an endless procession of ""Population Allocation"" goons come to hunt them down, lest their existence be an embarrassment to the leader of an organisation (or government?) committed to reducing world population.Yes, the entire plot of the film would not have taken place, were it not for one person's ""embarrassment"".Glenn Close (looking oddly fake in corporate weave and garb) hams it up for a few lines as aforementioned leader, rounding up excess ""siblings"" (a word snarled throughout the film) for forced incarceration. She's putting them all in cryo freeze though - with the promise of future revival once the population has become more manageable. Or something.The main event though of course, is Noomi Rapace, who throws everything into the role of 7 subtly different characters, each named after a day of the week (corresponding to the day they go out - see what they did there?). Though its frequently hard to tell which is which, or even remember what name each one has.But even Noomi's considerable efforts cannot distract from a barrage of gaping plot holes.In this dystopia, most of the population just seems to march about comfortably in business suits heading to and from offices. Yet the streets are surrounded by armoured future-cars and riot police. And when whole apartment blocks explode or are raided by SWAT teams, and bystanders are shot... there's barely a whiff of widespread panic or uprising?The end result just doesn't carry. Too silly to believe, yet played oh-so-earnestly - right to the last messy shootout, or embarrassing death scene. The twists also pile-on - as if the writers just didn't know when to stop.This film might have worked better as a completely over the top satire (think: Robocop).

236,tim-935,Seven into one does go.,8,2 January 2018,"What Happened To Monday is a tour de force of action and character definition, given that seven of the principles are the same actor.Noomi Rapace plays seven sisters born into the hellish world of single child politics future. Mad Max meets Soylent Green. Glenn Close is the baddie, reminding one of Jayneway from Star Trek Voyager. This incarnation, however, is political intrigue at its finest.The seven sisters avoid the dubious fate of cryogenic stasis by granddad Willem Defoe's intrigue of not only naming them after the days of the week, but also allowing them out only on their named day. The sisters are supposed to form a cohesive personality so as to go undetected in the scanning, high tech world outside their top floor flat.Of course, seven women just can't do it. Squabbles and differences arise. Most of the film is set when the women are in their early thirties, and Noomi Rapace portrays the various sisters' differing characteristics with flair and imagination.We are used to computer generated effects by now, so accept the multiple characters interacting. Bleak dystopian backdrops are taken as read, as are the flashes of technical wizardry that will seem quaint in a few year's time.Whilst we are drawn into the action, identifying with the lead character, multi-faceted as she is, and her only friend, the film does not draw upon emotion. The first five minutes, setting the scene will resonate with some, and the last few moments will appeal to the mother impulse in us all. However, the torturous trail blazed in between is a mix of action machismo and Gaia loveliness. Neither mode hits the mark.What Happened to Monday is an appealing, well crafted watch, but fails to reach the heights that the concept deserves.",What Happened to Monday

Would've loved if it had a longer runtime, some more insight about the 7 sisters could've gone a long way in nailing the emotional portion of the movie, must still, beggers can't be choosers.I saw some reviews saying ""I didn't expect this"", ""surprised me""... It's not hard to figure that Monday was the one that gave them up. True, the reason isn't given away until the end, but it was easy to speculate until then: she wanted to be her own self, to not having to share her image and her achievements. The pregnancy was ...at most meh, the movie didn't invest more in announcing that to us, so I didn't care, if she just wanted to be the only one, it would've been enough for a reason for her actions, personal opinion.

Here Noomi Rapace is also a great choice, her chameleon like changing is fault I could only remember her from Alien movies and not the ones before (like Girl with Dragon Tatoo movies,..). Willem Dafoe and Glen Close (her faint is wonderful) are nice as always.
There are instances, where you can guess budget was not big (like cars), yet they still made good effort of convincing the audience it was set in an overpopulated metropolis (I first thought it was filmed in Hong Kong, instead in Romania, with some interesting buildings). Script also made some nice turns, if you can get over the fact that forcible (under skin?) contraception might have been easier choice to implement than ""freezing"" children. That already happened in India, one-child-policy is known from China. Interesting also to see main character die (many times, even!). Just bank donation I didn't understand - girls were just employees, no?
Still, not a bad movie, not at all, and I'm gonna be looking for Noomi from now on.. (interesting how very great or bad reviews movie got here - interesting movies divide the most..)",What Happened to Monday

245,themoondweller,The theme of futuristic films are mostly based on backwards ideologies. This one is no exception!,2,10 June 2018,"* Contains Mild Spoiler *The positives:
Interesting story
Really amazing performance by the lead actor RapaceThe problems:
* Overpopulation usually opens the gate for modern ""slavery"" where lots of children, women, men fall prey to sex industry.. The harm and death these human beings suffer is exceedingly massive.
Does this movie show the true face of overpopulation? NO!
The only inhumane act this movie presents is forcing people not to over breed like cockroaches so humans can live like humans again without having to resort to horrid things like cannibalism due to lack of food (which is another realistic outcome of overpopulation) or selling their own children for few bucks.* They have mirrors that are smarter than our state of the art PCs. But the futuristic regime in this movie has to resort to medieval methods to prevent excessive birth!
I was first thinking they should get a reward for the immense lack of imagination! But then I realized that most movies/shows in certain countries focus on certain themes repeatedly because of the ideology/religion dominant there. Christian America would of course have more negative feelings towards prevention of birth than to the realistic outcome of excessive population, where the value of human beings has become so low that even finding dead bodies of children have become a daily regular incident!
In our age, even since few decades ago, prevention of conception has been far easier than enabling conception! It would only make sense that with some ""egg disabler"" or ""manipulator"", implant or bracelet if you like, they should be able to prevent the occurence of pregnancy to begin with!! But no. We have to see how horrible birth prevention is because there is no other way than already born humans being killed to cut down the population!! Also, this is the most horrible thing according to the movie! Not to let them die ""naturally"" in the hands of malnourishment, diseases from lack of hygiene or non-toxic materials, abuse from parents/society who are already psychologically damaged, so many children abducted and who knows enduring what...* They still have the famous old fashioned ""American"" guns. They have trouble finding food but guns? No problem, still being manufactured thanks to amendment loving corporations. The actors only open a drawer and the gun is there fully loaded! No need to ponder over how in such strictly control regime they can get their hands on an ""old fashioned"" typical American gun?
I have already given up on this gun thing disappearing on screens because I realized that the gun corporations or lobbies are financing the movie/show productions. They are sponsoring them. That is why in all those futuristic movies/shows while people can't find water or even another human being, can easily find all sorts of guns with endless ammunition! And the directors/story writers have to place these guns in the movie even if their existence defies ""normal"" logic!The movie has some other plot holes and I saw they were already addressed to by other reviewers. But the ones I mentioned, especially the first and the second, were the most obvious and illogical plot holes in my opinion because the entire movie were based on them",What Happened to Monday
246,criticrasdvatri,"Is your life your own to live, or are you subservient to government?",9,29 December 2019,"This is an excellent, thought-provoking movie set in a dystopian overpopulated future somewhere in Europe. On the one hand we see seven female protagonists, septuplets, whom we get to know as sweet young children, and whom we wish well as adults as they hide, to avoid detection due to government one child policy. We cheer as they fight for their right to life, as individuals, when government has said six of them have no right to exist at all due to overpopulation and a one child policy. The women must hide in their apartment and only one can be seen at a time, We cheer when agency goons are sent to cryofreeze or exterminate them and the women prevail and have a few short victories ( illustrated in a lot of action sequences and terrific acting by Noomi Rapoce in seven roles). We are upset when some of the sisters have a less successful struggle and land up dead.
But what are we cheering for? The premise of the movie is that unless people have only on child, the overpopulated earth will perish due to lack of resources, so government forcibly enforces this policy by rounding up ""siblings"" and eliminating them so that others can eat. The future of the world as dictated by senior leaders is too important to allow emotion and sentimentality to permit siblings to exist, much less allow them to have twins.
There are plenty of plot twists in this thriller which, combined with Rapose's fantastic acting, make the movie worthwhile for that alone, but the bigger message is the ethical conflict of rights that is illustrated, individual vs. Government, life vs. Death, fighting back or dying for the good of a future world where tyrannical and powerful figures masquerade as benevolent agency heads and politicians but are not keen to tell the public the whole truth about what is going on, and who manipulate and con the masses.

She is the highlight of this movie by a long shot and should be commended for her work.The story and writing however, leaves a great deal to be desired and raises serious questions about the agendas of the writers.Addressing the writing, it's drab, predicable, and is a simple repetition of various dystopian story elements and character stereotypes everyone has been exposed to ad nauseam. It's filmed competently, lighting, color palette, etc are decent enough. Camera angles are bland, as is editing, but it's there's nothing wrong with any of that.The problem, aside from the utter lack of originality and predictability, is the premise and agenda behind the agenda. Scientists are almost always portrayed both badly and notoriously inaccurately in films and environmentalists even more so. This takes those trends and ramps them up to what looks like it comes directly from a right-wing conspiracy theory about how Green, liberal, scientists are taking over the world and going to destroy life as we know it.This is a bullshit message we all hear repeated incessantly on talk shows and by bough-and-paid-for pundits all the time, and even more so in recent times (even by political ""leaders"") given some of the shifts in political control in recent years and the attempts at demonetization of opponents to those shifts. Frankly I'm tired of hearing that sort of garbage, no matter what package it comes in.It's a shame because the film had potential, despite it's hackneyed premise, and Noomi Rapace does a fantastic job in her roles.",What Happened to Monday

254,LimbleKite,A Big Bang That Goes Bust,6,5 February 2018,"This film had a lot of promise, but it veers off course pretty rapidly. Let's recap. Seven septuplet (is that redundant?) sisters conveniently named. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. live together in a rooftop apartment. Each can only go out into the world on their namesake day because it's against the law to have siblings. Overpopulation, scare resources, all of that stuff. You know the drill. No more double cheeseburgers.At the end of each day, that day's sister - who has ventured forth under the singular identity of Karen Settman - must pow wow with the other six on that day's events so that everybody's up to speed in keeping up the illusion of a single person.By the way, when siblings are discovered by the Child Allocation Bureau (which also doubles as high tech SWAT and Gestapo), they are placed in a frozen sleep chamber until that magical day in the distant future when all food production problems are solved and their pretty little fleshes may be thawed.Being a somewhat predictable sort of film, the absolute second that the cryo sleep commercial comes on screen with the friendly tech guy delivering the punch line ""awake to a better world"", you know it's bull. They're killing the kids. You'd have to be asleep yourself not to see that coming.Anyway, each of the seven sisters has a distinct personality, and within their apartment world, can express it. Outside, they must conform, but inside they can have red hair, blond hair, short hair, long hair. Many kudos (or more precisely, seven kudos) to Noomi Rapace for pulling off seven roles.Things start to fall apart when Monday doesn't come home one night and Tuesday goes out the next day to look for her. Since their singular alter ego Karen Settman works at a bank, Tuesday heads straight to the office and asks her secretary ""Where did I go after work last night?"" Quite the sort of thing that a secretary is used to hearing no doubt and therefore without batting a single eyelash tells Tuesday where Monday went.At the bar where Monday went, Tuesday asks the barkeep ""Was I here long last night?"" and ""Who was I with?"", again quite normal questions for a barkeep, at least in this dystopian future. Clues drift down.All films must have a villain. In this case, it's Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close) who runs CAB and doesn't have the dry humor it would take to come to work in a taxi. Later, after her inevitable downfall, she'll say something like Jack Nicholson's ""you can't handle the truth"" because it's a Hollywood rule or something. Like Tom Cruise on a motorcycle.Anyway, Cayman cannot let the world know that seven siblings survived for 30 years. It would destroy her reputation. So, the goons of CAB need to get rid of the sisters and ""keep it quiet."" By the way, if you look up ""quiet"" in the dictionary, you probably won't find: enter the foyer of the apartment building, shoot the doorman in the head, bust down the apartment door, fire automatic weapons in all directions. Later, after many harrowing escapades and quite a few gruesome deaths, the head blond goon is just outside the apartment door ready to burst in and kill the last of the nasty when nerd tech sister Friday launches her deadly gas/microwave oven attack that incinerates her and literally blows the entire top floor of the building to bits. Buys some escape time for sister Thursday down in the alley who uses it instead to moan and wail among the falling ashes. Also gives the viewer time to wonder why gas lines in the movies never need a crescent wrench.Al least it's good riddance to obnoxious head blond goon guy who was last seen flying backwards into the void engulfed by overwhelming force, flame and fury. Well, that's what you'd think, but perhaps he had some sort of high tech body lotion smeared on his sensitive parts because about 10 seconds later he's down in the lobby barking orders.Well, you get the idea. Over the top for over the top's sake. Still, it's an enjoyable flick in many ways thanks to Noomi Rapace and other good performances. But don't expect sensible responses from sensible characters.

258,wogsurfer,Another in the pantheon of great dystopian films.,8,26 August 2017,"If you were to go through my movie collection, you would find an eclectic mix of films. One of the most prevalent in the mix of genres & sub-genres, I have many that are post apocalyptic/futuristic dystopian world films. Its the kind of film I love exploring, as its a look at not only our possible future, but a look at ourselves now, and where we are heading should we continue down certain paths. In the tradition of some of the great films like the classics Blade Runner, and Total Recall, to more modern tales like Equilibrium, and Children of Men comes What Happened to Monday. Set in a future where food resources are drastically low due to overpopulation, a sinister organization responsible for implementing a one-child policy by taking all subsequent sibling to be cryogenically frozen until such a time when resources are enough to cover everyone. Terrence Settman (Dafoe) finds himself in a rather precarious position with the birth of setuplets, granddaughters, whose mother dies during labour. Naming them after each day of the week, he makes the dangerous decision of taking them all in to his care, raising them in secret, and taking all necessary precautions to ensure that they live in secret. When the girls have grown to an age where he feels comfortable, and confident that they are aware of the dangers of the outside world, and the consequences of anything that could mean the secret being uncovered, he allows each girl to go out on the day after which they were named, ie; Monday on Monday, Tuesday on Tuesday, and so on, and so forth. The girls each live their day outside as one Karen Settman. As is the case with any group of children, the girls exhibit an array of personality traits from shy and demure to outgoing and rebellious, with the rebel of the seven causing a uncomfortable, and lasting, consequence for the other six siblings when she goes out on a day that she was not designated to do so, and suffers a painful injury. Fast forward some 30 years we find that the girls have grown to adulthood successfully in secret, and while inside they exhibit their own personalities, do their own thing, and keep their own interests, they work very well together maintaining the life of Karen Settman out in the world. This is largely down to nightly debriefings from the one who went out that day, so that the others are aware of their role to maintain their cover. This all works perfectly until Monday doesn't come home from work, leaving her sisters extremely worried about what could have happened to her, and Tuesday going blind to what is waiting for her outside, with no knowledge of the previous days happenings. It is now up to Tuesday and her sisters to figure out what happened to Monday. The thing I love most about this film is it's concept, its what I love about the genre in general, as a dystopian future story can lend itself to anything that can cause a dystopia to happen, over population causing implementation of restricted breeding, or emotions being banned so that people don't fight, and cause war. I also love the performances of Noomi, and Clara in the two stages of the girls' lives, the seven nuanced personalities demanded such range from both to capture the essence of the seven sisters, but also the prime character of Karen. What also impressed me about this film, is the way in which the seven different characters were juxtaposed in the scenes they were together in. In no way was this done cheaply, or nasty, and definitely did not come off cheesy.",What Happened to Monday

In this case, even with poor writing and execution (in direction), I gave first a 5, because of the decent artistic direction, but downgraded it to 4 after all, because the writing is that bad.

I had polarizing feelings questioning myself how haven't I heard of this movie if it was so brilliant. But then I read the summary and I got excited. Only now I can tell that how far from the truth I was. 
Things I did not buy: Since the very beginning until the end there was no reason to care about anyone in this movie. People keep dieing for no reason. 3 sisters already died and they keep trying to rescue monday. People are expected to believe that in over populated world they put children to sleep instead of killing. Government that control population in order for human race to survive is portrayed as evil villains who go against living. 
Acting is decent, film is good looking, unfortunately it can't make up for all the flaws in plot, character development.

Though each of the seven identical sisters is supposed to be unique (one slutty, one brainy, etc.), they're sketchy at best. Rapace brings as much depth as she can to them in the little time each holds the screen.

Well, I'll start by saying you should give it a look and that Noomi Rapace is excellent.This movie had both some great elements and some less interesting. The backstory is great and so is the moral dilemma that it brings with it. However, the movie quickly take a standard action flic turn and it made it that the middle to end part was boring in some parts. Some scene are really inventive and I am happy to have been able to see them. However, the supporting cast, while good, is criminally underused and some chase scenes could have been cut to develop them a bit which would have helped us to go through the movie. The Seven Sisters all have a single attribute to represent them, but I can easily forgive that to the film because developping 7 leads must be increadibly hard.Overall, I don't regret seeing it, I had a good time for the first and third act, but the second bored me.

276,ElphieDefyingGravity,"Great!!! But then again, just okay.",7,21 August 2017,"WHAT HAPPENED TO Monday is a great, clunky, fascinating and silly dystopian thriller set in a future where population has spiraled out of control. I was immediately sucked into the film...I like this genre and loved Naomi Rapace in the Swedish ""Girl Who..."" series. To see her play seven distinct yet identical personalities? Awesome! From the beginning, with Glenn Close as Dr. Nicolette Cayman, the calm yet forceful Doctor/politician who is attempting to save the world...this movie made perfect sense. Until it didn't that is. And that became apparent quite early on. SPOILERS! To summarize; WHAT HAPPENED TO Monday (known from this point on as WHTM) is set in a bleak future where population explosion and global warming have nearly destroyed the world. To battle hunger and starvation, plants and animals have been genetically altered to produce bigger results. The unfortunate byproduct of this is a massive rise in multiple births. Glenn Close's Doctor/politician designs a protocol to deal with these millions of new mouths to feed...one child per family. Any siblings born before or after the protocol must be put into ""Cryosleep"", destined to sleep until ""things got better"". Apparently 30 years will do the trick.Our heroines arrive as seven identical girls whose mother, Karen Settman, dies in childbirth. Their grandfather, apparently a political bigwig of some kind, is called and arrives ready to take all of the babies, obviously against the new laws, and raise them in secret. He names the girls after the days of the week...Monday, Tuesday, and so on. When the girl become old enough to start school, they each go out into the world on the day they were named for. They had already received Grandpa's expert instruction in subjects ranging from computer design to Kung-Fu (or some kind of self defense), so obviously Kindergarten was a snap. From this point on, things become muddled. Their Grandfather, played by William Dafoe, the only person they have known since birth, speaks with an American accent. The young girls speak with an English accent. The grown sisters, all played by Rapace, speak with a Swedish accent. This was an obvious mistake and a dumb one as well...how hard would it have been to match these accents? The action begins when Monday fails to return home one evening. Despite the rule to never enter the city at the same time, Tuesday leaves to search for her sister. It becomes obvious that the government, and more specifically Close's Dr. Cayman, are involved in Monday's disappearance. The girls fight to save themselves, losing a few siblings along the way. They ultimately learned what happened to Monday...she had sold them out. A few more surprises occur along the way, but since the Director of WHTM telegraphs every play, it's easy to guess where the movie is heading.Acting is the strong suit of WHTM, beginning with a performance for the ages by Naomi Raspar, who gives each of the identical siblings their own personality. The CGI that places the siblings together within the frame is top notch and Rapace does an amazing job acting with herself. Close is solid as always, but I've seen this persona in a few other films, i.e. THE GIRL WITH ALL THE GIFTS and THE STEPFORD WIVES. Dafoe is Dafoe, playing the same guy I've seen him play in every film I've seen him in. Additional goofs occur, my favorite happening at the end of the movie during a fancy political party when a dirty, disheveled Tuesday devises a plan to attend and confront Monday. Magically Tuesday appears minutes later, make-up and hair perfect, wearing a dress that is practically identical to Mondays. Despite these silly continuity problems, WHTM is a great popcorn movie, fast moving and interesting. If for no other reason, see WHTM for the truly stellar performance by Naomi Rapace. 8 STARS",What Happened to Monday

I really like Noomi Rapace and since her character from Prometheus was killed of in the sequel (the Covenant ""masterpiece"") has started a renewal of the interest in her movies (seen almost). Of course the grade is more for her not the movie (which might have been a 6ish), but it was not awful for what was, a relative cheap almost straight to video thriller. Of course it has plot holes and clichés, but look at the director (2 zombie Nazi movies and one about adult Hansel and Gretel fighting who knows what) and 2 almost anonymous writers. It did not promise anything and I feel that it delivered on a few things, unlike Alien Covenant.Maybe you could have guessed that Monday betrayed the rest of the sisters but could you have known why. And the end is it really a happy one, as without the killing of the siblings the problem of population will resurface with a vengeance.

It's a Dystopian World movie where the streets are clean and the government is evil.Noomi Rapace is marvelous as seven very different sisters. I loved her in the original, subtitled 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' and I loved her just as much in this movie. (She's not an native English speaking actress, but nevertheless, has NO ACCENT at all.) Granted, as other reviewers have said, nothing is mindblowingly different from other futuristic, dystopian film worlds, but it's done very well.And it's a Netflix movie!

284,pisarenco-a,Worst piece of redneck propaganda ever,3,26 August 2017,"So the movie basically starts off with saying that GMOs are bad and that they cause mutations in humans and whatever, that leads to a global catastrophe, and a dystopia where the characters find themselves in.Get that? GMO!Next.For some reason people have never heard of abortion, probably because it's bad. In this futuristic high-tech society it's impossible to predict the number of babies in a mothers womb, and impossible to abort all but one. At the end of the movie, 2 embryos who don't even show as a tummy, are equated to actual human beings.Get that? Pregnancy is God-given, abortion is a sin, an embryo that was a zygote a week ago is a human being, important enough to sacrifice 6 of your siblings for.Next.So how to save the Earth? Well, some mean old scientists, and Obama, told everyone that there is overpopulation, so they have to freeze the children. And of course scientists are evil, and science is evil, and scientists lie, and children of course get incinerated instead.Get that? Scientists are evil liars, and if you give them your children, they'll burn in hell fire.Next.So acting was bad, I didn't care that much that someone died in the movie, and it was just ... meh... senseless.Conclusions: GMOs cause the apocalypse, abortion isn't an option, a zygote is a human being, scientists are bad and they eat children for breakfast.Splendid!The only reason there is a 3, is because I have to consider that one actress played 7 roles in this movie, and even having that movie on screens is an achievement for such an actress.P.S. Villains always wait for you to understand what's going on, turn around on the chair for a bit, before they land a bullet in your head while you're trying to say ""I love you"".

Accordingly, the sisters are forced to live secretly from every one and go out into the streets one by one, so that no one suspects that something is wrong with their family.
I understand that the main focus in the film was put on action and entertainment, but I didn't feel enough drama in the movie, and the gloomy world of the future was shown superficially.

Kudos to the writing/direction/technical teams that let one actor play seven characters in the same room at the same time. Nominations for Noomi's hair, makeup, wardrobe.But I'd like to take a stab at the premise without getting spoilery. Let's take a moment to think about population control movies. ZPG, Logan's Run, and Soylent Green come to mind. They all pose a conflict between a harsh response to the threats of overpopulation with a personal, human response to being subject to those controls. In ""What Happened To Monday?"" the previews show you a world where One-Child-Per-Family laws mean surplus children are frozen by the state awaiting a better future. Our heroes are seven siblings breaking that law, living an underground life, cooped up in their flat. Except for their day each week where each gets to live outside. Thirty years pass. Complications ensue.I enjoyed it, beginning to end. The structure is a little bit SaveTheCat for a European production. It's a flat out mystery/thriller, with memorable characters, a brisk tempo, a great set for their Anne Frank home, and more than a few twists that feel natural. I especially enjoyed seeing nearly every sibling dynamic played out, and their love for each other. A good way to spend two hours.",What Happened to Monday
290,camcullensmith,Expect action over philosophy and you'll have a good time,8,13 March 2021,"Great plot taken from a short story published on Tumblr. Noomie Rapace gets a whole lot of role to play with given the seven different parts, and did a stellar job with it. Pleased that this was also backed up by the acting vetrans Glenn Close and Willam Defoe, without brilliant acting it would be easier to get pulled out of the somewhat unrealistic general senario. However it kept me enthralled until the end.Action seens were strong and suspensful. Score kept it going and the editing didnt leave any moment to stop too much. Sure, if you want to sit there and pick it apart then its not difficult to find plot holes, but its a hell of a lot tighter than some other two hour movies ive seen. Typically theres at least 5-10 minutes that could be cut but in this they do really make the most of the run time.Also, a 20 mill budget went a hell of a long way! No its not The Matrix, nor is going to go down as an absolute great, but it knew what it was and decided not to go too deep. If the director wanted to they could have delved into deeper waters to really dig into the 'identity' and 'sense of self' themes but in many ways im glad they didnt. It kept it moving and i had a lot of fun watching. Act one got the exposition out of the way effectively and you do need to suspend some disbelief, but im glad it didnt bolt on another 20 minutes trying to explain every detail of the dystopia. Instead it prioritised the main plot and some top notch suspense and action scenes. Albeit at the sacrafice of some character development across the board, but with seven main characters and in a world of overpopulation, not getting into the meat of every character is okay by me.A few easily spotted plot errors, and it wouldnt take a genius to guess that ""evil agency is evil"" minor twist, but it didnt detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.Knew what it wanted to be and executed it well.",What Happened to Monday

If I hadn't been bored out of my mind, I would never have given this movie a chance based on that.Boy, was I wrong. The movie initially looked like confirming my prejudice, though it already started to look less budget, more like a Stan Lee type of movie. But it got better and better, and wow... action, love, romance, it was all there. The acting by Noomi was so superb, it made me look her up on IMDb just to see if I was right about her slight Spanish accent. And while she has Spanish blood, I guess it's more Swedish. But she's indeed a great actress.I expected to find a very high score for this movie, but was surprised to see a relatively low score. I think the story could've been better, which is why I gave this only 9 out of 10. But the great acting and even the special effects made up for it. Since I didn't know much about this actress, I was surprised but believed the twins were real, only to read in the credits that they were all one.

the evil government tracks the moves of everyone, at any time, but they somehow miss the x7 food consumption of a single person for 30 years.
basically, the movie says ""don't question it"" about once a minute.2. at no point in the plot do the characters know what they're doing or why. they have no plan, neither the ""heroes"" nor the ""bad guys"" make sense. i could write pages here.3. the tech. this is another inconsistent mess. retina scanners can somehow not tell the siblings apart, until at one point, they suddely can. all goverment systems can be hacked without effort within seconds. it's 2073 or so, but drones? no. self driving cars? no. robots? no.

Disappointingly it slowly lost it from there. I really began to get distracted by questions which never seemed to get answered. The film starts with Terrence Settman (Willem Dafoe) – the grandfather – deciding to raise all seven septuplets in a futuristic world where it's illegal to have siblings. The earth has undergone catastrophic events in the likes of global warming and overpopulation. In an effort to fix these issues the Child Allocation Bureau was created and ran to maintain a one child per family law. I was immediately impressed by the performance of Noomi Rapace as The Settman Sibilings. Each sibling with her own personality and look played by the same actress cannot be easy to pull off. Noomi's portrayal of each was believable, but there were times where the most noticeable differences between them was their wardrobe. I enjoyed seeing the personalities of each sister, but it was an inevitability that some would stand out more than others. The writers Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson had me wanting to ask if there was a real reason to have seven siblings other than naming them after the days of the week. Decisions like these that ignored obvious issues is what plagued this film the most. The moments where the film shined the most were the scenes we saw the relationship between the seven girls and their grandfather Terrence. The lengths that he went to in order to ensure their safety and own self-preservation were admirable and touching. Willem Dafoe brought a strong performance when he could, but another mistake was the under- use of his character in the whole of the plot. However I did appreciate how the extremes of the families' situation were never underplayed and really showed through the eyes of their grandfather's role as their mentor. Where this film bombed and really couldn't come back from was the plethora of plot holes. If it wasn't for this review being a non- spoiler I could list ten plus moments that had me questioning, is this possible? From technology to just characters simply not noticing the obvious, it felt the writers were simply ignoring these issues and assuming the audience would never notice. The film's runtime was two hours and three minutes and I would have gladly watched another ten or fifteen minutes of explanations to solve most of these issues. Overall I felt this film had a lot of potential and a few good moments, but fell on its face tripped by its own mistakes. Compared to Tommy Wirkola's (Director) other works this was a step up, but clearly he has room to improve. The futuristic setting was believable, but the cinematography was nothing to call home about. Acting was good enough to keep you immersed, but the script had obvious issues that removed you from the world. In the end What Happened to Monday satisfied my sci-fi itch but left me scratching my head.",What Happened to Monday

The premise was so poorly established to really justify why this brutal one child policy was necessary, and there was little done to demonstrate the harsh realities of this attempted dystopia. The movie spends very little time exploring what 7 people living a single public life would actually look like, and it seems completely uninterested in some of the implications of it even as it tries to bring it up again once the movie has degenerated into one of the dumbest run and guns I've ever had the misfortune of witnessing.The protagonists are supposed to have an ""important"" daily meeting where they go through every thing each of them has done during the day. However, the first time we see the grown heroes they immediately mess up and interaction with their doorman. This only gets worse when several of them are shocked to know the ""party animal"" of the seven is a virgin, which is something they very obviously should have known about, additionally there is a surprise reveal of a secret boyfriend. All of these things would be forgivable if it was a side plot or a funny moment, however these are core plot points which end up being antithetical to the core premise of the movie. There's basically no evidence throughout the movie that provides any convincing proof that these seven individuals would actually make it this far into the brutal society.Finally the big ""reveal"" at the end of the movie is neither surprising nor an interesting take on the ""one child policy"". While tackling dystopian fiction the creators burden themselves with creating a thoughtful commentary on society, and this movie doesn't even attempt to deliver this. The film neither explores the ramifications of extreme overpopulation nor the visible benefits of a harsh one child policy, leading to a completely one dimensional film which simply expresses the belief that ""killing children is bad"" but ""killing armed guards is okay""This movie is simply laughably awful and the screenplay is 150% to blame. The acting is great and the production pulls off one actor playing 7 roles admirably, but the plot didn't make sense and no care was put into developing the characters or the world. The 6.9 rating this movie has currently suggests that this movie is a flawed but enjoyable action movie; this is far too generous.

In a near future the world is overpopulated and as a step to saving the planet every family is only aloud one child. The story follows seven sisters who are trying to survive. When one of them disappear the others try to solve the mystery. Review
After watching the movie my first thought was: why hasn't it got a higher rating on IMDB? Which made me write my first review:The plot was good but quite predictable and the theme was a bit clique except for the seven sisters which puts a fresh and interesting twist on it. But I think the good aspects of this movie heavily overweights the bad. Noomi Rapace does a outstanding work as the seven siblings, and sure it got a little bit confused as you didn't get a lot of character development. But in this rare chase I think more character development would make the film worse. She got me emotionally attached to them all as a group, and that was enough. The shooting of one actor playing seven roles was superb, I was really impressed. The photography overall was good. I didn't think so much of the script maybe because I was quite tired when I watched it or it didn't give me any impression which means it was neither super good or bad.There is a lot of action and I am not a big fan of excessive action scenes but it never bothered me in Seven Sisters. Because of the good acting and story I found myself on the edge of my seat more than one time. The mix of action, drama and crime was really good.Overall a really good movie that I would recommend. Just Rapace acting makes the whole movie worthwhile. It's not a film that will stick in my mind for days but it sucked me in whole and made me forget everything except for the fate of the sisters which is exactly what I want form a sci fi movie.",What Happened to Monday

Poor actors have been given brainless lines that do not let them deliver any acting whatsoever, but this is mitigated by the fact that half of the movie is dedicated to pure action with a lot of gratuitous gore scenes.I am left wondering why somebody would decide to spend so much money on creating a movie featuring A-class actors, and just slap the most inane script ever written. Life is too short to spend two hours in front of this. I will never get back these two hours of my life but it is not too late for you, reader. Go do anything else instead.",What Happened to Monday

Everything else is just nonsense.I see a lot of praises for the dazzling and unforgetable performance by the lead actress. Sorry to say, but it was just an ok performance. Nothing dazzling or praise worthy. 7 different characters?! I only saw two - the geek and all the others. But it's not her fault.

It's not that she (Rapace) had an accent in general, it's that she had an accent that sounded nothing like her grandfather's. Grandad(Dafoe) was shortly and sweetly played, and made out to be the only person the identical septuplets (heptuplets?) were exposed to for most of their young life. How do you want end up with different accents? Anyways... The dialogue was very clunky at times and despite that I think Rapace did a good job of acting like 7 different people. I think they did a good job at filming the 7 copies of Rapace interacting convincingly and seamlessly, so that deserves props!However, the plot was rather convoluted and I had a hard time believing that any of the steps taken by the government were actually necessary. There wasn't enough world building to actually make me care about these people and their plight.The plot twists came and I rolled my eyes and at times laughed heartily with my partner. I suspend my disbelief with the best of them, but some of the dialogue was hilariously bad, and the film lost me before the big reveal. I did watch it until the end and we both saw it coming and were not surprised at all about where Monday actually was.Sooo, 4 out of 10 as far as I'm concerned, mostly because it made me laugh (unintentionally) and that's worth something to me.",What Happened to Monday

The dystopical atmosphere could be the sole achievement of the film, but it isn't actually innovative nor worked in detail.

Some flashbacks try to provide the emotional foundation for the characters but there's just too little development to make the viewer feel anything at all. The predominant emotion I felt while watching this film was ""it's absurd"". The setting is absurd. The premise is absurd. The antagonists are absurdly powerful when there's no reason why they should be. The actions of the characters are absurd. The progress of the story is absurd. Even the action scenes are absurd. One example: a character improvises an explosion by dumping aerosol cans in an oven, and the explosion happens exactly when the timer runs out. Try doing that at home and see if it works that way? The only thing that makes a little bit of sense is the trigger for the current crisis.

387,deafoldbat,"Intriguing premise, but cliched and poorly thought out",3,21 August 2018,"The good: The film starts well as we are introduced to the seven sisters attempting to live as one person in a future where only one child per family is allowed. When one of them - Monday - goes missing, the rest must decide how to proceed. The acting is okay - Willem Dafoe is very good, Glenn Close is a delightfully campy villain, Nooni Rapace is adequate. Perhaps I'm being uncharitable as I have been spoilt by the amazing Tatiana Maslany playing multiple clones in Orphan Black (watch Orphan Black instead of this, it's excellent).The bad: Everything else. Huge, huge plot holes, characters acting illogically, timings that don't make any sense. I love SF and am used to suspending my disbelief very willingly, but ...Aerosols in the microwave do not explode as the timer reaches zero except by amazing coincidence.Having a death squad running all over town gunning down random passers by as they miss their target is not how you discreetly deal with a problem you can't risk being exposed (which is the whole excuse given for this killing spree). Are there no journalists in this future? No angry relatives? No police enquiry about the daylight shooting of numerous unrelated innocents?The death squad don't return to the apartment for many hours after the first invasion, even though they know the siblings are in there. The siblings know they will return, but their plan appears to be to wait for them to come and kill them, even though they mentioned in an early scene that it is possible to disappear and go off-grid. This seems to be so that they can each take turns giving their in-character cliched reaction and we can watch the subplot with Jerry and the other subplot with the CAB agent play out.Why does Glenn Close have her own private death squad anyway? How does she get that signed off? Presumably the collecting of siblings is handled by the CAB agents, and doesn't usually require teams of assassins.The fight scenes are so over the top they cannot be taken seriously. They play like a spoof of a fight scene, with excessive violence and cartoon-like instant recovery. This might be forgivable if this film didn't take itself so seriously.Each sibling is different and each a cliche - there is the geeky genius, the sporty one, etc. Might be more believable if they weren't supposedly identical septuplets raised together.The siblings inexplicably have a different accent to the man who raised them and everyone else in the country. As they live a very restricted life, there would have been limited opportunities for them to each acquire this accent.The twist is so obvious from very early in the film that I got bored waiting for it, hoping desperately that it would be a red herring. It wasn't.If you were freezing people's children, there would be evidence and a footprint of this activity, it would be monitored and regulated. There would be vast buildings where the frozen children were stored. There would be documentaries about it. It's not something you could just pretend to be doing whilst really burning the children.On the subject of burning the children, why would you do this in a glass paneled chamber in a lab with glass doors where anyone passing could see it happen and film it? Also, there were far too many people who must have been involved in/aware of the burning for this to have remained secret. Again, where were all the investigative journalists sniffing out the shocking story? The lack of cryo-storage must surely have been a huge clue to them.We are obviously meant to hate Glenn Close's character, as she is an evil child-burning witch, but there is no alternative solution offered to stem the population crisis (State-sanctioned suicide/euthanasia? Contraceptive implants? Nah, let's burn the kids). This is a huge subject, the premise of the whole film-world, that was ignored beyond the ""evil"" one-child rule.Overall: It started well and gave some entertainment, but the script and directing were so poor and the story so badly constructed that I can't recommend it.",What Happened to Monday

I'm writing this, not as a review of the events or themes that take place; but rather, a questioning of expectations from the average film viewer. It should be fairly obvious that to enjoy any motion picture, one must enable their sense of disbelief. This means when you watch a fantasy film or show you don't question the reality of wands, spells, dragons, etc. Instead, you allow yourself to be immersed within the story. After all, the entire point of art is to transport yourself within the world of the artist. I take issue with criticism from professional critics to the average person on the basis of ""realism,"" ""continuity,"" and/or any other tropes related to the experience of (in this case film), art.This movie uses certain themes that have a major impact in the possible near future as its basis for storytelling, and therefore, I can see why some might attempt to hold the themes as a basis to grade its merits. I must contest this though as I would say you don't read an Asimov, Clarke, Dick, novel and complain that your predictions of the future aren't the same as the author's do you? While watching this I'm reminded of my experience of watching ""Minority Report"" and it's safe to say that that version of the future hasn't come close to existing yet, but nonetheless it's a masterful bit of storytelling. The point though is this, sure there are holes in almost any plot, especially in films that don't coincide with our present day notions of reality; but what has that to do with our ability to enjoy a film?Be honest with yourself for a moment, when you're watching anything but a documentary (and even then..) you're primary concern is the entertainment value. To which, this film delivers in spades. There's great drama, great action, great acting, and one person playing 7 roles. What more could you ask for?

From the very beginning, the movie shows glimpses of what kind of world the characters live in, and watchers will be able to gauge the tone immediately. The sisters are all unique, exceptionally portrayed by the main actress. What I loved most about the movie is the balance between different kinds of scenes. No moment is dull or unneeded. It all flows nicely until the end. The concept of the movie is certainly not original, but the execution, the performances, and good editing make it a wonderful watch. I would certainly love it if a mature series was made of this. One that would tackle this very concept, but explores different aspects of the world that was presented here. All in all, a great movie that certainly deserves praise.",What Happened to Monday

It would have been nice to see more range in character like in OB, but not really possible given the limitations.*SPOILERS* There were a number of little things that kept pulling me out of the story because they were so unbelievable such as- 1) The backstory for the world overpopulation problem is that people have mutated to have litters of children because of GMO crops, 2) The guy who tripped over the refrigerator and died ... what?, 3) Every time Thursday makes somebody shoot themselves with the weapon they are holding, 4) Why CAB does not send a team to kill the sisters immediately, 5) When CAB finally sends a team, they fail to cover the fire escape exit, 6) How the ""SWAT"" team allows Wednesday to take them out 1 by 1, 7) How Friday is seemingly immune to chemical gasses, and has plenty of time to escape, but chooses to stay and die anyway. ???, and 8) Microwave time bombI don't understand the positive reviews for this movie. The ideas are interesting and the scenes with Wilem Dafoe are really good, but those are a minority. The special effects are good, Noomi Rapace is okay, and there are some nice action sequences, but I can't get over the plot holes.

416,South7th,Bland wit,6,24 December 2018,"The premise was really interesting, having 7 siblings in a one-child policy society. They also did well in second degree plot twists, typical of an action movie. For the made-obvious premise, I expected the plot twists to be more predictable but it wasnt as much, which is good.The script was bland and sometimes, corny (kinda wasted the great acting tbh). At the beginning, the policy was a bit over-explained (treating the audience dumb). One thing that bugged me was that big billboard of the ""One Child Policy Act"" that was so unrealistic since the law was implemented for 20+ years already and who tf puts laws in billboards anyway? That wasn't necessary in the screenplay too. Another thing was that the movie felt like a tv show, maybe because of the frame rate and was done on purpose since it's a netflix and not a cinema film. I just personally don't like it.Cinematography was average but the editing in the action part was good. I liked the alternating scene of Cayman's speech and the the two sisters fighting (I didn't care about the fight scene with Monday's bf and the security because there wasn't much of a build up to it for me to care). The only thing that put me off is the overuse of the intense music in not-so-intense cuts and with just a few seconds interval between a ""badadum"" to another ""badadum"" . Also, the one part where Thursday (?) pushed the fridge door to trip the police looks like it's missing a shot bc I needed to repeat it to understand what happened (maybe it's just me). It was cool though. The action scenes were mostly unrealistic but really cool so I think it saves itself.All in all, 'What Happened To Monday?'

This is a great movie on so many levels: amazing acting performance from Naomi Rapace who plays no less than 7 different endearing characters, a great story which entertains & captivate the audience until the end (well at least me!), an interesting issue already taking place in the world (overpopulation) & it's an intelligent movie that makes you THINK. I won't give any spoilers, but I'll give a general idea of the movie: It takes place in the future where the quality of the food has led women to give birth to twins or more. However, the world is overpopulated and the government establish a very strict one-child only policy. Naomi Rapace plays the main characters, seven identical sisters who are hiding from the government. but for how long? I was happily surprised by this movie and by Netflix. Netflix keep it up!

I have liked her ever since seeing her in the (original and best) ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"". She is an intense actress and seems to take on every role she's in with a vengeance. This movie?

However, the extremes in which specific laws are forced upon citizen of this film's universe help to create one of the most surprising films I've watched in a long time. To start, the acting is top notch. I won't spoil anything but the lead in this movie deserves many awards for her performances throughout. Secondly, the plot twist in this story kept me on edge fully through. This film can easily fool you into believing that it carries out a monotonous linear story structure. But that is the furthest thing from the truth. The layered screenwriting paired with the elusive editing created one of the most compelling adventures I've been apart of. The only knock I have is with the cinematography. There are good visuals here, however, I felt that some of the shots could've been composed with a more personable perspective to the story. Nothing in this film stood out as ""beautiful"" to me. Not beautiful in terms of color grade and the world itself, as I know there was a specific look that the film had to carry. But beautiful in terms of impact, there were little times where a shot allowed me to get a feel for the current moment and what the character was going through.

431,philford,"After one sister (Monday) is missing, the other six sisters are trying to find her - but in this future, they are not allowed to live.",4,15 August 2017,"What happened to a great idea?The near future. The earth population has grown and the consequences of the global warming cannot be denied. Therefore the Child Allocation Bureau (CAB) is founded by Cayman (Glenn Close). Every parent is allowed to have one child only and after that you get sterilized. T controll that everybody has an arm wrist, which allows you to pay, to phone, to connect with anybody and – of course – your identity can be detected at any time. That is the reason why parents who should give birth to twins, triplets etc are living in hide. The CAB tries to capture these children and promise to put them into a frozen sleep until the world is in a better shape.Terrence Settmans (Willem Dafoe) wife gave birth to seven children (septuplets). She died during the birth and Settman raised the septuplets (all played by Noomi Rapace) on his own. He produced an arm wrist for every child but all with the same identity: Karen Settman. Also he named every child after one day in the week and that will be the day, on which that child is allowed to leave the hiding and live a ""normal"" life. Maybe this is the first big mistake of the whole story. It seems not that kind of a big deal, to produce this fake arm wrist. The seven children can pass every checkpoint without any problems. But later in the movie the CAB is able to locate all these arm wrists. And why not create entirely new persons? Maybe find adults without children and pretend with the fake wrist, that they are the parents? And if this is so easy, they probably aren't the first with these kind of fake wrists. More plausible would be one wrist for all – so that Terrence would have find a trick how to put them off. Karen is working at a bank. One Monday, Monday is not coming back from work and the rest of the family is trying to look for her. And then the movie is getting totally out of control and dives from one plot hole to another. The problem in science fiction movies is creating a whole new world which is plausible constructed. In this movie works simply nothing. The cars do not have any airbags, the CAB gets the order to kill Karen quiet and after a quick pursuance the CAB is even killing civilians to get to Karen. Then it takes nearly five minutes to copy some data onsomething like a USB stick, and after that it takes one (!) second to send it via Wifi to another arm wrist. I could go on and onPretty annoying are the really bad dialogues, which couldn't be more pathetic. The music sounds like a open source version of the Inception O.S.T. and there is not one moment without it. And because they wanted to portrait all of the septuplets a little bit, Rapace has to change between seven stereotypes – time is to short, to give someone an individual character. Maybe they should've been focused on one child. There a some things on the plus side. The action sequences aren't too bad sometimes and are often very consequent. But the showdown fight in a server room (not the one in the bathroom) is one of the worst action showdowns I've seen in a long time. I would not recommend this movie, if you want to see a serious discussion of a science fiction scenario. If you interested in light entertainment with an interesting setting, and do not get annoyed by that many plot holes, this should be your pick.",What Happened to Monday

442,lizbethjrz,Eye Opening,9,29 November 2020,"For my English class, we have started a unit going over the 7 Revolutions. Two revolutions that really stood out to me were the population and resource management revolution. For my project, I decided to do the option of watching a film based on one of 7 revolutions. Doing my research I found the film, What happened to Monday. What happened to Monday not only covered one but four revolutions. It went over the revolutions of population, resource management, technology, and governance. As the film starts it talks about how the human population has begun to double over the last 50 years. They have also tripled the amount of food and water being used and quadrupled the use of fossil fuels. They talk about how there are too many people and a small amount of food. For this reason, they have put this problem into scientists' hands to find genetically modified crops in order to feed more people and overcome the food shortage. The film shows clips of beaches and transportations being crowded and many challenges going on around the world such as climate change and hunger. This movie really focuses on the revolution about population for it is based on how the Federation has instituted the policy called the ""Child Allocation Act."" Meaning that only one child is allowed per family. They have instituted this policy for the sole reason of trying to reduce the number of population and trying to uncrowd the world. In the film, we see that if a person has more than one child, the eldest is left while the rest are put into cryosleep until the crisis of population is resolved. By families being torn apart, citizens are angered and fight against the agents making commotions rise. Each person is tracked by a bracelet making sure that they are an only child. The family we focus on is hiding 7 identical sisters, where they must hide their identity and all pass as one. The revolution about resource management is shown when people are limited to the amount of food they are allowed to buy and types. It is seen that in order to get their food they have to get their bracelets scanned signifying that they have gotten their meal for the day. Their resources are limited due to the problem of climate change and being in a food crisis. The revolution of technology comes into play by how each person has their information being held by the technology in an electronic bracelet. Each person is required to carry around an electronic bracelet that tracks them. They must scan their bracelets in order to access transportation and cross zones. The bracelets require information such as name, a picture of the citizen, and family count. The last revolution I noticed was governance. The Child Allocation Bureau had the policy enforced saying that they were putting kids in a cryosleep. In reality, information was being withheld on what really was happening. The kids were being put into sleep but when they were they were being incinerated. Not many knew of these actions and when the information was leaked they were left feeling infuriated. This film really expressed the 7 revolutions. I feel that this film really opens up someone's view of the future and makes you think of the current situation we are in. Really recommend to watch.",What Happened to Monday

Enter the Settman sisters, 7 identical sisters, named after the days of the week, that share a single identity in public and only go out on the day of their name. One Monday, the namesake doesn't come home. This kicks off a frantic panic among the others to figure out what happened without exposing themselves as sisters, even though they very quickly find out they've already been discovered. As enjoyable as this movie is if you don't think about it too much, the movie tries to get you to think about it and there are some major problems with the whole premise and ending that really ruin the movie.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!First off, there are two ""twists"" that really are not surprising at all. The first one I figured out in the first five minutes of the movie and the second one about 15 minutes later. As straightforward as the plot is, there's also a dirty politician/corrupt government angle in play here also. In the opening montage, before we even meet the siblings, they tell us that genetic engineering to create better crops also led to humans having multiple births. This led to the Cryo-solution, but an obvious problem here is where do they store all these kids when there are millions born daily (also according to the montage). This reveals the first ""twist"". The second twist isn't quite as obvious, but it's still easily picked up by anyone with half a brain. When Tuesday goes looking for Monday, she is nearly immediately picked up by the authorities and they know WAY too much. They know how many siblings there are, where they live, where they hide, and when one of the sisters goes for their gun in the safe, it's missing. Obviously, they've been betrayed. Any guess as to who done it? There's a few red herrings, but the lack of gun really doesn't make any of them believable suspects.Finally, they beat their betrayer and use everything they've figured out to publicly disgrace and bring down the corrupt politician and reverse the ""one child"" law only to basically doom the planet to terrible death at the hands of human overpopulation, and the move is not at all subtle about saying it.

This is bound to be a cult classic as an original spin on a dysptopian world where family breaks down while exploiting the realities that we've already experienced as a species. This story not only reinforces the strength of family, but also the amount of secrets that can be kept from each other and at the same time strengthen our resolve against one another... making the audience question the very foundation from whence they make assumptions.

483,j_achim,Predictable and typical,4,19 September 2017,"I really do not get the hype about this movie. It has all the standard, typical stuff for a movie in this genre, alongside with The Hunger Games, Divergent and so on. That being said, I have not read the book so this review is based on a simple guy heading to the movies with friends. First, everything in this movie is predictable. From the second Cayman entered the screen you could tell that she would be the powerful bitch. She even wore makeup that made her ugly and annoying. You know, that punchable face. Just like Dolores Umbridge in Harry Potter. I am sorry to tell you that the predictable, annoying parts of this movie does not stop here. Secondly, the seven sisters were way to different from each other for it to be even close to realistic. In every single movie made for the teenager segment (which this has to be), the group of characters is always significantly different from each other. The clever one, the computer geek, the strong one, and so on. Exactly like that is it with these sisters. Wouldn't they become very similar by living literally the exact same life? And of course, the evil, huge and powerful state. Obligatory for this kind of movie, the bureau is super mean. Like, for no reason whatsoever. They get the order from Cayman: Capture this random innocent girl because she is a sibling. Fair enough. But out of the blue the agents hate this girl so much they want to stab her in the face and call her a whore. And then there's the dialogues. Yeah, you guessed it: predictable. The webcam chat with the blonde one: ""I love y.."" *Bang*. Shot in the head. I even heard a guy in the audience laugh when it was supposed to be a surprising and heartbreaking moment, probably because he predicted it. All of the dialogues are like this. The meetings around the table, where everyone have to say a stereotypical phrase for their character. The classic bust of the evil empire, literally on a huge screen in front of the entire world. Caymans obligatory breakdown when she gets busted, when she yells that everyone sucks and does not understand. On the other hand it is fair to say that I was entertained. Even though everything is predictable and the ending is supposed to be surprising (which it was not), I guess it is worth a watch. One of the things that actually impressed me was Naomi Rapace and her acting skills. It obviously is a hard job to have that many roles in the same movie. Dafoe also does a good job as the caring but tough father. The minor roles did not impress me though, and some were even quite annoying with their typical lines like ""step into the f*cking van"" in bad English. Some of the scenes were pretty cool, like the fighting, explosions, special effects and getaways. However, that is pretty much the good things about this movie.",What Happened to Monday

485,jamiebclamb,My monday was made significantly worse from this film.,5,24 January 2021,"The concept of the film is provocative and exciting: set in a dystopic world with an enforced 1 child policy, the film follows septuplets named after the day of the week they are allowed out of the house; as to not arouse suspicion. It is undeniably a clever and fun concept.Though don't let this idea fool you into thinking this film is a philosophical or political film; it is purely a 'save-the-world' gory action movie with violence, sex and an evil villain. Now I dont think this is a bad thing but from the advertisements and concept, you might be expecting something different.In essence, the 7 sisters take it upon themselves after Monday goes missing, to remove this oppressive 1 child policy. They take out seemingly endless military in order to enact this goal and they eventually do. However the film ends on a weird tone as it addresses the peace after the oppressive regime collapses but does not address the overpopulation problem which was the reason of the 1 child policy in the first place. Usually a good antagonist has a good end-goal but a warped way of thinking and the protagonists defeat them and offer a more moral way of thinking but no such endeavour was achieved in this film. Thus the message one may get is that the systemic killing of children is our only option.This movie could be much better and I have seen some supporting this movie by saying ""its not meant to be realistic"" but I think this misses the point. A regime that can be collapsed by simple gore and violence is a weak one that lacks an antagonistic flair. The writers are uncreative of how these sisters complete this goal and I think a government exposé film would have complemented this plot.This film is not a boring film nor is it unwatchable but if you are expecting an insightful and satisfying tale against a paternal and authoritarian government, I would say keep looking.",What Happened to Monday

The fact that she survived the fall is a miracle, but afterwards she just ran like an athlete and nearly escaped a bunch of trained armed soldiers??? Wtf???? 2) the soldiers surrounded the sibling's building, but they didn't care to guard at the fire escape. Really??? 3) Friday chose to kill herself, for what?

In fact, it has some very solid action which presents over the top stunts in a more subtle way that makes them seem possible. Normally in fight sequences, a smaller person will be shown in an unrealistic light when fighting. Here the action is shown with intensity and restraint, in a rare combination. In this movie, several scenes present the action in a more accurate but still gripping way than anything I have seen before. That increased plausibility really pulls you in. Noomi Rapace plays 7 sisters so well that it's hard to believe that much range is possible. She somehow conveys each one of the familiar characterizations with a subtleness that increases their authenticity and appeal. Glenn Close plays a character that is evil, but very authentically so. She really shines. The strong characters portrayed in a believable manner that will pull you into the movie and make it come alive. You do want to watch it cold without spoilers to truly get pulled into action and suspense. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart due to the realistic action sequences. It has some really strong female character depictions that you rarely see in films of this nature. Highly recommend.",What Happened to Monday

I'd like to believe that this is mostly the poorly written scripts fault, but her acting is also to blame. The story is boring, predictable and quite upsetting, since it wasn't able to create a single moment where you could actually root for or identify with someone. It seemed like every single person fighting for something was fighting for the wrong reason. I just wanted them all to die so the movie could end.

I expected it to be a rip-off of Orphan Black. I finally decided to watch it when I had nothing else to watch and trust me when I say that it's one of the best movies I've watched this year. Noomi Rapace plays the characters of the Settman sisters incredibly even more so that each of the seven have different personalities.

The whole story just didn't make any sense to me with its huge plot holes and mistakes in logic. There were just no relatable characters and the way everyone miraculously survived explosions, falls etc... Not to mention the stupid and unnecessary violence and erotic scenes. The movie was just laughable. There have been some pretty smart sci-fi/action movies recently, but that's just not the case. Too much blood and stupidity.",What Happened to Monday
521,elenci,"Great, underrated sci-fi",9,22 September 2017,"Excellent performance by Noomi Rapace. Moreover, we all know how good Glenn Close and Dafoe can act. It's a sci-fi thriller, with drama, crime, and some explicit violence. One thing I found weird, is that most reviewers thought this was a great movie, yet we have a not-so- great rating (6.9) in this site. Maybe Netflix is not so welcome here? Anyway, I strongly suggest you watch this movie.",What Happened to Monday
522,rickyjamesunderdown,Great for the first 40 minutes,7,10 October 2017,"I am giving this movie a 7 just for the simply amazing way that is started. It really was fantastic, and I really did enjoy it. The way the father brings them up, it really was shaping up to be a fascinating story.... that was until it all started getting a little too violent and gory which I felt was no need for. The story was moving along at an excellent pace, and it all of a sudden went very dark very quickly. This movie should have stayed on the tracks it was heading down, rather than derail at the stage it did. Fantastic start, very poor end.",What Happened to Monday
523,lakyky,"I thought there were seven days in the week but ""What Happened to Monday""?",9,25 October 2017,"Having twins is fairly unique and uncommon on its own, but imagine having septuplets (7 kids). This is the case in the Netflix original movie ""What Happened to Monday."" This action-adventure- crime-drama film is set in a dystopian future, where overpopulation has forced the government to enact a one-child-policy. This obviously becomes an issue when someone has septuplets.This movie was recommended to be me by a friend, and I was intrigued: it sounded like an interesting story concept. I was expecting the sisters to find the major fault in the one-child- system, then to find a way to reveal it to the public to put a stop to it. I was expecting some fight of desperation—seeing how it is an action film—and some significant character to die—because it's also a drama.The movie did satisfy me with the action, where I felt myself really engaged and rooting for the characters, but what I wasn't really expecting was how emotionally invested I got into the main characters—and without sharing major spoilers, I want to confess that I shed tears multiple times throughout watching. There was one scene I didn't particularly enjoy, which was a very sexual scene with a lot of nudity—they didn't show EVERYTHING, but it was kind of a lot for me. I think they may have overdone that particular scene.Overall I would give the movie an 9 out of ten—any movie that makes me cry so much, I would recommend to others.",What Happened to Monday

After 1/4 of the movie, the film is just a profoundly dumb action movie with no content whatsoever. The rate of 2 goes for the premise.",What Happened to Monday

I know the government were chasing them with guns and everyone in the CAB were like chasing them but too much death but of course it was which didn't bother me. But when Monday did that like why would she?! I couldn't tell who was who but I think the smart one that blew herself up aka to me Saturday was the team player. She blew herself up to get all of the government things on them to Thursday and it made me cry. And like Adrian was in love with Karen I'm like BOI you liked all of them and you had a one night stand with the blond one and you thought that was Karen. I would be like hold up you cut your hair got rid of your bangs AND dyed it too like that's just suspicious. But loved it!!,What Happened to Monday

528,jdpennell,"Reviewing the reviews for ""What Happened To Monday""",9,21 December 2017,"While reading the reviews I found the range from 1/10 to numerous 8, 9 and 10/10. This should tell you something. You decide.I found reviewers who were unable to discern which sister was which and who survived. It can happen. Pay attention. That same reviewer doesn't know the usage of ""to"" and ""too"".I found reviewers who (apparently) have a severe dislike for someone associated with the movie and vented their spleens with abandon on the work. They sort of stick out.I found a reviewer who stated someone with an IQ of 70 would be needed to enjoy this movie. My IQ is more than triple that number (as if it matters), yet I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as did my wife. Trust me, if a movie can hold her past her bedtime it's a real gem!I immediately commented ""This was made in Bucharest"" only to discover in the closing credits it actually was. The elevator did it. Been there. Don't use the elevators! The floor just might fall out! Use the stairs and hold onto the railing tightly at night. They are not lighted. Neither are the halls. That's the only thing that almost fooled me.Several reviewers had issues with the demonizing of a segment of society being over the top. Those with a grasp of history (or current news) can see this happening every day. I guess they walk around with eyes wide shut.Other reviewers ran the entire political gamut from ""Neo-Nazi, Bible toting, filled with hate Christian"" (seen too much these days) to ""Flaming Liberal Genetically Modified Crops BAD"".Bottom line is this: This is one really good movie! Try to keep the sisters sorted out and you'll be VERY glad you didn't miss seeing this one. Of course I wish for more character development. Who doesn't want more of a good thing? I wish for more Willem Dafoe as the grandfather and reaction to his passing out of the movie. I suspect that's on the cutting room floor in the interest of length. I'd like to know more of the governmental role in the premise of the movie beyond ""the baddie is highly respected and is trying to enter politics"" at the end.Cancel the Academy Award ceremonies, hire a truck and just send them to Noomi Rapace.",What Happened to Monday
529,willbell-10546,Definitely worth watching,9,28 December 2017,"Wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this. I must say that I was indeed pleasantly surprised. It was a smart film that showed the dark side of human nature and what happens when drastic situations call for drastic actions. The storytelling was superb as it kept me guessing all the way up until the end. I was secretly hoping that the film would not fall into the usual trappings of a bad ending and this film did not let me down. All in all, this was a great sic-fi film that tackled not only real world problems but real life ""human"" problems and moral dilemmas. If you are looking for a film that will not only keep you intrigued but also thoroughly entertained, then What happened to Monday will not disappoint. Wonderful execution.",What Happened to Monday
530,muganziherbert,configaring the viewer into the movie,8,9 April 2018,"I appeal to the writers of the movie and appreciate for such a wonderful entertainment. majority of the movie are all about fighting ,revenge without a prior entertainment concept that would keep you closely attached to the character themselves. surely if there was a way of analyzing deeply on what impact such movies do to our understanding and feelings, these of such a kind would be always recommended as a food of thought.",What Happened to Monday
531,samadalbah,Good but not good enough.,6,9 March 2018,I'd say it isn't a HORRIBLE movie but it also didn't fulfil my expectations (or anyone who saw it probably)...just because of how low the budget seems like some scenes were HARD to believe i need you to convince me with your act. The writing isn't that good as well. Their accents kinda don't suit the movie but i worked with that so that was ok with me to some extent. When you watch the trailer or even start watching the movie you expect so much from it and expect the absolute BEST! but it was sorta going dull for quite some time like i don't know how to explain it but it lacks some stuff and let's stick with that. I wouldn't HIGHLY recommend it but i'd say watch it & you'll understand what i'm saying. I mean the story itself was great but it wasn't done justice in my opinion.,What Happened to Monday
532,INVINCIBLE2002,"This movie really had it going, until...",7,17 January 2018,"""What Happened To Monday"" was one of those movies that built a really good foundation with believable actors, scary antagonists, and fairly decent plot twists. And while were biting our nails on how the C.A.B. agents found out about the siblings and where Monday possibly could be, it turns out that Monday sold them out. The worst part is that when Thursday confronts her and tells her that she killed her family, Monday's best response is ""What do you know about family?"" and ""I didn't plan this."" She evens claims to do everything she could to protect her family (Adrian, a man she barely knows, and her babies), but the solution is to kill the rest of her siblings to do that? But fine, whatever, let's ignore the fact that she indirectly takes out the six people she's lived with her whole life to spend it with a man she sees one time a week and for some reason accept the clichè that mothers will do literally anything for their children (no matter how twisted or insane that thing may be), that stills leave the fact of why she wouldn't tell her siblings about the deal or her babies or ANYTHING when she easily could've gave them the heads-up, preventing anyone from dying (except for maybe Adrian), and everybody wins for the most part, but instead, this movie happens. Now, don't get me wrong, this was a great movie! I was thoroughly thrilled up until 1:45:04, and before that, there was intense action scenes, interesting clash of philosophies, and shocking, very gory deaths that pulled on our heart strings. You should definitely watch this movie, but the conclusion might not satisfy you.",What Happened to Monday

From the literal edge of my seat I was engrossed in the story, absolutely brilliant acting, and unrelenting intensity.Rapace has earned a spot with the top actresses of all time in my book. She has ""wowed"" me in every film I have seen her in. I am now hooked and seeking out her others.To all the critics of the realism - umm yeah... it is a movie... about a possible future.. where a bureau has been created to police the number of babies being born. With machine guns.. futuristic machine guns 😉 And everyone has a holographic screen projector built into the palm of their hand....... You guys make me laugh.",What Happened to Monday
534,timothygrams,"Could have been great, execution killed it.",4,29 January 2018,"I watched this movie recently on an American Airlines 3 hour flight. I wanted to like this movie, and I think it held a lot of promise to be great, but the execution of the making of the film doomed it to just mediocrity. First the good: Noomi Rapace put a monumental effort into playing seven different charters. She did a great job even if we don't have time to fully know each of the seven sister's personalities. The premise of the film is one I enjoy on film: distopian not-to-distant future sci-fi; plot twists I didn't see coming; bad guys/gals get their due in the end; addressing humanities (projected) problems within the sci-fi genre.The bad: I really questions films which unnecessarily use bad language and nudity. I nearly quit the film early on when the first dozen ""F"" bombs and gratuitous vulgarity hit in first 15 minutes. The gratuitous sex scene was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the plot or character development. It was as if the director and writers said, for this film to be ""relevant"" to our target audience, we have to have the characters use vulgar language, talk dirty to our sisters, and get naked. The killing off of characters became predictable and the movie seemed to follow a script for what happens in predictable action movies. In some movies, we wonder what will happen, or if a character will make it out alive. I learned early on in the movie, if something can happen, expect that it will happen just like you imagine and will happen most violently. Think someone is going to die? Yep, the writer is going off them just like you think. There is no suspense left, just rolling of eyes as if to say (sarcastically) ""didn't see that one coming""Overall, I was disappointed this movie didn't reach the level I think it was capable of and felt like I needed to take a bath after listening to the sisters jab each other sexually and talk dirty to each other.",What Happened to Monday

542,nientje_new,You might be able to watch this one if your expectations are low,5,21 October 2018,"What do I expect from a sci-fi movie? (Also to sender the below review)Well, sure I agree that you need to ""go with the artist"". But why do I like and accept Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings and why do I find movie mediocre? Because of the logic and reason behind it, you can tell me dragons exist and wizards are real as long as it makes sense in the world you created in the movie. The problem with this movie is that there are a few flaws that make no sense. If you want to take all the sisters out, just go to their apartment before they even figure out Monday is missing and kill them all. If you want to take two sisters out why wait downstairs if you shoot with teargas? Just have a team standing by right outside the door with gas masks, no need to wait downstairs and give them the option to escape?!Why go through all that effort to save two embryos from a mother who just died if the world is already full and we have a huge problem with overpopulation? I mean great that they stopped killing people, but saving two embryos that are probably no older then 3 months makes NO sense at all if you are dealing with overpopulation.But all that aside, showing Monday sitting there signing the contract and act like this scene is some HUGE plot twist like we did not see this coming from miles away... god how stupid do you think your audience is. You knew there was a traitor among the sisters from the moment that colleague said there was a money transfer.... it was just too easy and I don't like easy movies.",What Happened to Monday

546,,"An interesting concept, missed the execution by _",5,31 March 2019,"Sorry in advance for the wording of this review bit I'm writing it in a bit of a rush. While the films concept is remarkably interesting and was the reason I decided to watch this film I have taken an issue to the execution (again rushing this so it might come off more as a list). For me the emotional punches don't land in film due to rushed story telling (pacing issue), mainly the killing of siblings to liberally. The Plot twists are extremely telegraphed and can be figured out early into the film such as Monday's betrayal. In addition siblings with different personalities/skills do not appear to have any bearing on the plot e.g. Wednesday's apparent physicality and fighting training have very little impact on her death (honestly her death build up and scene kind of threw this film for me). Additionally siblings are constantly set up to escape however, apart from Thursday never do, this cheapens all of the ""plot twists"" in the film, becoming quite a stale plot device. Friday's side plot of uploading family history plot line never really pays off and therefore makes her whole involvement feel kind of redundant, likewise can be said for the plot lines of all siblings bar Monday and Thursday. If I could offer up some advice to this film I would say that making the deaths of each sibling have real importance to the plot would fix a lot of issues regarding this plot (e.g. have Wednesday die while protecting one of the others and have it be brutal, fighting till her last breathe... Something like that, just a little bit of sustenance would pull this film up by a lot). But I would like to be very clear that I do not have any problems with the acting in this film especially the portrayal of each of the siblings, it's really the thing that kept me watching till the end.",What Happened to Monday
