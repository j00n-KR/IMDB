0,MartinHafer,Much better than I'd expected.,7,24 January 2020,"""Dennis the Menace"" is a cute film and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. That being said, it's not for everyone. For really young kids, the film is surprisingly scary...so I'd either watch it with them or skip it entirely. And, for teens, well, they hate family movies...so tell them to text their friends while the rest of you watch and enjoy the film.The first portion consists of Dennis annoying poor Mr. Wilson (Walter Mathau) in 1001 different ways. Most of the time, it's because Dennis is just too hyper and inqusitive and finds many different ways to get into Mr. Wilson's things and ruin them. Later, after Mr. Wilson blows his temper and Dennis runs away, the film turns darker as a sleazy looking hobo kidnaps Dennis and threatens to hurt him.This final portion is the part that young and very impressionable kids should probably not see. I wouldn't let most kids under 5 watch the film or at least I'd be there to reassure them it will be find. But it is quite funny and enjoyable...and adults and older kids will know that no matter what happens, Dennis will be safe. It's also a bit disgusting...wish it hadn't been so. But on balance, it's a fun little family film...one that I think even most grumpy adults could enjoy. And, as such, it seems a tad underrated on IMDB. Lots of fun for most of the family.",Dennis the Menace
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Entertaining and funny, where I think the pros outweigh the cons",8,30 September 2010,"This is far from a perfect family comedy, but I consider it one of the most underrated ones. Amy Sakasitz as Margaret Wade is rather annoying and the usually excellent Christopher Lloyd is sadly over-the-top and distracting as Switchblade Sam complete with a subplot that was a little too violent and doesn't fit with the overall tone of the movie. However, Dennis the Menace despite what its reputation and rating suggests is actually very entertaining and does a pretty good job with the transition from comic to movie. It has been criticised for taking too much ideas from the Home Alone movies and I suppose that's true with the sight gags, but I personally think the sight gags are funny. The cinematography is good, the soundtrack is fun, the story while predictable is well structured and interesting, the pacing is brisk and the direction is efficient. And the acting with exception of Lloyd is not bad at all. Mason Gamble thankfully isn't the annoying brat I was expecting prior to seeing this film, instead he is cute and funny as the mischievous yet well-meaning Dennis, while Walter Matthau from the facial expressions to the delivery of the dialogue is brilliant as Mr Wilson. Joan Plowright is also very touching and Lea Thompson and Robert Stanton also do well as Dennis's parents. In conclusion, it is a decent and entertaining film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Dennis the Menace
2,bkoganbing,The Menace is back,5,29 March 2018,"For those who remember Jay North as the lively little kid who seems to take an
almost fiendish delight in tormenting grumpy neighbor Mr. Wilson, this new
Dennis The Menace feature film will bring back some good memories. Warner
Brothers even had the foresight to cast Hollywood's number one specialist at
curmudgeon roles Walter Matthau as the ever grumpy Wilson.Young Mason Gamble is Dennis Mitchell, problem child deluxe. Parents Robert
Stanton and Lea Thompson have trouble getting babysitters as Dennis's reputation is known far and wide. The next door neighbor Wilsons played byz
Matthau and Joan Plowright take him, at least Plowright makes the offer.The usual mayhem follows with Matthau the brunt. But when robber Christopher Lloyd steals Matthau's valuable coin collection, Dennis is on the
case. What follows is what you see in the Home Alone films.Gamble made a nice and appealing Dennis. But even natural scene stealers
like kids are up against it when dealing with Walter Matthau. Poor Gamble
didn't have a chance.Dennis The Menace is a nice family film for a family movie night.",Dennis the Menace
3,SnoopyStyle,Why Switchblade Sam?,5,4 December 2015,"Mr. George Wilson (Walter Matthau) is a retired postman with loving wife Martha (Joan Plowright). He is tired of the irreverent boy living next door, Dennis the Menace. He is hosting the party for the Garden Society and desperate to show off his flower. Dennis has loving parents (Robert Stanton, Lea Thompson) who treat him with kid gloves. He hates being forced to spend time with Margaret Wade. It's an idyllic town life until the arrival of Switchblade Sam (Christopher Lloyd). Dennis' parents go away for work and the Wilson has the babysit the Menace.I love Walter Matthau and the kid is rambunctious. I like Dennis' family. I love Margaret and the other kids. Switchblade Sam makes no sense being in this movie universe. I think John Hughes is trying to recreate Home Alone. It's a big mistake. The movie is split in two. I find the parts without Switchblade Sam fun especially with Matthau. It's got a childlike innocent tone with a splash of modern irreverence and that's what so great about it. Switchblade Sam has no place in that world.",Dennis the Menace
4,kosmasp,No Menace detected,7,14 July 2021,"This came after Home Alone - but it is probably rather a remake of an older movie. Which would make Home Alone a copycat (of probably many things). And this I'd say is sweeter in many departments and not as mean as Kevin is. But you may disagree and I may be wrong with that.I do know that it has quite the range of great actors in it. Walter Matthau for one, who really brings gravitas and then some to his role. Even the silliest of things can be elevated if performed by such an amazing and gifted actor. Overall I am not the biggest fan of pranks, no matter the context, but they work here most of the time, especially because Dennis seems so innocent.Also this is a family movie and as such there are a lot of merits this has on its side.",Dennis the Menace
5,jboothmillard,Dennis,5,13 July 2005,"If you ever watched the cartoon, or (if there was one) read the comics, then you would know the troublesome little boy of this film. It isn't the most funny disaster type film I have seen, but some parts of it do have some interesting cartoon like comedy. Walter Matthau as Mr. George Wilson is very good at showing his hate, or rather frustration, with Dennis the Menace (Razzie nominated Mason Gamble). Dennis loses his teeth, bakes paint on a barbecue and throw a burning marshmallow onto his forehead! A disastrous movie with a disastrous kid. Also starring Joan Plowright as Mrs. Martha Wilson, Christopher Lloyd as Switchblade Sam (Town Robber) and American Pie's Natasha Lyonne as Polly. Worth watching!",Dennis the Menace
6,ccthemovieman-1,Here We Go Again - Hollywood Polluting A Nice Comic Strip,3,6 October 2007,"Like everyone else my age, I read ""Dennis The Menace"" comic strips and comic books when I was a kid. He and his dog and neighbors all provided laughs. With a cast that included Walter Matthau, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Plowright and Lea Thompson, I was sure this would provide laughs for me now as an adult, as well. Wrong.This was NOT funny, just one stupid gag after another. There was no real story line and most of the characters were annoying, not humorous. No wonder this was another disappointing ""bomb"" at the box office.Not everything is bad. Matthau is ""Mr. Wilson"" true to form. He looks and acts like you figure he would out of the comic strip. Dennis' parents pretty much do the same and some of the stuff is fairly funny.But there are some big-time disquieting aspects of this movie. ""Dennis"" is not the innocent- but-mischievous kid of the comics, but a mean-spirited, sadistic kid in here. Did I really hear Matthau utter ""GD"" three times without making it sound like it was blasphemous? Oh, how clever these Hollywood folks are in their clueless idea of ""family fare."" Speaking of that, what was the purpose of the sleazy character ""Switchblade Sam?"" In this age of child molestation and worse, this kind of character is funny? A guy hanging around schoolyards making threats is funny? No, not really.Once again - clueless Hollywood. What Dennis does to him is not funny, either - it's over-the-line. You would be appalled if your kid acted like this. This is far cry from the intention of comic book writer. It is typical of the sick screen writers of today.If you think I'm over-reacting, check Roger Ebert's review of this movie. I don't agree with him on many films but he was extremely offended by that character, too, and thought it had no legitimate reason for being in this movie. Good for him. This should be a ""G"" rated movie. It's ""Dennis The Menace,"" for cryin' out loud, so why the PG attitude?",Dennis the Menace
7,wes-connors,Dennis the Menace Is a Stinker,3,28 May 2011,"""Hank Ketcham's popular comic-strip kid comes to the big screen in 'Dennis the Menace', a delightful family comedy from writer/producer John Hughes, the creative force behind several of the most popular movies ever,"" according to the original Time/Warner synopsis scribers, ""Young Mason Gamble (who won the title role over 20,000 hopefuls) is all-boy, all-menace, all-Dennis, right down to his slingshot and dog Ruff. As Dennis' long-suffering neighbor George Wilson, Walter Matthau is a marvel of lovable grumpiness. And Christopher Lloyd adds a new wrinkle to Dennis' neighborhood as a villain who learns he can't match wits with a certain 5-year-old dynamo. He may be a minor, but he's a major delight."" When an adaptation of a classic property is as off base as this, it inevitably raises the question, ""What were they thinking?"" ""Home Alone"" (1990), probably. Mr. Hughes, and a few other crew members, worked on both films. The plot isn't the same, exactly, but the resemblances are there. And, they are uncomfortable additions to ""Dennis the Menace"" of the comic strip and TV series starring Jay North. As the mischievous kid with the cowlick, Mr. North was perfect in the role. Nobody told young Gamble how to wear the hair (not that it would have mattered), Mr. Matthau is almost as unconvincing, and they have no rapport. Violent, grungy and farting in the wind, Mr. Lloyd (as ""Switchblade"" Sam) is especially unwelcome. While only minor players, Robert Stanton and Lea Thompson capture their characters convincingly.*** Dennis the Menace (6/24/93) Nick Castle ~ Mason Gamble, Walter Matthau, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Plowright",Dennis the Menace
8,OllieSuave-007,Annoying little kid!,5,24 May 2014,"I never read the ""Dennis the Menace"" comics, but have watched the cartoon and the old black and white TV show. They were more interesting than this movie version, where Dennis' (Mason Gamble) have to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Wilson (Walter Matthau) and (Joan Plowright) after his parents go out of town, and tries to be helpful to Mr. Wilson, but ended up being an annoying menace to him.This movie made me laugh at certain points, but thought the endless pranks Dennis played on Mr. Wilson went overboard, making the man hate on the kid than trying to get along with him, like the character development you see between the two characters in the TV series. You almost feel no sympathy for Dennis and feel sorry for Mr. Wilson for all he went through.The acting was quite good, nonetheless, and you see some innocent and sincere themes in the movie, especially involving the kids. However, I think this is a film best left for the younger ones.Grade C-",Dennis the Menace
9,John6Daniels,Annoying kid that needs a spanking.,7,31 March 2019,Another Gem for Mr. John Hughes. A rare Good adaption from the cartoons.Overall a fun movie. But Dennis is one annoying kid and his parents don't do anything about his disgusting behaviour. He is as bad as 2020 children because he destroys lives whether or not it's an accident.Still Dennis needs to have parents that know how to parent.The movie has heart and sympathy.,Dennis the Menace
10,Movie Nuttball,One of the funniest movies of all time!,10,7 December 2002,"Dennis the Menace is a great hilarious movie. The music composed by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith is perfect especially for the scene when we fist see Christopher Lloyd. The cast is great and it was great seeing Llyod and Lea Thomson in the same film again ala the Back to the Future trilogy.Walter Matthau,Joan Plowright,and Paul Winfield were very good and I think it was a fine choice of putting Mason Gamble for the menace job as Dennis. The film has non-stop laughs especially the scenes with Matthau and I just love the scene when the end credits are playing.If you want to laugh look no further than Dennis the Menace!",Dennis the Menace
11,snoozejonc,Could have been good but for some poor creative decisions,4,2 October 2020,"Comic strip creation Dennis terrorises his grouchy neighbour Mr Wilson and encounters a creepy burglar.This movie has all the ingredients to be excellent. John Hughes writing, Walter Matthau, Joan Plowright, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd starring along side some cute children and some nice cinematic touches from director Nick Castle.I think it portrays that fantasy suburbia you see in many American comedies well and establishes a number of potentially strong comic characters. Mason Gamble looks a substitute Macaulay Culkin as Dennis, Walter Matthau gives us his grouchy self as Mr Wilson, Joan Plowright is lovely as Martha, Amy Sakasitz is very funny as little Margret and most other actors play their roles well.Some of the cinematography is pretty creative and makes the most of the slapstick sequences. It also nicely captures the surrounding landscapes and works well with the score.Unfortunately, I don't feel the overall movie delivered on its early promise. The story didn't flow for me after the opening sequence. It seemed to move from one visual gag to the next, before stopping to show us something creepy, then more sight gags, something creepy again, then something sweet, then a bit of suspense, then something slow and silly that kills the suspense before going back to something sweet again.Dennis has some cuteness, but his character lacks the easy charm and charisma of the Kevin McCallister he tries to be. I am a huge Walter Matthau fan and what he does in this movie he does quite well, but his strengths are ultimately wasted by the demand for constant slapstick. There is one point when Mr Wilson loses it and really gives Dennis a piece of his mind, prompting Dennis to go after the burglar. I thought he would go missing, giving Mr Wilson the opportunity to find or rescue him and at least let Matthau act out a nice redemption arc, but it doesn't work out that way unfortunately.One of the biggest mistakes is the Switchblade Sam character played by Christopher Lloyd. He is way too dirty, creepy and out of place to be in this story. It's obviously more of the 'Home Alone' formula thrown into the mix to try and recapture previous successes, but the imagery just does not work. Harry and Marv were a hilarious double-act serving a similar purpose to the likeable antagonists used in Looney Tune cartoons. However, with Switchblade they have put Christopher Lloyd into in scenes where he's constantly showing an ugly set of teeth and either threatening a child with a knife or staring creepily at children while they play. I think the beans and flatulence gags were the final straw for me before I wanted to switch off.I watched it with my four year old daughter and thought the saving grace would be her enjoyment of it, but after it finished she told me 'I don't want to watch it again Daddy because of the naughty man'. Contrast that with other movie antagonists she enjoys watching (repeatedly) in 'Home Alone', 'Star Wars', 'Gremlins' and even Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and I think it speaks volumes.",Dennis the Menace
12,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with smashing performances,10,27 November 2005,"DENNIS THE MENACE, in my opinion, is an excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with smashing performances. Also, even though everyone gave an appealing performance, I liked Dennis' (Mason Gamble) the best. In addition, I thought that Mr. Wilson (Walter Matthau) was a very cantankerous guy. However, I thought that Margaret (Amy Sakasitz) was an absolute b****. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did a very good job. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances to any fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",Dennis the Menace
13,hu675,Amusing family picture is worth seeing thanks to Gamble's and Matthau's performances.,8,6 April 2007,"Dennis Mitchell (Mason Gamble) is a five year old boy, who's clever and always curious. Which Dennis doesn't meant to be a bad little boy. But his neighbor George Wilson (Walter Matthau) is been suffering for some time, Because of Dennis' antics. When a poor, grease thief (Christopher Lloyd) comes to Dennis' home town for robberies. But he didn't think that he can't match with this little kid.Directed by Nick Castle (The Boy Who Could Fly, The Last Starfighter, Major Payne) made an amusing comedy family film, which is based on a comic-strip by Hank Ketcham. Gamble is very likable in the title role. Matthau is perfectly cast as Mr. Wilson. The Cast includes:Joan Plowright, Lea Thompson, Robert Stanton and Paul Winfield. But the Script, Written by John Hughes (The Breakfest Club, National Lampoon's Vacation, Pretty in Pink). Who also produced this film manages to somewhat rip-off his ""Home Alone"" style mischief violence for laughs. Which isn't that bad, since it was a modest hit at the box office and audiences of all ages should enjoy this. Watch for a young Natasha Lyonne for a bit part and Devin Ratray from the ""Home Alone"" fame. (*** 1/2 out of *****).",Dennis the Menace
14,Kamurai25,"""The Good Son""",4,21 August 2020,"Bad watch, unlikely to watch again, and can't recommend unless you're just dying to see a poor version of ""Home Alone"" in reverse.I've probably seen this before, but I can't remember it, and I used to read ""Dennis the Menace"" in the funny papers, can't say I was even that big a fan then.And maybe I'm too much of a grumpy old man myself at this point, but this little brat is borderline evil in his stupid behavior. The old man is a jerk too, but it is largely reactionary.I can't even remember the inevitable heart-warming resolution of the child lying to the old man at the end of the movie right before he does it again. It's like watching a serial killer documentary: this is a sociopathic character, and I'm glad we don't have modern day versions of this, at least not that I can see.",Dennis the Menace
15,Beta_Gallinger,"Funny in parts, sometimes lame in the humour department, but overall, not as bad as it could have been",6,25 May 2008,"I remember exactly when I first saw some of this movie. It was Christmas Eve in 1997, when I was eleven years old and it came on TV (it's not a Christmas movie, so don't be mislead by that), but I didn't finish it, and can't remember exactly how much I liked what I saw. At the time, I had never heard of Dennis the Menace, and only recall seeing a strip once in the newspaper funnies shortly after that. To this day, I'm still not very familiar with the strip, and have never seen any episodes of the TV show, but a few months over a decade after seeing some of this movie, I finally watched the whole thing, which left me with mixed feelings.Dennis Mitchell is five years old and lives with his parents, Alice and Henry, in a suburban house. Their next-door neighbours are Mr. (George) and Mrs. (Martha) Wilson, an elderly couple. Unfortunately, it's Dennis' nature to constantly cause trouble, even if he means well, and he often unintentionally makes Mr. Wilson's life difficult! During the summer, Dennis' parents have to find people to babysit him while they're at work. Sadly, their son's bad reputation spreads among the local babysitters! By the time they both have to go on business trips, meaning they will have to find someone to look after their son while they're gone, they try many people, all of whom refuse, so they have no choice but to leave him with the Wilsons! Meanwhile, a thief named Switchblade Sam prowls around town, and anyone around could become a victim of his! Knowing this adaptation of the ""Dennis the Menace"" comic strip wasn't very popular, I didn't have very high expectations, though I think I was expecting some laughs, remembering what I had seen before. Fortunately, I wasn't let down by that. Some of the gags are lame, such as the scene with Margaret and Joey (two kids Dennis has to stay with at times), where Margaret makes forces Joey to close his eyes and kiss her doll's bare buttocks. You can usually expect lame gags like that in these PG-rated family movies. There's also a scene where Switchblade Sam lets out a huge fart. Yes, I think you can also usually expect fart jokes in these PG-rated family comedies, ones which aren't usually funny, no exception here. Fortunately, there aren't too many of them in this film, that's the only one I can think of. Despite these weak gags, however, there are also some very funny ones, usually the ones involving Dennis causing poor Mr. Wilson grief.Overall, due to the mixture of funny and lame gags, this is certainly not a work of genius, but worse comedies have been made, including some of these other PG-rated children's comedies, such as ""Jungle 2 Jungle"", ""Snow Day"", and probably countless others! Aside from the humour, some performances are highlights, including Walter Matthau as the short-tempered Mr. Wilson. I may have enjoyed this adaptation of ""Dennis the Menace"" more if I had watched it from start to finish back when I was eleven, and right now, I wouldn't want to watch it multiple times, but since I did find some parts funny, and the gags and conflict kept me watching, I will give it some credit. So, while this movie is pretty cheesy, and I'm sure it's generally more amusing for kids, some parts could amuse adult slapstick fans.",Dennis the Menace
16,Mister-6,John Hughes the Menace....,5,27 August 1999,"I like a good slapstick movie as much as the next guy.If the next guy is John Hughes, though, he has me beat.You have a property like ""Dennis the Menace"" and you want to make a movie out of it?  Fine.  Just don't get John Hughes to do the scriptwork.  For some reason, the spirits of ""Home Alone""s past haunt him and possess his typewriter to recycle the same jokes over and over.He does manage to eke some sweet observances about the friendships between kids and even between kids and gruff old neighbors like Mr. Wilson (Matthau, who seems to be having a high old time).  Even suburban life is observed with a good deal of truth.  And who doesn't know at least one family in the neighborhood who has a child that all the babysitters refuse to sit with?One thing that offsets the pranks here that the ""Home Alone"" pranks didn't have is the fact that Dennis (Gamble) isn't a vindictive little kid.  he's just an innocent who happens to push the wrong button at the wrong time. Then, trying to cover up, he ends up making a worse mess than before.  And Mr. Wilson is usually on the receiving end, whether he likes it or not.If the movie had followed thsi tangent all the way through, it may have been a bigger success.  But when Switchblade Sam (Lloyd) is introduced, his scrungy form of evil kind of throws a monkey wrench in the works.  Even when Dennis unknowlingly waylays him into a blubbering, emotionally scarred mess, it feels more like a Hughes movie than part of Dennis' wholesome universe.As it is, this movie feels like less a ""Menace"" than does Hughes, who refuses to let old formulas lie.Five stars.  All for the Dennis/Mr. Wilson chemistry.  And for suburbia in all its splendor.Next time, John Hughes, check Marv and Harry at the door.",Dennis the Menace
17,mitsubishizero,Hilariously cute movie,10,3 April 2018,For what it's worth it's a good movie. Dennis is cute and unintentionally mischievous making him a pest to his neighbor Mr. Wilson. The story's not the greatest but it's good enough to be believed. Everything seems to fall into place such as the gags and the lines. The movie basically chronicles the misadventures both Dennis and Mr. Wilson face everyday. Christopher Lloyd's character as the reclusive serial killer is strange yet fits in still. In conclusion the movie's a great family movie and i'd recommend it to anyone.,Dennis the Menace
18,bellino-angelo2014,One of my all time guilty pleasures,8,18 January 2020,"DENNIS THE MENACE is for almost everyone a terrible movie. Despite it was a box office success back in 1993, it has a score on IMDB of 5,6 and many negative reviews. But I love this movie so much that if I would tell everyone how much I love this movie everyone would think I am nuts! I just love this movie because it makes me laugh everytime I watch it (and I just re-watched it for the 10th time).Dennis is a 6 year old kid that loves to play pranks on everyone, and his favourite target is his elder neighbour, Mr. Wilson (Walter Matthau). After the upteenth mischief at Wilson's, Dennis' parents say that they have to go out of town for business trips, and since nobody wants to take care of Dennis thanks to his reputation, they have no other choice than to leave him to Mr. Wilson, much to his annoyance (and his wife's delight since they never had children). In the meanwhile, a dirty and grimy looking thief who has escaped from prison (Christopher Lloyd) arrives at Dennis' hometown striking fear in the people he meets in the streets, burglarizing homes and stealing everything he can find. But after tons of mischief at the anger of Mr. Wilson (during which in one occasion the thief ends at home) Dennis will manage to almost kill the thief and return to his hometown completely safe.I personally loved watching all the mischief done by Dennis and Mr. Wilson's crazy reactions (especially when at one point he accidentally kisses Dennis's dog Ruff). But I think that what makes this movie great is the villain played by Christopher Lloyd (who, despite being a good actor, has a reputation of always making terrible movies such as his Bottom 100 entries FOODFIGHT, BABY GENIUSES and PIRANHA 3DD!) Unlike most of the reviewers I have to say that he was my favourite character throughout the movie. Yes, he is dirty, creepy looking and terrifying, but I just loved to see this delusional character getting hit by various objects multiple times when he kidnapped the kid (in HOME ALONE fashion). And just for this I give the movie a 8.In my opinion, this is among the best movies for families that can be enjoyed by both parents and adults because of its star studded cast, clean humour and lots, and LOTS of cartoon-like gags that kids would love. I know, I should be ashamed for the fact that I love this movie more than everyone on Earth... but I am not.",Dennis the Menace
19,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Uneven with it's story, but not as bad as some say it is",6,29 May 2012,"There are some things that went wrong with this film and I never read the comic strip, but I don't think it's as bad as everyone says it is. I'll start off with the positives.The acting on the whole isn't that bad. Walter Matthau did a good job as Mr. Wilson as did Robert Stanton, Lea Thompson and Joan Plowright, but I think that Mason Gamble steals the show as the most likable title character who got the personality and characterization right. Even his chemistry with Walter Matthau was decent. Also, Christopher Lloyd was very sinister as the main villain and he steals the show as well. The scenery is nice and it has some nice cinematography. I also liked the music from Jerry Goldsmith. Not the best here, but still worth listening.However, the story, while having its nice moments, falls into the predictable zone and the script feels flat and would've been so much better. Some of the humor gave me some chuckles (Dennis causing some trouble to Mr. Wilson and the baked beans farting scene), but some of them lacked wit and the pacing was very mediocre.Overall, uneven with it's story and pacing, but not as bad as some say it is. I'm giving this a 6/10 because of it's likable cast and some nice scenery.",Dennis the Menace
20,Atreyu_II,Surprisingly underrated,8,27 July 2010,"This is the film adaptation of Hank Ketcham's comic strip of the same title. In most cases, film adaptations of comic strips or TV shows simply suck, but with this one not only they did a pretty good job but also made something much better than what it's based on.Dennis is much more likable in this film than in the cartoons. But, before saying more on this, let me say that the cast was very well thought and selected. The actor chosen to portray Dennis's father, for example, looks exactly like the character from the comic strip. It's as if he was the human version of that character. And he is very well on his role. Pretty Lea Thompson does well as Dennis's mother, in a much better role than ""Lorraine"" from 'Back to the Future' trilogy. Hank Johnston is excellent as Gunther Beckman. Walter Matthau... well, they couldn't have chosen a better Mr. Wilson than him! Joan Plowright is just as good as Mrs. Wilson and Mason Gamble steals the show as Dennis Mitchell.Mason Gamble is unbelievably cute. The title suggests that Dennis is a menace. To a point he is, but without meaning to. Dennis is absolutely adorable, loving, sweet, very nice to everyone and innocent. He does many mistakes and often annoys people (particularly the cranky Mr. Wilson), but he doesn't do for bad. He isn't a mean-spirited child, unlike the sadistic kid from those stupid 'Problem Child' movies. Plus, Dennis is really funny and at times so dramatic that he becomes even more hilarious.The character Margaret Wade is simply annoying. No wonder that Dennis and his friend Joey dislike to be with her. I mean, with a girl like that, can you blame them? Another character I have no sympathy for is Andrea, co-worker of Dennis's mother. What Dennis does to her at the end (even though innocently) is deserved, seriously. Mrs. Wilson is a very nice old lady and she's very good to Dennis - she actually treats him as a son (or a grandson).Walter Matthau is, like I said, the best Mr. Wilson ever. And his facial expressions are priceless! He's hilarious, even though he is a grumpy old man, sometimes highly apathetic. For example, the part when he says to Gunther «Gunther, I'm just talking to your daddy on the telephone. He's going to the ice cream store. He wants to take you with him. Hurry up and go home!»... that's kinda mean of him. Imagine the disappointment of the kid when he gets home. But even meaner than that is when he says (despicably) that Gunther is a foot short for his age and cross-eyed. Plus, later in the movie he says some very nasty things to Dennis. Devin Ratray (""Buzz"" from the first 2 'Home Alone' films) has a minor role as Mickey, the boyfriend of Polly (one of Dennis's babysitters). Christopher Lloyd stars as Switchblade Sam, a bandit, but he isn't a likable character. He's filthy, mean and looks sinister, maybe too much sinister, does not fit well in the general nature of this comedy/family movie. Hank Johnston's role as Gunther is minor. Too bad, really. I wish he had a bigger role in the film. Yet it is surprising how, despite his minor role, very brief appearances and almost no dialogs, he manages to be hilarious. Gunther is, just as much as Dennis, unbelievably cute, sweet, loving, innocent and completely adorable. Yet there is something about him that makes him funny. Maybe it's his facial expressions which are innocent and hilarious at the same time - and his crossed-eyes also make him funny, as well as when he says ""a apple"" instead of ""an apple"" and when he waves goodbye to the burglar in the end. There are many hilarious moments and lines in the movie. Classic humor, the kind of humor that can cause you some good laughters. There's plenty of them I could mention, but then I wouldn't finish writing this.",Dennis the Menace

22,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,9,25 May 2014,"Cash-grab adaptation of Hank Ketcham's comic strip centered around a ""mischievous"" (""annoying"" is a far better word) boy Gamble and cranky next door neighbor Matthau. Although one can find many issues with Gamble's portrayal of Dennis Mitchell—one being that the character just doesn't seem like a little boy of the 1990s—he and Matthau end up making a pretty decent duo; while Plowright, Stanton and Thompson all fit nicely into supporting roles. Perhaps the greatest thing about this movie is the chillingly disgusting drifter, played excellently by Christopher Lloyd, who creeps slowly through the cookie-cutter town like a python in a rose-garden. Lots of dull jokes, but the movie never ceases to be boring. Very anti-climatic. Followed by direct-to-video sequel and Saturday morning cartoon.**½ (out of four)",Dennis the Menace
23,Min111,Really good kids movie,6,1 April 2018,"There are so many wonderful family movies during the nineties, and Dennis the Menace is one of them. Personally, it's one of my favourite family movies out there - very entertaining! What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the humour. The story is fun. It's a movie that can teach you some valuable life lessons too. It's a movie which you could never get bored off. I would also say it's an underrated one too. Surprised just how early it was released during the nineties since it looked something which was released after the mid-nineties. What I enjoyed the most about Dennis the Menace was that ""Menace"", and I'm talking about the actual ""Menace"" that is, or in other words, that 'crook' played by Christopher Lloyd (Doc in Back to the Future) - he was so good in this movie.

I loved the black & white sit-com, but this 1990s movie version almost tops it! That lovable sling-shot-toting kid with the cowlick is an unlikely ""menace"" to retired postman Mr. Wilson, who wants nothing more than to be left alone. Dennis Mitchell always seeks out Mr. Wilson's company, but each time disaster strikes, usually causing harm to property or Mr. Wilson (sometimes both). Mrs. Wilson adores Dennis and often volunteers to watch him when the Mitchell's list of possible baby-sitters is exhausted.There is a sub-plot with a ""bad guy"" who, of course gets ""fixed"" by our hero. This is the perfect family movie. It's funny, sweet and makes you feel good when it's through. I showed this video to my 4th grade class (as a reward).

Meanwhile A man named Switchblade Sam played by Christopher Lloyd who likes to stare at children.This is a very gentle film. The child actors are cute, Walter Matthaus performance is very good and the film is often very funny.

28,cosmic_quest,Adorable and funny family film,7,19 April 2006,"I don't know why 'Dennis' only receives a 4.7 rating on IMDb because it is a rather enjoyable film with plenty of cute/funny moments that leave you chuckling so surely deserves a few points more. Based on the comic book and Eighties cartoon, this film centres on five-year-old Dennis, a boisterous little boy who just wants to help but everything he touches turns into a catastrophe. He hero-worships his miserable next-door neighbour Mr Wilson despite the old grump being the sort who thinks children should be seen and not heard. The main storyline is about a thieving hobo Switchblade Sam who has turned up in Dennis' town to make a picking except he hasn't counted on a certain blond-haired moppet making his life a misery!Mason Gamble was just so adorable as Dennis, giving a very engaging and energetic performance that leaves kids wanting to be his friend and adults wanting to adopt him. He's the sort of child who is cute but charming enough to not be just another cutesy Hollywood brat. Walter Mathau was also perfectly cast as the cantankerous Mr Wilson who just doesn't have time for small children and he has a very nice rapport with Joan Plowright, who played the exasperated Mrs Wilson. I also have to mention Christopher Lloyd as he is totally unrecognisable as the filthy, slimy Switchblade Sam and how he is just hilarious as the hardened thief who quickly regrets ever meeting Dennis.In many ways, this film is more involving and enjoyable than similar films such as 'Home Alone' since Dennis is a very sweet, likable character compared with the more cocky and, at times, grating Kevin. There is also few sugary, overly-sentimental moments that often crop up in family films. It would have been nice to see more of interactions between Mr Wilson and Dennis since that was always a great focal point of the cartoon series but this film is still a worthy successor. It should keep fans of the cartoon amused as well as thrill young kids who may not have ever heard of Dennis before now.",Dennis the Menace

33,blazesnakes9,Dennis the Menace....... Is Annoying.,2,11 June 2011,"In 1959, a character named Dennis the Menace was made into a comic strip cartoon. Now, it is adapted by film. Dennis the Menace stars Mason Gamble as the troubled kid who keeps bothering his next-door neighbor, Mr. Wilson, played by Walter Matthau. The movie center around the neighborhood where Dennis engages in mean-spirited pranks that even injured Mr. Wilson. Lea Thompson plays Dennis' mother. She said that Dennis is out of school and on summer vacation. But, why in the world would a brat like Dennis would even be out of school when he was mean to Mr. Wilson? I don't know, but the background is not quite right. Another character is Switchblade Sam, played by Christopher Lloyd. Now, his character is menacing as Dennis. Why? Well, to put it in one way, Switchblade Sam is a probably an escaped convict or a killer. His character is not right for this movie. Especially in a kids movie. As for Mason Gamble, he is an annoying little kid, who I think has no respect for Matthau's character. In one scene, Wilson plans to have a party over his house, and the flower he was growing was blooming when the moon was out. Suddenly, Dennis pop out of the house to say that Wilson's house is robbed by Switchblade Sam. It seems that somebody must have pick Mason Gamble by mistake.

36,ravsten428,Hey Mr. Wilson!,10,13 October 2011,Dennis the Menace is a good film. I love how they show the film being set in the 50's. However you can see that not everything fits in to the decade setting such as the automobiles used in the film.Mr. Wilson the curmudgeonly next door neighbor of the Miller's can't seem too tolerate their young child named Dennis. Wilson sees Dennis as a pest always trying to cause trouble. At some point the Miller's have to both go on business trips forcing them to try and find a babysitter for Dennis. Unfortunately they can't find anybody willing to watch him because of his troublesome manner. Well who's left on the list other than the Wilson's.Understandably Mr. Wilson isn't thrilled at the prospect of looking after him but his lovely wife Martha does not mind at all and is delighted to look after Dennis. Mr. Wilson puts up with Dennis and his antics for awhile but after Mr. Wilson's house is robbed by Switchblade Sam and his debut of his plant that is about to bloom gets ruined when Dennis tells Mr. Wilson his house has been robbed and Mr. Wilson doesn't believe him at first and tells him that he never wants to see him again. Dennis rides away on his bike and gets captured by Sam but he of course saves the day later on and comes back home.The characters in Dennis the Menace are thought out well. However I would have to disagree that Switchblade Sam would look like a total creep and be a thief. This is of course silly as any normal looking person can do bad things. Of course it is a movie and I suppose that he does look very intimidating in the town of clean looking folks.Dennis the Menace may not be for everybody but I think that it stays true to the comic and it is an enjoyable laugh out loud film. This is a good movie and isn't over the top with slapstick and should have most people with a funny bone laughing out of their seat.,Dennis the Menace

38,Logan-22,"Hideously violent and mean-spirited, not for children",1,3 December 1999,"This film is one of the few films to offend me. It proclaims itself to be a children's movie, but is so full of gratuitous (presumably meant to be ""comical"") violence, nasty ""pranks"" and the gruesome sequence with Christopher Lloyd being tortured (nearly to death) by the obnoxious brat Dennis makes DENNIS THE MENACE entirely inappropriate for children. The fact that it is a terrible film in all other respects makes it entirely inappropriate viewing for adults, as well! Would you want your child to repeat any of the ""antics"" Dennis gets away with in real life? They would land your child in jail or the hospital; vicious films like this and HOME ALONE, PROBLEM CHILD, etc. have no place in your child's life.

48,Ronald_Mexico,"Not bad, but...",8,18 January 2006,"For whatever reason, this film has been somewhat underrated since its release in the early nineties. I suspect that much of the apathy stems from the fact that audiences at that time had reached the saturation point with ""Little kid outsmarting the bad guy"" slapstick (Home Alone 1 and 2, The Three Ninjas series, etc). Still, this version of Dennis Mitchell's escapades is well worth a look, and is certainly holds its own against other John Hughes films with a similar (ok, ""identical"") premise.The highlights of the film include winning performances by Mason Gamble and Walter Mathau as Dennis and Mr. Wilson, respectively. Mason Gamble was one of the more talented child actors to grace the screen at the time- if you're able to see more than a 'cute kid' and listen to his inflection, he's actually pretty funny. Mathau, of course, is Mathau and brilliant. It's somewhat annoying that the film decided to go 'PC' in portraying Alice Mitchell as a career woman, but other than that, the casting of the parents and Martha Wilson was perfect. The musical score was also excellent- whimsical, nostalgic, without coming across as cloying.There were only two problems with the film, but they were big ones. First, the director did not adequately develop Wilson's friendship with Dennis, which makes the end scenes seem forced and trite. The only recollection I have of Wilson even speaking civilly to Dennis before he 'ran away' was when he briefly explained why he kept his coins in a safe. Other than that, their relationship was nothing but snarls, grumbling, and apologies. Secondly, the introduction of Switchblad Sam was a typical (and oh so tired) Hughes device, although it was surprisingly violent compared to his other films (watching a cute little five year old force feed and then accidentally set a villain on fire was slightly disturbing, to say the least). Christopher Lloyd's performance was over-the-top and distracting, taking away from what could have become a semi-classic children's film.",Dennis the Menace
49,stephane_decker,A kids movie but not for kids,4,14 October 2008,"Dennis the menace, as the last word points it out right away, is a menacing movie.It is supposed to be for kids, but I remember that I was pretty scared of the movie and I thought that Dennis was just an utter crazy boy, scary in his way. I know that he is kind of supposed to be scary for adults, but as a kid I couldn't really identify myself with anybody in the movie; you're not really involved.Furthermore, a lot of the cuts are directed in a way to submit horror, but in a gentle way. That is like showing us a dangerous car accident but underlining it with cheery music. Something is awfully wrong, it does not feel right. Kids will be frightened by the villain, Mr. Wilson, the girl with the dolls and by the way the director Nick Castle brought the ideas to the screen (only Mrs Wilson is a charming, nice person). This movie simply is not for kids.You might think then this is for adults, for moms and dads, to watch with their children... nnnnno. You see, the problem is that, while you actually are capable of feeling of how much Dennis is a menace for retired men, you never really think that he's an interesting kid; he's very naive, over the top naive which is basically it.The movie then is not for children, nor their parents or anybody else. Especially not for teenagers, nowadays they watch films like Matrix at the age of thirteen. The result is that this movie is probably for no one.4/10",Dennis the Menace
50,bensterpiszczek,"The early 90's had a lot of strange films with misguided logos, but this film-directed by the guy who played the original Michael Myers-takes the cake.",7,18 March 2021,"I first watched this film (Directed by Nick Castle) on VHS many moons ago, and today it's one of those films you can find on Netflix like Space Jam. As an adult; two or three things in this film really make no sense. First, I should explain the premise.The film is about a 5 year old named Dennis Mitchell and an oldster named George Wilson. Dennis is out of school for the summer, and Wilson knows this is no good, as he is always the butt-end of these jokes that are essentially similar to Home Alone traps (John Hughes worked on both films). Wilson is to become the host of a garden party during the summer, but when a homeless man starts a string of burglaries, it tests Dennis and Wilson's bond.There are two things in this motion picture that I have ISSUES with:The plant that George Wilson has at his garden party and the nonsensical biological logic behind it. According to him, this plant (identified as a Night blooming mock orchid) takes FORTY YEARS to grow; the blooming part itself not withstanding. That in itself lasts FIFTEEN SECONDS, and after that, the plant just wilts and dies quickly. There exists NO plant whatsoever that would evolve a trait that takes that window of time to grow. It provides no benefits toward survival, as flowers are a plant's sex organs that form into fruit and subsequently drops seeds. It's highly unlikely, especially when you consider the fact that nobody would be able to time the blooming of the flower down to the exact minute in four decades. The more I think about this, the less it makes sense.
*It gets even dumber. George Wilson spends forty years growing a plant that he is fully aware will bloom for a quarter of a minute knowing that he won't live long enough after it blooms to grow another one if something goes awry. He was only able to grow JUST ONE of these plants, so it's not like he has a backup plan whatsoever, and on the night of the garden party he hosts, his house is robbed by the burglar. Dennis is the only one who witnesses the robbery, as Mr. Wilson made him stay in the house after he accidentally knocked over a table of refreshments. Dennis tells Mr. Wilson that his house has been robbed just as the plant is about to bloom. They all miss the blooming (and because they're old people, it's not like they know how to record things with a camera) and the third act sets in motion.The second act and the chicken George cooks. Dennis wants to help his friends paint a treehouse, and Dennis spills some pain in his garage, which he cleans up with a shop vacuum and accidentally shoots into Wilson's grill with the chicken on it. He doesn't notice this even after he puts the lid on the grill and he walks away, where it sets ABLAZE, the next we see if the chicken, it looks PERFECTLY FINE. It actually looks edible, when realistically it should be charred. If that were the case, he'd be like GODDAMMIT DENNIS!-During the scene where he subsequently investigates the Mitchell garage, and the golf ball is in the vacuum tube. It's sitting on an elevated platform (some kind of grate?) protruding out of the tube as opposed to being within it. This one is minor, but still.This deleted scene that takes place between the kids finishing the treehouse and Dennis arriving back at the Wilson house before the garden party. From what I read, in this scene, the burglar (Switchblade Sam) visits the kids, and offers them candy (and in Margret's case her doll that the burglar previously stole) in exchange for information regarding their parent's valuables. Dennis then proceeds to tell him about Wilson's stash of coins hidden in the book safe. THIS SCENE ALONE EXPLAINS 3 THINGS:
*How Margret inexplicably has her doll back in possession during the search for Dennis in the third act.
*How the burglar knows where Dennis and Wilson live.
*How said burglar found the coins in the house so easily.
Why did this scene get taken out? It would've made Dennis look like a straight dumbass, while also implying that his parents didn't teach him much about talking to strangers. Seriously, this scene proves Dennis caused the problem with the coins initially. It's almost like they took it out because it would've made the rest of the film so predictable.In conclusion, I enjoyed Dennis The Menace a lot as a kid, but I'll always think about what I just explained above.",Dennis the Menace

Wilson, who after finally telling Dennis off, softens when Dennis goes missing shortly after.Mr. Wilson is overjoyed when Dennis rolls back into town and seems like a brand new man...

It's that uninvolving.Great actors, a talented director and writer still can't save a bad script. John Hughes, fairly fresh from Home Alone, had contractual obligations to fulfill, and adapted Hank Ketchum's classic comic strip for film. But studio bosses like to meddle, and I suspect there was a lot of ""change this, change that, it'll make more money"" sorta stuff that flew around during production.
It boils down to this. Walter Matthau. Chris Lloyd, Joan Plowright, and everyone in this film is wasting their time. The whole movie is pointless and dumb, and if you really want to watch Dennis at his best, go find the old black & white television episodes from the late Fifties. Even all the Oscar-caliber talent in this thing couldn't save it from mediocrity.
Recommendations. Want to see these actors at their best? Fine. Here's what to rent:For Walter Matthau, The Odd Couple. For Joan Plowright, I Love You To Death. For Chris Lloyd, Back To The Future, all three of them. For Paul Winfield, Roots. Better yet, the Star Trek episode ""Darmok"". and for this film's director, Nick Castle, The Last Starfighter.Just stay away from this mess. Maybe that way it'll end up buried in the vaults somewhere and vanish into well-deserved obscurity.",Dennis the Menace
61,IMDB_Steve,One of the best Sunday afternoon films there is!,10,3 March 2013,"First of all it has to be said that this film has no relationship whatsoever with the cartoon comic 'Dennis the Menace' you may have read as a child. With that out of the way you can now enjoy the film for what it is, not how you may have remembered a character from your youth.The film is superbly cast with Walter Matthau playing the grumpy old 'Mr Wilson' and a young Mason Gamble playing the role of 'Dennis'. Matthau really is on top form as strong as he was with Jack Lemmon in the 'Grumpy Old Men' films. Gamble is fantastic as the adorable but mischievous 5 year old and shows an acting ability way beyond his years with superb comic timing and wonderful catch lines.Full of laughs, crazy antics, hilarious childhood expression and the odd touching moment too, this is an entertaining film that keeps on giving scene after scene. It's a Sunday afternoon film to watch either on your own or with the kids, either way it won't disappoint!",Dennis the Menace
62,bhamnida,A classic kids movie,8,29 December 2018,"I just thought 5.5 was way too low for this film. I grew up with it, and just rewatched it as an adult, and I think it's simply a solid movie. All of the acting is well done and it has a stellar cast. Well done!",Dennis the Menace
63,skellons,Change the name of the film,3,1 May 2021,"OK so in the US a blond haired cute looking boy who is actually the anti-Christ maybe Dennis...but not in the UK. The problem with this film starts with the name - Dennis is dark haired, causes mayhem for all and has a dog called Gnasher. This isn't Dennis in my books and I couldn't shake that throughout the film. Another attempt at the US film market taking a name and ruining the history and context.",Dennis the Menace
64,JerBet,"This movie is best compared to ""Home Alone"" and the better of the two.",8,11 January 1999,"I feel really badly that this movie is on the list of worst according to average vote.   If you consider that it relies very much on slap-stick humour, which does not appeal to everyone, that might explain its poor showing.The movie is best compared to ""Home Alone.""  I feel it is by far the better of the two movies.  Dennis is wide-eyed and innocent and the slap-stick scenarios are 'accidental' rather than contrived as in ""Home Alone.""This is a movie that elderly parents can watch and be guaranteed to have a good time.  It is also a movie that kids will love.  If those in between can't appreciate it, that speaks a lot for their loss of innocence.",Dennis the Menace
65,slee-10,A perfectly-chosen cast will entertain the entire family,10,4 April 2002,"Dennis the Menace is among the few films on the video shelf that is able to keep the entire family amused.  In the film, we see the newspaper cartoon of our youth come to life with a cast that could not have been more perfectly chosen.  Walter Mattheau and Joan Plowright are ideal as the neighborly object of Dennis' affection; he the loveable old curmudgeon and she the unfulfilled neighborhood grandmother. Mason Gamble embodies the spirit of the spunky menace you cannot help but love. Margaret and Joey appear on the screen just as you had always imagined them, as do the parents of the menace.Of course Christopher Lloyd gives a fine performance as the true menace to this sleepy village. Lloyd  may be just a tad too scary for younger children, and some of the riverside scenes with Lloyd and Gamble may be the stuff of nightmares. Parents beware.If your young ones are not easily scared or influenced to devilment, this will be the film to provide an evening of fun for all ages.",Dennis the Menace
66,chriskilla,"Underrated film, must watch!",9,17 July 2017,"Giving it a 9 to bump it up a bit. It is a 7,5 otherwise. I really like this film, when i was a kid i loved it. But even now when i am old i def can c the charm in this movie. It has great humor , nice environments , small town genre that i like. It makes you feel like you want to live there.Just a nice enjoyable film.",Dennis the Menace
67,b_eazy01,Immensely underrated here!,10,14 June 2021,A lot of family movies that came out during my childhood are unwatchable to me now. But this one never gets old. The writing is tastefully hilarious. The casting is perfect.,Dennis the Menace
68,jordanmccaig,Such a low rating...why?!,8,23 February 2019,"This film is a great little family comedy. I loved it as a kid, and it still holds up today. Walter Matthau is delightfully miserable, Mason Gamble is chasing, and Christopher Lloyd is unrecognisably fiendish.
Get the popcorn, sit the kids down, and enjoy...whilst remembering to tell the kids not to try ANYTHING Dennis does!",Dennis the Menace
69,cphillips-09984,"Came for nostalgia, stayed for Walter Matthau",10,18 August 2020,"I saw this movie when I was 6 years old and I was in love with it. Maybe it was the satisfying imagery or the quiet talking but I had no idea, this movie had some kind of charm to it. Like a Jules Verne novel and a hot chocolate. Besides this movie had some real talent. Walter Matthau, Joan Plowright, Christopher Lloyd. This movie also had the voice of a character from Red Dead Redemption 2.",Dennis the Menace
70,minimeburton,The Best Movie,10,3 September 2004,"Dennis the Menace was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The actors were brilliant, there was not one part that no one would not laugh about it. Out of ten I give this movie a ten plus. The actor Mr Wilson (Walter Matthau) was the best of them all. Knowing that a 72 year old man could be that great in the making of this movie. it is a terrible shame that he passed away in 2000. I will miss him terribly. He had made heaps of movies that were fantastic and really funny to watch.Joan Plowright was great playing Mrs Wilson. She really knows how to act.",Dennis the Menace
71,p_miskiewicz,Classic film for kids & family viewing,10,8 December 2019,"One of my favorite films as a kid, its entertaining for the adults to watch as well.
Some great writing & camerawork. Very well produced. The locations are beautiful and actors are solid as well. I recommend it for anyone looking looking for a good option on family movie night. We keep a copy up at the cottage for rainy days. Thoroughly enjoyable. Can't believe this film only has 5-6 stars at time of this review.",Dennis the Menace
72,LardLad3545,A wonderful family comedy that can be enjoyed again and again!,9,28 July 2006,"This movie is a real treasure. Walter Matheau is excellent as Mr. Wilson and Mason Gamble brings the cartoon Dennis to life for us! Christopher Loyld does a wonderful job of being a menacing Switchblade Sam and is able to be vicious without being truly scary - which is helpful as this is primarily a family movie. His part is important because it shows how even a really mean person (which Mr. Wilson's character is not) can be foiled by the innocent childhood antics of Dennis the Menace.The real joy of this film, beyond the many sight gags and the smart dialog, is how the movie doesn't seem to age with time.. I saw it at the theater in the early 90's and it still seems fresh 13 years later. Also, it is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over and still surprisingly be interesting, enjoyable and brightly funny!",Dennis the Menace
73,ericaeades,Dennis the menace is the greatest,10,9 December 2006,"Dennis the menace only got 4.7. and that is unacceptable. it deserves at least a 16. but you don't give us that option. and that makes you butt faces. Dennis the menace is wonderful. he has a girlfriend named Polly and she is pretty with glasses. there is a scary man. his name is Christopher and he is in back to the future. the story line is glorious. his name is switch blade Sam and he takes apples from little children. we like the movie Dennis the menace, it is fab-u-loud. thank you. sincerely. with greatest concernJoseph Danaherand Erica Eades",Dennis the Menace
74,squidgebunny,One of my many 90s favs,10,17 March 2019,"I love this film, have huge nostalgia for it. But also its an incredibly well acted and funny film for a cast mainly made up of children. I find it a nice comfortable trip done memory lane. Its a great family watch and a classic i think kids would still enjoy today.",Dennis the Menace

76,qaani,Top quality comedy at its best!,10,18 August 2021,"This is my all time favourite movie. Most comedy movies barely raise a chuckle with me, but this one is top quality! Walter Matthau is brilliant. It's the go to movie when I need a laugh.",Dennis the Menace
