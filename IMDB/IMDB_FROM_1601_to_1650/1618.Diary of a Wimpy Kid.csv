0,bkoganbing,Ruefully Painful,6,4 May 2016,"Where I come from middle school is referred to as Junior High School and those are not years I care to relive. Face it folks, if you're not part of the cool kids clique life can be pretty rotten for you. I remember for myself going from baseball cards to supposedly having an interest in girls. Faking it was something you had to do most definitely to survive Andries Hudde Junior High to Midwood High School. At least I had to fake it. Zachary Gordon is like so many kids, just trying to find his niche to fit in. He has an older brother Devon Bostick who's no help at all and parents who just don't quite get it. For instance the fine points of difference between journal and diary. Gordon tries a lot of things and nothing quite works out. He's also got a chubby friend Robert Capron for whom puberty is a late arrival and he's not socially graceful.But in the world of middle school unexpected things occur and it's Capron who wins acceptance first. But in the end Gordon shows some real character that says he's going to come out fine as an adult.Diary Of A Wimpy Kid is based on a best selling book popular with the juvenile set. Some of the film while funny might also be ruefully painful for many adults who watch.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
1,SnoopyStyle,Unlikeable kid gets one right in the end,6,27 October 2013,"Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) is starting middle school. His best friend is Rowley (Robert Capron) is a chubby awkward kid. Greg is selfish, deluded, and generally a bad friend. He can't help embarrass himself. His big brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) loves bullying him.Greg is a jerk and clueless. The best part about him is his friendship with Rowley. That saves him as a character. However most of the time, he's a horrible person and learns nothing from his mistakes.The good thing is that in the end, he learns the lesson and redeems himself. It's a little late. I would prefer him to make the right decision every once in a while. But getting one right at the end is good enough.This is also notable for Chloë Grace Moretz as a kid one year ahead of Greg. She serves as a conscience for Greg which he almost never listens to.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
2,paul_haakonsen,Don't eat the cheese...,6,21 January 2011,"I found ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" to be a rather good movie, with entertainment for the entire family.The story told here is a nice story about lots of things, including friendship, standing up for whom you are, trying to fit in and of course the story of the cheese on the ground (watch the movie and you will know what I mean). I haven't read the book, so I wasn't familiar with the characters, story or anything beforehand. But still, I found this movie to be quite nice. And anyone who ever attended school will be able to recognize lots of things that could happen in real life as well.As for the cast of actors/actresses, well there was a lot of nice performances from the children, especially Zachary Gordon, playing Greg Heffley, and also Robert Capron, playing Rowley Jefferson. These two boy had really good on-screen chemistry and genuinely seemed to be best of buddies. And of course, Chloe Moretz, playing Angie Steadman, did a good job, despite having a rather minor role in the movie. It was, however, somewhat of a surprise to see Steve Zahn in a movie like this, playing Frank Heffley, Gregs' father. But he sort of seemed nice for that role, adding a strangely odd quirk to the father character.Throughout the movie there is a bunch of funny moments and scenes, where you will be laughing, because it is funny, but also sometimes awkward. And that touch of comedy really made the movie work quite well. Of course, the cast had a lot of to do with chemistry of the characters and how they came off on the screen.I think that ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" can be equally enjoyed by adults and children alike, because despite having an almost all-out children cast, there is something to learn from the movie for us all. There are some nice morales being told in the movie. I was genuinely pleased with the movie and enjoyed it.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
3,michaelRokeefe,Not a diary...it happens to be a journal.,8,28 July 2011,"Who hasn't been the victim of a wedgie, pulverized by a bully or farted in class? You must have been home schooled. Only a kid understands a kid. What about the wimpy kid? Greg Heffley(Zachary Gordon)in spite of wanting badly to be cool always comes across as a dork. His friends are nerds, but they're bosom buddies...well, most of the time. Greg keeps a journal of his trials and tribulations of middle school. It seems like he and pal Rowley(Robert Capron)are the only ones not blessed with a growth spurt over summer vacation. Greg haplessly creates get-cool-quick schemes that always seem to leave him the butt of a joke and still out of the loop of cool dudes. His mother(Rachael Harris)sympathetic to his traumas believes the world is a cotton candy land. He desperately hopes that someday he'll be able to look back at his diary, I mean journal, and see his experiences may just prepare him for high school. Situational humor, but not knee slapping belly laughs. I've always liked Harris from her TV commercials, even when she had no spoken lines. Also in the cast: Chloe Grace Moretz, Steve Zahn, Laine MacNeil, Nicholas Carey, Devon Bostick and Grayson Russell.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
4,anaconda-40658,Diary of a Worthy Kid.,8,25 May 2015,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2010): Dir: Thor Freudenthal / Cast: Zachary Gordon, Robert Capron, Steve Zahn, Rachael Harris, Devon Bostick: Amusing comedy about trials. Zachary Gordon plays the wimpy kid who enters middle school only to be scorned and ridiculed. His best friend is a dorky overweight kid played by Robert Capron who gains sudden popularity after Gordon causes an accident. Director Thor Freudenthal establishes the hardships and ambitions of middle school resulting in a film that many kids will relate too. Gordon is superb as a kid who cannot win for losing but ultimately he proves to be a friend when he puts his reputation on the line for the good of another. Capron does a decent job as his best friend. He is odd, behaves in a manner that has him perceived as a dork, and he dresses in a manner that gains him unfavourable comments. What is interesting is how his popularity causes Gordon to become vindictive while he remains the same until the popularity starts to shift his appeal and appearance. What works against the film is that Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris are underused in the otherwise thankless roles as parents. Zahn's spying on the neighbours doesn't fit the material, Harris is too standard and normal. Devon Bostick steals moments as the older brother involved in a band. His attempt at coolness allows him to falter, which translates humour. Otherwise children of this age will relate to its themes of peer pressure and that next step in the growth of youth. Filled with imaginative images, ideas and a diary that paves the way for the next generation. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
5,FlashCallahan,cheese touch......,6,8 May 2011,"To Greg Heffley, middle school is the dumbest idea ever invented. It's a place rigged with hundreds of social land-mines, not the least of which are morons, wedgies, swirlies, bullies, lunchtime banishment to the cafeteria floor - and a festering piece of cheese with nuclear cooties.To survive the never-ending ordeal and attain the recognition and status he feels he so richly deserves, Greg devises an endless series of can't-miss schemes, all of which, of course, go awry.And he's getting it all down on paper, via a diary.....Never heard of the book, i'm a philistine, and had never had any intention of seeing this movie until i saw the trailer for the second movie.So what did i think? Well it's kind of funny, but when you look a little deeper, it's just about a snotty little kid who wants to become the popular one, and gets jealous when things do not go his way.But this is aimed at kids, which goes to explain why the adult characters are wasted wholly in this. But there are some funny scenarios. Halloween is a stand out and the Cheese is the best character in the film.All in all, it's forgettable stuff, but has charm and a lot of personality, not bad, but not brilliant.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
6,Sylviastel,Don't Eat The Cheese!,8,1 September 2015,"The movie adaptation of Jeff Kinney's popular children's novel is a delight. The books are easy reading too. It's a fine family film with a boy named Gregg Heffley who wants to be cool at his first year in middle school. I don't recall the suburban location. Gregg is the middle child and picked on by his older brother. He lives with parents and siblings in a modest suburban home. Steve Zahn plays Dad. Belita Moreno plays a teacher. She is underused in this film. The comedy is light hearted and relative to young kids today. Much like the books, the film captures the story. The children actors are first rate in this film. They don't overact or underact. They're just right in their roles. The film's weakness is the lack of storyline. It's about Gregg's first year in middle school.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
7,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Diary of a Wimpy Kid,9,3 April 2010,"I haven't read the book by Jeff Kinney which this film is based upon, but one thought struck my mind, and that is Ferris Bueller just got younger! For all his wisecracks, smart alecky ideas and attitude, Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) just reminds me of the time when Matthew Broderick took on the Bueller role, though this time round it's got less to do with cars and girls, but everything to do about surviving middle school, just about the time before puberty kicks in for him.No thanks to the 101 tactical lessons on middle school survival by his brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick), Greg decides that his goal and calling during his time will be to be Mr Popular, though he increasingly finds that task being close to impossible given the number of his schemes backfiring most of the time, and when his best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) continues to be the source of embarrassment to his perceived supercool demeanour. He tries to rewrite the school's playground rules, only to find that he isn't quite the trend setter or the visionary he thinks he is, while his plus sized friend somehow manages to climb up the popularity rankings.It's about that time in our lives where we think we're able to change the world from a very young age, where we think we're infallible, and that whatever we do, we can reset the established norm. It's about how negative emotions such as jealousy and envy get the better of us sometimes, and we react in the nastiest of ways due to pride. Then there's the message of being true to oneself rather than the actor being someone else. Relatively heavy themes for what's essentially a kids' film, but that's how director Thor Freudenthal managed to include in the tale of the wimpy kid's first year in middle school without you feeling overwhelmed but them.What works here wonderfully is the casting, which is probably just about the highlight of the film itself. Zachary Gordon owns the role as Greg and has this schmuck look on him that doesn't irritate, but will buy you into his exploits, and most times laugh along or at him depending on whether his antics will rub you the right way or not. And nearly stealing the limelight away from Greg, is his best friend Rowley, played to wingman perfection by Robert Capron, who like his character is always on the verge of upstaging Zachary Gordon and stealing his thunder. The two are believable as best friends forever in Harry Potter-Ron Weasley proportions, and it is their play against each other, one using the other to further his cause, the other just happy to have someone whom he can try to emulate, being the strong points in the narrative. Their acting's natural, and have incredible chemistry so much so that you wonder if everything will go downhill when they split.The humour in the film is manifold, from pure wit right down to the occasional toilet humour with farts, pee and all, from the home to outside of home, and the usual challenges faced when in battlezones such as the canteen, the gym, and festivals like Halloween and even Mother-Child Night?! The basic animation featured in the film also boosted its narrative through its simple, iconic drawings, and provides very much on how Greg sees himself, and that of his friends and family, which no doubt had tinges of familiarity and being stereotypes, such as the nasty big sized girl whose influential family means she can act like a bitch, or that nerd outcast that everyone tries to avoid. Plot elements such as the rotting piece of cheese stuck on the school grounds also provide for plenty of inane moments, and Cheese Touch is something that I'll never forget.Diary of a Wimpy Kid is loads of fun, being reminiscent of the time when growing up was quite the pain and more often than not a time of being misunderstood. Highly recommended!",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
8,Mr-Fusion,A decent diary entry,6,15 August 2017,"I didn't give ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" much credit when I'd first heard about it, and that's because they went the live-action route. The charm of the books is the comic book aspect; each drawing has that Dilbert-like simplicity and you'd be surprised how much humor can be wrung out of such rudimentary artwork. No, seriously, the books are hysterical. I never understood why they didn't just go CGI like ""Captain Underpants"". It stayed true to the books and it worked.That said, the movie does capture the heart of the books, and that's what matters. The character of Greg is a little off (he's kind of a dick) but his relationship with Rowley is the important part. It still takes some getting used to pegging these actors as the characters we know so well, but then again, I did laugh more than I'd expected to.6/10",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
9,namashi_1,Lingers Your Memory...,6,8 August 2010,"Films like 'Diary Of A Wimpy Kid' take you back in time. Of how, we celebrated our school days and how we cherish them today. Moving on, 'Diary Of A Wimpy Kid' is a fairly entertaining film, that makes you laugh, re-counts your memories and is cute in nature.Based on the book in the illustrated novel series of the same title by Jeff Kinney, Thor Freudenthal has directed the film well. However, the film is not without it's minuses. It gets repetitive and is about 10-15 minutes longer then it should've actually been.Coming directly to the acting department, Zachary Gordon is first-rate as the protagonist. He expresses the haste nature, anger and envy every kid goes through. Robert Capron is outstanding! The real scene-stealer! Chloë Moretz looks lovely, as always, and performs superbly. Steve Zahn in a brief role, has not much to do. Alex Ferris is hysterical.On the whole, It's film that will entertain you in those 90 minutes, and expect only entertainment from this one. Nearly, A Thumbs Up!",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
10,StevePulaski,Diary of a Bad Movie,1,4 July 2010,"Anger, agitation, frustration can all describe the emotions during the film Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The book itself states in it's tagline ""A novel in cartoons"". Not ""A novel that will be turned into a crap, live action movie shortly."" The part where a golden ray of sunlight was shone on this movie was seeing the cartoons from the novel come to life on the screen. Though those would disappear faster than you can blink.The film follows closely to the book it represents, in this case the first novel in the DOWK series. Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) is starting middle school on the wrong foot. He has an overprotective mother, a confused/harmless father, a humiliation bound older brother, Rodrick, and a innocent youth named Manny. Greg has really only one close friend, childish and loner Rowley (Ropert Capron). He is often poked fun at by his classmates and Greg himself. Not only in the film does he do a bad job of being mature, but does a miserable job at acting.The film tries to be cute and funny with its jokes on ""The cheese"" which is just as bad in the book as in the movie, the stupid recurring jokes about a classmate having ""a cute butt"", and the weird kid no one gets by the name of Fregly. If anyone has reads my ""It seems we were more mature when we were younger"" blog, many kids at my school found the jokes in this movie to be funny, which I find completely distasteful, but I'm not the one with poor judge-meant and taste.Its unrelenting to watch two amateurish actors (Gordon and Capron) try to make the cartoon versions of themselves come to life was a miserable attempt that should have never came pass the talking stage. I never wanted this film to be made, but this is a new low in poor kid films. I love the book, I hate the movie. Enough said. Its a miserable uninspired mess that acts funnier than it is. It basically picks every possible bone to get a laugh out of the audience. I have never put my hand in my palm to shade myself from the poor jokes ever in a film. This is groundbreaking.A sequel will probably be spawned along with another, and eventually being a movie to go with every book. Most having the redundant plot line and the dull character adaptation about a self absorbed kid. Keep in mind, I consider myself wimpy, I think I'm a wimp, I know I'm unappealing and non-athletic. At least I can face the fact rather then push myself to the limit with exercise equipment and thinking I will be the next Bill Gates or someone rich and famous. Director of Hotel for Dogs, Thor Freudenthal should find better work than great books turned into Grade F kids films. Beyond mediocre and boundaryless in the distasteful department, Diary of a Wimpy Kid is the worst film I have seen all year.Starring: Zachary Gordon, Robert Capron, Rachael Harris, Steve Zahn, and Devon Bostick. Directed by: Thor Freudenthal.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
11,KineticSeoul,Brought back a lot of memories,7,6 August 2010,"I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Mainly because I can relate with a lot of stuff that is going on in this movie, kinda like how some stuff are funny or entertaining because you can relate to it. Call it nostalgia, but I enjoyed this movie although it's over exaggerated so kids can enjoy it as well. Although the book was written for kids, this is a movie that kids and adults can enjoy watching and has a decent message for kids as well. I actually enjoyed this one enough to the point of actually looking forward for the sequel. Now I ain't going as far to actually go read the books, but for a adaptation to a kid's book, it did a fine job.7/10",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
12,Robert_duder,"Fun and silly, Wimpy Kid is for all the kids and kids at heart!",7,18 July 2010,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid won't be this years blockbuster film for kids. It likely won't even be a huge hit but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Imaginative, outrageous, and funny the film definitely takes liberties in poking fun at itself, school, and being a pre-teen but in mostly good ways. If any youngster has even remotely similar problems at school or in life then Diary of a Wimpy Kid will make them see things in a light and fluffy and funny way. The film absolutely has a target demographic of pre-teen and slightly younger, but adults like myself will still have fun chuckling at the angst and antics of the kids and how serious all of it is to them. The lead character is so likable and his sketchings add imagination and laughs to the whole ordeal. Diary of a Wimpy Kid covers school, friends, family, and everything in between and does so with a simple, well written concept. Though I have never seen the books I have this feeling that this is really a terrific adaptation of the original novels. All four co-writers have extensive experience in writing for Television and in particular writing youth driven angst stories so this is easy for them.At 12 Zachary Gordon already has easily a dozen credits under his belt and I think its easy to see why. He is charismatic and fun to watch and already has a surprising grasp on comedic concept. He has emotion, and realistic responses and best of all gives some terrific laughs. Relative newcomer Robert Capron does a solid job as Gordon's best friend but unfortunately (and perhaps on purpose) his character is rather more made fun of than taken seriously. He sort of gets the short end of every stick but if that's the way the character is than Capron nails it. Rachael Harris and the almost always amazing Steve Zahn play Gordon's parents. They don't have a huge role in the story but enough to make it effective and they are fun and easy to watch and silly in their own right. Devon Bostick is absolutely terrific as the tormenting older brother Rodrick. The chemistry between him and Gordon is palpable and perfectly delivered for laughs. Also a young professional already Chloe Moretz is good as a new girl friend for the boys. Unfortunately similarly to Capron she doesn't get a lot of depth to her character and hopefully any future instalments will explore her character more. Karan Brar and Grayson Russell round out the cast and do terrific jobs in the respective roles as friends. Brar delivers some amazing dead pan humour and Russell is that annoying, gross little geeky kid that nobody ever likes.Director Thor Freudenthal has done several family films over the course of more than a decade but his projects are few and far between so perhaps he chooses his projects wisely. I think (and again I have never read the books so I could be totally off base) that he stayed true to the original concept, which is easier to do with children's books like this. Is the film perfect? No. I think it sits on a very fine line between poking fun and being cleverly humorous. Although I read a few reviews where adults said they thoroughly enjoyed it, its more of an 'aw that's cute' rather than thoroughly entertaining but if you have to sit through a kids film this is one you won't be disappointed seeing but at the same time you probably won't rush out to see this one solo if you're older than...11? A fun movie. 7/10",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
13,MLDinTN,a movie for brothers,7,29 December 2011,"This was a cute kids movie about 3 brothers. The film centers around 7th grader, Greg, and how he gets along with friends and family. He has a younger 3 year old brother he finds annoying. But the movie focuses on his relationship with his older high school age brother, Rodrick. They are always at odds and pulling pranks on each other. There's the skating ring where Rodrick teases Greg about Holly, the pretty new girl, and he plays rock music right as Greg is asking her to dance. There's the prank before church where Rodrick puts a candy bar in Greg's seat, and it looks like poop on his pants. Their mom comes up with the idea of mom bucks, which means she will pay them to spend time with each other and be civil. Their parents go on a trip leaving the 2 boys at home and of course there is a party that leads to some laughs as the parents are coming home early and the bathroom door needs replacing. After sticking together about the lies of no party, they start hanging out, and there is some fun with fake vomit.Some of the movie is also about Greg's friends, mainly his best bud, Rowley. They have a sleepover and watch a scary movie and there is some laughs with a gift made by his little brother. Then there is Chirag, whom teases Greg, so he plays the invisible game with him till he flubs up because of being outsmarted.FINAL VERDICT: It's fun and cute. I think kids will like and I liked it too.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

15,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,8,5 August 2010,"The Diary of a Wimpy KidI'm hard-pressed to believe a wimp could keep a diary. In fact, a true weakling wouldn't even be able to lift a pencil to write in one.Fortunately, thanks to computers, kids no longer have to exert any energy to write diary entries or anything else.Determined to be the most popular kid in middle school, Greg (Zachary Gordon) will do anything to gain the admiration of his peers, including turning his back on his less-than-cool friend Rowley (Robert Capron).But when Rowley is suddenly well liked, Greg's left with egg on his face and moldy playground cheese in his belly.Based on the illustrated novel, The Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a brawny comedy: the characters are wacky, the situations are zany and the theme of schoolboy camaraderie is a welcome change.In fact, young men everywhere should refer to their chums as their BFF (Boy Friend Forever).

It's considered a family movie, but if you graduated from school you better skip it. The story of a 12-year-old who wants to be popular at a new school at all costs, but tries in the wrong and ugly ways, and after much peripeteia finally learns his lesson. The classic story of friendship, selfishness and sacrifice, bullying, complexes, and responsibilities ... there's nothing new that could interest anyone older than the movie's protagonists.

It wasn't laugh out loud hilarious, but it had a certain charm. It reminded me of the TV show ""Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide"" that was on Nickelodeon from 2004-2007.All the main characters seem like nice enough kids, barring the bullies of course.Zachary Gordon is perfectly cast as Rowley Jeffers the title character of the movie. Robert Capron is a good laugh as his best mate.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here, as child actors tend to be hit and miss at best.Chloe Grace Moretz is one of the most talented young actress's in movies today, and her talent is in rare supply.

18,strong-122-478885,"The Verbal-Diarrhea Of A Cynical, Little Brat",3,23 June 2014,"I'd say that the name of Rodrick's punk band ""Loaded Diaper"" (spelled ""Loded Diper"") was a perfect metaphor for summing up this dreary, over-rated film in a nutshell - 'Cause, to me, all this film amounted to was just being a ""loaded diaper"".And speaking about Rodrick (Greg's older brother), I thought that he was a total closet queen. When he started wearing eye-liner his apathetic parents didn't even seem to be in the least bit concerned that their son just might be transforming into their daughter.Here are some of the messages that this film sent out to me - Having a good, solid rapport with your parents is completely unimportant.If you're a parent it's OK to totally humiliate your kids in front of their friends, as Mrs. Heffley did with Rodrick when confronting him about his ""girlie"" magazines.It's good to take out revenge on others. And always make sure to hit back twice as hard when you do.When choosing friends, always pick ones who are clearly less attractive and/or intelligent than yourself. This makes you appear to be so much more appealing in the eyes of others.Love thy gym teacher, even though this lard-assed jerk with love-handles is a terrible role model and a hypocrite when it comes to the likes of physical fitness.This movie repeatedly drove home the message that middle-school students have nothing but hatred and resentment for one another. And when it comes to vicious bullying, girls are just as horrible and nasty as boys. (In fact, they are sometimes even worse bullies) One of the most alarming statements made in this film was about how widespread cruelty and hatred was even amongst the younger children of today.I thought that the snot-nosed Zachary Gordon made for a terrible ""Wimpy Kid"" character (aka. Greg Heffley). He was totally miscast for the part.I absolutely despised the Greg Heffley character. I found him to be just as much of an obnoxious monster as the people he so sneeringly pointed out as being beneath himself (the morons).For a 10 year-old kid Greg's bitter cynicism was unbelievably appalling. At the pessimistic rate that he was going, what was this arrogant, little brat gonna be like 10 years down the road? And finally - I found this whole frickin' business about the slice of rotten, moldy cheese sitting out on the outdoor basketball court to be taken way too far. It was humorous once, but after that it was a bore. (Why had this cheese slice been sitting out there in the same spot for so long? Like, didn't this school have a janitor who took care of cleaning up litter, etc. on the grounds outside of the building, as well?) P.S. - If this film had been turned into a feature-length, animated production, using the goofy, cartoon, stick-figure people as its characters, then, I'm sure, that it would've been so much more entertaining to watch. This sort of approach would have worked so much better (certainly to its advantage), in the long run.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
19,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent big-screen adaptation of a Jeff Kinney bestseller,9,17 June 2013,"Even though I haven't read the novel, DIARY OF A WIMPY KID, in my opinion, is an excellent big-screen adaptation of a Jeff Kinney bestseller. If you ask me, Patty (Laine MacNeil) was a totally b****y ice queen. I think that for many reasons. My favorite part of this movie was when ""The Wizard of Oz"" was being performed on-stage at school. One reason is because all hell broke loose. If you really want to know why, you'll have to see the movie. When you do, you'll know what I meant.

20,3xHCCH,Erratically Entertaining Interpretation of the Books,5,3 April 2010,"My kids introduced me to the Wimpy Kids books, and I was able to read the first three in quick succession. The books told the story of Greg Heffley and his years in middle school, his friends and his family.I could not imagine the characters in the book as live people while I was reading. I could not say that the actors looked like I imagined them to be. In fact, the animated parts of the movie were actually very cute, and I wished for more of these animation, rather than the live actors. To be fair though, the lead duo of Zachary Gordon (as Greg) and Robert Capron (as his best friend Rowley) do very well to bring their characters to life. They also have good chemistry as best friends. I did not really like the way the rest of the Heffley family was cast as they all seem drab and annoying, especially the Dad.This movie is basically a translation of that first book into live action. It has the same hodge-podge style of episodic situations tethered by a tenuous storyline, which seemed better for the books, rather than for a movie. It was one erratically entertaining movie. Sometimes it can be hilarious (like the sleepover in Fregley's house), sometimes the humor falls flat (like the ending with the cheese). There was the unproductive introduction of new but major supporting role of Angie Steadman, who was not in the book. With a running time of over 90 minutes, that could be a lot of hit-or-miss.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
21,ptb-8,The kid's all right...,7,2 October 2010,I laughed out loud and often at this terrific family comedy. Zachary Gordon's amazing performance and charisma (incredibly he looks like Jamie lee Curtis!) certainly is the best debut of carrying a whole major mainstream movie (he is TEN...!) since Mackaulay Culkin in HOME ALONE. This school age farce about one 10 year old's emotional journey and lesson in true friendship is really funny with great insight and well defined characters. His friend Rowley played by equally talented and kind Robert Capron counterpoints the needs of our thoughtless hero who's 'best friend' status comes out for some tough scrutiny. The hilarious support characters and shambles situations are just out and out funny. I loved the Halloween adventure especially and is definitely the funniest since MEET ME IN ST LOUIS....... WIMPY KID has had some tough reviews which baffle me. I thought it was great and so did 10 year old Rohan who went with me. We especially loved the cheese touch.....and the truly horrible garage rock star brother with the eyeliner. Hilarious! Go. Haven't read the book. Loved the movie instead.,Diary of a Wimpy Kid
22,robertemerald,Charming middle school entry movie is OK for any age,9,3 February 2020,"The best thing about Diary of a Wimpy Kid is that it starts with variety and quick edits, incorporating fun tunes, wonderful animation and interesting action. I suppose the thing that really sets it apart is the ambition of the lead, brilliantly cast and played, which is for the most part fantasy, but so hopeful and true to a small kid's mind that it instantly charms. The corresponding charm is that this kid has a big and tolerant heart, crucial to the story, so that, despite making mistakes, basically he's prepared to entertain the weirdo kids at the expense of his own popularity. He's good looking, so such an attitude is refreshing, and a credit to his anxiety ridden parents, also superbly cast and played. His best friend is a wizard of non-conformity, also refreshing. There's an array of great characters, such as the bullying older brother, the local punk gang, the precocious popular girl, the do-it-anyway baby brother, two other brilliant weird kids, and the sympathetic yet uncool older nerd girl. With 117 reviews of this movie so far at this site I probably don't need to rabbit on, but I will say that the filming techniques and cameras used still present a crisp and colourful modern looking movie. If I have any criticism at all it is that the story didn't push the adventures a little beyond the routine activities of kids that age. Great watch that anyone can easily enjoy.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
23,WeAreLive,Close to the books,9,27 April 2018,"Diary of a wimpy kid is a really fun movie to watch and it is probably the only one which is close to the actual book. Although I personally think this movie is a bit childish compared to the other ones but I was 10 when this came out.My recommendation is to read the book before you watch the actual movie that way you would know a bit more of the characters. However the only change I noticed was that in the book Rowley eats the leftover cheese but in the movie Greg removes it. The cast including Zachary Gordon, Devon Bostick, Robert Capron, Steve Zahn, Rachael Harris and Owen Fielding all did a great job as their roles as the character.All in all it's good movie for families with kids.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

The director still did a great job by adopting this book and presenting it I think the way it will be in the books as well. After understanding that it's for kids of 8-12yrs I had great time watching it. It was funny and very entertaining. Zachary Gordon did a good job playing the lead Wimpy kid (Greg) he was totally natural though the real funny kid and scene stealer in the movie was Robert Capron (Rowley). He was hilarious, funny and adorable. His one liner jokes are just Hilarious I was literally laughing hard. Chloe Moretz did get to do much but she was adorable as always. Devon Bostick as mean brother of Greg was like a Brat teenager, he has some really funny moment in it with Zachary Gordon. Watch it because it takes you into the mind of a young kid, I liked it though the ending was like from Kindergarten Kid's mind.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
26,Pumpkin_Man,Awesome Family Fun!!!,7,6 April 2010,"This movie was actually a lot better than I expected, and had some hilarious moments. I can relate to some of the things that happened to Greg. I have not read the book, so I couldn't compare it. 12 year old Greg Heffley is nervous about starting middle school. Him and his dorky best friend, Rowley Jefferson try to fit in and become popular, but that's easier said than done. Throughout the school year, Greg and Rowley come up with weird ways to become popular like being a Safety Patrol officer, wrestling, and performing in epic school plays. In order to truly appreciate this film, you either need to be a parent, or think from the perspective of a kid. I highly recommend DIARY OF A WIMPY KID!!!",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

28,napierslogs,It's a problem when you can't separate the hero from the morons,4,12 August 2010,"""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" does not live up to its billing. ""I'll be famous one day, but for now I'm stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons."" And I loved the drawing: ""me ->"" and ""morons ->"". Unfortunately that's how it was watching the movie, here's me and a bunch of morons and before I turned off the movie, I felt like one of the morons.The movie relies on the universal, and yet solitary, feeling, that we can be good and popular and accomplish everything we want to if only we weren't surrounded by a bunch of morons. I completely bought into their premise, but I couldn't buy into the main character. He was just too desperate, selfish, and annoying for the audience to care for him or relate to him. He basically deserved all of the horrible things that happened to him, and that was not fun viewing.Despite the fact that it's not fun viewing and the main character is a self-absorbed pest, I can see its value for fans of the genre. The bullying scenarios are pretty accurate, the film has a great pace, and the acting is pretty good, especially by the main ""wimpy kid"". If you can get past your indifference or even hatred for the so-called ""hero"" then it is watchable.But for me, the expectations for ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" were too high, and just couldn't be reached.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
29,johnstonjames,Hilarious. Just As Funny As The Book.,7,6 November 2010,"even though this movie was aimed at little kids (the ""PG"" rating is an extreme for this), and i'm a 49 year old male, i still thought it was pretty funny. i actually read this book a couple of years ago. it was for children, but it made the NY Times bestseller list and the library happened to be pushing it in a display at the front desk. it also was easy to read and had funny pictures so i figured it would be no sweat. i read it in less than three hours.this was a good adaptation of the book and managed to capture a lot of the childhood frustrations and humorous situations effectively. i didn't think the kid who played greg, looked anything like the drawings in the book. but the kid actor who played him did a great job anyway and was really funny. the kid who played Rowley was a scream and looked and seemed just like Rowley in the book. the kid who plays Greg's older, obnoxious, brother Rodrick was perfect. just like Rodrick in the book. and the performance was hilarious. the scene where the mother makes Rodrick guilty for reading pornography and she asks if he has anything to say to women, and Rodrick guiltily replies, ""sorry women"".sometimes i think Rodrick is the funniest and most revealing of all. typical teenage American boy, obnoxious, self involved, with very little redeeming traits or potential. the mother pretends she understands and accepts Rodrick's behavior because she really can't control it, and the father ignores most of Rodrick's angst because he's afraid to confront it. very revealing and very funny.still, the two little kid actors who play Greg and Rowley are the ones who stand out best. these are two great, funny performances. some of the best i've seen by kids recently. i always think it's hilarious when Rowley embarrasses Greg in front of everyone by asking him if he wants to ""plaaaay"". or when Rowley is trying to be cool and he tells the popular kid, ""nice butt"". this movie's a riot.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

31,RossRivero99,Oddly one of the best family movies ever made,9,11 August 2014,"Thor Freudenthal's Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a movie i thought was going to be very bad but when some of my friends told me that it was funny I still had no doubt in my mind that it was going to be terrible, but to me when I saw it last night I thought it was stupid, then I thought it was a guilty pleasure then it was a very good movie that for me is one of the best movies of 2010. The movie stars Zachary Gordon as Greg Heffley a kid who is just about to go into middle school in the beginning of the movie he asks his older brother Rodrick what middle school is like but Rodrick says something that has nothing to do with the question which he says ""Don't look, or talk to anyone, don't be noticed etc."" because he thinks his brother is really that wimpy so that he can be shy about middle school. Freudenthal uses a young and unfamiliar cast including Robert Capron as his best friend Rowley Jefferson, Rachel Harris and Steve Zahn as his parents, Devon Bostick as his freakish brother Rodrick, Laine MacNeill as Patty Farrell a bully who beat him up in kindergarten and 4th grade. All of these characters try to prove that he is a loser except for his best friend Rowley. But in the end the movie may be weird and vulgar, as well as being funny in certain scenes, but the movie works as a dramatic character study that to me is one of the best family movies ever made.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

33,cat_ranchero,Good without ever being great...,6,7 April 2012,"Quite well made although I did have the feeling I was watching one of those kids TV shows set in a school (there are many). Production values aside, I did like the use of the occasional cartoon to illustrate a point, if anything, I would have liked a few more of these. Never having read the books (I'm neither young nor American), I don't feel inspired to do so on this evidence. Don't get me wrong, the film was OK, but no more than that. I found the character of Greg was far too self centred and would go to almost any lengths to make himself look good, or at least not look bad. Now to some, that's funny, but to me, I'm afraid it's pretty lame and quite sad. Even so, there were some good points; I did like the 'Cheese Touch' story for instance and the way Rowley gets ahead by just being himself. Over all, a film that had some bad points and some good; I probably wouldn't watch it again, but I may watch the sequel when it makes it to TV-land, just to see if Rowley ever grows up.My Score: 6.0/10IMDb Score: 6.1/10 (based on 12,287 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 53/100 (based on 103 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 48/100 (based on 95,500 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
34,scottshak_111,Enjoyable and lovely,6,19 August 2010,"I really enjoyed the movie. The movie depicts the life of a teen Greg (Zachary Gordon) who has his issues of longing to be famous in the middle school.He ranks himself 19 on the popularity list.He has a dream to fulfill.He considers his previous friends 'who were not able to grow up' according to him ... morons and tries to maintain his standard by keeping his distance from the infamous.His best friend Rowley however though weird in his ways,as Greg considers him 'still not Middle school ready',keeps on posing a threat to his popularity position. Chloe Moretz has a wonderful role herself in the movie however her appearance is short.But the story is however about the wimpy kid and hence that becomes justified.There are a lot of funny moments in the movie and you would smile every now and then on their innocence.There is one another character Fregley- Greg places him at the last position in the popularity list. There is this funny moment wherein whoever touches the piece of stale cheese is considered to have THE CHEESE TOUCH. Whoever touches that person takes with himself the cheese touch.Even a cockroach was concerned about its dignity. No matter how hard he tries he always gets branded every now and then as the douche.Eventually however Greg learns that it really doesn't matter if one is on the top of the popularity list in the school but what matters the most is being on the top of the list of your best friends. A little act of genius and sacrifice vindicates him eventually. I found the movie totally enjoyable as guys we were kids once remember after all ! We used to consider some little and petty things as important, didn't we ? The sequel to the movie - Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2: Rodrick Rules is set to hit the theaters in March 2011 and I'm looking forward to it as well. The movie was really cute and I wish everyone watches it although I'll give it a 6 as it wasn't excellent though but the movie is highly recommended if you want to relive a part of your past.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
35,MovieGuy01,Diary Of A Wimpy Kid.....A great comedy film for all ages!!,8,24 July 2011,"I have to say that really enjoyed this movie. It is about a young teenage boy called Greg (Zachary Gordon) who really longs to be famous in the middle school that he attends. His has a best friend Rowley who is quite weird in his ways i really like the cast in this movie especially Angie Steadman (Chloe Moretz) who i also think is a great actress. There is one other boy called Fregley (Grayson Russell) who i thought was very funny. Greg places him at the last position in the popularity table at the school. No matter how hard Greg tries he is always though of as unpopular with the others in his school. There are some very funny moments in the films, one is where whoever touches a piece of stale cheese in school yard then has the cheese touch. Greg eventually learns that is does not matter if you are on the top of the popularity list at your school. I found the movie very enjoyable to watch. I felt that i could really relate to the things that happened to Greg. The cast were all great. It is a very good entertaining movie that can be enjoyed as much by adults as well as kids.

38,zac-04879,Sticky But Enjoyable,7,31 July 2021,"This book-based journey through a single year of middle school is fun, cringey and should definitely be witnessed by young kids. Although most tweens and teens will agree that Jeff Kinney's books are of higher quality, director Thor Freudenthal still never fails to portray similar material in the movie.Greg Heffley, Diary of a Wimpy Kid's lead character, sure has a selfish and quite an unlikeable personality, but his and the rest of the cast's performances are pretty watchable. Despite the lame averageness featured in pretty much every family movie, Diary of a Wimpy Kid is usually entertaining, but also deals with friendship and silly middle school topics.Don't expect the most clever ideas, but it achieves portraying the main elements kids loved about the book. You'll understand why some audiences felt this comedy was just a big chunk of snot. The gross-out humour is also a little nonsense, however, it's honestly quite an enjoyable film. The characters are unforgettable and the pacing is decent.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
39,TheCorniestLemur,I was a wimpy kid like you once,7,5 July 2021,"Oh yeah. Now this is true cinephile material.I don't have much nostalgia for many films that are memed a lot from this sort of era, but this particular one? I could probably recite the whole script to you word for word back in the day.Obviously it's faded from my memory a bit since, but if anything, I'm surprised it did, because going back to it...I'm amazed at how good it actually was.It's like... actually funny? And well acted? And is juuuuuuust realistic and mature enough to recognise that some of this stuff is what you'll unfortunately have to get used to in middle school, while still being amusing enough that I wasn't ever bored by it.The main issue I hear brought up story-wise is that Greg is a conniving little bugger, which he is, but I'd say that's just simply his character arc. He starts the film willing to do anything to get popular at school, to the extent of framing his best friend, and gradually starts to see how all this desperate trying gets him nowhere, while his best friend actually does do well just being himself.So honestly, I'd find it hard to understand how kids could take the wrong message from this at the end of the day.And seriously, I can't stress enough how good the performances are, because if there's one thing I thought wouldn't be good about this, it would be the kids' acting, but I couldn't have been more wrong. They're all surprisingly really great.It's not all that well directed or shot, but it's certainly not terrible on that front either, and the dialogue and characters are really entertaining, even to me in 2021, maybe as much as me in 2010.So yeah, the memes did not lie, this is in fact Kino (TM), and the NotMyGreg/Rodrick hashtags exist for a reason.Believe The Hype.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

When I first heard of this film, I watched it. This film was brilliant. I absolutely loved it...to me everything was great. The actors were brilliant, it had its great moments. To be honest, I seemed to like the movie a bit more than the novel, though I believed the novel was great.This film is about a lazy child, who prefers to spend his time playing video games and watching movies. He is forced to go through Middle school which he finds to be ridiculous. A lot of things happen in this film, and its directed nicely. The pacing is brilliant and at first, I didn't realize how the whole novel could be put into a film in under two hours.

41,canuckteach,Fair to Middlin...,6,4 April 2010,"I saw Diary of a Wimpy Kid (DOAWK) at a Cineplex large screen (full-price), with 2 grand-daughters, one of whom has read the books (I haven't). I concur with others that the film starts out promising, but tends to bog down in the middle. The main character becomes a little mean-spirited, and the fun begins to fade somewhat. I gather that the books contain a certain cynical tone for the main character, and that the humour plays off that. When you transfer to a screenplay, you have to get the 'voice' right, or else the gags don't work.I might compare it to describing a Seinfeld plot to a bewildered foreigner: ""you see, George takes a disabled parking spot at the mall, causing a girl in a wheelchair to have an accident, so George and Kramer buy her a replacement wheelchair that has defective brakes, and she goes screaming down a hill.."" sounds mean, huh? it's not -- it's hilarious WHEN you see it in context. Maybe that's what happens in DOAWK -- incorporating several ideas from the books resulted in some 'losing the context', so to speak.However, family films are few and far between these days, and this is passable family fun. My advice? if you have a matinée-priced theater, go see it. At full price? stay home and watch your 'Better off Dead' DVD on your big screen TV.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

Then I see the movie.To be honest, it could have been better. But to be honest, it could have been worse. The story is basically a stereotypical middle school exaggerated. It actually didn't do that bad of a job making fun and exaggerating the way school is. Rejects, populars, girls, bullies, etc. It was very amusing to see how the movie portrayed the characteristics.I was actually quite impressed not by the story but by the way it was presented. It was obviously overly exaggerated during some scenes. The mother-who-believes-the-troublemaker, the 'talking to a girl for the first time', etc. The acting wasn't the greatest but it wasn't horrible either.Unfortunately as I was watching this on DVD, a few times during the movie it froze, so the story with the cheese I didn't fully understand.

I was disappointed.Steve Zahn was just bizarre as the father. Not really funny--just strange. Some of the situations were very promising, but the comic potential was not fully realized. Through about the first hour, I smiled occasionally. But then I thought the film was really going to take off, with the scene about auditions for The Wizard of Oz. But that potential just fizzled out.I am wondering if the film was directed solely toward pre-adolescents. Maybe they would think this film is hilarious.

Robert Capron as Rowley Jefferson, Greg's best friend, he is good as well and his take on the character is really nice from what is in the book.Devon Bostick plays Rodrick, the brother of Greg and he is just so disrespectful as that character, but he is really amazing in that part as well.

50,Doublej20005,A Decent Comedy,6,16 February 2021,"Works better as a dramedy more than a straight out comedy - some of the comedy honestly does fall flat - but it's very much saved by a good ending and some great supporting performances. Rachael Harris, Devon Bostick and Steve Zahn all nail their roles, and they bring much more comedy than Greg's school troubles. There are a lot of fun scenes, but the middle does drag a tad and a lot of the gross out humour is really not my thing. On the whole it's solid if unspectacular.

53,cyclone259,Some painful memories,5,2 June 2010,"My wife and I took our nine year-old daughter and her best friend to see this at the discount movie theater (only .75 that day... cheaper than RedBox). I know that their age group is their intended audience, but had a small amount of interest in seeing it after perusing the books. I think the material is timeless, no matter who reads it. Most of us have experienced at least one of the incidences or feelings described.As for the movie itself, the two young reviewers we took felt that the book was better. I have to agree. I don't feel the movie was nearly as clever as the source material, even with the interlacing of animation in the style of the book series. There were some of those 'ewwww!' moments, but personally, I see those as cheap humor (potty/fart/booger jokes) but, it's always guaranteed a laugh from the tween and younger set.I also won't take 'it was a kids movie' as an excuse for lack of character development and plot. It wasn't insulting, but pretty tepid overall. I did relate to Greg and had an overall sense of 'been-there-done-that' when he let his friend take a fall and then regretted it. That scene made me uneasy and took me back to elementary/middle school. My favorite part of the entire film was the 'Just Be Yourself' and the cheesy 80's portrayal of self-esteem through break dancing. Truly awful and funny. If they'd just release that scene by itself, I'd buy it.Now, this was by far not the best movie depicting the throws of youthful angst, but it was OK. The characters were once again, OK. Most were stereotypes, with little depth. There was an actual life lesson thrown in for good measure, but I don't see this one as staying above the fray for movies of this type. If you do like this one, you might check out 'Angus'. Although it pre-dates this one by a long time, it's worth watching, plus it's George C. Scott's last film.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
54,dudeguy-29536,A lot of people are missing the picture about Greg Heffley,7,25 August 2020,"Greg Heffley is NOT the villain. Yes he has done bad things but they were MISTAKES. In this movie Greg has to deal with middle school survival, and one reason he's the way he is, is because of his brother Rodrick. People say Rodrick isn't unlikable when he literally woke him up just to be funny in the beginning of the movie. This is what makes Greg want to see what's in his room. Rowley isn't a perfect kid but he's not unlikable. Greg just doesn't have as much in common with him which is what caused the whole conflict between their friendship. Greg is not a sociopath, he's just different and he knows he's going to get bullied because of it. Him going to middle school is the place he knows all the kids will be on to him for it. Fregley is a weirdo who basically makes him feel uncomfortable. Chirag is actually another good kid who warns Greg about how everyone will freak out about the cheese touch. And with him and Angie, the girl who of course wasn't in the books. Greg just had no interest in her and just wanted to follow his heart. Not that she was actually unlikable. But of course, Greg did go too far when he broke Rowley's arm and then acts proud of it right in front of him. That's when Greg looks selfish. But remember he's the protagonist, the protagonist has to learn from his sudden mistakes. So soon afterwards Greg and Rowley stop being friends, all the kids come and get them to fight which neither of them know how to and then two teenagers approach school campus and force Rowley to eat the molden cheese on the ground. Greg knew his only way to save Rowley's future was to take the blame even though he didn't eat the cheese. This made all the kids think Greg has the cheese touch (and again just about everyone at the school were also terrible just like people can be in real life) and all were afraid to trust him. But Greg didn't care since he knew Rowley was all he needed. He dropped his plan on being popular just for him which was generously well done for their friendship atleast. But they however did make it to the yearbook so it turns out Greg did get famous after all. But this is not the end, Greg's diary continues in two more movies. And he gets better. I just wish people would stop missing the picture who review the DOAWK movies, especially on Greg Heffley, the protagonist. It's really sad.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
55,garyvanhorn,A family film adults can watch and not want to claw their eyes out.,7,10 January 2011,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a charming, family-friendly film that follows the awkward trials and tribulations of a young boy just starting middle school. Greg (Zachary Gordon) wants nothing more than to be accepted and perhaps idolized by his peers. His best friend, Rowley (Robert Capron), is a hopeless social misfit, which is just one of the many silly, yet very real, obstacles young Greg must face. The movie is good specifically because it focuses on those situations faced by millions of awkward adolescents every year, finding the right lunch table to sit at, getting in the cool extra-curricular activities, and being terrorized by a cruel older sibling, and gives them a noticeable, yet believable, comedic twist.One of the best examples of this is Greg's decision to become involved in wrestling, mistakenly believing that his hours spent studying the execution of the piledriver, the body slam, and the flying elbow drop will ensure his success. Greg and the class social pariah, Fregley (Grayson Russel) are the only two kids in the ""chihuahua"" division and thus they must wrestle each other. Fregley soundly thrashes Greg numerous times, impressing the coach, and making Greg look foolish. The next week Greg contrives a way to get moved up in weight class so he can wrestle different opponents, only to be thrashed by the only girl on the team.Diary of a Wimpy Kid maintains its charm and good humor throughout the film, even in the more serious learning moments. It's easy to identify with Greg and he, as well as the rest of the case, convey a kind of sincerity in their roles that is not often seen with child actors, making the film enjoyable for both kids and adults. If you have kids, be sure to watch this movie with them, if not, find an excuse to watch it anyway, you might just enjoy yourself for an hour or two.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

It's a funny, feel good movie that made me chuckle. I liked it but I'm guessing kids everywhere love it.The acting is brilliant, considering how young they all were!

57,Reel_starz,"An amusing, if unmemorable look at middle school life",7,1 April 2010,"I'll admit that I've only read a few pages of Jeff Kinsey's popular, wildly successful books. However, my younger brother had read the entire series and the trailers did not look half as bad as the majority of modern-day kids' movies, so I was not opposed to seeing it. I had no real expectations for this and for the most part, I can say that I was quite satisfied.Unlike most movies about school nowadays, The Diary of a Wimpy Kid does not involve high schoolers, but instead it takes a look at the hazardous, chaotic first year of middle school, where kids like Greg Huxley, our protagonist, who ""haven't hit their growth spurt yet are put with gorillas who need to shave twice a day."" This makes the movie somewhat refreshing as it does not focus on crushes and cliques but on friendship and the human desire to conform. Having gone through middle school in a private school, I cannot say I identify with all that Greg and co. go through, but I did empathize with his need to find his place as an individual and his drive to be accepted by others. Wimpy Kid has a sense of sincerity that most school-related movies lack. Unlike most school movies where the so-called ""loser"" main character is actually surrounded by dozens of friends, Greg is truly a loner, spending his days with his equally uncool best friend, Rowley, and trying not to get beat up or laughed at by his fellow classmates. Greg is a character that almost everyone - children and adults - can relate to in one way or another.The cast is solid. As Greg, Zachary Gordon is the most impressive as he portrays the protagonist with a combination of selfishness, (attempted) swagger, confusion and the determined spirit of any real-life kid his age. Despite his occasionally questionable actions, Greg is immediately likable.The movie has several flaws, but few of them are glaring. At approximately two hours, it feels lengthy like a stretched out TV sitcom and some scenes could easily have been shortened or simply cut out altogether. Take, for instance, the Halloween sequence, which involves Greg and Rowley running into a trio of troublemaking teens and contains a lengthy chase/fight sequence. A related subplot concerning a supposedly haunted forest is mildly entertaining but, in the end, serves no purpose to the characters or overall story. Apparently, the film-makers took scenes from numerous books in Kinsey's series, which gives the movie a slightly disjointed flow; it might have been better if they stuck with the first book. Besides, if they do turn this into a franchise as some have speculated, they would have more material for future installments.I walked out of The Diary of a Wimpy Kid feeling not ecstatic but satisfied and entertained. There were plenty of laughs and the material rarely - if ever - felt dumbed down so much that older people can't enjoy it; in fact, there is a fair share of moments that might resonate more with nostalgic adults than with kids. Although more amusing than hilarious, The Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an admirable effort to showcase the trials and tribulations of a typical child struggling to grow up.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
58,georgia_cushion,Dear diary...,7,10 July 2011,"Before watching this, I thought that it would be a cheesy, American, middle school film made for five-year-olds. I was proved wrong. I thought that it had a humorous story-line and there were a lot of good actors. I thought that the whole school situation was portrayed very well and the characters acted like they were of that age. It was a lot funnier than I expected it to be, I even found myself laughing-out-loud in some parts, which I barely ever do in children's films. Overall I would say that Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a very good film with some very amusing parts. Also an excellent family film, it will find your inner child! I would rate it 7.5/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone!",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
59,filmbuff-05706,"Holds Up From Childhood, Despite The Gross-Out Humor.",9,22 June 2021,"Like my classmates back in middle school, I had an obsession with the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books. I've read the first 6 books about half a dozen times each, and I've read the 7th one twice I think. And I'm admittedly not much of a reader.So, as a film buff, you can imagine how an 11 year old me felt when they were adapting the first book to film. I also have the special memory of one of my aunts taking me to see it in theaters.The film is based on the diary of Greg Heffley(played by Zachary Gordon). Sorry, it's a JOURNAL, not a diary. But it says ""diary"" on the cover, which his Mom was NOT supposed to get!The journal chronicles Greg's first year in middle school, and how he has to deal with his mean older brother, weird family, bullies, popularity status, and other school issues. And one thing ""holding him back"" is his friend Rowley(Robert Capron), who wears clothes of his Mom and still holds onto childish things.One thing to greatly admire about the movie is how faithful it is to the book. Very little is added or removed from it, and many direct quotes are lifted from the book as well.The acting is done quite well too. Nothing Oscar worthy, of course, but every actor does great fulfilling their roles from the novel. Steven Zahn of Daddy Day Care and Racheal Harris of The Hangover both do well in their roles as Greg's parents. The kids do very well of course, especially Zachary Gordon, who succeeds in carrying the entire movie with him in the center.The movie is also filled with a ton of great humor, most of which works. For example, the trouble Greg and Rowley get into on Halloween is often hilarious. Another humorous moment occurs when all the kids are afraid of one kid who simply touched moldy cheese and ""spreads"" it to other students.However, my one flaw(something 11 year old me didn't mind) was the movie sometimes resorts to potty and gross out humor, which doesn't quite hold up to an adult re-visiting the movie. In one scene, Greg tries to befriend a strange kid named Fregley, and he chases him with a booger. Fregley gives him a note apologizing for that, and puts the booger on the note so Greg can chase him with it. (Again, true to the book, but still...it's gross.)Also, in a mildly decent scene(that's not in the book), something happens which causes Greg to accidentally pee on Rodrick, and when the Mom walks in, he tells her: ""Rodrick...(omit for lack of spoilers)!"" His Mom replies: ""And so you PEED ON HIM?"" I admit, that line is my favorite part of the movie, so I can forgive the scene for the sake of that single line.Despite some minor quibbles, Diary of a Wimpy Kid is still an excellent family movie that truly is a family movie. Whether you are a kid or an adult, DOAWK is something all members of the family can enjoy. It is entertaining for all from start to finish.Note to 1/10 review writers: Quite a few 1/10 star review writers complained that Greg is too much of a selfish jerk to his friend Rowley, out of character for him in the book. I challenge them to read the book again.Greg does get jealous of Rowley in the middle and he does ""terrorize"" the kids and let his friend take the blame. As I said, the movie is very faithful to the book. And it's important to note that Greg CHANGES by the end of the movie.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

63,MrGoodMovie,Great Kid Flick,8,30 April 2011,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a great movie for sub and early teen kids.It contains strong moral messages that some kids that age will need to take on board in order to transition to adulthood - e.g. ""be yourself"", ""don't attempt to impress through falsehood and deception"" and ""think of others before yourself"".It takes a while to get to Greg's ""moment of truth"" wherein, perversely, it is actually a white lie that shows the true meaning of friendship, and defines his ""coming of age"". But the moment is worth waiting for, even a bit of a tear jerker if you've engaged with the film and its varied characters.There are a few amusing moments for us adults but not enough to rate this as an adult movie - my rating of 8 is based purely on this being firmly in the ""Kid Flick"" genre.Enjoy it for what it is and it will revive some halcyon memories of your own schooldays. Unless of course, unlike Greg, your ""moment of truth"" has never arrived",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

It's very tricky to pull off something like this and not end up with an unfunny mess. This film proves that kid comedies can still be fresh and originally done.It is based off the popular books by Jeff Kinney, and having read a few, I can say that this film is faithful enough to the source material, quoting entire lines of dialogue from the cartoonish novels.It's about a middle-schooler, Greg Heffley, and his adventures and misadventures throughout the year. The character is not entirely likable, in fact is very self-centred, which is a refreshing change from some films like this for it provides a large space in which the character can develop and progress.The acting is good; Greg is very well played by Zachary Gordon, and there are strong supporting roles by Robert Capron as Greg's best friend, and Devon Bostick as Greg's older and menacing brother.

His friend Rowley is a childish yet good hearted person. Greg takes this to full effect and make Rowley (forgive the language) his bitch. Greg says jump over fire Rowley does so. Greg wants ketchup and maple syrup sundaes Rowley makes it.We have very little interest in Greg at first but we begin to like him until he begins treating everyone like he is god. Of course nothing happens to him but still. Throughout the movie we see no one likable except Rowley.

67,relious,Terrible!!,1,10 December 2012,"First and foremost, the only reason I watched this horrible movie is because it has Chloe Moretz (My favorite actress in the entire world) in it. If she wasn't in it, I would have avoided this movie completely. Basically this movie is about a whiny kid named Greg that is starting middle school, but acts like he is 4 years old. He has one best friend named Rowley, who acts like he is even younger than Greg. The whole movie is based on Greg trying to get popular at what looks like the worst school on the planet, Rowley however, doesn't worry so much about it which makes them kind of opposites. I am so offended at how school is portrayed in movies and TV shows as being such a hellhole. There were bullies at every turn, teachers that pick on students, Greg and Rowley getting into trouble for no reason at all, Middle school was nothing like that when I went. I tried to be open minded about this movie, but it really let me down. I kept waiting for it to get better. Never did! The only good parts of the movie were the ones that had Chloe Moretz in them, as for the rest of the movie, I will spend the rest of my life trying to forget it.

The actors as can be seen are kind of new to the industry, their not an all-star cast which is understandable, one actress who i was particularly happy to see in this movie was Chloe Mortiz who acts as a sort of guidance for the protagonist in helping him survive middle school. Although he doesn't really take her help and ends up regretting his actions latter on. my favorite part of the movie was the Halloween part because it's my favorite holiday and the way it is portrayed here really brought back memories from when i used to go trick or treating. the only negative things i have about this movie is that i felt like the movie tries to hard to be funny in some parts. the books charm was about how he survives middle school, the movie is him surviving life period. Some parts i felt could have been left off like the part when he stays over at that nerdy guys place, or when his brother gets in trouble for the magazine. Overall, its an enjoyable movie for all ages, although kids in the elementary level probably wouldn't be recommended to see it since it does contain some crude humor, minor but its there.

So, no, I don't see best actor awards being given for this film, but I went into realizing that at the beginning, and was not disappointed.

A horror flick is supposed to make you feel icky and bad, so I stick them out but this film was an exercise in existentially molesting my inner child. The main character ha d no redeeming values and if it were a horror movie, I could have taken solace in imagining how he was going to die. It felt like it was meant to be made into a tediously bad pixar film but the decided to use actors and make it all look pixarish with the same kind of 2d overacting.To be fair I did not like A Christmas story either, just can't handle the saccharine glorification of a fairytale childhood, still I do get why people liked that. This, film is utterly unredeeming and dull and pointless to boot.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
82,sjd615,A entertaining ride through one year of middle school.,7,27 March 2010,"I went into this movie with an open mind going with my girlfriend and her 8 year old brother who really wanted to see this. I knew it would be a portrayal of how movie makers makes middle school seems but since it is a movie it was pretty funny. The leading stars were very likable as I was smiling basically the entire time. It was a rather short movie but enjoyable that goes through one full school year showing how tough it is for this one individual and how hard he tries to become popular. The main character Greg Kind of comes off as a rude and full of himself pre teen student as he tries to change his bestfriend who is a little chubby and a funny red hair goofball. He becomes more popular after a certain incident which causes an argument between the two childhood bestfriends. Overall, It was enjoyable for the whole family including adults, teenagers and of course the children. There was no cursing or sexual content which was pleasant in this movie. The parents are likable as well as they are actually suportive unlike other movies but the older brother is of course an annoying, punk rock wannabe who picks on the younger brother which gets old quickly. In the end, I was happy i went to go see it but not to sure if I recommend it but definitely if you or your children has read the books. Its not bad but not the best book to movie series or children's movie either.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

My impression was, I think it was good one, but not really interest to buy. Suddenly i found this book at my home, and I couldn't help my self from laugh! The movie, as good as the book!This is about the friendship between Greg (Zachary Gordon) and Rowley (Robert Capron). Greg always thought that he was the coolest kids in the world, potentially became a popular students and considered Greg was not suitable for junior high school. He's too childish! Greg has a 'cruel' big bro, Roddrick (Devon Bostick) and younger one, Manny who called Greg in stupid name. In the opening scene we directly showed how 'cruel' Roddrick with Greg. He awakes Greg and told him it was already late for school as the alarm clock was rang. In shock, Greg in hurry worn his clothes, breakfast, and made some noise. His dad, Frank, (Stephen Zahn) awake and wondered what Greg did. He said he's in hurry not wanted to late in his first day of school. Are you kidding?? This is just two o'clock! Greg blank, and realized his brother prank on him! Told his dad, with disbelief, they checked Rodrick sleep calmly and his bed. When the door closed, he's smile, satisfy. There was legendary cheese in Greg's School. That cheese firmly attached to basketball field. No one know where the cheese come from, since when it attached there. What they know, that cheese already there long, long, long time ago. So disgusting, sticky, slimy. Any students who accidentally touch that, would be infected the syndrome that they called : cheese touch. No one ever talked, touched, or interacted with that kid till she/he touch the other kids. once someone else touch by him/her, the cheese touch syndrome move to that kids! The last kid who touch that cheese, was moved, so no one got infected, for a while. Greg avoided sit with the dummy to make him as popular student. Trapped with the dummy a whole year was not good idea. But yeah, the fact is always bitter than dreams, Greg trapped with the dummy, the weirdo one. The fortunate Goddess was with Rowley. Got accident when played with Greg, his arm should be in gips. That was attracted people around, said how brave is Rowley, they wanted signed Rowley gips, girls wanted to hang out with him. Greg felt alienated, he was jealous with Rowley. Then, Rowley and Greg had a fight, Greg scared the kids when they become 'a guardian school', but people blamed Rowley. Even he's not guilty he admitted it, then after wards Greg said, hey actually it was me! ha ha. Shocked, Rowley said, actually Greg never be his friend. Felt so lonely losing his friends, Greg tried to make a friend with the weirdest kids in school, Fregley (Grayson Russel), which later, he was sorry about. Will Greg and Rowley become a friend again?

86,dmorrisbadger101,Best Movie Ever!,10,16 September 2012,"I was so desperate to see what 20th Century Fox did to this New York Times Bestseller. Here's the plot and reception of this major motion picture: One Day, in a major town in Vancouver, Greg Heffley was sleeping in to enjoy the Summer sleeping in while he could before he started Middle School. Meanwhile, Rodrick wakes Greg up at 4 A.M. and claims that it's morning and he needs to get ready to go to the school bus stop. Rodrick closed Greg's blinds and changed his alarm clock so Greg would think it was 7 A.M.! By the time Greg made some Cheerios and went downstairs, Dad said that school doesn't start 'till next week and school does not start at 4 AM! First Day of School....... Greg's alarm clock goes off and he checks to see if it's morning. And sure enough, it is. So he eats breakfast next to his annoying little brother, Manny, who sits on a plastic potty at the kitchen table watching little kids' TV shows like Barney and Sesame Street. On his first day, Greg opens the doors to his new school, and it was a complete madhouse. Kids were throwing toilet paper down the staircases, hogging up the soda machine, and putting their belongings in their lockers. Greg walks to his classroom noticing that his archenemy Patty Farrell is sitting in the back of the classroom. Unlike most middle schools, Greg has recess and still has lots of outdoor gym classes. One time, Greg walks off the Athletic Field grounds and over to the blacktop area around the playground equipment. He noticed this piece of moldy cheese laying on the blacktop. That's when Chirag Gupta comes over and tells the story of the Cheese Touch. It is a very contagious thing, like the Cooties. So Greg then attempts to use the bathroom in the upstairs hallway. The stalls have NO doors! They even had to eat on the cafeteria floor! Later On In The Year.......Greg signs up for the Wizard Of Oz play in the auditorium. Greg sings True Eclipse Of The Heart and the teacher says his voice is too high so he has to be a TREE instead. During the live action play, Greg overheard Manny shout ""Bubby"" to Greg. Luckily, Greg reflected the embarrassment over Archie Kelly. Then, he notices that Rodrick is holding a video camera so Greg throws apples at Patty until the play was shut down. End of the movie....Greg notices the Whirley Street KIds (who invaded Gramma's house) drove onto school property and made Rowley EAT THE CHEESE. That's all I can say about this film, folks.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

What I also remember is how much I loathed it. I though that many of the moments that were meant to show main character Greg's growth into a teenager and a ""rebellious one"" only succeeded at making me cringe. His constant bad mouthing of his best friend Rowley is just upsetting and in no way teaching him to grow up.

90,chips-19,Review from a 13 year old,1,12 January 2011,"SPOILER: Background:I am a 13 year old, which means Im in the target audience in this film. I also have seen some of the worst films ever, like ""Star Worms 2"", ""Monster A GoGo"", and ""Night of the Lepus"". When I heard hey were making a DOAWK movie, I thought it would be fun! Boy, was I wrong! This is one of the un-funniest films ever! Not sure if this is worse than Vampires Suck, but it makes Disaster Movie look like Airplane. While this film follows the books, it feels entirely different. While the books gave a funny story that 13 and 14 year old's can relate to, this film only serves to exploit middle school like 70's blaxploitation movies did to blacks.Why does every character look like a 7 year old? Ansewer: So they could get younger kids into the theater while still using the title to pander to young teens. I was offended by the way they portray middle school! ""The Cheese Touch""? Kids at my school play similar games, note that those kids are in 2nd Grade! And even they don't break friendships over that stupid game! The whole film is about the main character who""Will do anything to be famous!"" I assume that that is the only reason he took this role. This kid is so clearly without talent that I cringe at all the lines he has here! If real kids acted like that, the suicide rate int his country alone would go up by at least 60%! And there is no suspense, or drama throughout the whole movie. I don't want to give away spoilers, but lets just say nothing is resolved, clearly hoping for a sequel or 7! In conclusion, do not fall for this films tricky marketing. You will only be disappointed! One star.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

98,frankveer-1,This movie does not deserve a 6.1,1,29 July 2010,"First of all: I never write a review. Second of all: I never quit a movie 30 minutes in. Third of all: I've seen way over a 1000 movies and I enjoy almost all of them for what they are.So here goes; the review about a movie I quit watching 30 minutes in, which I hated everything about. I wrote this review (and voted 1) because I think it doesn't deserve the 6.1 it's at right now.The main character is a terribly annoying kid, who over-acts, has an annoying voice and does not get your sympathy at all. He's supposed to be smart and funny, but he's really not. Also the premise of the film is really American and superficial, not interesting at all. All the other characters in the movie are wrongfully cast for their parts (except for the little chubby kid, he did an okay job). Even the father (Steve Zahn), who I usually like in movies, is not suited for the part of the father, which I was really annoyed about to see. The brother was supposed to be a bad-ass rocker, but he couldn't pull of the attitude or the outfit. The events that happened weren't funny, and usually stuff you've seen 10 times better in other movies.I can't believe all these semi-positive reviews (seems like they were created by the people who made this movie), so I'm trying to warn you: if you have a choice in it, don't be stupid and choose this movie, it's a terrible waste of time.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid

Although relating to the book through most aspects it also goes of plot a little and for those who haven't read the book it can come across rather childish.The plot is also quite weak at times and yet the humour and clever acting makes up for it. Also after the film you can be left a little disappointed as nothing 'Major' happens its just small things all the way.Im looking forward to the sequel however and recommend you buy it if seen under £10 and your ready for a good light hearted laugh.

(What movie does?) There are some new scenes, new characters, and some minor characters like Chirag have bigger roles. I think all the new things kept the spirit and integrity of the book. One new scene I liked is one that assists in driving the wedge in Greg and Rowley's friendship.(Let's just say it involves dancing.) The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It was OK and brought closure, but it wasn't as good as the book ending. The acting was better than I thought it would be. Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron (Greg and Rowley) carried this film well.

Every time I hated it more and more. There is only one likable character, who isn't featured much and does not 'win the day'. The main character is the most detestable: arrogant, shallow, self-centred - everything you don't want your children to look up to. The stories focus around this horrid child and his plans to be 'cool' and 'famous' - all things shallow and worthless. I kept waiting for the life lesson, but it never happened. On top of that, some of the humour is quite nasty. Children might like it, but personally, I didn't like it being encouraged to impressionable young viewers (I promise I'm no old fuddy duddy, I'm 22!). There was nothing genuinely funny or interesting, and even if there had been, I wouldn't have been able to root for the characters because they were so unlikeable. It doesn't represent real school at all, but if children think it does, it will either terrify them about going, or turn them into shallow egocentric brats like this boy.

The ""comedy"" sucked. Tired jokes, that fat kid doing some bad interpretation of the truffle shuffle and gags that have lame punchlines. The soundtrack did its job but wasn't the greatest. The whole film is just another lame kids film and is really for kids or people with IQ's less than 90/parents who think these kinds of films are funny.How this got to the number 2 spot i will never know because it was a disgrace of a movie and is on a par with alvin and the chipmunks for the kids films who do good and other much better films do badly.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
121,artiei,💯,8,30 August 2021,"A cinematic masterpiece. Although the main character is flawed, very flawed, it subverts expectations of a kids comedy/family movie. I prefer Rodrick Rules but I'm not complaining about this version.Zoo Wee Mama.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
122,mdonat1,Amusing,8,19 March 2010,"If you want to be entertained, then this movie is for you. Granted a lot of the humor is sophomoric, but after all it is about middle school. It really does depict how it can be. Especially the importance of being popular. The last thing you want is to be the least popular kid in the school. It also depicts how simple things are magnified and made out to be a really big deal,like getting the ""cheese touch"". The best part of the movie are the characters. You can easily identify and relate to them without being over done and going over the top. Some of the parts of the movie, I could have done without because it didn't add much. For example the teenage bullies who chased around Greg and Rowley after squirting them during trick or treat. Other than that, I was pleasantly pleased and would recommend going.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
123,travelingaroundtown,An Entertaining and Fun Movie for Anyone of Any Age!,10,26 March 2010,"We went to see the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Movie this past week with a number of adults and kids and I have to say that everyone absolutely loved this movie. There is something for everyone to relate to in this movie, young or old. It stays true to the book which was a concern all of us had before seeing the movie. However, you don't have to read the book to enjoy this movie. In addition, the adaptation from the book to ""silver screen"" was one of the better ones I have seen and the transformation captured the essence of the story intact. There were a few additional scenes added to the movie that weren't in the book, but they kept in step with the story and didn't detract at all from the enjoyment of the film.The cast was all well picked. The main character of the movie, Greg Heffley (played wonderfully by Zachary Gordon) stayed true to the book and he was totally believable. Everyone felt that this kid actor, Zach Gordon, did a great job of bringing life to this complex character and transforming Greg Heffley from a cartoon stick figure in the books to a real live person, while maintaining all his idiosyncrasies. It was also fun to watch him as, at times, he has these great facial expressions. The beauty of the movie was the added sensitivity and emotionality that presented itself in the film that wasn't available to us in the novel.In the movie, Greg led us on an emotional roller-coaster ride throughout the film: first we liked him, then we hated him, then we felt sorry for him, then we loved him. His relationship with his best friend Rowley along with its ups and downs (hey, just like real life) was great for kids to see. For adults, it would remind us of the ""real"" friendships we had (from simpler times) in those early Jr. High School years. Before computers we had real ""live"" friendships and we really did go over to our friends' houses to ""play"".I did not find the movie ""trite"" ""predictable"", or ""slow"". The comedy was evenly paced and kept the attention of the audience throughout, including my kids. This is a very entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids. If you want a fun, witty, wholesome, and relatable story that will both touch and entertain you at the same time, go see this movie, it won't disappoint.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
124,matthewmdm,Not like the book,10,19 March 2010,"This movie was not like the book, however, it was still great. It introduced new characters such as Angie that weren't in the book, but they made a great addition in this movie. Although I am not going to say too much, the ending was just like the book. Many new events were added and some were left out. Most of the events, however, were out of order, but it still had a similar story line. I would definitely recommend this movie to others because of its great way of incorporating new things, along with keeping the old. Occasionally, bits and pieces of the book would return, but I thought that it was perfect touch for the movie.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
125,funny893,A real middle schoolers view,5,29 March 2010,"One thing you should know is that I haven't read the book. The quality of the movie was a 2010 great. There were animations that were of good quality and the video and lighting was also good. The story how ever wasn't as good. Middle School can be understandable hard on certain people. But for most it's not horrible at most times. I'm a nerd or whatever but I'm not the one who answers every question that the teacher asks and I don't cry if I get less then a A+ on a test, and my friends just me being a nerd because sometimes they understand me more than the teachers. The movie's middle school is not at all like a real one. The kids are little more mature and middle school isn't so free (like there would never be a girl who never goes to class only sits under the bleachers)There is sometimes that weird person who all of sudden is popular, but it never lasts more than a week before he's forgotten again. Also the ending was horrible. If they ended when Gregry did his speech after he ""ate"" the cheese and the students realized how immature they are then the ending would be good. But in the end you are left thinking that it was never really resolved(family wasn't united, students didn't mature, etc.) This movie wasn't what it could have been.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
126,bcoregon,Don't waste your time or money,1,31 March 2010,"I agree 100% with Sean - this was a lame movie. There is nothing likable about anyone in this. Greg (the character and the boy who played him) completely lacked any charm - one-dimensional self-absorbed jerk of a character. By about halfway through the movie, I found myself liking the ""villans"" much more than Greg. The ""tender moments"" with his parents fell flat and did nothing to endear him to the audience. I wasn't expecting great cinema here; it's based on a kids' book. Didn't care for the potty humor; it was tired and immature. Even in a movie for kids, the material should try to be better. What I expected was a cute, goofy but heartwarming movie that left you smiling at the end. This is not that movie. I couldn't wait till it was over. If it weren't for my kids, who enjoyed it (but not as much as the books), I would have walked out after the first 30 minutes.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
127,murka7777,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,7 August 2010,"A failed attempt at riding on the popularity of the book series it is based on. It is like a rejected pilot for a Nickelodeon sitcom. Downright distasteful. The wimpy kid is a total jerk. I could not sympathize with this character at all, I hated him all the way through. Sadly, the movie often comes across more like a low-budget series of gross-out sketches. Too soon, maybe 30 minutes in, audience laughs turn to chuckles, fading to worn smiles. The film encourages urine, fart, and booger humor, which reeks of nose-picker pandering, compounded by a message of personal worth that never comes through clearly enough. The thing in this film that feels most alive is a slice of cheese rotting on a playground blacktop -- which would be a funny joke if it was intentional.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
128,martinslcp,Diary of a boring movie,1,8 August 2010,"I just bought the DVD of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I thought it might be a little above my 10 yr. old and 6 yr. old's interest but thought it might have some funny stuff in it. I was SO disappointed! The movie was so below the quality I thought it would have. As one post stated ""the main character is actually mean-spirited"". So watching this through the WHOLE movie was a big let down. I kept wondering when the funny, happy, stuff would happen. The only thing I got out of the movie were the scenes when some kids were mean and obnoxious...a teaching point I took advantage of. My kids would have preferred doing anything else, than to watch this movie. I, would have preferred cleaned the bathroom, than to have wasted my time and money on this. I am going to sell the DVD!",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
129,AdamMWTV,Meh,4,7 April 2011,There were only a few problems with this movie but they were major problems. The lead character is a complete (excuse the language) dickhead and deserves every bad thing that happens during the movie. Although the actor acted quite well by the end of the movie I hated Greg. He is very different than he is in the book (which is much better).Patty Farrell may be the most hated character ever. Of course you can have characters that you dislike and this adds to the movie but every scene she's in you're cringing.The best part of the movie was the acting. It was acted extremely well especially Chloe Mortez. She was excellent. All of the actors/actress' were fantastic but it wasn't enough to make the movie a good movie.,Diary of a Wimpy Kid
130,evan-347-64041,Outrageously awful.,2,18 April 2012,"A very poor, inaccurate depiction of middle school, this pathetic take on a children's book series deserves two thumbs down. I would have given it 1 star if there wasn't that slight comedy to it. WIth disturbingly bad actors, disturbing corniness, and a story that is one of the biggest lies of the century, this is the downright stupidest movie I have ever seen. Zachary Gordon, a young kid actor, plays the main character, Greg Heffley. The ghetto- style middle school in the middle of a typical suburban town makes it all the more inaccurate. Every single kid in the movie acts like a nerd, even if they are not supposed to be one. Greg is pathetically misguided and says everything in the most idiotic, sarcastic, trying-to-sound-serious tone possible. As well, the brain-wrenching soundtrack makes it all the worse. Please, for the love of God, don't watch this awful excuse for a movie.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
131,DocHoliday808,"Enjoyable, funny but ................",3,30 June 2012,"To start off with, I have to admit that I never read the book that this movie was based on so this review is solely based on my opinions of the movie. I like movies where the story line is about the trial and tribulations of kids learning about themselves and the world while growing up. This movie presents many funny scenes with the main character dealing with different situations with friends and activities at school that generate adolescent jealousy, selfishness, self worth questions and rationalizations by the main character Greg. But something kept nagging me through the whole movie and when it ended I realized I really didn't care much for the main character and his flawed behavior which seemed never to look beyond his petty needs. So although funny I gave it 3 stars because I felt it wasn't worth seeing any sequel if it was more of the same.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
132,spiessens-divers,a fun and entertaining movie,8,25 September 2012,"diary of a wimpy kid is a movie about a boy who just begin middle school. this movie is quiet funny because some of the scenes show me like embrassing things such as : greg (the name of the boy) fights with his brother (rodrick) i love the way they just make up their siblings relationship because their parents fed up to see them have a conflict in everything they do. but the way his parents make them up is work. some problems happened but at the end, greg and rodrick relation is getting better. this movie quiet recommended to be watched by all ages. family, teenages, etc could enjoy this funny movie.I enjoyed this film very much., it is a good movie for everyone, no matter how old are you, I swear you'll enjy this movie, This movie contains no strong language and sexual situation, So, Kids are allowed to watch this. The next important things are.. This movie is absolutely funny !, And all of the jokes are catchy and simple, In another, This movie also touch your heart, But it won't make you cry! It will just add some ""taste"" on it. This movie is a good movie to spend time with your family or friends if you have nothing to do during your spare time or your holiday.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
133,keir-strickland,Average movie with a thoroughly unlikeable main character,1,8 July 2018,"I'd heard good things about the DOAWK movies, so my daughter and I sat down one evening to watch the first one. The movie in general would be ok (not great, not awaful) if it wasn't for the main character - Greg. The central plot is Greg's single minded quest for middle school popularity, something that shows him to be an immensely mean, selfish, egocentric and unlikeable person. At no point does he redeem himself, at no point does he appear to learn from his awful behaviour - and this leaves a gaping hole in the centre of the film. You don't want Greg to succeed, you want his friends to see the light and ditch him",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
134,estacyemail,Review by my middle school ESL Class,8,23 May 2014,"This was a funny movie. The kid had the thing on his tummy. That was gross. It had a good message. It had a message about friendship - don't lie and treat other people the way you want to be treated. I recommend this movie. It is good for junior high students. My favorite characters were Greg and Rowley, Chirag Gupta and his Greg's brother. My least favorite character was Patty Farrell. The PE teacher just let kids do anything in the class and that's not good. I think it is more important to be yourself than worry about being popular. The name of Roderick's band is funny. He is not a good singer. The little brother is funny. The big brother and the little brother bother each other a lot. That is realistic for many people.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
135,Anonomys246,I actually enjoyed this movie.,7,5 October 2010,"This movie was enjoyable from beginning to end. You really have to have an open mind to enjoy it. I don't consider this movie strictly as a kids movie, but more of something that almost any one can enjoy. I myself hated middle school when I was a kid. It kind of brought me back when I was in middle school. I actually went to a worse place then the one in the movie, but this movie does a good of job of generalising how middle school really is like and how stupid and crew kids can be. This is one of those few movies thats about kids that I actually like since many family and kids movies are not considered enjoyable to adults.For those who haven't seen it yet and like comedies and do not mind not having sexual raunchy jokes found in adult themed comedies, then give this movie a go.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
136,gianfrancotb,"Is ""false realism"" a movie genre? Because there is some faux realism in this work.",4,28 September 2017,"Greg is a disgusting egomaniac little protagonist for this coming of age film and, while his innocence may be bothersome in the first few scenes, Rowley, his best friend, is everything the likable person and admirably moral guy that Greg is not. And there's people like that in the real world, the black and the white (by western metaphorical standards).Yet there are the infrasurreal elements; Rowley being naive enough to stay as Greg's friend for so long, them being best friends in the first place, karma kicking Greg in the butt and giving Rowley what he deserved (in the real world people like Rowley are shoved into anonymous submission and those like Greg, well, they become politicians or enter the showbiz, unless they manage to gain ownership over a successful company and become businessmen and entrepreneurs).The initial, no matter how in a hurry you are, you just do not act as careless as him, and it even looks like it mimics the starting scene of an old show with Greg taking the place of the hardworking father who is in a hurry to go to work.Manny. Was some CG used with him as it was with the cockroach? Many times his face seemed false, I could say the same of Greg's father, but it could be just that the actor is ugly.And the cheese touch. From the start it was an obvious Chekhov gun but the intrigue was about how it was going to be used... SPOILER ALERT: Rowley's upcoming illness should be a dead giveaway of Greg's sacrifice, and a sure way to get the bullies in jail. END OF SPOILER. In the real world sanitation would have dealt with rotting cheese that magically survives generations without its decomposition spreading thin the remains until there is nothing to be seen. Something as simple as handling it with a napkin could suffice. And as a 13 year old reviewer said... The reaction to someone touching such a piece of cheese wouldn't extend to kids and teen of such diverse ages. Nor it would last long. I remember killing a spider with my fingers and freaking out the three or four eyewitnesses, it didn't last more than that day I think, or week, month tops. I would exaggerate if I said they were 11 years old, I am not sure how the US system of lower school, middle school and high school works, how middle school translates to the system of lower school and upper school used in my country, in my school, but he looks older than that. Their immaturity could not be denied.Bottomline, the work pushes reality like few other works, using it maturely, but also pushes childish fiction even more so than other works; at times the script seems taken from the muppets, with Greg as egolatry incarnated, Miss Piggy, male human version... But also at times the script seems like memoirs turned into a fable. The protagonists are black and white, but the story is grayscale and has some technicolour to boot. It is no silent movie, morally wise. And yes, morality matters, not only in general but in this movie, otherwise it would be a pointless movie as it is a coming of age story drawn towards a moral lesson, the goal is right there at the climax towards the end.So why did I watch it if I grade it that low? Why would I recommend it? Do I even recommend it? I came to the movie as part of research, but I stayed for the punishment, watching Greg get his comeuppance brought invigorating schadenfreude to me and instilled enough interest to keep watching despite having seen enough to know I wasn't watching what I expected to. I was expecting Greg to give up for once and for all and, somehow, despite the anti-climatic ending that would be, to have it all wrap up in a way that satisfied the seemingly wasted time I spent watching the movie. I was waiting for Greg to touch the cheese.Sidenote: Rodrick, Greg's older brother, was certainly a source of fun, all his abuse on Greg came out with delicious gusto as I hated that petty fool throughout the whole movie. It was disappointing to see him get some retribution although that was what was pleasant with his brother, the retribution he got. But, like Greg, he shows how much a failure his parents are as such, not to forget the useless moral advice; ""trust your gut"".I am overanalizying this and it is just a family movie to watch when you have time to waste, with an outcome that was the movie's hidden ace, in the hole or up its sleeves, only foreseeable as it drew near. Greg doing the right thing for the first time in the movie and earning a little something for that, and becoming wiser, was an unexpected source of pleasure, and it justified him being such a jerk before that, character development and heel-face turn is not possible if all you have is a face from the start. Taking place much earlier seeing Rowley becoming wiser was also pleasant; when Rowley ditched Greg, Quixote earned some sense of reality, Sancho Panza earned some self respect. Conversely Greg's sacrifice was Sancho Panza becoming a little more dreamy and Quixote realizing, more realistically than before, the value of Sancho Panza. A whole commentary on sidekicks contained as the kernel of truth in a stupid movie.Would I recommend it? Not any more, if you have read all this review, with or without spoiler, you already have enough to not need the movie at all. But please, be my guest, watch it, prove me wrong if you really have time to spare or want to have some shallow family time with your kids. After all, this review is only what I see, you may see more, you may see less.",Diary of a Wimpy Kid
