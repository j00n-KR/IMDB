0,Leofwine_draca,"Goofy, fun light popcorn flick",6,3 March 2016,"WHITE HOUSE DOWN is a film with myriad problems. It's directed by Roland Emmerich for once, a guy known for his less than stellar effects films like 2012 and GODZILLA, although once in a while he makes something like INDEPENDENCE DAY to make up for the bad stuff. It has some terrible CGI effects of helicopters in particular. It's a 12 certificate movie, which means that although violent it's not realistically violent. It's overlong. Channing Tatum, despite being a hot property in Hollywood, is wooden beyond belief. And, as with many Hollywood blockbusters, the writers have to shoehorn one of those annoying teenage characters into the storyline.Despite all these flaws, I have to say I enjoyed WHITE HOUSE DOWN. It's no masterpiece, and it's not as good as the more serious OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN which came out at the same time. But it keeps your attention on it throughout, and it never fails to entertain. The various DIE HARD homages come thick and fast, and Jamie Foxx has never been so much fun as the Obama-style President who gets in on the action. The bad guys are suitably bad, James Woods acts up the screen, and there's a ton of explosive action to enjoy. You may want more, but this didn't disappoint as a light popcorn flick.",White House Down
1,SnoopyStyle,totally stupid but good chemistry saves it,6,7 August 2013,"Divorced Capitol Police officer John Cale (Channing Tatum) brings his daughter Emily (Joey King) to the White House. His interview for the Secret Service with Special Agent Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) does not go well. An attack occurs and President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) is in danger.The premise is stupid, really stupid, so stupid. This is a movie where the writer thought it would cool to have all logic bend to push an action thriller. I can't explain enough how stupid much of the action is in the movie. The good thing is Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx. They have good fun comedic chemistry. They're likable enough. The movie would actually be served better with even more interaction. There is plenty of action certainly but it gets repetitive. Things get blown up but not anything we haven't seen before.",White House Down
2,Prismark10,Attack of the dunces,5,3 February 2014,"Just as soon as Gerard Butler has reclaimed the White House in Olympus has Fallen. Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx arrive for White House Down.Whereas 'Olympus' had the North Koreans as the bad guys. Here we have a ragtag bunch of neo right wingers and the military industrial complex types as villains who want to take down the President for wanting to have peace talks with Iran.Tatum is the secret service wannabe who ends up fighting the bad guys and then teams up with the President played by Jamie Foxx for some buddy buddy action and some laughs. Even though all around them there is carnage going on.Both 'Olympus' and 'White House Down' are in effect Die Hard in the White House.Whereas Olympus had Butler as the lone man fighting the bad guys and was more effective, here the buddy action does not quite work.Both films are entertaining but ludicrous but Tatum does not quite sell it for me here.",White House Down
3,claudio_carvalho,Déjà vu?,6,17 November 2013,"The North-American President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) proposes a global peace plan frustrating the arms industry. Meanwhile the Capitol security agent John Cale (Channing Tatum) had made an application for the secret service to protect the president and travels for an interview with Agent Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) in Washington with his eleven year-old daughter Emily (Joey King). Cale is not accepted and he goes with Emily on a tour in the White House. Out of the blue, the White House is invaded and overtaken by a terrorist group led by Stenz (Jason Clarke) and Cale fights against the paramilitary group to save his daughter and the president while discloses high treason and coup d'état sponsored by the arms industry. ""White House Down"" is a kind of déjà vu of ""Olympus Has Fallen"" that is a rip-off ""Die Hard"". The lack of originality is impressive associated to a dull, predictable, boasting of patriotism and unbelievable story and an annoying teenager. However the result is funny and entertains with the absurd. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Ataque"" (""The Attack"")",White House Down
4,nogodnomasters,I CHOOSE THE PEN,8,26 June 2019,"The White House in under attack and only Tatum Channing, a wannabe secret service agent can save the world, the POTUS (Jamie Foxx) and protect his 11 year old daughter (Joey King). The movie follows a ""Die Hard"" formula.There is nothing overly special about this film. It uses the current world situation and creates stock political characters. The scenario ranges from improbable to impossible. Break out the popcorn and enjoy the feature as Channing bonds with his movie daughter and beats up the bad guys against all odds.Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",White House Down
5,kosmasp,"More ""story""",5,25 May 2014,"Not as much fun as Olympus has fallen (and due to the rating constraint not as violent either), but with more ""story"". Not that it matters much, because the thin story layer this might have over the Gerald Butler starring movie, is not worth much. But it is more family friendly and has less one liners than the other White House movie.It depends on your taste, because you might not like a Die Hard movie with anyone else than Bruce Willis (which would be the case with Olympus). The Emmerich movie at hand does have all the ingredients you expect him to have (including some comic sidekick, here the tour guide and other things). You also have a president who is able to kick some ... well you know what. And they wouldn't allow it to be said anyway ... Decent, but not as effective ... unless you are a big fan of Mr. Tatum (a cool guy in any case).",White House Down
6,jboothmillard,White House Down,5,30 September 2013,"It was only five months ago that I was in the cinema watching Olympus Has Fallen, and seeing the trailer this looked very similar, so it was definitely going to be a rival situation, like Dante's Peak vs. Volcano and Armageddon vs. Deep Impact, from director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow). Basically John Cale (Channing Tatum) has worked as a U.S. Capitol policeman and a serviceman, but his dream job is to be a Secret Service Agent, he also hopes to connect more with his estranged daughter Emily (Joey King), who is passionate about politics and presidential history. He was interviewed by former colleague Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) about the job, but is denied, not wanting his daughter to be let down he gets a pair of tour tickets to the White House, Emily is excited, and even briefly meets President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) himself. Terrorists bomb the U.S. Capitol building, but this is a distraction allowing them to invade the White House, kill most of the Secret Service and hold the tour group hostage. The mercenaries are led by Emil Stenz (Jason Clarke), but the true leader reveals himself, retiring Head of the Presidential Detail Martin Walker (James Woods) who wants revenge for the death of his son due to a botched mission the President orchestrated. Skip Tyler (Jimmi Simpson) is hacking the security systems of the White House to use missile technology, and meanwhile Cale has been separated from Emily so grabs a gun and radio, and Emily meanwhile sneaks around and uses her internet phone to record footage of the terrorists, before being caught by Killick (Kevin Rankin). Cale gets to and rescues Sawyer, they manage to find a way to contact Finnerty and the authorities outside, and with the footage of the terrorists posted on YouTube the identities of all the mercenaries are confirmed, most have military and political group connections. After being contacted by leader Walker, who is demanding millions of dollars in ransom, the retiring politician is confirmed to have an inoperable tumour, so he is on a suicide mission, and meanwhile Cale and Sawyer are doing everything they can to hide from attack and escape to alert the politicians and forces. After a chase on the White House lawn Cale and Sawyer crash in the presidential limousine, with the President presumed dead Vice President Hammond (Michael Murphy) is sworn in as the new President, but the duo inform the authorities they are still alive, and they are told of the counter attack coming, but Cale knows the terrorists have weapons to shoot the helicopters down. Emily is found out to be the one who sent out the video with incriminating footage, so she is taken to Walker in the Oval Office so that they can get to Cale, meanwhile Tyler has hacked the missile systems. Missiles are fired on Air Force One, so Hammond is killed, and Eli Raphelson, Speaker of the House (The Cabin in the Woods' Richard Jenkins) is sworn in as the new President, he makes the dramatic decision that the only way to stop the terrorists is to blow up the White House. Walker that he will kill Emily if Cale does not hand over Sawyer, but to save her the President surrenders himself, the villain explains that the mission to bring the White House down was to show American power, Sawyer refuses to use his required identification to activate the nuclear weapons. Tyler kills himself after his bomb in the escape tunnel has been tampered with, Killick is defeated during a brutal fight when White House tour guide Donnie (Nicolas Wright) smashes his head in with a clock, and the hostages are allowed to run out and escape, and Stenz is killed when a grenade explodes beneath him. Sawyer gets into a fight with Walker, but he is made to activate the weapons and shot dead, an anonymous source sends Walker the codes to activate the missiles to target various Iran cities, but before the countdown to launch and press the button is complete Cale comes in and kills Walker with a mini gun. Emily hears about the air strike on the White House, and to stop the approaching fighters she bravely runs onto the front lawn waving the presidential flag, they call off the attack, Sawyer is still alive as the bullet hit his pocket watch from his wife Alison (Garcelle Beauvais), and after a trick it is revealed that the one who had all the codes and in on the attack was Raphelson. Emily is congratulated as a hero for the video footage and calling off the air strike, Finnerty congratulates Cale, who is officially announced by President Sawyer as being recruited into the Secret Service, the father and daughter are taken on an aerial tour of Washington D.C. as they head for hospital, and the President says he will make a peace treaty for all middle eastern and Asian countries. Also starring Rachelle Lefevre as Melanie, Lance Reddick as General Caulfield, Matt Craven as Agent Kellerman and Jake Weber as Agent Hope. Tatum is a good John McClane like hero, Foxx looks a lot like and bases his performance on Barack Obama, and does so relatively well, Woods is a good choice as the mad villain, and the supporting cast are all fine as well. Olympus Has Fallen was straight and patriotic, Emmerich concentrates more on excitement, the story is simple enough and doesn't distract from the main attraction, which is obviously all the guns and explosions going on, it is slightly silly, but a fun action thriller. Worth watching!",White House Down
7,rmax304823,Copy That!,5,27 July 2014,"A cabal within the Secret Service, aided by a squad of mercenaries, blow up the capitol, capture the White House, and pursue the president (Foxx) and a casual visitor (Tatum) who happens to be an ex soldier (bronze star) taking the White House tour. All hell breaks loose.Now, judging from this précis, you may think this is an imitation of an Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone action movie from the 80s. But it's not. It's an imitation of a Bruce Willis action movie from the 90s, specifically ""Die Hard,"" with a touch of Steven Seagal.Instead of the Nakatomi Tower, we have the White House. And we have the jokey computer wizard with glasses who takes over control of all communications. That figure is common to ""Die Hard"", ""Under Siege,"" and ""Under Siege Two: Dark Territory,"" all of which I enjoyed for their utter mindlessness. Like taking a vacation in Cancun and getting lit on piña coladas.The adventitious hero, Tatum, has a vulnerable but tough little girl, his daughter, as his companion(King.) He's separated from her during the initial uproar and she becomes a hostage. (""Die Hard"" plus ""Dark Territory."") The press make fools of themselves by betraying her identity. (""Die Hard"" and its sequels.) Helicopter attacks on the captured White House result in helicopters being colorfully shot down. (""Dark Territory"" and ""Die Hard."") Like Willis, the hero ends up wearing a sweaty, dirty undershirt of the kind called a singlet. I'm getting tired of noting all these isomorphisms. The chief villain (Woods) is neatly dressed. The mercenaries are dressed precisely as all brutal thugs are dressed in these dumb movies -- black leather, sleeveless armored vests, greasy hair, weird mustaches, plenty of masculine tats, and they're all determined and beef-brained. They shoot one another for the slightest hint of betrayal, as in the Nazi movies of the war years. The script abounds with wise cracks during moments of stress.James Woods has a few seconds in which he convinces us that he's putting something into the role -- as he reaches for the nuclear ""football"" that will obliterate Iran. Nobody else can act. Tatum has a neck the girth of a utility pole and not much more. Foxx acts about as well as you or I could. Well -- you, anyway. I've committed some magnificent performances to celluloid. Everyone else, regardless of race, color, or creed, acts and speaks like a Hollywood actor. They bleed like Hollywood actors too. After a prolonged tussle with a mercenary Man Mountain Dean, in which Tatum gets much the worst of it, he emerges with only a few trickles of blood from one nostril. He crashes through at least two windows without visible cuts.It's hard to make a movie about the president and his staff without politics entering into it. So what are the politics here? One of the thugs shouts, ""Get along, Sheeple."" There is a Rush Limbaugh figure who sacrifices himself heroically but without purpose. The president is a black man who has sent troops to Iran. Once he's powerless and the Vice President has been eliminated, the presidency passes to the Speaker of the House, who secretly intends to conquer the world or something. The correspondences between the film's characters and today's political situation are too clear. I understand that some of this is unavoidable but it was a turn off, at least for me, because I dislike propaganda that treats me as if I'm still learning my ABCs.Yet I found this monstrous mess entertaining. After the set up, hardly a moment passes without a car being driven through a wall or somebody being ripped to smithereens by a two- or three-second blast from one of those Gatling guns that spits out a million rounds a minute. Oh, how the arms and legs fly.I wonder. I suppose I shouldn't reveal the ending because it will come as a big surprise. But, ah, well -- Woods and his gangbangers take the president hostage, launch all the nuclear missiles, obliterate much of the world and then conquer the rest, forcing everyone on earth to vote with his fingertip, drink iced cinnamon dolce latte at Starbuck's, and become ovo-lacto vegetarians. Of course it all involves a massive effort on Wood's part, but the results are salubrious. And that's how everyone on the planet came to speak Esperanto.",White House Down
8,Tweekums,Silly over the top action... but a lot of fun,8,8 March 2018,"Police Officer John Cale has applied for a job in the Secret Service at the White House. He takes his daughter, Emily, with him when he goes there for an interview. He is rejected but can't bring himself to tell Emily. Since they are there already he decides that they should tag along with one of the tours of the building. Emily is thrilled when she gets to meet the president but the joy is short-lived as a group of terrorists take control of the building. Separated from his daughter Cale manages to acquire a pistol and get away from the terrorists. He later gets to President James Sawyer and rescues him from the head terrorist... who is none other than his outgoing chief of security! Still trapped inside the White House Cale and the President struggle to get out while elsewhere people start discussing the transfer of power when it is assumed Sawyer is dead or captured.If you are looking for something serious or even something vaguely believable then this won't be the film for you; however if you want full-on, over-the-top action then this is probably the film for you. Once the terrorists first strike the action barely stops till the film ends; there are fights, numerous shootouts, exploding helicopters and even the president firing a rocket launcher from his car as it races over the White House lawn pursued by terrorists firing a minigun! It must be said that some of the special effects are a bit weak; some of the explosions are clearly CGI. The cast; led by Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx as Cale and Sawyer; and supported by the likes of James Woods, as head bad guy; Joey King, as Emily; and Maggie Gyllenhaal as a senior Secret Service agent put in solid performances while never taking things too seriously. Overall I'd say this film is a lot of fun; put your brain in neutral, ignore the clichés and enjoy the mindless action!",White House Down
9,blanche-2,what to think...,6,27 June 2014,"If you want a ton of explosions, shootouts, fires, and a car chase on the grounds of the White House, this is the movie for you.In ""White House Down,"" the White House is taken over. I'll leave it at that.Too long, and way, way over the top. It's the perfect film if you just want to sit and stare at a screen for 2+ hours mindlessly watching people running around the White House.I don't know what the film cost, but the beginning, with helicopters flying toward the White House bringing the President back there, was a cheap process shot that looked like it was from a video game.Someone told me that big studio films are geared toward 15-year-old boys in Taiwan. A 15-year-old boy in Taiwan would love this and probably did.I will say that Jamie Foxx was very likable. Presidential timbre, I don't know. The acting was all fine, what little anyone had to do.If the movie was correct as far as the architecture of the White House, I have to say I found that interesting.I don't know when this film was released but it had summer written all over it. And did I mention the dialogue? Awful.It is possible to make a film with special effects and actually have a good script. It doesn't have to be believable, just good, suspenseful, and tense. The viewer should not be taken out of the film by bad dialogue and preposterous scenes. Of course there's some license with these films. I doubt anyone thinks some of these situations would really happen or be treated as they are in this blockbuster type of movie. But when scenes are blatantly ridiculous, you lose the viewer.A $150 million movie that made less than half that in the U.S.",White House Down
10,Quinoa1984,"another intelligently directed fest of the mindless, but with charm and Jamie Foxx",7,30 June 2013,"An on-the-ropes secret service man. A president who wants to see big changes. Villains who just will not let that happen (and may or may not have profit motives, it is a Die Hard knock-off first and foremost). And lots of explosions, bloody deaths, and wild turns of surprise and suspense all about the destruction of White House and the swift erosion of political order. Sound familiar?As with 2012, a rating that is reflected mostly or at least half ironically. It's a well-made action film, one where you can tell what is going on at all times (not much hand-held, or at least the thing ala Man of Steel that feels pointless), and is dumb as a box of rocks. But it's a fun box-of-rocks movie, and unlike it's close counterpart, Olympus Has Fallen (seriously, some parts of the plot are just telegraphed from one film to the other, villains entrance strategy, double-crossing inside character, and the ultimate goal of the villains involving nuclear launch strikes), but this one kinda has a more (albeit insanely) liberal slant to it - a black president who wants to get ALL troops out of the middle east in order to make total peace, and crazy right-wingers and white supremacists having NONE of that noise jack. Which in a way makes it more awesome. If Olympus has anything really over Down, it's the hero factor, where Gerard Butler showed he can act and carry an action movie not suffused in CGI, while Tatum, though not totally useless (he plays well off of Foxx, who comes off as the real bad-ass of the film, glasses and nicotine gum and all), is just not that strong of a dramatic actor. When he has dumb-fun lines to say, and it's a Roland Emmerich movie so they do come around a lot (i.e. the rocket launcher in the car during the white house lawn chase), he can deliver, but when he has to react to, say, his character's daughter having a gun to her head - which seems to happen quite a lot - he can't quite get to that dramatic level the movie asks for. But, again, this isn't exactly a full-bloodied character piece (albeit James Woods is always dependable, and good to see being so formidable in the first time in a while), and Emmerich knows it. Much your popcorn, sit back, and take in a ride that knows how to push a fantastical political thriller for all its worth, implausible (and predictable) twists and all. At the least you will have more entertainment as far as getting into decidedly cartoonish action than a Man of Steel or even Star Trek from this summer.",White House Down

It is also quite incredible, but as I've stated it's action packed.Jamie Foxx is supposed to be a President Obama with a plan to remove troops from the middle east.Channing Tatum wants to be in the secret service, but is turned down for a variety of reasons by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who he knew in college. Tatum has a precocious daughter, who makes the most awful grimaces during her hostage ordeal.The story really goes awry when retiring Secret Service head James Woods wants revenge for the death of his son in the middle east.

12,michaelRokeefe,"Rocket launchers, hand grenades, helicopter crashes...and the White House!",9,11 July 2013,"Not a very good summer for the White House being nearly vanquished by terrorist attacks and paramilitary hooligans. WHITE HOUSE DOWN is totally superior to OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN. Albeit, both contain firepower galore and provide sensory overload. And patriotism takes no back seat. WHITE HOUSE DOWN has more combined elements to qualify for a possible blockbuster. A D.C. cop, John Cale(Channing Tatum), has just been turned down in his search for employment as a Secret Service agent. But to save face with his winsome daughter Emily(Joey King), he wrangles a tour of the White House for her. The ultimate would be her chance to meet her hero, President Sawyer(Jamie Foxx). Things quickly go awry when a heavily armed paramilitary group causes havoc at the U.S. Capital before moving to the White House and taking the President hostage. Now it is time for Cale to prove his stuff and go into action in order to save his little girl; save Sawyer; and save his country. Among the rampant mayhem of rocket launchers, rolling hand grenades, helicopter crashes, semi-automatic gunfire and limo chases...Cale and the President manage some comedic buddy banter.

13,Scarecrow-88,White House Down,4,8 January 2015,"Absurd action flick services the audience with what it promisesthe White House takes a licking, with Channing Tatum getting to slide into the hero part made available after Stallone, Arnie, Seagal, and Van Damme. Jamie Foxx is the President of the United States and his stance against further military action in the Middle East has angered Secret Service agent James Woods (at this point, Hollywood seems to offer him nothing but villain parts which is a shame, but he is kept employed and does a bang up job in the role he's made a living in forever) to the point (thanks to his son's death) to infiltrate the White House, hold tourists hostage, and threaten to fire nuclear weapons at Arab countries he considers the enemy. It seems Woods has a political ally that has provided him with launch codes needed to fire off those weaponsbut who is it? With Jason Clarke as Woods' chief henchman and direct physical adversary to Tatum (they obviously will do battle), Maggie Gyllenhaal as a secret service agent taught by Woods, Richard Jenkins as the Secretary of Defense, Michael Murphy as the Vice President, Matt Craven as a fellow Secret Service Agent, Lance Reddick as General Caulfield, Rachelle Lefevre as Tatum's kid's mom, Joey King as Tatum's kid who is one of the White House hostages (of course), and scene-stealing Nicholas Wright as the White House guide very protective of its heritage and artifacts. Most of this film, as directed by Hollywood junk extraordinaire Roland Emmerich, is about special effects, gunfire, explosions, and beefcake heroics in the grand style of Hollywood blockbusters. That this was a hit is no surprise since the film promises and delivers violence inside (and all around) the White House. Tatum flexes his action hero muscles and has the physique to make the ladies swoon. Foxx, much to my surprise, is only serviceable as the President, not nearly as fun as I was expectinghe's ever so Presidential, and maybe that's why. Maggie is too good an actress to be stuck in such a bland part, with Jenkins so ""commendable"" he is obviously a wolf in sheep's clothing. Woods is the token ""raging Arab hater wanting them to suffer"" villain, a liberal Hollywood character mocking ""extreme right wing pro military occupation of the Middle East"" type sorts. He tries hard to make him multifaceted, with his son's death motivating himbut when he shoots the President and holds a gun to a little girl's head, it is hard to view him as anything but a psychopath over the edge. This kind of movie has been made for the summer since the 80s and offers nothing new. Jets and helicopters fly over the White House or crash around it, machine guns, rocket launchers, and grenades cause structural and human carnage, and Tatum vows to rescue his girl and keep Foxx safe: don't expect the reinvention of the wheel.",White House Down

Cale (Channing Tatum) is there with his 11 year old daughter Emily (Joey King). Through circumstances Cale saves President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) from being killed and they try to figure a way to beat the terrorists and save the White House.This starts out badly. The first half hour deals with character development. Nothing wrong with that--but it's so DULL! Then the action starts up and it picks up. There's plenty of violence--LOTS of shootings but no blood (hence the PG-13 rating). Still it isn't that good. The action is strong and violent but not enough to carry the movie. Also it's far too long and gets stupider as it goes along. Seriously--by the end I was getting insulted as how moronic the film was getting. Also Emily (an 11 year old) is slapped around, threatened and (more than once) has a gun held to her head! That's going too far. Even worse is Tatum's acting. He was blank-faced throughout. On the plus side the special effects were great, Foxx was good as the president, and Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Woods were great in supporting roles.

""Die Hard in The White House - Part II"" - after the on-the-heels-release of ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a near redux this time with Tatum flexing his pecs and right man-in- the-wrong-place-at-the-right-time shading of John McClane as a DC cop who finds himself knee deep in a heavily armed assault on The Oval Office while attending a job interview cum tour of the building with his young daughter in tow. Faced against insurmountable odds (and a lot of credibility swallowing) Tatum makes a good use of his talents (including some dry humor) while saving The President Of The Untied States (Foxx equally good as well) while all hell breaks loose thanks largely to the fun and dumb screenplay by James Vanderbilt and director of mass destruction Roland Emmerich taking pot-shots at his own ""Independence Day"" with Michael Bay bull-in-the-china-shop/kitchen sink skills at full tilt.

17,ferguson-6,He Hates the Buildings!,4,30 June 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Roland Emmerich loves destroying buildings. In Godzilla, he crushed Manhattan. The Statue of Liberty was trashed in The Day After Tomorrow. Independence Day saw The White House explode, and, as you would expect by the title, The White House gets pretty banged up again in this latest. We have come to expect summertime big, slightly dumb, action-packed popcorn movies, and this one certainly fits the bill (emphasis on dumb).Relased just 3 months after Olympus Has Fallen, the plot is similar, but the approach is diametrically opposite. Emmerich seems to think he gets a free pass thanks to a steady stream of punchlines ... spread amongst most every character. Hey, it's a parody of action films so if you don't like it, you must not ""get it"". Unfortunately, we do get it and it's just not that funny ... the action is weak ... the CGI appears shortcut ... and the characters ring hollow. Through it's numerous similarities and tips of the cap, Emmerich seems to beg us to compare it to the class of this genre ... Die Hard (1988). We've all seen Die Hard, and sir, this is no Die Hard.Channing Tatum takes on the lead action role, though he is working with a safety net ... the buddy picture element supplied by Jamie Foxx. Unfortunately Tatum has neither the acting chops or the screen presence to pull off the lead, and Foxx's President Sawyer is simply a poorly conceived character. Tatum's daughter is played by Joey King, who was so good in Crazy Stupid Love. Here she plays the role of smarter-than-adults kid and is clearly designed to be the patriotic heart of the film.For these type of films to work, we need a nasty bad guy. James Woods is fun to watch as he chews scenery as the Secret Service Director gone bad. He holds one of the various personal grudges against the government and the faceless ""Military Industrial Complex"". Woods' number one guy on the assault team is Jason Clarke, who was last seen in a key role in Zero Dark Thirty (no coincidence, I'm sure). The rest of the supporting cast is pretty much wasted, including a miscast Maggie Gylenhaal, Richard Jenkins, and the always fun Michael Murphy (where has he been?).There is nothing wrong with pure escapism, but rather than compare this to the classic 1988 Die Hard, it really has more in common with this year's A Good Day to Die Hard. If you prefer your White House terrorist attack movies to be serious and full out action, then Olympus Has Fallen is the better call. Instead, if your preference is strained one-liners, an awkward buddy-film and hazy bad guy motivation, then White House Down might do it for you.",White House Down

While every guard in the White House is picked off with solo shots Tatum becomes the umpteenth action star to avoid being hit as he dives over tables in an effort to protect the President and find his daughter. Jamie Foxx plays the President and if Harrison Ford couldn't pull it off in the pathetic Air Force One then he sure isn't going to do it. James Woods is revealed as the villain the moment he glances as a framed picture of his son and removes the American flag pin from his coat. Richard Jenkins is another great talent wasted in this garbage, and his revelation is not that striking either. Joey King is the only eleven year old I've ever heard of whose psyched about current events and politics and its a verbal counterpart to all the other crap thrown into this relentlessly horrid garbage that should be flushed down a toilet.

19,FlashCallahan,Tours over....wave your flag.....,5,8 September 2013,"John Cale wants to be in the Secret Service. When he goes for his interview, he brings his daughter along. But he just lacks some of the requirements needed to be an agent. He's also planned a tour of the White House for his daughter. When she goes to use the bathroom, some villains who have seen Die Hard, take over the building and seek the president. Luckily he's been saved by James Woods, who happens to be working his final shift as head of security, but earlier on, we learn that his son was killed in the Middle East, and also that he has three months left to live. Could this be a co-incident? Cale decides to take back the White House and go all Bruce Willis on the bad guys, and tags along Jamie Foxx, who happens to be the President......Another one of those movies where two of exactly the same plot line come out in the same year. There is always one serious one (Deep Impact, Dantes Peak) and one, goofy one that defies belief (Armageddon, Volcano). This falls into the latter, after the semi-serious Olympus Has Fallen, and yes, the film is flawed, bad in fact, but thanks to one of the poorest scripts ever written, and two really bad performances, this is hilariously brilliant.The two bad acting awards go to the bad guy who looks like a long haired Freddy Mercury, and the army captain at the command centre who looks like the Mr Halloran from The Shining.There were some scenes where I could not control my laughter, from the Benny Hill car chase scene on the lawn, to Channing Tatums death defying leaps into the air.The plot holes are in your face, and there are so many similarities to Die Hard, you could play a drinking game. From the vest, to the computer hacker, to RPG hitting the tank, its all here, and I enjoyed every awful minute of it.Foxx is woefully miscast, and Tatum looks way to young to have a daughter, but when you think that the Director made 2012, and Independence Day, its a step up.I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons, but it really is a bad movie...",White House Down
20,phd_travel,Good fun - watch it.,8,4 July 2013,"For this type of action movie it's quite fun with long lasting and varied action. Expected more destruction from the director of 2012 etc but there was more fighting than special effects and destruction. The story has quite a few mild twists and turns. An interesting aspect was all the different agendas and justifications the bad guys had for the attack.Acting and casting are secondary issues in such a show. Jamie Fox played the president in a non presidential, not so dignified way which was a bit jarring. He spoke with a man of the streets accent. Maybe it was meant to keep the movie more action like and younger. Channing had his usual half smile on his face which seemed out of place at times. But in the end it doesn't matter because the action is the main thing in this movie. Channing's daughter is played by the suitably scared looking Joey King from Romona and Beezus. Liked seeing the now plumper Rachelle Lefevre in a small role. Big role for James Woods.Overall worth a watch - ignore the bad reviews.

Reason? The drama loses pace, the good vs evil fight gets monotonous & the excessive length leaves you in mixed-emotions. The Screenplay is crispy in parts, but clichéd otherwise. Roland Emmerich's Direction is standard. Performance-Wise: James Woods is excellent as the tormented menace. He contributes enormously in the narrative. Channing Tatum is okay. Jamie Foxx is efficient. Richard Jenkins is decent. Jason Clarke is effective. Maggie Gyllenhaal is passable. On the whole, 'White House Down' is fair.",White House Down
23,jdesando,Chill out--it's summer flick fun,8,27 June 2013,"You can't have much more fun this summer than White House Down. Although the director is Roland Emmerich of Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012, it's not just famous buildings going down, but the action genre takes a parodic turn with quips, one-liners, and subtle comic situations that signal everyone is having fun.As with Olympus Has Fallen earlier this year, the president is in trouble needing a hero who was Gerard Butler and now Channing Tatum. Tatum as Cale, a war hero, DC cop who wants to do Secret Service, wins my favorite status because he has the better lines along with the capably comedic companionship of Jamie Foxx as president. Their repartee is second only this summer to the banter in Much Ado About Nothing, and W. Shakespeare wrote that comedy.White House Down has tongue firmly in cheek as it rolls out all the presidential thriller tropes including the vulnerable child and corrupt high-level politicians. That the ""military industrial complex"" is one of the bad guys gives an idea how this film can't take anyone seriously. (The North Koreans in Olympus were satisfactory villains). Heck, even a Don Cheadle lookalike general has a prominent role (Remember him as Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in Iron Man 2?). Now that's having fun with the genre.The genius of a film like this is to keep you enjoying its mastery of suspense and computer graphics while knowing it's making fun of itself as it baldly sets up improbable good fortune for the heroes and occasionally for the bad guys, some of whom have a comedic line or two.If you can stand the absurdities and don't have a problem with a few jokes that may make fun of beloved action films, then see this summer tent pole and confirm that movies don't have to be serious or intellectual to be enjoyed.",White House Down

While it is quite easy to understand how far outside of reality this is, there a re couple of points that need to be made.Jamie Foxx comes off as a US President that is more mature, more calm, and much smarter than the real guy is. He does not stand around making boring speeches or pleading for sanctions but actually does his job. Of course it is easy to tell this is not real as there is no golf course footage and no first lady. There is a little girl whose role and White house Tour ends up being a night mare in the oval office. Just put your brain away and enjoy the ride. Anyone looking for reality in this remember, Foxx would beat Obama in an Election with this hands behind his back.",White House Down
25,lasttimeisaw,White House Down,6,28 July 2013,"My once a week cinema-going experience, Emmerich's latest tentpole is a doppelgänger of another White House terrorists-attack actioner (at least plot wise), Antoine Fuqua's OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (2013), and its North American box office performance has tanked badly ($69,430,120 for WHD Vs. $98,925,640 for OHF so far), which is a rather unlooked-for denouement for the internecine combat, considering from all aspects, the timing and the budget (a summer blockbuster Vs. a spring release), directors' cachet (Emmerich is a monolith name in the genre) and the cast (Tatum is the hottest leading man in the Hollywood right now and his drawing power has been solidly tested by different genres), it is an impossible battle to lose for WHD, nevertheless the reality has no clemency, but Chinese market could be its last haven, a sizable income is well expected. Generally speaking the film is a safe bet, the retro-80s packed action, a state-of-the-art SFX, a corny but effective father-saving-daughter stock-in-trade, a topical black president with enjoyable banters, and a last-minute twist of revealing the culprit. Scale-wise, the film cannot beat Emmerich's 2012 (2009, 6/10), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004, 5/10) or INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996, 7/10), but it doesn't prevent it from being a satisfactory pop-corn fest. Tatum takes after a young John McClane image from DIE HARD franchise, an unbeatable stud defies all the bullets and weaponry, teamed with a righteous and suave president, with no military background, whose fighting-back is more amusing and anticipating than Tatum's special agent's combat skill. Child star Joey King is a new-rising starlet, a politics-enthusiastic and premature girl, an underage heroine is equally praiseworthy as her father. The schemes behind the rebels are half-witted, but Jason Clarke and James Woods are the attention-grabbers, typical villain-design, but introducing their own fiber of insanity in their executions. Maggie Gyllenhaal is engaging but hasn't been warranted any showboating opportunity in a masculine- dominant bullets-bombarding thriller. I cannot say I'm disappointed by the film and anyhow it is a middle-of-the-road output with wide appeal to the general taste of hoi polloi, one thumb up for its verisimilitude of the precise reproduction of the world-famous locale. As a misfire from Emmerich, one could blame audiences' aesthetic fatigue of the same milieu but a revive of old-fashioned action hero fails to reconnect with the superhero-fed generation and it is something beyond Tatum and Emmerich's capabilities.",White House Down
26,KineticSeoul,"Maybe slightly better than ""Olympus Has Fallen""",7,6 July 2013,"""Olympus Has Fallen"" is the first movie to come out this summer where the premise is about the White House being taken over. And kinda found it shocking when I saw the trailer to this movie not too long after ""Olympus Has Fallen"" came out. Is Hollywood really running out of ideas or something or was it just a coincidence? I personally liked the build up slightly better in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" but when it comes to the direction of the action and the story although far from being intelligent. I liked this one better, even though the violence is trimmed down for this one. The shootouts I liked better in this one but when it comes to hand to hand combat sequences I liked it better in ""Olympus Has Fallen"". So there is certain areas I liked better in this one and other areas I liked better in ""Olympus Has Fallen"". But as a whole this one takes the cake. Channing Tatum is turning out to be a alright action star, mainly because of his physicality and a bit of charisma. He goes by this guy named John Cale who gets put in a crucial situation to save the day. But he will never replace John McClane. Jamie Foxx is likable as the partner role, despite one of the main mission is for him to be protected. I thought he put on a entertaining performance. Despite the insults some people has been giving this movie and the insults that given to people that enjoyed this movie. It's just not a bad movie, I mean it's not a amazing action movie but a entertaining popcorn flick. And it's actually worth a watch in the theaters when there is no other movies to check out in the theater for a matinée price.

27,sddavis63,It's Exciting For A Bit - But By The Time It's Over You Really Want This To End,5,24 December 2015,"If you really want to watch a movie about a terrorist takeover of the White House and the attempts to save the president from the bad guys, I'd really recommend that you watch ""Olympus Has Fallen."" It's a better movie. ""White House Down"" is basically the same story - the major difference (for me) being that in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" the terrorists are foreign, while in ""White House Down"" they're domestic. Since folks are so afraid of foreign terrorists, I suppose this deserves some credit for that. The problem is that this just isn't really that good. It's exciting for a little while (for perhaps about a half hour in the middle of the movie.) Before that it was actually pretty slow starting off as we follow Cale's attempt to get hired on to the presidential Secret Service detail, learn all about his troubled relationship with his 11 year old daughter and then join the two of them on an interminable tour of the White House. I get it. The White House is a big building. I've never taken the tour, but I have seen it from outside the fence. So it's a lot bigger than it looks. Gotcha. Now, get the movie going please. I mean, I really didn't need to know how many bathrooms the White House has. Once the terrorist plot swings into action it gets pretty exciting - but after a while it just becomes more of the same. I don't mind action movies - even if you do have to suspend your disbelief to watch them - but this was just way too long to the point at which it got dull. You just want the thing to end after a while. Yeah, there's a little bit of a twist at the end about exactly who's involved in the plot, but I wasn't really shocked by it.Too much of the movie was filmed in very darkened lighting conditions. I guess this was supposed to heighten the sense of chaos - but all it really did for me repeatedly was make it difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys. It didn't really add suspense, and I already had the message that everything was in chaos. The performances were OK, but nothing better. The leads were Channing Tatum as Cale, Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer and Joey King as Cale's daughter Emily. You also have recognizable people like Maggie Gyllenhaal, Richard Jenkins and James Woods. As I said, they were all just OK. From time to time there were some attempts to inject some humour into this (mostly from the White House tour guide) but the humour just seemed out of place and didn't work all that well. And I wonder if anyone else was bugged that the President of Iran was named al-Sharif? It was only mentioned a couple of times, but it bugged me because al-Sharif sounds to me like an Arab name - and the Iranians aren't Arabs!I did like the idea - as I mentioned - of portraying domestic terrorists, and I also thought there was a believable portrayal of a struggle for power between the military, the FBI and the Secret Service over who should be in command of the situation.But really - watch ""Olympus Has Fallen."" It's a better movie. (5/10)",White House Down
28,Hellmant,"Better than 'OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN' but it still doesn't beat the real thing,",8,29 June 2013,"'WHITE HOUSE DOWN': Four Stars (Out of Five) Yet another 'DIE HARD' rip-off, set at the White House, in the same year (following 'OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN')! This one is better than director Antoine Fuqua's take (on the same subject matter) but it still doesn't compare to the real thing; 'A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD' was the best 'DIE HARD' movie this year! Sure a lot of people were disappointed in the latest John McClane adventure but they're putting too high of standards on it; by comparing it to one of the greatest action films of all time (the original). Judge 'A GOOD DAY' on it's own merits and I'm sure you'll find it's a very well made and entertaining action film; compared to it's knock-offs (like 'WHITE HOUSE DOWN' and 'OLYMPUS') it's far superior. I like Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx but even combining their talents together doesn't match Mr. Willis alone. As far as the rip-offs go this is a pretty good one though, it doesn't live up to the best ('SPEED', 'PASSENGER 57', 'UNDER SIEGE') but it's still highly enjoyable.Tatum stars as a Capitol policeman named John Cale (smart to name him John). He's takes his daughter, Emily (Joey King), with him to the White House, on a job interview for his dream job as a Secret Service agent, in order to try and impress her (after missing her talent show). He blows the interview but keeps it from his daughter and takes her on a tour, before leaving, at her request. They meet the President (Foxx), on the tour, shortly before the White House is attacked by a paramilitary group, led by a well trained mercenary named Emil Stenz (Jason Clarke). Stenz has assistance from a high ranking government official though and it's up to Cale, of course, to stop them before they carry out their deadly plot. He must protect the President and save his daughter, who he's separated from.Blockbuster master Roland Emmerich directed the film and James Vanderbilt wrote it. Vanderbilt is also famous for writing the films 'ZODIAC' (which is fantastic) and 'BASIC' as well as co-writing 'THE RUNDOWN', 'THE LOSERS' and 'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN'. Emmerich should need no introduction to movie buffs; he's directed some of the biggest blockbusters ever including 'INDEPENDENCE DAY', 'THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW', '2012', 'STARGATE' and my favorite (even if it wasn't actually a blockbuster) 'UNIVERSAL SOLDIER'. The movie of course looks fantastic (it should with a $150 million budget though) and the action scenes are spectacular but given Vanderbilt's resume I'm surprised it was so poorly written. The dialogue is atrocious in places and it's so overly sentimental and cheesy, when it's not in action mode, that it's painful to watch at times. The action scenes are great though, the bad guys are classic (classic stereotypes but still awesome) and Tatum makes a cool, fun action hero. Tatum is one of the biggest male movie stars around right now (in box office draw) but this is no 'MAGIC MIKE' and all the biggest top male stars combined together couldn't match the star power of Jennifer Lawrence (that girl is on fire). Still he's a good lead for this type of film, he's no Bruce Willis obviously but he's a good action hero. So the movie is fun when it's not trying to be serious. It delivers just what a 'DIE HARD' rip-off should, nothing more and nothing less.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diBy263FaHs",White House Down
29,thesar-2,The Top Twenty-Five Ways Olympus Has Fallen Even Harder,1,16 August 2013,"1. The only thing this White House and the real one had in common was the color. Sorry...colors.2. Suspending one's suspension of disbelief must be a talent I don't have, but apparently, Director Roland Emmerich's very familiar with the 2012 concept.3. It's been almost 20 years since I've walked out on a movie. One hour into White House Down, I almost broke that streak.4. But, thank goodness I didn't. The climax was a triple-threat of absolute, albeit unintentional, hilarity.5. And, gee, I knew the boring, flag twirling subplot would come in handy.6. The President might be captured, used for ransom or assassinatedso why not worry about the absolute improbability of the stock market crashing in less than 30-minutes following a DC attack?7. Terrorist take note: Janitors never get screened when working high profile government jobs.8. It's gotta be a tad bit racist for an African-American to shout ""Code Black! Code Black!"" when the White House is under attack. Especially for someone imitating Forest Whitaker.9. Do all White House guides resemble Alan Ruck from Speed or Jason Schwartzman from any Wes Anderson film?10. Screaming to a terrorist: ""You're gonna go to jail for that!"" after he shoots a hostage might seem like an empty threat. Because it is.11. Ripping off the other White House-attacked 2013 release? Forget Olympus Has Fallen. Focus on who'll sue you for copyright infringement when White House Down names its tank-topped hero ""John"" and blatantly rips off even the worst Die Hard sequel.12. Oh, and A Good Day to Die Hardnot so bad any more.13. An entire scene of an action movie spend on: Squirrel vs. Bird Feeder feels more like a Rocky & Bullwinkle short. 30-seconds of that is certainly more entertaining than any of the 131 minutes of this.14. Characters like John Cale shouldn't have to tell the audience ""This is so stupid!"" but, he did anyways.15. First day visiting the White House? Fear not, every character in this movie is also serving their initial day. Including the President who clearly has no idea how or where to secure himself.16. Making 1993's Dave seem realistic must be an accomplishment. But, creating a less secure White House than the Dulles International Airport of Die Hard 2 should win some awards.17. Beepers should never be a key plot twist. Ever. Well, okay, at least, not in the last 20 years.18. When Sharknado appears to be more realistic and the WORLD-WIDE box-office receipts back me up, it's time to think twice before releasing a B-Movie in the theatres.19. Poor White House Down. They made a movie centering around White House tours that were outdated months before release. At least the original Spider-Man had the common Spidey-sense to delete the Twin Towers scene.20. Butif they ever reinstate the White House tours, and you happen to see a door ajar that you can peer into and see the bad guys getting ready for an assaultplease say something. Anything. To anyone.21. Calling the White House ""the safest house in the world"" and then immediately following that with another character hoping his inexperienced daughter got out is really wishing too much.22. White House windows are easy to open with knives and the rooms are even easier to set on fire to thwart terrorists.23. Spitting on President Abraham Lincoln's grave should be considered treason.24. Try not saying: ""Whatthehell?"" and following that up with extreme laughter every few moments in White House Down. I dare you.25. Jack Bauer would literally take a few seconds to analyze this situation and take less time to solve itif he wasn't already bored one second into this day.",White House Down
30,Robert_duder,Proof that I don't follow the crowd...I freakin loved it.,9,12 July 2013,"Yet another controversial Summer film. I heard basically nothing but negative things about this film and it certainly didn't do well financially. It had a lot of things going against it, not the least of which was the fact that Gerard Butler did an identical movie a few months ago that did decently. I am a sucker for action flicks without a doubt and its hard to find a good old fashion good vs evil type of movie like this. Roland Emmerich is a lot like Michael Bay only I think more passionate and tries a lot harder. The last two films I saw of his were atrocious in my books (Anonymous and 2012) but the man also has some truly legendary action flicks under his belt. There is no doubt the first half of this film really dragged. I mean, I give them kudos for wanting to establish characters before throwing them into the action but it was almost too much. Fortunately the second half of the film makes up for it by just being a balls to the wall, fun, breakneck action movie with great characters, amazing supporting characters and really just unapologetically ripping off Die Hard. Unlike some I don't consider this a negative thing. As long as the movie stands on its own legs and brings something different to the table then who cares who they are copying. Our lead hero wears the white undershirt, is a single Dad struggling to find his place with his family, wrong place at the wrong time...this should have been the plot for the new Die Hard film because it felt more like Die Hard.Channing Tatum is a hit and miss actor for me. When he first came on the scene I wasn't crazy about him but now he's starting to gradually grow on me. In this film he isn't amazing but he is certainly good in the hero role. He's fortunate because the supporting cast is so exceptional that it makes him seem just a little better than what he probably is. His humour in the film feels a little misplaced and a little forced but it works. Jamie Foxx plays President James Sawyer. Foxx is Barack Obama. I know this fact causes right wing squeaky wheels to start squeaking and squawking but really...who cares. He is a good character with some good lines and him and Tatum have decent chemistry. If they had had great chemistry it possibly would have pushed this to a ten for me. As I mentioned previously the supporting cast is brilliant. Maggie Gyllenhaal is terrific as a Secret Service agent trying to protect her agency and the President, Nicolas Wright has a very small role but its a really great role and a lot of fun. He gets one of the best lines towards the end of the film. Michael Murphy, Rachelle Lefevre and Lance Reddick all have really great small but important roles of varying degrees. Jason Clarke is just perfect as an old fashion villain as the muscle behind the terrorism plot. He is wild eyed and crazy enough to be the perfect threat. Richard Jenkins is also really great in his role as the Speaker of The House. His character gets better and better and by the end of the film he is really stand out. The amazing James Woods (I've always liked him) is epic as the head of the secret service who has lost all hope in the system and wants vengeance for his son's death with the most convoluted, disturbing plot you can possibly imagine. Woods is brilliant in this role. And finally the young Joey King. She was amazing. Not only did her final scenes in the film literally bring tears to my eyes (yah I teared up at White House Down and proud of it!) but she holds her own in every scene that she is in. She shows a passion and emotion that nearly carries the film and even shows up Tatum in their scenes together.Let's talk bad news, good news because I will not deny that there is both in this film. With any action films there will be inevitable plot holes and I actually think this one didn't have too many glaring ones. I'm not sure about the whole nuclear launch codes, I feel like that was a potential major plot hole but they at least tried to cover it up as best as they could. The lead performances lacked perfection and chemistry. Imagine if someone with the extreme old school charisma of Stallone or Willis had been in the lead role this would have been a ten easy. Do I think there was some definite left wing leading to this film? Yes maybe a little but WHO CARES!! Then again I'm a democrat so I can say that proudly. But hey, why don't we deserve a left wing movie. The President is a black democrat so there is nothing wrong with the film portraying that. The good outweighs the bad ten to one. The special effects are brilliant and the action scenes are some of the best I have seen at least in years. Air Force One being destroyed and downed, the attack on the Capitol Building, the White House scenes and the nuclear launches were done in such a way that it will leave you in awe. Sometimes you have to review a film on how it entertains you and moves you and this was a near perfect experience for me. It is scary how close Emmerich to making a ten/ten movie in my books. This sits firmly in the company of legends like Air Force One and Die Hard. I look forward to watching it again and again!! 9.5/10",White House Down
31,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A gloriously nonsensical throwback to action films of old,7,11 June 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAgent Cale (Channing Tatum) is looking for a little promotion from the position he presently holds, but even if he doesn't quite meet the standards, at least he can get his surly daughter Emily (Joey King) some tickets for a tour round the White House. However, this would just happen to be the day disgruntled Agent Walker (James Woods), on the verge of retirement, launches a sudden and dramatic takeover of the president's home, and threatens to launch nuclear weapons at various targets if his demands aren't met. Cale must thrust himself in to action, and prove to all the disbelievers that he can save the day.Reliable action stelwart Roland Emmerich gives his addition to the 'what if...' scenario of the white house being taken over, with this throwback to the reliable Die Hard spin off that's worked so well over the years. Reveling in the clichés of the genre, while throwing in some unexpected plot developments, it has a solid lead in Tatum, who just feels a little young with his role as the single dad with the sulky teenage daughter (see what I mean about the clichés?) However, co star Foxx feels perfectly cast as the American president, a worthy nod to Obama and his cultural position in this present climate. Woods also pops up out of nowhere, and is equally well suited to the villainous role.Any stab at food for thought or any sort of social commentary about the threat of extremists infiltrating the White House in these riskier times, and the effectiveness of security to prevent this is quickly ditched in favour of the maximum amount of mindless, explosive action, that only Emmerich can manage. Tatum races around, bare chested, ripped and battered, demanding increasing amounts of suspended disbelief as he goes along, a sub par Bruce Willis, but suitable eye candy for the female members of the audience that might have been enticed along. Hollow and nonsensical as it is, though, somehow it does manage to keep you just about on the edge of your seat, with the main components to make the DH clone work (the hero, the villain, the dialogue) just about dodging any blanks.This is disposable, heavily flawed film-making, that was never going to win any awards, but personally, I think it just about beats last year's similarly themed Olympus Has Fallen. Only by a jot, but just about. ***",White House Down

33,bowmanblue,A bit too clichéd for its own good,6,15 July 2014,"Strangely enough, 'White House Down' is one of two films about terrorists taking over the White House released in the same year (the other being 'Olympus Has Fallen'). They basically follow identical plots of regarding terrorists taking over the White House when it just so happens that – by complete chance – the one man capable of fighting off an entire army of highly-trained mercenaries happens to be in the building.Judging by how well both movies were received, it's widely accepted that Olympus Has Fallen is more serious, whereas White House Down is a little more light-hearted and cheesy. So, depending on whether you like your action films dark and moody, or light and fluffy, will go some way to which one you thought was better.Personally, I preferred Olympus – not because it was darker or anything, but simply because (although it too offered nothing new in the way of story lines), the action was a little more inventive and realistic. In White House Down, you have every single action movie cliché going. Everything from the hero's family being taken hostage, to the (strangely incompetent) special forces who offer nothing in the way of credible help, to an air strike on the building destined to be thwarted at the eleventh hour.It's not a bad film, but it's certainly not a great one either. It's the sort of film you can walk in and out of and not miss a thing, nor fail to understand every aspect of the plot.

34,MLDinTN,exciting action flick,7,9 April 2014,"I thought this was a good action movie, along the lines of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Channing Tatum was kick *ss in this. He plays wannabe secret service agent John Cale, whom has a job interview at the White House. He brought his daughter along to impress her. But they picked the wrong day for a White House tour.Terrorists invade and overtake the White House. Now you have to suspend reality to believe that this could happen. And to make matters worse, it's an inside job. John has to go find his daughter, hence, kick *ss action ensues. He's got an answer for all the bad guys. And once he teams up with the President, better watch out. So of course they try to escape but something always happens during the middle of the film.At the end, they gotta stop some nukes.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining, plot makes sense, of course not all that realistic. Definitely worth checking out for all the action fans.",White House Down
35,g-bodyl,"The ""Fun"" Version of Olympus Has Fallen!",8,6 October 2014,"Well now that I have viewed White House Down, I can compare it to the other 2013 ""destroy the White House"" movie, Olympus Has Fallen. Personally, I liked Gerard Butler's film better, but I will admit that this film has it's own unique touch. While Olympus was more serious, this film seems to have a campy tone as more wisecracks are used. I didn't buy into the action as much, but this film benefits from the chemistry of Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx and I personally enjoyed Roland Emmerich's homage to his previous films, mainly 1996's Independence Day.Roland Emmerich's film is about a Capitol Hill police officer named John Cale who in order to make his daughter happy, interviews for a position as a member of the President's secret service officers. A little after the interview, the White House is taken over by a group of paramilitary officers and now John Cale must show his worth and keep the President safe.As mentioned before, this film benefits because of Tatum and Fox. Of course, the ladies will probably be happy with ""The Sexiest Man Alive"" being on screen most of the film, but his acting ability has improved and I think he does a good job here. Jamie Foxx was great as President Sawyer, who reminds me of Obama in some ways. We also have a good supporting ensemble but James Wood as the head of the Secret Service and Richard Jenkins as Speaker of the House stands out the most.Overall, White House Down benefits from not taking a serious approach, but in the long run I can look at Olympus Has Fallen more favorably, even though I liked this film. The script could use some tweaking and the action could use some editing. But some of the action is good and I liked the high-energy acting from the leads. This is your ideal summer blockbuster since it offers a fun time and is your typical Roland Emmerich. I rate this film 8/10.",White House Down

37,A_Different_Drummer,And the Search for the New Bruce Willis Continues...,7,7 July 2013,"Lets tell a story. IN THE BEGINNING there was a fairly unique TV show called Moonlighting directed by a maverick director who used a lot of strange cuts and spent a lot of time on the chemistry between the two stars. The female star was an ageing blonde bombshell and the male star was a relative unknown named Bruce Willis. The show was a hit. When it ended, both tried to move into features, but only Willis succeeded. His breakout role was an adaptation of a novel by (then) bestselling writer Roderick Thorpe and it was called Die Hard. It was brilliant. One of the best films of its kind ever done. And Willis was brilliant, showing a knack for action and pathos at the same time. The movie (DIE HARD) was so good it became a franchise although the quality of the sequels was very uneven (and the last entry was an abomination). But Hollywood is nothing if not repetitive, and as it becomes clear that Willis is too old to continue, the HUNT FOR A NEW BRUCE WILLIS CONTINUES. In one corner we have Gerard Butler who, to be fair, does a brilliant job in a movie (OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN) that lacks good writing, good direction, and a good supporting cast. And now (because, as noted, Hollywood is repetitive) we have WHITE HOUSE DOWN, where the versatile Channing Tatum gives it a go. Here the writing direction and supporting cast are a bit better than OLYMPUS but the net effect is to make Tatum part of an ensemble cast and that of course is the absolutely wrong thing you want to do in this kind of picture. It is somewhat entertaining and (as said) a heck of a lot better than anything Willis himself has done lately. BUT DIE HARD IT Ain't.",White House Down

Now he has to try and protect both the President and get his daughter out safely. I was pretty excited about seeing this. I am a big Jamie Foxx fan, but I was leery of Tatum (not a fan). I will admit that the chemistry between them was very good and the movie had some very funny parts in this as well as wall to wall action. This is the latest movie in Hollywood's ""I can do it better"" series. Other movies in this club are Deep Impact & Armageddon, Illusionist & Prestige, movies with the same idea coming out close to each other. While Olympus Has Fallen was OK and worth seeing this one was way better and if you had to choose between the two this is the way to go.

Expect something loud, dumb, overlong, but fairly entertaining as well",6,31 January 2014,"Capitol police officer John Kale is denied his dream job at the secret service because of a C average and the ability to be a loose cannon. Unwilling to let his daughter down again, Kale gives off an optimistic impression that he obtained the job and tours the white house with her. The White house is invaded by military men. When Kale's daughter is kidnapped, Kale searches frantically for his daughter and tries to make sure President Sawyer stays alive. I really don't know what to tell if you expect a great movie going into this one. It's a Roland Emmerich movie, the king of big budgeted, cheesy goodness. His résumé speaks for itself. He is all about blowing sh****t up and delivering ridiculously OTT action. Suspension of disbelief is a must when it comes to this one. This is one of the two releases of 2013 that are presidential themed. One is the R rated Olympus Has Fallen and this one. My personal preference is Olympus Has Fallen, but it doesn't mean this one isn't fun. On the contrary, it doesn't abstain from fun at all. It throws in many clichés, but there is constant action throughout, some that are mind-blowing. Ever seen a tennis court get demolished from a crash? Roland Emmerich gives us that in this one. It is senseless and a lot of fun. I also liked the idea of a black president. We don't get many black presidents in movies, not that I can tell anyway. Channing Tatum is good as the lead. He's always had charisma, but he is really becoming a very good actor as well. He's very adept at playing the invincible action hero as well. There is a reason he's one of the top actors in Hollywood. Jamie Fox does his own style for the role and I appreciated that. He was actually a real human being and not just a political figure. I enjoyed his chemistry with Tatum. He even wore Air Jordan's as the president, how cool is that? James Woods can play a villain like nobody else can. He is clearly relishing being back in a huge role. He killed it in my opinion. Joey King is excellent for her age as Tatum's daughter. Maggie Gyllenhall and Richard Jenkins are both solid with what they have to do. I have only a couple of major complaints. How is it that security is so incompetent? Also, the twist at the end was a tad unbelievable. Overall, this is stupid fun. What do you want, an Oscar winner? Check your brain at the door and just go with it. 6.3/10",White House Down
40,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,4,7 November 2013,"White House DownThe upside to being an African American President is that if you are ever taken hostage, the authorities will actually negotiate for your release.However, the higher-ups in this action movie cannot be trusted.While U.S. Capitol Police officer John Cale (Channing Tatum) is touring the White House with his estranged daughter (Joey King), Pennsylvania Avenue is attacked by homegrown terrorists lead by a civil servant (James Woods).During the melee, Cale comes to the aid of the president (Jamie Foxx), who is required by the gunmen to launch nuclear weapons.Meanwhile, to avert an air strike, his daughter broadcasts vital Intel to the outside world via her Youtube channel.Mired in patriotic rhetoric, green-screen action and an ignominious Obama impersonation from Jamie Foxx, White House Down doesn't hide its hostage movie inspiration or it's hackneyed plot twists.Besides, forget launch codes - get the president's keys to the Roswell UFO.Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",White House Down
41,tabuno,Potential Not Realized,6,16 January 2019,"14 September 2013. White House Down starts with a lofty humanistic developing story that has substantive drama, but unlike its contemporary cousin Olympus Has Fallen (2013) becomes more a derivative of John McTiernan's action thriller Die Hard (1988). The result is an uneasy attempt at light humor along with a more darker plot that literally destroys a national American symbol. The plot elements in this deliberately twisting action thriller sometimes fails logic and later descends into a more chaotic and at times manipulative story.Even with a rather ingenious double, double cross there is the over simplified demise of one of the more colorful villain, action scenes that seem to become more cluttered confusion and literally driving around in strange circles that defies believability. Even with the sincere and poignant if not manipulative scene with the daughter towards the climax of the movie, there are just too many moments where escape plans are abruptly and conveniently and contortedly altered.While the beginning of the movie offered a polished and genuinely felt corridors of high power well folded as a solid backdrop to the humanity of the developing characters and an interesting liberal conspiracy theory embraced by the President himself, the tone of the movie becomes uneasy. Unlike Olympus Has Fallen which takes itself more thoughtfully seriously both the take over of the White House, the rebellious counter measures, and the consistent appealing emotive tone, White House Down just can't bring the same level of dry humor and entertainment as Die Hard.",White House Down

Well, White House Down does the impossible, too.With a story-line so uncanny with that of the previously released film, Olympus Has Fallen earlier this year, it goes on to show real references. I am not gonna compare them and bore you, but if I were to choose, I'd play a diplomat & choose both.You know the story, the music, the cinematography, the patriotism, the performances, the CGI (oh, my) are top-notch and no critic can bias his review negating these points. All these gives the 2 hour long film an impetus and I am sure it will hook you up, that is you do what I suggested in the summary above.Jamie Foxx & Channing Tatum are good, but the timing of their dialogs were simply the reason the film lost 2 stars from me. Their airs are appreciable even Maggie G was good enough. With surprises all over the narration up till the end, I enjoyed the movie with total concentration. Maybe because I am not an American, I agree to state my experience.Also, a special mention for the lady who played Channing's daughter and a special smack below the ear for the guy who wrote all the scenes related to her. Just why the terrorists show extra sympathy? God, I hate not to spill spoilers at this point. Humor is very good, so is the action. But the timing of the former is what is illogical.BOTTOM LINE: Trust me, you won't be disappointed. If you enjoyed Olympus, you surely will love this.

43,The-Sarkologist,Now Channing gets to do Die Hard in the White House,8,18 January 2014,"I must say that this film was actually a lot more believable than Olympus Has Fallen namely because the way that the set the bad guys up in this movie is a lot more believable. However, the catch is that the nature of the president of the United States of America is actually not all that believable. To me it appears as if the president in this movie is what Obama was supposed to have been as opposed to what he actually is (considering that the only way to get to the position of President of the United States is to be supported by the monied interests that this particular president is going to war against).A quick glance at the reviews seem to indicate that people seemed to believe that this movie was dumb and unbelievable. Seriously, were do they get off? My opinion was that Olympus has Fallen, with a crack North Korean commando unit taking out the White House was much more unbelievable than the military industrial complex attempting to undermine a president that actually wanted to make peace with the nations of the Middle East. This, to me, is a much, much, much more believable scenario. I guess the problem that some people may have had is that it is unbelievable that such a President would ever get elected.Personally, I would love it if such a President got elected, and many people saw Obama as such a president. Granted, he has withdrawn troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, and also attempted to push through a form of universal health care, but the thing is that he has not taken a stand against the technocracy that is the United States. Take for instance the fact that the surveillance scandals, with Snowden and Manning, have both occurred on his watch. Also consider the fact that both Snowden and Manning have been implicated in crimes when in reality they are whistleblowers (and I also believe that Manning is nothing more than a fall guy). Seriously, while Obama is a thousand times better than Bush, he has done very little to actually change the way the technocracy works. I guess this was to be expected.At least he managed to get a second term, because it would have been a lot worse under Romney.",White House Down
44,Reno-Rangan,"Jamie Foxx, Channing Tatum and the white house",7,31 October 2013,"I might be a coincident that two similar movies to release on the same year. Yes it was a similar kinda theme to 'Olympus has Fallen' but a different storyline. In both the movies, white house has been under attack by the paramilitary forces. Like Gerard Butler as a special agent, Channing Tatum is the one man army in 'White House Down' who defends the US president from bad guys to take him as a hostage.Yes the story was simple as that. I felt Channing Tatum still not capable of handling whole movie by himself. Without Jamie Foxx the movie would have been a tragedy, he controlled the movie in many parts, the saviour. Individually everyone performed very well, especially Joey King was proficient at her acting. I liked her in 'Ramona and Beezus', now I think this movie will give her a breakthrough to gain more roles to her in near future.I loved many movies from this director but not this, at least not as much. Since 20 years, the first time he gave a movie which is just an average. Hope 'ID Forever' series will be much better than this. It is a another movie in the list of movies like 'Die Hard' and 'Air Force One'. It was not too bad as well not too good but okay as a decent entertainer. I guess the audience blaming it because of similarities between this and other movies.

He has to try and save his daughter and at the same time protect the president from the invaders.I have to admit that I had high expectations for this movie because of the cast and also because of the plot but I was let down by it. I didn't like the silly jokes of Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx during the movie because this movie it is supposed to be an action, thriller and drama movie, not a comedy. If I wanted to watch a comedy I would choose to watch a comedy movie, not an action one. The direction which was made by Roland Emmerich was poor with not any imagination or something different except the silly jokes as I mentioned previously. The only interpretations that I liked from this movie were Jason Clarke's who played as Stenz and Richard Jenkins who played as Raphelson.Lastly, I have to say that ""White House Down"" is a below average movie with not a boring plot but not an interesting one. If you are a fan of action movies and you have already watched movies like ""Olympus Has Fallen"" with more or less the same plot then you can just ignore this movie and even pretend that never existed.

46,eddie_baggins,A generic snoozefest of an action movie,3,21 January 2014,"Taking his obsession with destroying America's capital by any means necessary to all new levels, director Roland Emmerich forgets to bring any inventiveness to the party in this bland beyond belief action flick and in a year in which cousin Olympus Has Fallen has pretty much done the same thing, White House Down seems even more dour than it perhaps is.Getting a whopping $150 million budget to blow things up with and a getting a cast with usually charismatic presences has not stopped Emmerich from directing this action flick in such a boring way that the 2 hour run time is played out at a not far from tortuous pace with the opening 30 minutes and a middle section where Foxx and Tatum seem to spend a worrying amount of time in an elevator shaft particularly unwarranted. It's strange that a man famed for creating spectacle over substance has more success with the dialog than the action, with no set piece making any type of lasting impression here where even his lesser films like Day After Tomorrow and the craptacular Godzilla had enough memorable stand alone scenes. If only the action was up to scratch some of the films better elements could of carried it to seriously good popcorn entertainment territory.A major plus for the film is in it's main villains who unlike almost every similar film choose not to have them be from some Middle Eastern, Russian, Asian or Africian background giving the film a slightly fresher vibe on that front. A front in which it fails in (like it's action) is in it's main cast with Tatum delivering a cold performance as hero Cale, Foxx seeming miss cast as President Sawyer and Joey King on increasingly annoying form as child wonder-kid Emily but at least James Woods can hold his head high in a now rare big screen performance.It's not hard to see why White House Down was a major flop for Unniversal and in comparing it to Olympus Has Fallen it must be said that they are both pretty much as bad as each other with bland action and blank performances prevalent in both.

Some of it is pretty corny but it doesn't spoil the movie. It was a bit weird to see Jamie Foxx playing the president and the twist at the end was good. Tatum wasn't bad but he could have added some wit to the movie, like Bruce Willis did in Die Hard. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but that was the longest 8 minutes that I have ever seen. You can really see were the big budget went, with all of the explosions action which was pretty unbelievable in parts. It makes me laugh how many times Tatum & Foxx gets shot at without getting touched. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch with a box of popcorn and loads of sweets. Watchable!Round-Up: If you would have asked me ages ago if Chaning Tatum was going to become anything in Hollywood, I would have laughed at you, but he actually isn't bad in this movie. He still needs to loosen up a bit to bring some reality to his characters, but he is getting much better. You can tell throughout the movie that Jamie Foxx is really holding back and that he is just doing what the director is telling him. This isn't a typical Foxx performance because he is playing a president, but the movie could have done with something original here and there. James Wood was great as the baddie and he really brought the intensity to the movie. It is a lot like Olympus Has Fallen but with more of a political element.Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $205millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there intense action/thriller/drama movie about the White House getting taken over by baddies. 6/10",White House Down
48,TheMovieDiorama,White House Down plays out more like a teen interpretation of 'Olympus Has Fallen'.,4,8 June 2018,"You get yourself a hot young lead actor, a musician turned Oscar winner, a director who essentially ejaculates shoddy visual effects that reek of mediocrity and top it off with a story that feels reminiscent to 'Die Hard'...however feels more like 'Die Soft'. Put them all together and you get White House Down, a film so unnecessary and unfortunate with the timing of its release (the same year as 'Olympus Has Fallen') that you start to question its existence. The White House is under attack, the president and government officials are held hostage as terrorists cause havoc and seek demands. John McClane was busy in Moscow, so they got Channing Tatum instead...honestly, I've already forgotten his character's name. Right, so here's the problem. There are unrealistic films that are fun, and then there are fun films that are unrealistic. This falls into the former category. Why? Well alright, here we go! One scene in particular: the president and a ""secret service agent"" are driving around the front lawn in an armoured limousine being chased down by three SUVs with machine guns, rocket launchers and assault rifles. The president, and I kid you not, gets a rocket launcher as he peers out of the passenger window and fires it. Seriously? Could you imagine Trump doing that? Sweet lord his hair would be all over the place. To conclude, this film is a visual effects mess weighed down by a ""comedic"" screenplay that hosts an uninspired plot and derivative action. Foxx and Tatum have good chemistry sure, and Clarke still remains decent (although always chooses poor films). And yes, you could say some parts are enjoyable. But Emmerich is so stuck in the past, that the film immediately feels outdated. It's not 1996 anymore, come on! His excessive patriotism is just too much for me. Don't even get me started on the comedic relief that constantly missed, much like the mercenaries who can't fire their weapons for toffee!

49,l_rawjalaurence,Wish-Fulfilling Thriller That Makes Some Telling Points,6,11 October 2014,"It would be easy to dismiss WHITE HOUSE DOWN as another wish- fulfilling thriller in which an apparently indestructible hero John Cale (Channing Tatum) takes on a group of insurrectionists who take over the Capitol Building and the White House and outmaneuvers them all. Despite many gun-battles, no one can apparently hit him; on the other hand, he is such a crack shot that he mows down his enemies at will.On the other hand, Roland Emmerich's action-packed film makes some important points about contemporary politics. It shows the rivalry at the heart of government, where the cabinet apparently supports President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx), yet schemes behind his back to frustrate his desires for peace in the Middle East. The about-to- retire head of the Secret Service Walker (James Woods) is particularly resentful of the President's apparently liberal stance, which provokes him to take matters into his own hands, even if he risks committing treason by doing so. Vice President Hammond (Michael Murphy) proves equally treacherous; it seems that personal ambition transcends his responsibility to the nation.WHITE HOUSE DOWN takes a skeptical attitude towards capitalism and its consequences. It seems that financial gain transcends everything in some politicians' minds, even if it means the potential destruction of large parts of the globe. President Sawyer embraces a refreshingly liberal approach towards his job; but Emmerich suggests that his task is often a lonely one, often without the support of any of his so-called Cabinet 'colleagues.'Perhaps contemporary politics has rendered the film's liberal message rather obsolete: the vision of peace involving Russia and most territories within the Middle East seems a bit remote in light of Russia's policies in Ukraine as well as ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.

Thus, the subsequent events have thrilling and entertaining value only, together with profound lessons on the White House's history... There are decent chases, shootings and explosions, mandatory witty/funny lines by some characters, pondering about guilt and remorse, and typical Hollywood syrupy ending.As for the cast, names like Channing Tatum, Jamie Foxx, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Richard Jenkins, James Woods are at least guarantees of non-flop. On the other hand, some of them have played double-dealing characters so often that you start to suspect similar things over and over... And doubts may come true :) And Tatum is more versatile actor than Gerald Butler from Olympus, but the latter was more credible as a tough guy capable of saving the world.All in all: not bad, but no masterpiece, and very typical Roland Emmerich.

One the day of his interview the President announces a peace plan to withdraw all American troops from the Middle East, much to the annoyance of the industrial-military complex.Cale is unsuccessful at getting the job but when terrorists and mercenaries take over the White House and the head of the President's detail, Martin Walker (James Woods) betrays the President, Cale ends up being the only man to stop the terrorists, save the president, hostages and most important of all, his own daughter.White House Down is as stupid as I expected, it is too long (like most of Roland Emmerich's films) and its plot falls apart if you think about. But it is enjoyable enough because of its stupidity. It is a clichéd piece, with plot points and who the main bad guy really is. Hell, some of the film's ideas and the structure of the day makes White House Down look like 24: the Movie. Even elements of the story where taken from the fourth season of 24.Emmerich is an accomplished action director and the action is strong in White House Down. The shoot outs were well handled and the fist fights between Tatum and Jason Clarke were very entertaining and well shot. The action was a little hamstrung because of the PG-13 rating, especially considering White House Down has a very 90s vive to it (a part of the ending is lifted from The Rock). When the action starts it is non-stop should please action fans and White House Down at least has the good grace to not take itself too seriously, such as having the President using a rocket-launder and a tour guide ending up becoming a hero.The other strong element is the cast. As well as the already mentioned Tatum and Foxx, we get the likes of Jason Clarke, Richard Jenkins, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Joey King and James Woods. Tatum certainly has the physique and channels his inner John McClane and worked well with Fox. Clarke too was awesome as the main henchman, also having physical presence and very believable as a vengeful special forces soldier turned mercenary: he should be considered for being the next Bond villain. But whilst King is a good child actor her character felt it was written to be older, she was an 11-year-old who speaks like an 18-year-old, a child who is obsessed with politics and seems to handle the violence in-front of her very well.For a Roland Emmerich film the CGI is disappointing: it simply looked too digital, too fake. It is really a shame because Emmerich's films in the past have had excellent special effects. The music score from Harald Kloser and Thomas W@nker (most embarrassing name ever) borrowed many beats from Michael Bay's Transformers films and the horns of Inception.White House Down is a film that is reminiscence of films of the late 80s and 90s, with it following the likes of Die Hard, Air Force One and The Rock as well as being like 24.White House Down is a light hearted, tongue-in-cheek affair that does not take itself too seriously. It is overlong, overloaded and the story does not hold up if you give it too much thought. But it is an entertaining enough actioner that I picture people enjoying if watching it a friends and a couple of beers.6.5/10",White House Down

Richard plays the Speaker of the House and James plays the head of the Secret Service, who just happens to be retiring in a matter of days-Hmmm, I wonder if there will be a job opening anytime soon?

In the former flick, aliens invade all across the world (as if!), and the sitting U.S. President is involved in shootouts raging through underground bunkers in Roswell, NM, before flying a combat mission of doubtful outcome against moon-sized alien aircraft. WHITE HOUSE DOWN makes that story seem like a boring article in the morning snooze-paper. In the first few minutes of the latter film, the White House janitorial crew guns down approximately 48 Capitol policemen, U.S. Secret Service Agents, and rooftop snipers WITHOUT A SINGLE SHOT BEING FIRED AT THE BAD GUYS! Apparently Mr. Emmerich does not realize (and may not care) that this country is filled with crazed John Hinkley's just waiting for one more teeny tiny nudge to push them over the line into pure insanity, trying to be the next Joker to attack a ""soft"" target, such as a multiplex movie theater. It is downright treason for Mr. Emmerich to imply to all these loser terrorists Homeland Security constantly is entrapping that one of our iconic national treasures is such child's play to overrun!",White House Down
54,alindsay-al,an attempt at a smart film just turns out be a generic story,4,9 June 2014,"This film is possibly as generic as it can get which is funny because even though I have only seen this film I hear the premise is almost identical to Olympus has Fallen which I have not seen. This shows people running out of ideas for movies. This film starts off with our likable protagonist played by Channing Tatum being denied his dream job while taking his daughter on a tour of the White House when the White House is attacked and he is the only one who can save the president, his daughter and stop World War 3. Now is it just me or did that premise just sound as generic as possible and that is one of the worst parts of the film with the fact everybody has seen films like this before and this film doesn't really do anything to surprise you throughout the two hours of this film. Also this film doesn't seem to know what type of film it wants to be as there are parts where the father/son storyline is so dull and boring in this action film where it is so unrealistic so I am not sure what to think of where this film wanted to go. The script isn't special but for a film like this it seemed not to be the point and this is also showed by the villains truly being cartoons and ridiculously over the top just like the film. The main positive of this film is Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx's chemistry throughout and it just seems really natural and carries all the good points of the film. Tatum is a serviceable lead but Foxx as the president is the best character of the film and is the coolest character in the film. Also the style of the action in this film is fitting for it and adds to this unrealistic action film. This film can be entertaining but is just generic and it really doesn't show the audience anything new.",White House Down
55,estebangonzalez10,White House Down is enjoyable if taken lightly,6,8 September 2013,"""My father is a very special man.""White House Down might suffer from a terrible plot and loud action scenes we've seen a million times before, but the leads have such great chemistry together that this movie was actually entertaining. I'm giving Roland Emmerich a passing grade for the first time since his 2000 film The Patriot. I've disliked pretty much every film he's made since (2012, The Day After Tomorrow, and 10,000 BC), but for the first time Emmerich barely redeems himself thanks to strong performances from Foxx and Tatum. This is the second film coming out this year about the White House being under siege where the president is taken hostage and one man has to save the day. Olympus Has Fallen starred Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart. The action sequences in that film might have been a little better than White House Down, but I didn't like that movie because it took itself too seriously despite the ridiculous plot. What Emmerich has going for him here is that he knows the film is silly and that everything is pretty much formulaic, but he has fun with the story. He lets these two lead roles play with clichés and simply entertain the audience with their over the top performances. In a way this film felt a lot like Independence Day and those 90 films I enjoyed so much. It's not a Die Hard film, but it does pretty much live up to films like Air Force One and has a little more fun with the familiar story. We know pretty much everything that's going to happen in this film; it is very predictable, but somehow it manages to have fun with everything and never tries to takes itself seriously. Tatum has such great comedic timing that he really steals the show here. This is a summer popcorn film that is loaded with entertaining and funny scenes, but has very little depth to it. Unfortunately the film is way too long and has a preposterous final act. Despite it all, I still enjoyed White House Down and had a decent time.Former military, John Cale (Channing Tatum), works as a Capitol policeman but thanks to a contact he gets a job interview with the Secret Service for the President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). He doesn't get the job, but he takes advantage of his interview to take his young daughter Emily (Joey King) on a tour through the White House. She is a huge admirer of the President and is having her dream day, but all of a sudden the place is attacked by a group of heavily armed paramilitary men who take everyone hostage. The head of the president's security, Walker (James Wood), is behind the attack. John prevents Walker from taking him hostage and hides out with the President inside while finding a way to escape and at the same time rescue his daughter from the dangerous paramilitary group led by Stenz (Jason Clarke). Cale gets through with the Pentagon from the inside and is permanently in communication with Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who tries to guide him and the President to safety. Cale and the President will have to team up in order to disrupt Walker's destructive plan. Among the talented cast we have supporting works from Richard Jenkins, Nicolas Wright, and Peter Jacobson.I don't blame those who didn't like White House Down because I can see why they hated it. The premise is really silly and the movie is way too long with a very ridiculous final act. I enjoyed the film mostly because the actors seemed to be taking their roles very lightly and having fun with the material given. Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx worked extremely well together and shared some very funny scenes. Their chemistry is what made this film worthwhile for me. The film isn't as good as Die Hard, but I thought it took a similar approach and that is what worked for Emmerich this time. Tatum is a bankable actor and has been on a role lately (21 Jump Street and Magic Mike). The film is worth watching for this alone, just don't go into this film expecting an intelligent action film.",White House Down
56,mattkratz,good action movie,8,21 January 2014,"This was one of two movies released at the same time (with Olympus Has Fallen)about the White House being taken over, and I'd rank both movies about the same. While this has nothing new to offer, this was a good action movie. Channing Tatum goes to the White House for two things:a tour with his daughter and a job interview for his dream job as a Secret Service Agent. When he doesn't get the job because the interviewer knows he can't finish anything, he winds up on a bit of an ""internship"" when the House gets taken over by terrorists (including his daughter getting held hostage, and she winds up a hero!), and he winds up having to defend the president.Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx (as the President) make a good action team, as there are plenty of good action sequences and lots of great (humorous) dialogue. The cast was great too. This was not a bad way to spend watching a movie!",White House Down
57,jimbo-53-186511,"Requires the viewer to suspend a lot of disbelief, but on the flip side it is thrilling and exciting and basically does exactly what it says on the tin",6,22 February 2015,"Channing Tatum plays John Cale a Capitol policeman who attends an interview at the White House in the hope of joining the Secret Service. In an attempt to patch up the rather rocky relationship with his daughter Emily (Joey King) he invites her to the White House with him (as this is something that she has a keen interest in). After the interview, Cale goes on a tour of the White House with his daughter, but shortly after the tour begins a group of para military terrorists plant a bomb in the White House and take several hostages (including Cale's daughter Emily). Cale is now called in to action when he finds that he not only has to try and protect the president (played by Jamie Foxx), but he must also try to rescue his daughter from the kidnappers as well.This is effectively Die Hard in the White House so it's not going to win any prizes for originality. However, if you're prepared to overlook this aspect and just sit back and watch the spectacle unfold then it really is quite fun and entertaining. Had this been the only real issue then I probably would have rated it a little higher, but there are problems within the plot/narrative that for me were difficult to overlook. Here are a few examples;It may just have been me but I found the whole 'breaching of the White House' to be a bit preposterous. Our team of para-military mercenaries get into the White House and start unleashing hell complete with assault rifles, hand guns and machine guns. Quite how they managed to get all that weaponry into the White House without being detected is a bit of a mystery. Even if you factor in that it was clearly easier for Walker to get them into the White House, I still found it hard to believe that they wouldn't have been searched prior to going in. I understand that Walker wanted to kill the President for sending his son to war in a conflict that he believed should never have happened, but then we learn that the second part of his revenge is to kill everyone in Iran? Yes it would stop another war between the two countries, but why kill several innocent people in Iran? The issues were between the two governments, so if he did want to target Iran why not target a government building? In the real world Woods could have just kidnapped the President and forced him to declare peace with Iran and get the para-military to get to his family and use them as leverage in order to make sure that he complies. Quite simple really, but I suppose the film would have been a lot less fun if logic had been applied.Despite some of the problems with both plotting and narrative, I did enjoy this film because it basically has no pretensions - it's a film that provides plenty of thrills, excitement, tension and explosions. Tatum makes for a likable lead (complete with his John McClane white vest) and I did find that I was cheering him on. Woods also makes for an effective villain and I also thought Joey King who paid Tatum's daughter did a pretty good job considering her age.If you're prepared to suspend your disbelief and just go with the flow then there is plenty to enjoy here. Let's face it, it's No Die Hard, but it isn't half bad either.",White House Down

In a very Die Hard scenario sort of way 'Cale' must now fight to protect the president, find his daughter, figure out who the bad guys are, stop nuclear weapons from bring launched and drive in circles around the white house lawn while firing a rocket launcher.This is an over the top action extravaganza that for me quickly crossed over into the so-bad-it's-good department. If you just go along for the ride its a ton of fun watching the White House get destroyed and Channing kick butt trying to protect goofy president Jamie Foxx. Some twists along the way and a decent supporting cast with Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods, Richard Jenkins and Jason Clarke as the bad guy.A lighter version of Olympus Has Fallen.",White House Down

However, my curiosity to compare these two similarly-themed films got the better of me, so on this Fourth of July (coincidentally), I went and checked it out. And what do you know, I was actually more entertained by this one.""White House Down"" is about a day when a group of disgruntled ex- servicemen with big grudges against the government attacks the White House, aiming to capture the peace-loving President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) alive in order to launch nuclear attacks to various targets all over the world. Of course, it just so happened that Afghanistan veteran John Cale (Channing Tatum) was in the White House that very day with his precocious political video blogger daughter Emily (Joey King), joining a White House tour. He was the one variable the bad guys did not count on when planning their violent takeover.Initially I thought that the choice of Jamie Foxx as the President of the USA was all wrong, given his background in low-brow comedy. While watching though, Foxx and his great comedic timing is the ingredient that makes this film work so well. Channing Tatum continues his streak of high profile roles, and he does a good Bruce Willis impression in this one. The chemistry between these two guys kept the action going and the audience rooting for them, despite some pretty preposterous situations they got themselves into.As for the veteran supporting cast, Maggie Gyllenhaal does well as a dedicated Secret Service Agent, as do James Woods as the Head of the Secret Service and Richard Jenkins as the Speaker of the House. But Joey King makes a positive impression as Emily Cale, John's gutsy pre- teen daughter. She has a vibrant and expressive face that hopefully graces more film in the future.Director Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" ""2012"") does what he does best, delivering an explosive and exciting film that audiences will enjoy watching. The exposition at the beginning took its time, at times even looking like a White House tour video. But when the action started, it never let up. Certain plot details might be illogical, shallow or even cheesy, but this does not purport itself to be a serious film. It has an undeniable sense of humor that ""Olympus Has Fallen"" does not, making this the more entertaining film of the two. You will definitely have more of a good time watching ""White House Down.""",White House Down

John Cale (Channing Tatum) goes to the White House for a job interview with his daughter Emily (Joey King) when all hell breaks loose.I thought ""here we go again."" Seems Hollywood people relish doing bad things to the White House as we saw in OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN, but this movie is far superior.It has an all star supporting cast: Maggie Gyllenhaal as Special Agent Finnerty; James Woods as Walker the head of the Secret Service; Jason Clarke as Stenz the leader of the insurgents; and Lance Riddick as General Caulfield. It also has more story development with a twist at the end. What else? Well, the CGI is unbelievably good and sometimes you feel the action it provides is real and you find yourself ducking from time to time. The pacing is fast, but not too fast where you get lost in the proceedings – it is just right. Yes, some dialogues seem a bit corny, but with the seriousness of what is happening you pay them no mind. The banter between John Cale and President Sawyer is good, maybe a little too casual, at times, but again you pay it no mind due to the seriousness of the situation. As the White House is being destroyed you mentally tell yourself that rebuilding it will take years but you also keep telling yourself: it's only a movie; it's only a movieThoroughly enjoyable.

There were some unrealistic shooting and action scenes. I liked very much the many funny jokes placed in the dramatic situations. This is perhaps one reason why this movie got so high attention at the box offices. The special effects were average and didn't influence the story. It develops a fast pace countdown with high suspense until the end. James Woods delivered a great performance who gave the face to this film. Channing Tatum played like the new Rambo of tomorrow and Jamie Foxx was really a cool and sensible president. Last but not least director Roland Emmerich created again successfully a complete worst case of terror attack at the White House. 8/10.If you like this genre don't miss Air Force One, Independence Day or Flight Plan.",White House Down
65,denis888,"Very Much 50/50, Not Awful, Not Awesome Either",5,8 February 2017,"Roland Emmerich is such an uneven filmmaker, he can create a true masterpiece as Day After Tomorrow, where all the elements go together flawlessly and impeccably, and then he can do such a mess as 2012 with all its hilarious idiocy or sequel to Independence Day which is another shameful abomination of all worst clichés possible. So, here, Emmerich is very uneven, too. His take on White House terrorist attack is of very resemblance to Olympus Falling with Gerard Butler in main part. That makes this film a point of harsh critique and often rightly so, as yeah, there are some obvious repeated clichés and trite formula steps. At the same time, the stellar cast of actors here make a good job, and what can one possibly say bad about such luminaries as Jamie Foxx, James Woods, Channing Tatum, Maggie Gyllenhaal, among many, and they do their parts well, very well. The video effects are nice, too, and generally 2 hours fly very fast and the fast pace of the events adds to the neatly calculated suspense.

After an interview, he takes his daughter on a tour around the White House. Their tour is interrupted when the White House is suddenly by a group of terrorists who take everyone hostage including the president (Jamie Foxx) and Cale's daughter.

Big, loud, brash and completely ludicrous, WHD proudly wears its silliness like a badge of honour and as a result is unashamedly fun. At this point in his career Roland Emmerich can deliver entertaining carnage as easily as Hitchcock could produce thrills and chills, and so we are treated to a plethora of exhilarating, bonkers set pieces that are heavy on CGI, light on logic and cover everything from fisticuffs, gun battles, car chases, explosions, toppling buildings and assault helicopters flying through the streets of Washington DC. The other ace up Emmerich's sleeve is his cast; from younger stars Channing Tatum, Jamie Foxx and Maggie Gyllenhaal to veteran thespians James Woods and Richard Jenkins, everybody is having a blast earning this paycheque and their energy alleviates some of the clunkier moments in the script (ie, the entire script). Tatum and Foxx in particular forge a likable partnership as the reluctant hero and the Obama-esque President respectively, their odd-couple pairing resulting in a string of gags which hit the spot more often than not.

71,brchthethird,Better than OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN,7,14 November 2014,"Despite having the same premise as OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN, which edged it out into theaters by a few months, WHITE HOUSE DOWN is actually the better film. While OLYMPUS reveled in 80's action clichés with jingoistic fervor and took itself way too seriously, WHITE HOUSE DOWN manages to have a sense of humor about it and also treats the subject with more currency. The faults of the movies are largely shared, with an overblown, ridiculous plot being the largest offender. Where WHITE HOUSE DOWN shines, though, is the great chemistry and banter between Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx. On the flip side, I thought that way too much attention was paid to the villains and too much screen time was allotted to giving the audience a reason to care about them, as opposed to the protagonists, which were let down by the script. Ultimately, there was way too much going on behind the scenes, when the story could have stuck to being a movie about a dad trying to save his daughter, which is what is at the core of the narrative. Of course, you can blame Roland Emmerich for that. Most of his movies are cheesy, bombastic explosion/disaster-fests, and this is no different. However, after blowing up the White House in INDEPENDENCE DAY, and destroying the world in 2012, this comes off as a little underwhelming. However, despite the narrative clichés and overblown, convoluted story, there is a surprising amount of heart which distinguishes it from OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN. I feel, had this one come out first, it would have been the bigger hit. As it stands, though, it didn't and generally audiences had a lower tolerance for what they probably considered to be a carbon copy of something that came out earlier that year. So if you haven't seen either one of these, WHITE HOUSE DOWN is the better film by a small, but significant, margin.",White House Down

An unidentified group detonates a bomb in the U.S. Capitol Building, then takes hostages in the White House and shoots up the historic mansion, destroying priceless artifacts and paintings to the chagrin of a tour guide. Audiences know what they want from a Roland Emmerich movie, and ""White House Down"" delivers the goods; rapid cutting, action, explosions, gun battles, cheering onlookers, wise-ass heroes and bad-ass villains.Clichés abound; from a troubled father-daughter relationship to an expository job interview that details the hero's past and a White House tour that fills in the history of the presidential mansion, the plot inches forward until the explosions literally begin. However, logic and plausibility also evaporate as the pace accelerates. While metal detectors screen visitors, the terrorists have an arsenal of automatic weapons already in the White House. While bullets fly and White House staff and visitors cower and flee, a young girl records everything on video for her on-line blog. Preposterous would come to mind, if the action allowed viewers to pause and think for a moment.The cast of professionals is capable for this type of film. Headed by Channing Tatum, who sports a fetching sleeveless tunic to highlight his biceps, is the negligent father, caught in the dire White House situation with his blogger daughter. Jamie Foxx is fine as the President, while Maggie Gyllenhaal and Richard Jenkins both try to rise above the trite material, which was written by James Vanderbilt. Always fun to watch, James Woods manages to chew on the government-issue scenery in a showy role. The current resident of the White House, who claims ignorance of the 25th Amendment, should catch this film as that amendment is cited several times.Audiences for a Roland Emmerich movie know what they want, and ""White House Down"" will deliver the goods for them. However, after two hours plus of mindless action, plot holes big enough to swallow a tank or a helicopter, and casual dialog between elected officials that propels the world towards Armageddon, some viewers may long for a slower paced film with a literate script and a plot based on logic.

73,jon.h.ochiai,"""White House Down"" is Really Great Fun",9,6 July 2013,"Channing Tatum rocks ""White House Down"". Director Roland Emmerich's ""White House Down"" is awesome fun-- suspend your disbelief. Emmerich again wreaks havoc upon the White House in visually explosive fashion. Tatum is the new generation action hero—driven by family, lean and chiseled, and refreshingly breezy and humble. While moving President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) to safety and attempting to rescue his daughter Emily (Joey King), Tatum's John Cale asks the President if he can call in SEAL Team 6 to save the day. On the White House roof John uses his brutal mixed martial arts skills to take out vicious terrorists. He is not so much a smart ass, but is smart and can kick some ass—old school.Until ""White House Down"", I didn't know that The President of the United States' hash-tag is POTUS. Writer James Vanderbilt also schools us on the Executive Chain of Command—that stuff does have an app. Vanderbilt's story is adrenaline chaos, surprisingly woven with themes of family and redemption. The natural chemistry of Tatum and Foxx frames the movie which exhausts in the escalating over the top action. Heavy artillery car chases on the White House lawn may be a first. Acknowledge Vanderbilt and Emmerich for camouflaging a couple narrative twists. The supporting cast is amazing: Maggie Gyllenhaal, Richard Jenkins, and the powerful James Woods. Joey King as Emily, John's estranged daughter is amazing, and such a scene bandit. Fortunately, Tatum's understated star presence creates the authentic partnership with King, the emotional anchor of the movie.Visually, ""White House Down"" is breathtaking. The crystal clear panoramic aerial attacks from Apache helicopters and F-20 jets over the D.C. monument-scape are stunning. I think the quiet moments resonate most as Tatum and Foxx talk man to man. Cale says of his daughter Emily, ""I'm not her hero."" Sawyer confesses that he has become a politician—not what he intended. Sawyer says, ""I want to make a difference."" The two are also hilarious in armored limo chase, as Cale screams,"" How do you lose a rocket launcher?"" ""White House Down"" is a guilty pleasure of extremes.President Sawyer (Foxx) potentially jeopardizes a second term with his Middle East Peace Bill. Rival House Speaker Ralpelson (reliably solid Richard Jenkins) is the influencing vote. He lost to Sawyer in the election. John Cale (Tatum) is on Raphelson's security detail. John is the Silver Star Medal recipient who served 3 tours in Afghanistan—the reason he got his job. John gets an interview with the Secret Service at the White House, and swings White House Tour for his daughter Emily (King), a President Fangirl with her own YouTube Channel, ""not blog"". Strong and weary Maggie Gyllenhaal is Agent Finnerty, who interviews John, predictably they have a history. Finnerty's boss is soon to be retired Walker (James Woods). Walker still grieves the death of his son, killed in a mission in Iraq directed by the President. Woods is striking as the loyal good man, suffering the weight of the world.The White House comes under terrorist siege. However, these dudes don't look like Al-Qaeda. The attack is lead by heartless Stenz (seething Jason Clarke) and genius hacker Tyler (arrogant nerdy Jimmi Simpson). Emily is taken hostage as well, while Stenz and his men hunt down the President. Reluctant hero Cale is summoned to action. All is not what it seems—that goes for motives and villains. Sure John must protect the President. Saving his daughter resonates amidst the deafening firepower. John tells Finnerty, ""That little girl is counting on me right now, and I am not going to disappear on her!"" Tatum made WHD before he became a father himself. He is going o be a great Dad. He embodies a tangible gentleness to his hero, a man of his word and a man of profound action. The buddy part of the movie clicks with the stellar performance by Jamie Foxx. He is surprisingly restrained, and refrains from Obama-light impersonation. He balances funny and gravitas. The genuine relationship of Foxx and Tatum transcends the storyline. Yes, ""White House Down"" is preposterous and a little long. Besides that it is just great fun to watch.",White House Down

Perhaps it should have been a comedy.The best reason to see this in a theater is to beat the summer heat.,White House Down

I'm not going to totally dismiss this box office dud as ""bad,"" because I find it quite engaging. There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice.

Not the best film for Maggie Ghyllenhall, whose character really doesn't fit, but with James Woods-as mesmerising as always, Jamie Foxx - the President (who doesn't mind getting hurt) and Channing Tatum as the reject (watch the film) who holds everything together to save more than just the USA. Great stuff, which is good entertainment (except for the very young) and well worth catching unless you own your own copy. The other film like this is more hard hitting. Personally, as a preference I prefer this one due to the lower use of foul language and this plot is end to end stuff that keeps you watching....theres a tribute to 1 or 2 films contained within the moving but Tatum makes for a really good ""step up hero"" when needed, unlike Ghyllenhalls weak white house staff member",White House Down
79,Likes_Ninjas90,An appallingly sentimental Die Hard knock-off,1,4 September 2013,"White House Down is an appallingly sentimental Die Hard knock-off that would have John McClane scoffing at its weak action sequences and undying love for its commander-in-chief. Evidently, the US public was not feeling the same love during the American summer. White House Down was a box office dud that failed to break even on its $150 million dollar budget. Earlier this year, the soul crushingly bad Olympus Has Fallen was released, which was also a film about the White House being under attack by Asian terrorists. It proved to be an undeservingly huge box office ticket and showed that Americans aren't tired of flag-waving or witch hunts for the good of national security.The star and producer of White House Down is Channing Tatum, who recently attracted great box office numbers with Magic Mike, so he isn't to blame either. Did people avoid the film because it reminds them of Obama's waning popularity? Olympus had a clean-cut white President. To appear modern and politically correct, White House Down casts Jamie Foxx as the President. Given recent developments in Syria it's difficult not to wince in disbelief when hearing how liberal and progressive the policies of his character are, including a bid to remove all American troops from the Middle East and how the pen is mightier than the sword. Furthermore, the film could also have failed because audiences know how to sniff out a bad imitation of Die Hard. Very few action films understand why that first movie was such a success. Die Hard's greatest asset was its airtight setup and exposition, establishing McClane as a believable, ordinary cop with an edgy personality and failing marriage. The humanity filtered into the action sequences so audiences felt the rough and tumble and the bruises. The physicality in the stunts and Bruce Willis' iconic performance is what makes Die Hard one of the finest action films ever made and why it has rarely been equalled. The setup here is long and embarrassingly cliché. Cale (Tatum) is a police offer who escorts a politician Eli Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) to work. Cale is also the father of Emily (Joey King) who he doesn't spend enough time with. To make up for missing her show, he arranges for himself and Emily to take a long tour of the White House where they meet President Sawyer (Foxx). Cale also has a job interview with Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) for a position with the Secret Service. She already knows him from college and doubts his ability, despite the fact he had three tours of Afghanistan as a soldier. When a bomb is detonated in the Capitol Building the White House is evacuated and Cale and Emily are separated. Walker (James Woods), a politician on his last day, has joined forces with a military type named Stenz (Jason Clarke) to try and kidnap the President. Cale and Sawyer team up to take down these terrorist thugs and rescue Emily. The director was Roland Emmerich who specialises in large scale end of the world films (The Day After Tomorrow). This is his second effort to destroy the White House following Independence Day. The only bright spot that Emmerich brings to the tired, derivative material is that it isn't racist like Olympus nor is it as self-serious. One of the lighter moments is when a wimpy tour guide finally arms himself with a shotgun. In spite of its occasionally jokey tone, the film is still a boring cocktail of aimless shootouts and male brutes wrestling with each other. It even resorts to the good old red countdown timer. If that doesn't drain every ounce of sincerity from the father and daughter schmaltz, wait till you see a laughable end scene that bring new meaning to flag- waving. The action scenes are disappointing and lack Die Hard's physical heft. Tatum is too clean in the role. He doesn't have the grit of Bruce Willis so the fights aren't particularly convincing, nor does he have the actor's hilarious tongue in cheek snark either. Action films don't have to be deep but they need to be punchy. The plot is bloated by setpieces but also over-stacked with too many side characters, including a computer hack I'm sure is meant to be Julian Assange. The pace grows sluggish, running out of gas well before the end, and Emmerich does a terrible job keeping the traitors a secret thanks to glaring close-ups and intrusive music cues. That's presumably why the film really failed: we're tired of this setup because we know how it begins and ends. Why would you pay to watch something you've already seen and done better?",White House Down
80,Christian_Dimartino,Olympus Has Died Hard.,6,20 July 2013,"I am really starting to wonder if Roland Emmerich is a terrorist. Emmerich, who is the king daddy of terribly enjoyable movies, seems to destroy the world with nearly every one of his films. Lets just think about what he's done to the planet so far. Aliens destroyed in Independence Day; Godzilla destroyed in... well, Godzilla; a huge wave destroyed in The Day After Tomorrow, and nearly everything destroyed in 2012. Now, he has directed a way to kill the president, in White House Down.White House Down is an absurd thriller from a wizard of absurd thrillers. Nobody knows how to blow stuff up better than Emmerich, and here he does it so effortlessly. WHD is a dumb movie, but it is an entertaining one, and sometimes that's all that really matters in a summer.Channing Tatum, who is practically taking over the world himself, plays John Cale, a man who desperately wants to work for the secret service. He soon gets his chance, and then some, when the white house comes under attack. Basically, Cale and the president (Jamie Foxx) play a game of cat-and-mouse with a terrorist group (led by Jason Clarke) hellbent on taking the president down.WHD is the spawn of Die Hard and this year's Olympus Has Fallen. It lacks creativity, it is predictable, it is cliché, it is noisy, it is stupid. But the actors are all likable here. They all seem to be having a good time here. Also, it's fast-paced and intense. This is far from the best movie of the summer, but it sure isn't the worst. Here is a movie that knows its audience and what it's trying to be, and proud of it. B-",White House Down

White House Down was made purely for entertainment value and that's what it delivers. If you don't overanalyse it or attempt to tear it apart with pompous intellectual put downs then you will be able to enjoy a good movie. Bonus, it's not only action but has a slight comical side too.It may not be witty or unique but it has a really solid talented cast that does a great job.

82,griffolyon12,Check Your Mind at the Door and Eat That Popcorn,8,27 June 2013,"White House Down is what Summer movies are all about -- fun. Does it feature the greatest script ever written? Not in the slightest, but it has so much over-the-top action and ridiculously awesome one-liners, how can you really complain? Channing Tatum plays John Cale, a man interviewing for a job with the secret service just as bad guys take over the White House. Coincidence? I think not. After all, the script said so. What follows is a buddy cop movie between a wanna be-secret service agent and the President of the United States, played by Jamie Foxx.To cut to the chase, White House Down is not the next Die Hard, it's not going to be a classic of cinema fifty years from now, but it does exactly what it intends to do, which is entertain. White House Down is just fun, you like the heroes, you hate the bad guys, and you're laughing at one liners whilst biting your nails all the way to the finale. It's the kind of movie that I would gladly watch again and again, the same way I keep eating that bad-for-you popcorn whilst watching. It satisfies that cinematic desire that only a movie like this can, and when it's clear that everyone in the cast was having this much fun while making it, it's infectious. Everyone from Tatum to James Woods, to nearly every character actor in Hollywood, they all were seemingly having a blast doing this movie and I had a blast watching them. Sure, it's got plot holes, and the first act takes a bit too long to get to the action, but these are things that can be easily overlooked if you just know how to actually have fun.I give White House Down an 8 out of 10!",White House Down
83,billygoat1071,'Murican Madness,8,5 July 2013,"White House Down is basically a remake of Olympus Has Fallen which was already a remake of Die Hard. Taking the footsteps of the source inspiration, this one finally embraces the fact how preposterous the ""White House being taken over by terrorists"" premise sounds. It never takes it too seriously, and instead of patriotism schmaltz, we get ludicrous sequences where the heroes and the government pick the most absurdly hilarious choices which is appropriate to this matter. Overall, it's not gonna be as ""perfect"" as our today's better blockbusters, but it sure is one hell of a time watching a bunch of people exploding their madness.Olympus Has Fallen was nothing more than an irony of seeing a band of eye slanted rice eating machines immediately defeating the White House, although it's very fun, there's nothing much else to remember in the end. White House Down may not have villains with funny accents, but the heroes' mission itself is the best absurdity you'll ever see. The film just plays around the preposterous concept. Like adding the fact that the president is now also an action hero who's firing a bazooka, and the government picking ridiculous and sometimes campy decisions that would only happen in the movies. It also had a Scooby Doo kind of ending. With all of these things getting out of hand, it seems the film is actually proud of it. Just keeping it strikingly dumb but in an exciting way.Channing Tatum is still not the best mimicked John McClane, but his physical strength buys the character and there's a fine spark of charisma to be found. Especially when he's with Jamie Foxx. Foxx as the president already sounds ironic, but he keeps up the film's flavor. Their chemistry pretty much fits in their exploding situation.Roland Emmerich stays upon his roots that made Independence Day memorable, except everything looks shinier, but the tone stays intact. It's totally old school where it presents the thrills then sudden humor, and cheesiness to the side. Also an extended exposition at the beginning because characters used to matter in action films decades ago. Emmerich is always perfect in creating large scale action and destruction, but when it goes to the hand-to-hand combat, the scenes troubles finding a better angle. Results the consistent thrills goes to the car chases and random explosions.Taking it seriously is possibly the worst idea of viewing the film. White House Down is simply just a dumb action movie, it mostly resembles to an old school action blockbuster, or at least fitting to a Nicolas Cage blockbuster such as Con Air and National Treasure. But the film's intentional craziness will make you forgive about anything what's preposterous in it. This is one of those blockbusters today that is not ashamed of expressing its true madness. Roland Emmerich is wise to be loyal in his style for it. Mainstream ""dark"" tones would have made it awkward. This concept is built for ridiculous thrills and the film justifies it. Many would disagree that White House Down is particularly good, but when you realize its intent, you'll get to understand more of the experience.",White House Down
84,Rickting,Olympus Has Fallen or White Hosue Down? Easy choice: OHF,4,7 March 2014,"The second Die Hard in the White House movie of 2013, the other being the you've probably already forgotten it Olympus Has Fallen, centres on a secret service agent played by Channing Tatum fighting a White House terrorist attack alongside the president. This is a huge, explosion heavy summer blockbuster epic and it's directed by Roland Emmerich. What a lot of people seem to fail to acknowledge is that Emmerich, despite making Independence Day, is not a good director and this is entirely evident in this ludicrous, brainless and utterly tension free stupidity fest. OHF, despite being totally ludicrous, suffered from playing it totally straight and that made the film less fun than it might have been. WHD goes to the other end of the spectrum, and is easily the stupidest, loudest and most nutty action film of 2013. It benefits from a fun performance from Jamie Foxx as the president, and the dialogue is pleasingly witty (""Can you not hit me on the head with a rocket launcher while I'm trying to drive?"") so it sort of gets the tone right. There are occasional highlights, such as a claustrophobic car chase around the White House lawn.The quickest way to sum up this movie: This is no more than a mood board of action movie elements combined with awful CGI (Despite the big budget that's the best they can afford), set pieces which get bigger and bigger and somehow more boring than the last and a total lack of any kind of maturity. The editing throughout is awful and the film is incredibly clichéd, even daring to refer to Die Hard as the stupendously bland hero spends some of the film in a vest similar to Bruce Willis'. It has a rather stupid and unnecessary twist ending and the day is saved by a girl waving a flag. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal falls totally flat. Roland Emmerich proves that Independence Day was just a hit thanks to good luck and a good special effects team. The most infuriating thing about this movie is that it lacks the most important thing in an action movie: Tension. There is none of that here whatsoever. No tension at all. I didn't care about any of what was going on and while it would sometimes have an inspired popcorn movie thrill, it made for a dull Friday night viewing. I think Roland Emmerich has a few things to learn about the art of subtlety.3/10",White House Down
85,DareDevilKid,A True Action Movie Fan's Wet Dream,8,11 July 2013,"Rating: 3.7/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Loved every minute of it. To hell with all the naysayers and the (obvious) comparisons with ""Olympus has fallen"" and the PG-13 rating gripe. Like me, if you enjoyed ""Olympus Has Fallen"", you'll definitely relish this action bonanza too. In fact, I'll go even further and state that it's even better and slightly more coherent, if not realistic, than the former.Tatum as usual is cool and breezy like in all his action roles and together with Foxx, makes for an entertaining combo. The direction does admittedly get a tad clichéd at times and might venture into overtly patriotic territory. But then, with a title that screams: ""White House Down"", this was naturally expected, and those who aren't pleased are either completely delusional or else they have seen way too few action movies. Boasting of pulsating action sequences, brilliant set designs, witty one liners, decent comic relief, a plausible plot, believable plot narration, and one of the most outrageous car chase scenes to boot, this movie has got it all.Sci-fi and action movie Director Roland Emerich might never be regarded in the same breath as similar genre auteurs like Spielberg, Cameron, Nolan, John McTiernan, or Richard Donner, and for good measure. But nobody can deny one thing, the man knows how to create an entertaining and adrenaline-pumping blockbuster, unlike some hacks (ref., Bay). Ultimately, ""White House Down"" delivers everything you can hope for in an exciting action movie. So sit your butt down, strap up, and enjoy this no-holds-barred action fiesta.",White House Down
86,TheSquiss,"Stupid, loud, pointless fun. A pizza & beer movie.",5,19 September 2013,"Shall we get the comparisons between White House Down and Olympus Has Fallen out of the way first? Director Roland Emmerich's heart must have sunk when, midway through his shoot, he discovered Antoine Fuqua had got there first. Fortunately for Emmerich, his is the destruction-of-the-White-House movie with the leading man who can act. White House Down is still utter tosh, it's still only receiving five stars from me and it still has more holes than substance, but at least it doesn't suffer the presence of plank-with-legs, Gerard Butler.As presidents go, I'm giving this the nod with Jamie Foxx over Aaron Eckhart. It's a close call with the rest of the principals: White House Down's Maggie Gyllenhaal, Richard Jenkins, James Woods and Jason Clarke versus Olympus' Angela Bassett, Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo and Rick Yune but, in the leading man stakes, Channing Tatum is head, shoulders and six-foot ladder above the plank.It's much the same story here as in Olympus Has Fallen: White House is attacked, President is betrayed, terrorists rampage through the building blowing every last wall, ceiling and art work to smithereens, hero finds himself the last man standing who can save the day and there's a child involved in the proceedings.The difference is in the details. The child in this one, Emily (Joey King) belongs to hero rather then President, POTUS gets to swing a gun rather than just get angry and there's some destruction beyond the gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. King is something of a pleasant surprise. I groaned inwardly as she paraded her predictably precocious Emily for us but, as the bullets began to hit overdrive, her performance mellowed and she impressed with a warm, intelligent turn as a child who wants to impress her dad and be the best that she can. It's a more convincing performance than Foxx's who is lumbered with a few 'comical' quips that fall flat and a role that requires action and sincerity but is very definitely written as the foil to Tatum's loser-dad-cop-wannabe, Cale.Tatum, as Cale, the cop who has failed in work, marriage and fatherhood and wants a fresh start in the Secret Service (hence his presence inside the White House), is more than adequate in the beefy lead. He can simultaneously shoot AND shout intelligibly, and you can't say that about some of the action men around. It's not a role that requires great thought, heck, it's not a film that requires thought, but he carries White House Down perfectly.Gyllenhaal, too, is on good form, coasting as the sexy sincerity of the piece. As Special Agent Finnerty she's the brains and the balls of the operation that makes decisions and argues the point without the need to shoot first. She brings a semblance of calm and reason to the legal anarchy that trashes the President's home. It says something about Emmerich's clout that he can attract the calibre of performers he has filled this White House with.Thank goodness the performances are there because the script is wobbly and all reason went AWOL before the first camera was loaded. I'll give you one tiny (very tiny) example: The White House, with all its weaponry and security measures, somehow still boasts a flimsy glass roof that two men can fall through? Hmmm. Somebody wanted another crash more than a reasonable plan to get said men back inside! Fairly early on in the mayhem, White House Down evolves into Home Alone 6 (yes, there really were five of them!) with rocket launchers instead of kitchen utensils. But, you know what? It may be stupid, but it's fun!*****HUGE, MAMMOTH, GIGANTIC, GARGANTUAN PLOT SPOILER ALERT*****Everything works out fine, Daddy's a hero, World War III was averted and America rocks! Go on; stone me for giving the plot away. You're not going to watch White House Down for the logic, the reason or the reality. This is a beer and pizza movie; sit back, put the earplugs in, banish thoughts of planks with legs and watch Roland Emmerich do what he does best: blow s**t up!

87,RevRonster,It has its moments...,6,19 November 2013,"I wasn't really blown away by ""White House Down"" but, and I won't lie, there are moments in the film that I genuinely enjoyed.A lot of the film is pretty darn silly and stupid, and many of the jokes the film throws at you are terribly and groan inducing. Also, the film has some horrendous green screen work due to the fact they didn't film outside the actual White House. The green screen composites are very obvious and make the film feel fake and like it is taking place in some alternate reality where light doesn't follow the rules of existence and just cast its brilliance wherever it feels like and color has evolved to the point that there are no bland shades, only insanely bright.However, there are some fun action sequences and Jaime Foxx and Channing Tatum are a decent duo. Like all other Roland Emmerich films, there's nothing subtle about this movie but it is suppose to just be a silly, cartoonish, popcorn action film and it succeeds in that aspect.Like I said, it's not the greatest thing out there but I didn't feel like I wasted my time...especially since James Woods and Richard Jenkins are in it and both of them are doing a tremendous job.Hi!

92,Al_The_Strange,White House Down review,8,4 July 2013,"Earlier this year, Olympus Has Fallen was released showcasing a lone hero rising to one of the boldest and most terrifying challenges: saving an entire nation when the White House and its members fall under attack. It's not a terribly great or well-made film, but it sure was entertaining, representing the essence of action cinema.Strangely, White House Down was released just a few months afterward, also portraying the White House and the President under attack. Coming from director Roland Emmerich, the man behind Independence Day and 2012, WHD embodies the thing that Emmerich does best: the essence of blockbuster cinema.In spite of that, you can expect plentiful amounts of action: there are numerous thrilling shoot-outs and crisis situations. Special effects are moderately-used, but look pretty decent. Witty quips and humor break up nearly every scene. It takes a little while in the first act for the action to pick up, but once it does, it's a very evenly-paced and satisfying thrill ride.The story in this movie bears much in common with OHF, but with enough subtle differences to warrant endless comparisons. Basically, WHD follows several characters, who are all endearing, but show minimal development. The film does a great job of establishing the main hero, his dilemmas, and his bonds with the other characters, which ultimately raise the stakes on a more personal level. The story may cover some unlikely ground (and it gets a little pushy with the left-wing politics), but the plot is well-structured. It's actually quite an improvement from OHF, which presented problems that were solved one-after-another; WHD keeps all the conflicts running hard and fast until the very end, making it all the more gripping.This film looks decent, with quality photography and editing. Acting is generally good; nobody puts on a serious face here, but everybody works to make the film fun and light. Writing is good and seems well-researched (another improvement from OHF). This production has nice-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is good too.OHF was good as an action movie for tough guys, but WHD works best as an audience-friendly popcorn flick. In fact, OHF reminded me so much of action movies of the 80s and 90s (like Die Hard, Under Siege, etc), but WHD reminded me more of the great thrillers and blockbusters of the 90s (such as a Jack Ryan feature, or the earlier works of Emmerich). Between the two, I actually do prefer WHD by a slight margin, and of the two, it comes the most recommended.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",White House Down

Come on, now. All the same stereotypical ""Hollywood"" cast. The black general.Problem number 2: Story. Same lame story. How many times have we seen the divorce parents with the Dad that always forget his daughter's important events. And the Daughter just happens to be extremely smart and knows everything about the White House. Seriously, how many times have we seen the exposition read off by someone in authority reading the lead's ""chart"" to give out all the background? Like a million times.The terrorists just got in the building, how exactly? and they left the door open so all the visitors could see right in what they were doing? They were THE most suspicious looking guys I've ever seen, but no one else noticed?Problem number 3: Story was ripped off from Die Hard. McClain was divorced and had a feud with his wife who gets caught in a terrorist operation. It's was pretty much scene by scene a total rip off. The ""best friend was just killed by your tourist"" speech was also ripped. The list goes on and on. The hiding on top of the elevator? Really? I'm surprised they didn't get sued. The flamboyant computer geek?Problem number 4: Unrealistic. Not a single secret service man despite wearing bullet proof vests were able to get any of the terrorists. They were just all gunned down one by one. How on Earth were all of those terrorists able to get inside the White House? But the lone ""unqualified"" secret service wanna be were able to take them all down. They put the President on speaker phone for everyone to hear?

94,Cinemaniac1984,An entertaining action movie,7,17 January 2015,"It was a shame White House Down didn't do too well at the box office, considering the fact Olympus Has Fallen which was released earlier in the year has a similar plot: Die Hard in the White House. Perhaps if White House Down was released earlier, it may have done better. If Olympus Has Fallen was brutally violent, White House Down may have watered down the violence but does it bigger and better with a touch of humour especially with Ronald Emmerich (Independence Day, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow) at the helm.Taking on the blueprint role of Die Hard's John McClane, Channing Tatum is Police Officer John Cale who takes his young daughter Emily (Joey King) on a tour across the White House while he applies for a job as a Secret Service Agent. While at the White House they meet the President of the United States James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). During the tour the White House is taken over by a group of ex-Military fundamentalists led by Stenz (Jason Clarke) who is also aided by disgruntled Head of the Secret Service Walker (James Woods). While John Cale is able to slip away, he must work to save President Sawyer and the many hostages including Cale's daughter Emily.I liked Channing Tatum as the hero John Cale. There are numerous homages to Bruce Willis as John McClane in Die Hard (white singlet, one liners and all) and I felt that this may be the passing of the torch. Channing Tatum shows he can easily do comedy (21 Jump Street and 22 Jump Street) and also action. Unfortunately I could not take Jamie Foxx seriously as the President of the United States of America. Jason Clarke is great as Stenz and it's always good to see James Woods chew every scene as Walker.Unfortunately after a while it felt like a buddy movie not too dissimilar from Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs with John Cale and President Sawyer taking on the terrorists. That aside I found White House Down to be more enjoyable and I felt it was better than Olympus Has Fallen. Another movie you can just sit back and watch it for what it is.7/10",White House Down

The script is a stupid, unintelligent political script.It starts off badly with some nonsensical crap about a controversial (that is putting it mildly) political deal with the Middle East about pulling out troops from all the bases in the Middle East. To add to this the entire situation have come about because the president just left several people to hang out and dry when he decided to pull the plug on operations in the Middle East. By hanging out and dry we mean get killed or spend some quality time in the regional prisons. That put the president on the bad guy list instead of the good guy as far as I am concerned. I do not know if the writer was trying to make a political statement, which I never like in my movies, or is just plain stupid. Given the rest of the script I would go for stupid or both.The good thing with the movie is that there is quite a lot of action and some of it is rather okay to watch. There are a few funny moments as well. I quite liked the tour guide for example.Unfortunately, even if you try to forget about the political nonsense, the rest of the script is just full of utter stupidity. It starts of not too bad with the diversion at the Capitol and the initial take over of the White House even though a whole bunch of armed, obviously unscreened, guys getting into the White House to work on the president's home theatre like that is not very believable.After that it gradually degrades though. Cale is nowhere as charismatic, nor as professional, as McClane and there are lots of silly and stupid moments. For example, the car chase starts of not too bad but then Cale get's into some bloody dream mode and gets shot up. Just dumb. During the same episode the tank scene is just ridiculous. Would they only have one tank? Not very likely. It takes forever for it to move. It is also highly improbable that it could be taken out like that by a hand-held launcher by a front hit. Rear or side maybe but not a front hit. The writer is obviously clueless about military matters. The fumbled chopper attack is embarrassingly bad. The worst is probably when Cale's daughter stops and air-strike by waving a flag outside the White House. I almost turned off the movie at that point.It is too bad because the movie had the budget and some nice actors to be a good action movie but was just ruined by a louse script with a totally unnecessary bunch of political nonsense in it. The next time I see a movie were the script is written by James Vanderbilt I am going to be very cautious.",White House Down
96,Finfrosk86,"Well made, entertaining action",8,5 June 2015,"Here's yet another movie with a score that is just way too low.This is thoroughly entertaining action. It has a great build-up, it has household names, it has good, hard hitting action. It's actually rather exciting at times too. Back to the build up, though. A risk that action movies run, is that the build-up before the action starts, is boring. It isn't in this one. Not that the build-up phase is that long, but still, it's pretty entertaining. Channing Tatum is really likable. You want the main good guys to make it through. I'm no big fan of Jamie Foxxxxx, but he does a fine job here. Also it is interesting to see Jason Clarke, right before he kind of blew up. (John Connor, everyone!)I think the reason this movie doesn't have a solid 7, or maybe even an 8, is haters. Action haters, probably. Because this is one entertaining action movie! Done deal.",White House Down
97,EthanBJones_03,Mildly entertaining but there are better action movies; Would Recommend,7,16 April 2017,"​Plot Overview: When terrorists attack the Whitehouse, it's up to John Cale(Channing Tatum), a bodyguard looking to join the secret service, to save the president and stop the terrorists.Directed by Roland EmmerichStarring Channing Tatum, Jamie Foxx and Maggie Gyllenhaal# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This movie has some mild entertainment but I think it was unlucky to be released the same year as 'Olympus has Fallen'. I know it may seem unfair to compare the two because of different tones and whatnot but it's hard not to when they came out in the same year, with the same premise. Taking 'Olympus has Fallen' out of the equation, this movie has some fun, stupid action moments with a decent series of performances and some re-watch value but I don't think it will last long. In conclusion, it's a pretty entertaining movie and I can recommend it.I think that the people who will like this movie will be fans of stupid, harmless action and people who like a more light hearted and less serious action movie.Would Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Channing Tatum was pretty good as John Cale. John Cale was an underdog which was a good idea because it made him seem more human. Giving him a daughter also gave him motivation and gave him more leeway with what he did, even if his daughter was really annoying. Jamie Foxx was good as President Sawyer and he provided a fun, unique take on a previously serious role. Maggie Gyllenhaal was fine as Carol Finnerty. James Woods was good as Agent Walker as was Jason Clarke as Stenz. The villains were reasonably strong. Richard Jenkins was fine as speaker of the house. Nicholas Wright was great as Donnie. Joey King was terrible as Emily Cale and I really, really hated her character. The motivations for the villains were also very weak. They tried to make it personal and I understand that but it was still not an excuse to play with a 'nuclear football'.The overall story was fine but the ending was particularly satisfying. The story is pretty slow starting off and can be pretty boring at first.It was a little hard to see during some action scenes but for the most part the cinematography was fine.The success rate for the effects was around 50/50. Some of them looked pretty good whereas some of them looked terrible.It was fun and mindless entertainment. It only gets properly enjoyable after the first 45 minutes. Some of the jokes worked and I laughed once or twice. ​It includes a scene were Jamie Foxx hangs out a limousine, holding a RPG shooting at the front gate of the Whitehouse while they're shot at by Jason Clarke! You should watch just for that scene.The music was pretty cool. The unit of terrorists felt more like a team than a group of just hired guns which one ups 'Olympus has Fallen' in that category. The actual endgame weapon was pretty weak. Personally, I enjoyed the movie from 45 minutes onward but before that I didn't enjoy it that much.7/10",White House Down
98,kgprophet,It is Literally the Die Hard Script,5,29 June 2013,"From the helicopter attack, to the guy in glasses cracking the ""vault"", to the some of the action beats, to the mano-a-mano showdowns, this is the ACTUAL Die Hard script set in the White House. When the tagline for this film was ""Die-hard in the White House"", I didn't realise they really meant a remake of the original movie ""Die Hard"". Back in the day, there was a flurry of ""Die-hard in a"" movies. You started to expect that audiences had enough of that formula and Hollywood moved on. Well, I guess with all the other reboots going on (look out - ""Terminator"" is getting a reboot too) perhaps these filmmakers thought fit to revisit the original story and deliberately model actual scenes, practically shot-by-shot, on the original film. Every single beat in the story is there. The only thing missing is ""Yippee Ki-yay Motherf***"". Even so, the first act plods along way too slowly, and contributes to the cardinal sin of clocking in over two hours. The definition of a crackerjack film like this one is to give audiences a quick and fun thrill ride. It has no business forcing us to sit in our seats when obviously it is not trying to break new ground.There seemed to be a sense by the filmmakers to be determined to show how well they could copy the ""Die-hard"" formula. If one studies the original action classic, you can appreciate the oddball one-liners that help to define the main characters. The notion that humour was necessary to pervade all aspects of this movie is a misstep. Thinking back upon the original Die-hard, there was a seemingly careful balance at how much snark was injected to the dialogue. Just enough to make the movie fun to watch, but not to the degree that the movie's central conflict is taken too lightly.So the film lacks originality far more than I expected, but the action quotient helped to offset that. The screenplay deserves credit for finding some credibility in character's actions, and the director gets competent acting from the well cast ensemble.   When compared to the predecessor ""Olympus Has Fallen"", obviously more punch was injected into the story, with a greater number of action setpieces. Production design for the sets also benefited from a larger budget, but surprisingly not the special effects (save the Air Force One scene).Ultimately I can't recommend sitting through this in a theatre, despite the ""fun"" factor in the constant one-liners, designed for a summer popcorn movie audience. The subject would never ever merit going into extra innings as it does, and the film could have easily solved the problem by tightening up the schmaltz in the beginning.",White House Down

100,Bronco46,More Leftist Claptrap!,3,26 August 2015,"This is what Hollywood has become. There cannot be any North Korean enemies, Russian enemies, Chinese enemies, or God forbid Islamic Terrorists. Hollywood has turned on their own country. It now routinely uses Americans, American governmental agencies, and American law enforcement agencies as enemies in their movies. This film has a man with a cancer as the leader of a group ultra right wing extremists. These extremists bring the entire country to a standstill while they occupy the White House. Political correctness has so infected Hollywood they can't make movies anymore about real enemies. They have to create American ones. We've even seen movies re-released after they've been altered to fit a far left position. This movie is clearly inspired by a number of other previous action films. Most especially the Die Hard series. Like those movies, this film has one lowly man fighting the forces of evil. And while doing it. He is bloodied and beaten. But prevails. It's a formula we all have loved in numerous Bruce Willis films. But those films look works of Shakespeare or other great authors compared to this screenplay. It's a completely ridiculous premise. And sadly has been lauded as a great film. At best. It's a way to pass two hours if you have nothing else to do.",White House Down
101,movieman6-413-929510,The lesser attack film at the White House of 2013,4,2 February 2019,"White House Down is directed by Roland Emmerich, the director of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. White House Down is also the second film of 2013 in which the White House is infiltrated. White House Down seems in some aspects much like the film Olympus Has Fallen.
White House Down is Channing Tatum's character, which has some father's daughter problems with his daughter. He would like to become an agent for the secret service, but does not have everything that is needed for it. He tries to get a job at the White House and because his daughter is a fan of the White House and everything that goes with it, he takes her for a tour after his application. As they follow the tour, the White House is infiltrated.
The beginning was slow, because during the tour you will all hear history about the White House. Meanwhile, the White House is very easily infiltrated and attacked.
The White House is known for its good security, but you did not say that back in White House Down. It all happens too easily and quickly. Making the film seem unrealistic.
There is also a lot of humor in the film, making it seem like a comedy, while the film is meant to be an action movie.
The story in the film is also something special and is difficult to take seriously, with twists that you can see in advance. The only thing that keeps you interested is that you want to know what the motives are of the perpetrators. When that is made known, you can quickly lose interest in the movie and watch some special action and weird humor.
The cast in the film did well, only the story is a bit different. Especially if you have already seen Olympus Has Fallen, the film is already predictable.",White House Down
102,trublu215,"Loud, Dumb and Overlong",2,29 June 2013,"Now, this seemed like the perfect summer blockbuster. Two huge stars, an expensive budget and a director with a knack for action. What could go wrong? By the end of it, instead of what could go wrong, you'll be asking yourself what went right. The answer....barely anything. White House Down is not only dumb, it is downright idiotic. The plot is preposterous, the action sequences sub par and the acting is atrocious. Channing Tatum does his best Bruce Willis impression while Jamie Foxx turns in the worst performance of his career. The supporting cast lead by Maggie Gyllenhaal saves the terrible leads and are the sole reason I am not giving this a 1. Overall, this film is loud, long and boring, so much so, I can't imagine any adult with a functioning brain to enjoy this. I highly recommend to stay away from this stinker.

103,MAYESY-44,There's better there's worse,7,5 June 2020,Decent action movie but not as good as Olympus has fallen which is similar and came out around the same time.

104,gregeichelberger,Violently stupid 'Olympus' knock-off,3,5 July 2013,"I suppose I could just copy and paste my review of ""Olympus Has Fallen"" from two months ago and it would suffice to fill this space as well as describe the latest installment of another film about an attack upon the residence of the President of the United States. I could, but there are certainly elements of the two movies that, while quite similar, are also poles apart.This newest version, White House Down (directed by Roland Emmerich, ""Anonymous"") has much more humor than the Gerard Butler vehicle. Of course, much of it is so extremely unintentional, that I would call this one of the funniest films of the year (easily beating out would be contenders like ""Over 21,"" ""Identity Thief"" and ""The Hangover Part 3"" on the Laugh-Meter).The problem, though, much of it is supposed to be taken deadly serious, but the situations are so patently ridiculous, the acting is so far over the top, the characters are so cliché and the denouement so violently ludicrous that one has no choice but snicker their way through this drivel — just to get through it.Plot, oh I guess I can try to describe ""White House Down"" as a ""Die Hard"" meets ""Independence Day"" (a picture Emmerich produced, by the way) meets any number of movies in which a sad-sack loser ends up as the savior of the free world.Here, Capitol Policeman John Cale has all of the Hollywood flaws that make us love him, such as a stellar war record but never can stick with a job and has no respect for authority. Played by the baby-faced Channing Tatum (""G.I. Joe: Retaliation,"" a cameo appearance in ""This Is the End""), he happens to be at the right place at the wrong time: In the White House at a Secret Service job interview when all heck breaks loose.It seems that liberal president Sawyer (think of a cool Barack Obama, played by Jamie Foxx, ""Django Unchained""), has decided to push a radical Middle East peace plan by removing all U.S. troops from the region. This, of course, stirs up anger from the defense industry, right-wing zealots and Sawyer's conservative congressional opposition.After a short build-up, construction workers putting in a new White House theater system show their disdain for the plan by coordinating an attack which secures the facility in just a few short minutes leaving the POTUS helpless with only one ally — John McClain, UH, I mean John CALE.So, while the bad guys lock down every other space, including clearing all security personnel from the roof, tapping into the nuclear launch code area and capturing the ultra high secret bunker, John and Sawyer get to spend time together discussing their family situations, exchanging bon mots and blowing away various, sundry and non-descript bad guys (yep, even our pinko Chief Executive gets to figuratively exude, ""I am the NRA"").A plot twist involving veteran actors James Woods (the remake of ""Straw Dogs"") and Richard Jenkins (""Jack Reacher""), as well as any number of shootings, killings, explosions, tank and helicopter attacks, plane crashes, beatings and the wounding of a conservative Glenn Beck-type TV host and other fun events round out this two-plus hour feast for dimwits.And don't even get me started on the whole subplot of Cale's 11-year old perpetually sourpuss daughter (an absolutely laughable performance by 14-year old Joey King) who has her own blog and manages to film aspects of the takeover and is proclaimed a ""beautiful little hero"" (that's actual dialogue, friends).Other than the decent chemistry between Tatum and Foxx, there is no enjoyment to be found anywhere in ""White House Down."" Bad guys are duly dispatched, the world is once again free from nuclear meltdown and a corn pone ending is wrapped around a safe PG-13 rating that makes everything all right and somehow feasible.At least ""Olympus Has Fallen"" knew its limitations and tried not to exceed them. Emmerich — who out-Michael Bays Michael Bay here — seems completely unconcerned with such trivialities and thus seems quite unaware that this is no doubt one of the stupidest films in a year where the bar has already been lowered to the ground.",White House Down

106,nesfilmreviews,Fun to be had in nothing more than a brainless summer blockbuster.,3,17 August 2013,"To his credit, Roland Emmerich's ""White House Down"" knows just how completely ludicrous this storyline is, but fully embraces it, and has a lot fun riding it out to its utterly implausible end. Apparently, audiences are very hungry for action concerning terrorist attempts to take over the White House. This storyline is remarkably similar to that of ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" from three months ago, but there are some fundamental differences. ""White House Down"" employs plenty of humor, which allows the viewer to just enjoy the viewing experience. There are many casualties in ""WHD"", but there is hardly any bloodshed. In contrast ""Olympus,"" decided to include graphic violence, making it a challenge to just have fun in nothing more than a brainless blockbuster.John Cale (Channing Tatum) is an US Capitol police officer that has struggled to hold a steady job and being a good father to his daughter, Emily (Joey King). She is passionate about politics and with the current US president, James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). Cale takes Emily to the White House when he applies for a spot on the President's Secret Service, but he is does not get job. Dejected, John and his daughter join a tour through the White House at the same time domestic terrorists take over both the Capitol and the White House. The terrorists gather the tour group as hostages, while simultaneously trapping the president inside the building. With the actual Secret Service incapacitated, it befalls upon John Cale to rescue the president from these villains trying to destroy the American way, and their motives are the usual, standard terrorist demands (money, revenge, etc).Despite the dramatic and grave tone of the trailer, ""White House Down"" has about as much fun with the disastrous scenario as respectably possible. There are laughs - mostly cheesy, throughout the entire film, never letting the viewer forget they are here to have a good time. However, its impossible to ignore its glaring faults. You have never seen a more unconvincing president depicted on-screen. While its amusing to show the President wearing Jordan's while shooting a rocket launcher out a car window, any shred of legitimacy left evaporates in name of some laughs. Channing Tatum is respectable as the hero figure, but stiffens up at times in some scenes that require some dramatic finesse.When comparing the two films with similar plots, separated by only three months at the box office, ""White House Down"" is the better summer, blockbuster watch when compared to ""Olympus has Fallen"" simply because the latter was just that bad.",White House Down
107,Bruce722,"Like Olympus Has Fallen, this movie fails to deliver.",5,16 November 2013,"This year there were two films made that were strikingly similar in concept. Both featured the white house being taken over and one man going John McClane on everyone and saving the day. The first film was Olympus Has Fallen and the second film was this one, White House Down. Like Olympus Has Fallen, White House Down had a lot of great action and some cool special effects. Also like it, this movie was a ridiculously unrealistic premise the was the foundation of the entire film and made the immersion nearly impossible. I'm sorry but a handful of guys are not going to single-handedly take over the most secure building in the world, especially not by force. Unlike the other movie, however, this film doesn't take itself too seriously. Mostly thanks to Jamie Foxx, there is a lot of subtle humor that adds a certain sense of comedic relief. While that is a strength, it is also a weakness because it, once again, breaks the immersion in the setting. World War 3 is about to happen and you've got jokes? Sorry, not buying it. Still, it's a decent movie but fails to deliver the intensity and edge of your seat thrill that movies like Die Hard 1 and Speed excelled at.",White House Down
108,fung0,Emmerich Does it Again,8,5 February 2016,"There are few directors who can put a sense of fun into their films like Roland Emmerich. I've seen him interviewed - he's really a big kid, who makes movies that amuse *him*, even if no one else comes along for the ride. That zest shows. Emmerich's films aren't *calculated* to be entertaining - they're built from his own gut-instinct of what entertains *him*. His films are easy to love, because he so clearly loves making them.White House Down is a perfect example of the kind of absurdly audacious action film only Emmerich would dare to do. And only Emmerich could carry off so well. The story is both fanciful and predictable, but Emmerich makes it feel fresh and genuine, with over-the-top action, over-the-top characters, snappy dialog - and a few odd little twists that make it his own.The biggest twist, of course, is in the anti-establishment politics that underpin the story. The president in the film is clearly identified as a caricature of Obama, including references to his trying to quit smoking. But President Obama isn't so much the subject of White House Down as the intended audience. This film is a Dorian Gray portrait of the heroic, iconoclastic president a lot of voters were hoping for, as opposed to the cautious, status quo Obama of real life. Emmerich is gently - and humorously - saying to Obama, ""Whatever happened to this guy?""Of course, that in-joke is kept very much in the background of what is unabashedly a simple action film. And Emmerich knows how to pace that action, how to create larger-than-life scenarios that feel just believable enough to get the adrenaline going. This is the kind of film you where you cheer for the handsome heroes and hiss at the slimy villains, secure in the faith that everything will somehow work out in the end.Yes, I know it's fashionable to scoff at that kind of fimmaking. But someday we're all going to realize that nobody has ever been better than Roland Emmerich at providing those 'guilty pleasures' that we all secretly crave.",White House Down
109,FountainPen,MANY problems with this attempt at a blockbuster. NOT recommended,4,8 March 2018,"Too many excessively long scenes. Too many plot holes. Too many implausible events.

There's no need for 30min of it before the first explosion. (6) If you are told you have 8min before the air strike, don't show 20min of shoot-outs and fisticuffs. The audience knows what 8min feels like. (7) If you have 100s of soldiers and tanks outside the White House, don't make them hang around and do nothing.

It's a perfectly fine action flick involving a tough dad, his resourceful 11 year old daughter, the President of the United States and a bunch of bad dudes. It's not breaking any new ground but it's a well put together movie using a tried & true formula. Lots of action & explosions, nasty sadistic bad guys, ""everyman"" hero, betrayals, snappy one-liners and great chemistry between the two main protagonists. There really isn't anything to complain about, unless that's your only reason for watching movies.The direction & cinematography is great, the music enhances the atmosphere, it's well paced, well edited and the acting is fine. It's not a complex plot nor does it have enormous character development or an inspiring point to make. It's an action flick pure and simple. If that's not your thing then look elsewhere. For me, I just love the traditional action flick, especially when it's done well, so it was an absolute blast to watch.A lot of the harsh reviews here seem to based upon some assumption that because Jamie Foxx is black he MUST be representing Obama and therefore the whole movie is bad because it's not about entertaining people or making money - they just made the movie purely to promote Obama. Really? Leaving aside the ludicrous idea that a movie is just a promo for the current US President, why assume this character is Obama anyway? Just because he's portrayed by a black guy? If the President had been played by a white actor would that mean the movie would have been okay to watch? I didn't assume that character was meant to be Obama, no more than I assumed a white dude playing the President in earlier action flicks was supposed to be Reagan/Bush/Clinton/etc. The actor always represents the office of President not any particular person in these sorts of movies. Why should that be different just in this one? Maybe it's because I'm not American that I really don't understand the anger I see in some of the reviews here towards even the slightest hint (real or imagined) that your President is being cast in a favorable light by a movie. Shouldn't you be proud that your country's leader is being portrayed so heroically? He even shoots stuff & gets in on the action for crying out loud!! Anyway, if you're looking for a deeply moving or thought-provoking drama, a nice sentimental romance, a biting political treatise or even actual, genuine political propaganda look elsewhere. But if you just want to have a great time being entertained by a standard but well produced 'goodies vs baddies' yarn without having to think too much I can recommend this flick to you.

This has great comedic scenes, an actually sympathic, feisty kid, good acting by all the cast, wonderful special effects, lots of unexpected and entertaining twists and turns. It isn't the least bit ponderous. It's just a lot of straight-forward fun. The other White House getting blown up movie has the A-list cast, the reasonably logical plot, the sad, pull your heartstrings moments, but it is ponderous, and not nearly as much plain fun. I want to give credit for that to Jamie Foxx and James Woods, who are absolutely essential to this slyly funny mix, and the computer genius, as well :)",White House Down
118,repojack,Best Emmerich flick yet,7,29 June 2013,"17 years ago ""Independence Day"" put Will Smith and Roland Emmerich on the map. Will Smith became the summer blockbuster hero while Emmerich became the guy who made popcorn flicks where he got to destroy stuff (most of Washington DC, national monuments, New York City, the world and more). This summer both Smith and Emmerich had big movies  ""After Earth"" and ""White House Down."" Both of these movies had really stupid titles but Roland delivered the goods while Will got sucked into the M Night Shamalayan's sinkhole (box office results notwithstanding). White House Down is a blatant rip off of Die Hard, but it tweaks the premise just enough to make it different enough and wildly entertaining. Channing Tatum doesn't try to be Bruce Willis (even if he eventually gets in the same bloodied tank top) but combines his witty ""21 Jump Street"" humor with his ""GI Joe"" bad-ass-ness. The addition of Jamie Foxx as the ""Obama"" president and, no joke, side-kick to Tatum, adds for some great comedic moments. Most of Emmerich's films are entertaining. Even Godzilla, his worst movie, is a mostly fun ride. But he seems to have matured to a point that all of his typical formulaic elements are made more cohesive. This formula typically goes: 1) character introduction, 2) action/destroy things, 3) quieter character development, 4) action and then an episodic cycle of 3 and 4 until the ultimate sappy happy-ending climax. The formula is there but it's better integrated and faster-moving. And he's found a way to reduce the sappiness. It helps to have the talents of Jamie Foxx, Channing Tatum, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Six Feet Under's Richard Jenkins who all put in great performances. If you wanted ""24"" to be a movie, this is it. They definitely borrow 24's ""the terrorist in the end is not the terrorist in the beginning"" twists and turns. Trust me. You will be entertained.",White House Down
119,Nightmarelogic,All action movies are basically the same,6,21 March 2014,All actions movies follow the same basic model so I am not exactly sure what people were expecting. I do understand some of the bad reviews though. This movie is a Liberal Wet Dream; basically a wish fulfillment fantasy on how the Obama Presidency should have gone. That is the only legitimate gripe against the movie I can see. Otherwise it follows every standard building block of a high octane action movie. This has been compared to Olympus Has Fallen for good reason but White House Down is so many ways better. White House Down is ironically an ensemble movie. Yes ultimately Tatum is the hero but the other characters aren't complete incompetents. The same can't be said for Olympus Has Fallen. The Hero in that movie is the only one who knows what he is doing. If not for him everything comes crashing down. OK fine. This is not perfect. It has holes you can drag a tank through but it strikes the right cords at the right times if you can get past your politics for a few hours. It is not a bad movie. It is not a bad way to waste a few hours.,White House Down
120,NanoFrog,Hidden Actors,2,11 August 2013,"The poster advertising this film, that I saw, does not show the actor James Woods. This was a clever attempt to have us believe this film would be worth watching. James Wood is even more unbelievable in his role in this film than in any of his so-called films. From the cheesy special effects to the sudden appearance of James Woods this is a film that just hoes downhill from the opening credits. Once again it becomes difficult to write a movie review for a movie that does not really have a working plot. The reasons all these bad guys are taking down the white house is alluded to, but never makes much sense. Is it an act of personal revenge? Is there some underlying surprise plot? No, not really. It is strange that two White House attack films have been real eased more less back to back. The other one Olympus Has Fallen is a much better film. James Woods is one of those actors that if he is in the film, it is not a serious film. His presence in a film is code for ""never mind"". Nothing to see here.",White House Down

White House Down gives what you expect for it. Over two hours action and effect rumble. Roland Emmerich knows that this kind of movie has to take little over and it is good to see that there is enough humor in it. Of course the bad guys are ugly had hero is handsome. Of course bad guys are so bad to shoot that they won't hit the hero and of course they are so stupid that you have to wonder how they can conquer one of the worlds most guarded buildings. You get what you have come to see, silver screen full of action and explosion. Emmerich keeps things running smoothly and over two hours passes quickly. White House Down is a movie that you won't analyze it too deeply. It is simply entertainment. If you like this kind of brainless entertainment, Then White House Down is perfect for you. If you expect something original and new, then you are better to avoid this movie. White House Down is great entertainment Roland Emmerich style, nothing more or less.***1/2",White House Down
122,ssvfolder-1,Not good enough,5,28 September 2013,"This summer two movies of the same theme came out. One of them was ""Olympus had fallen"" and the second one was ""White house down"". I was actually pleasantly surprised by the first one. Gerrard Buttler was nice adaptation ""Rambo"" type lone wolf inside enemy territory. The whole movie seemed like a great action and I truly enjoyed it. This one, just seems stupid. I like Channing Tatum (at least most of his roles). He's charismatic, simply ""cool"" guy, that lights up the screen. This is not one of his better performances. He does not seem to know how to act as a good father, his daughter overacts it in every scene, and it seems absolutely unreal. The whole situation is so unreal, all the actors overacting it by a mile and the takeover scene is so weak, that this movie might have worked in the 80'th at best. Who cast Jamie Foxx as a president? The guy is usually good - not in this one. He clearly tried to imitate Obama, but he lacks the grace and crowd charisma Obama has. In general just skip this one.",White House Down
123,eschetic-2,Something of a surprise - not for the director's élan but the star's,8,1 July 2013,"OK, lets face it: you go to a Roland Emmerich film, you pretty much know what you're going to get. His most memorable efforts (INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, 2012) are exercises in blowing up either the entire world or major parts of major cities. The thing is, while this may not exactly be great art, he does it awfully well.I did not rush to WHITE HOUSE DOWN, in part because the previews looked more than a little silly blowing up the Capitol Building and the White House for undisclosed reasons, in part because I have until now found myself in the minority which has been unimpressed with Channing Tatum's most discussed attributes. He always struck me, even in MAGIC MIKE which moved him into the category of ""bankable"" motion picture performers, as a somewhat bland but gentle football player type who could say his lines and not trip over the furniture but little more. Still, this last Saturday I was in the mood for a film, WHITE HOUSE DOWN was the next show going up and it sounded like harmless fun. As it turned out it was considerably more than that - as was its star.The key is in the usual controlled excess of the director and the finesse of writer James Vanderbilt in taking a potentially over the top roman a clef (every character is pointedly supposed to remind you of a real life counterpart from a current admirable president and first lady to an evil former Vice President and everywhere in between) and with just the proper blend of literate humor and warm *believable* family values (not the kind divorced ""conservatives"" talk about but the dynamic of a father trying to impress his alienated daughter) building a fast paced action thriller around them - moving just fast enough that you don't have time to notice holes in the plot (even as you are laughing at ironic incongruities like a chase scene across the White House lawn!).Playing to Tatum's strength - the gentle giant thing - we are given a highly flawed hero who is desperate to be a hero to his daughter and a plot which lets them both wind up as heroes. There ARE the inevitable lapses in credibility, but not necessarily in the places where the viewer might expect them (the central ""evil plot"" which threatens to provoke WWIII seems far fetched on the surface, but anyone who grew up in the District of Columbia or around enough military men will know how believable it actually is). The White House Tour Guide is played for laughs and a little heavy handed - but he GETS the laughs and is never demeaned. It's nice to have a throw away character who ISN'T thrown away but adds to what we would like to believe is a sense of reality as it ought to be.On the other hand, only an unregenerate right winger would believe for a moment that the generally responsible news media would reveal a piece of information in ""real time"" (as they do in the film) which would place a hostage in mortal peril - and of course (this one IS so common place you do almost expect it even while hoping for better) there is the dazzling air chase through the famous city, beautifully revealing half a dozen famous landmarks and sights - but with NO attention to continuity or physical reality (I'm not talking about whether the ""birds"" could make it between the buildings, but that they physically COULD NOT pass the all too famous PLACES they are shown passing in the order they are shown!). It's a little thing, but SOMEONE should have cared.So, why is the overall effect of the film so much fun? Well, Emmerich plays to his strengths and destroys everything he can get his hands on with just enough warmth and humor to ground the mayhem, and bland though he may be, Channing Tatum has enough warmth of his own (not the same as charisma, but in this case, close enough) as the father we find ourselves wanting to root for and Jamie Foxx makes a fine stand in for a real president with the strength and humanity enough like the original that we can root for him too.There are a few twists and turns in the fairly uncomplicated plot you may not guess early on, but only a few - and in at least one nice touch left for near the end, even if you HAVE figured it out (and if you haven't you're not trying), Emmerich makes it fun just watching it play out. Yes, it's a ""summer"" movie, but it IS summer and this and a bucket of buttered popcorn is a terrific way to spend a hot afternoon - even better on a big screen with a lot of other people around you sharing the thrill ride.",White House Down
124,julian-mumford,"Weak acting, plotting and bordering on unintentional comedy",4,11 April 2014,"Just like buses, we have no films about the White House being attacked and then suddenly there are two being developed in parallel.Unlike the earlier lesser budgeted ""Olympus Down"", this is the Roland Emmerich version, with money to burn, corn to pop and with no qualms in blowing stuff up real good.Cale (Channing Tatum) is a ex-military type, now part of the security detail for the Speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins). Life is easy, despite separation from his partner, the somewhat strained relationship with his daughter Emily (Joey King) and the need to draw his pistol on a squirrel.Like most teenagers Joey is sullen, sulks a lot and dislikes everyone, like forever. Unusually and rather improbably, she does like politics, especially Obama lookalike President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). Dad will become a hero once more, if he can only score tour passes for the White House.Cale manages to combine the trip with a quick interview with old flame/buddy Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaall), in a doomed attempt to move onto the Presidential security detail. Following what must be worst interview of the year, it is obvious that he should enjoy his time in the White House, he may not be back any time soon.Meanwhile, bad guy's in overalls alert. Instead of improving the audio in the White House cinema room, the right-wing influenced baddies have some sub-woofer bass of their own to add. It's no spoiler but whenever anyone leaves for work and says, ""I will be home late but you know that I love you"", either they are devoted husband or a potential terrorist. Walker head of White House security (James Wood) proving this theory rather neatly here.President Walker is negotiating nothing less than peace in the Middle East, so has plenty of time for getting the Marine 1 choppers to do the ""thing"", swooping low through down-town Washington DC on his way home, solely for his enjoyment.Of course the road to Middle East peace is fraught with dangers, encountering terrorists in the Oval office being but one. Luckily when the chips are down Cale is there to help Sawyer save the world and the American way.The film starts as a updated version of Die Hard in the White House, including white shirts, lift shafts and so forth, before descending half way through into almost parody. Instead of a thriller the film borders on outright comedy, whether this is intentional by all concerned is debatable.Later with the presidential limo careering around the gardens, President brandishing a rocket launcher out the window, someone says ""you don't see that everyday"". No you do not, not in any half decent movie anyway. There are too many scenes in a short review to poke fun at but certainly the final sequence, bearing in mind all that has happened before, is so incredulous one must question the term ""Writer"" before James Vanderbilt's name in IMDb.Tatum is OK in a square jawed, wooden type of way. Gyllenhall tries hard with a frankly implausible role and James Wood does his best but knows he is beaten. Jimmie Nelson as mad hacker Tyler just rehashes other screen-roles and achieves little. Central Bad guy duty falls to Jason Clark who does at least seem willing to make a half hearted attempt. However, Joey King is perhaps the only actor to come out with any credit, acting under duress she does evoke a sliver of emotion, something all other actors fail to generate.We must however reserve some separate criticism for Foxx, with a role that must surely represent one of the worst of his career. Clearly not knowing whether to play the character straight or as a buffoon, settling for somewhere between. Not presidential in anyway and without a shred of real feeling in any scenes he attempts. Harrison Ford would have kicked his butt, straight off Air Force One. Arguably a good drinking game would be ""who is not sworn in as President"" by the end of the movie.This is the worse kind of lazy movie making, throwing a huge budget at the screen with no thought on what you are attempting to achieve. Disappointing on every conceivable level, apart from maybe set creations, which are impressive. The film also attempts to tastelessly mix in contemporary world politics and the sacrifices made by those in the armed forces, with dubious results.Poor box office barely covering production costs before marketing, proved that not even the causal movie goer was fooled. This may prove a low water mark for director Emmerich, those trusting him with millions of dollars for two Independence Day sequels (ID Forever I and II), obviously have nerves of steel.Summary If you really must watch a film about an attack on the White House, then Watch ""Olympus Down"" which at least is adequate.Weak acting, plotting and bordering on unintentional comedy this fails to deliver. Unless you are a hardcore Tatum fan or studying movie making and require a lesson in ""how not to make a big budget film"", spend your movie watching dollar elsewhere.",White House Down
125,Camoo,Emmerich's best film,9,25 September 2013,"I've often found that previous Roland Emmerich films take themselves too seriously. Though a lot of them are tremendously fun - no denying - there's a feeling of unevenness of tone, and contain too many flaccid attempts at sincerity and heroism. He never struck me as a real 'director' with more talent than just staging elaborate and expensive effect sequences. Finally I feel that Emmerich is giving in, and fully enjoying his role as over the top schlockmeister director. White House Down has a boundless energy and takes great joy in itself.

126,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,Great American film - a must see for American patriots.,10,7 February 2021,"Interesting about this film is, that the danger to bring down the White House came not from foreign enemies, but rather from domestic hostiles - disguised as patriots - but who temporarily brought down the White House nonetheless. However, luckily there was a very competent CIA chief and a brave American hero - who against all odds- reclaimed the White House, and thereby giving the USA the great gift of reinventing itself and making America even stronger than before - like the Phoenix rising from the ashes!
Also, for those viewers who are not so familiar with the American constitution and American law, this film gives a good insight what kind of stuff the American President can do.
PS: Although there is some resemblance about this film to recent past events in the US, I want to emphasize that I still think that Donald Trump - as an American patriot - did quite a good job as former US president, working well with NGO activists such as myself to improve the world. So hopefully his supporters will behave better in the future, so that his legacy will remain positive for future American patriots :)",White House Down

Unfortunate but true. Alas...at any rate, this was a good action picture. Jamie Foxx is believable as president and Channing Tatum is very good as a wanna-be, forced-to-be, Secret Service protector of the president.

He is the central part of this film, its heart and soul, and it is he who is the true star of the motion picture. Sadly, the story is ridiculous but Woods makes the audience believe what is taking place is indeed possible with the power and skill of a veteran actor of magnificent stature.

It was evident that this was going to be an over the top, unrealistic, nauseatingly patriotic action film. It's just like Ronseal. (Does exactly what it says on the tin; UK reference).So when people come on IMDb and sink their teeth in it can only mean one of two things. Either they didn't see the trailer and went in expecting a masterpiece, but even then the cast is a big clue to what you're going to get so that would point to that person being slightly gullible. Or they are glutton for criticism. Now yes, the plot is mind boggling to some degree, and some of the things that happen make your nose bleed with bewilderment, but it was always going to be like that. Now i wouldn't have stepped foot in the cinema if it wasn't for my trusty Unlimited Card, because i seen the trailer and i knew what it was going to be like; cars flipping onto swimming pools and cheesy lines from the cheesy actors in their cheesy roles. And some downright lazy special effects; there where no ""Must See"" quotations from critics or ""5 star"" proclamations on the adverts. It is an OK film and enjoyable sometimes. The action could be a lot better and the acting is below average and it tries it's best to differentiate from ""Olympus has Fallen"" by trying to dilute the ""intense"" going-ons with a lame attempt at comedy. All in all if you have a Unlimited card or have a free pass to the cinema (and have seen every other film) that runs out soon then go and see it.

138,tstudstrup,Roland Emmerich the patriot,1,6 February 2019,"Roland Emmerich is actually german, but his love for America should grant him an american citizinship.This is the worst movie he has ever made. The only two really good movies he has ever made is Independence Day and Universal Soldier.The latter: a scifi movie about supersoldiers starring Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. That says it all.
Ive always enjoyed the special effects in Emmerichs movies, but nothing else in his natural disaster movies. Mostly because they feel like soap operas. Both story and acting wise.*SPOILERS AHEAD*And then there is White House Down. A generic boring PG13 actionmovie with awful acting all around and so much patriotism, I felt like throwing up. It even has an annoying bratty kid, who along with her dad ends up saving the white house from really stupid terrorists, that are so over the top evil, that its ridicuous.The terrorists are mostly mercenaries and their boss is the chief of security detail, played believable by James Woods. The only one doing a descent job. Even Emmerich cant make James Woods act bad. His characters motivations for attacking the president and taking over the white house are really stupid.
Jason Clarke is so ugly and as always a terrible actor. He plays the second in command badguy after Woods.Maggie Gyllenhall is almost as ugly and annoying as she always is.Jamie Foxxx is the least believable president ever portrayed in a movie. An insult to the real first black president Obama. Who was still president at the time. Had they hired Denzel Washington, it might have been bearable.Channing Tatum does what he can with the stupid lines and the lousy directing.Joey King as his bratty daughter is the most annoying kid in a movie since Kevin in The Home Alone movies. There are two scenes where the badguys have the chance to kill her. They dont. Unfortunately.Richard Jenkins plays the cliche government-man, for what must be the 200th time in his career.This movie has very little actual violence, almost no blood, do to the rating, which makes it even more boring. Many of the actionscenes, including at least one explosion and some Black Hawk helicopters are awful cgi.But the worst part is the before mentioned patriotism. The annoying daughter has a model of the white house in her room, we get to hear the entire history of the white house, including when it burned down and how a paintin of that fire, moves an annoying tour-guide. Were even told in details about whats on the grounds in the white house park. And later on there is a moronic car-chase where Channing and Jamie are being chased in the presidents car, which is named Ground Force One. I kid you not. A news helicopter films the chase and the reporter has to comment on the ""iconic"" fountain in the park as the cars passes it.In the same movie that is way too long, we even get the vice president as well as the vicepresidents next in command sworn in as new presidents. And Air Force One is shot out of the sky.I recommend skipping this one and watch Olympus has fallen instead. It came out the same year. For some reason, Hollywood always has to make two movies with the same story. One is always great and the other one is always terrible. Just like with Tombstone and Wyatt Earpp. Its the same thing here with White House and Olympus. Olympus however has a lot more action, its rated R, so its really violent. The actionscenes are exciting and better done and it has better badguys and even though both movies has a running time of two hours, in Oympus we dont have to wait 40 minutes before the action begins.",White House Down
139,albrechtcm,Same ol' same 'ol,5,9 November 2013,"I've long had a theory that too many filmmakers go to those famous Hollywood parties and, after a few drinks and a few lines of coke, can't resist talking about the project they have in development. Their listeners, full of drinks and lines of coke as well, go home and wake up about noon the next day with this great idea for a film and they can't wait to get it into development, little realizing their great idea came from the haze of last night's conversations. White House Down appears to be one of those, or perhaps it's the other way around. This film and Olympus Has Fallen appear to have been made from the same script as seen through the eyes of two different directors. We have the president with his antique watch. Check. We have a frightened child in mortal danger playing hide and seek through the WH with the bad guys. Check. We have a White House where security is so tight a mouse can't get in without three forms of ID including a picture,thumbprint and eye recognition, yet it's a place where bad guys routinely have free and welcome access. (They were quite obvious to us, the audience, but the secret service remained blissfully unaware of their presence. And the bad guys had more sophisticated weaponry and computer technology than our armed forces, plus of course their very own obligatory narcissistic computer geek. Check We have secret service agents who are helpless and completely lost in the face of an emergency. They stand around looking concerned and talking into their wrists. Check. We have a traitor among them of course. Check. We have a safe room that is about as safe as a closet where the prisident might hide praying that he wouldn't have to sneeze. Check. And we have the wannabe secret service reject that just happens by mere chance to be on the scene. Check. He has more moxie, endurance and patriotism than all The Expendables together. Check. We have a satisfactory ending. Check. The brightest light in this film was the sparky WH tour guide (Nicolas Wright). In both these films there is plenty of action and evidently the producers figured that's all the public wants. Maybe they're right. But action isn't everything. These sorts of double exposure coincidences happen too often in the movie business. That's the reason for my pet theory. There was McCloud and Coogan's Bluff just off the top of my head. Over the years there have been many like that. You sit down and dig into the popcorn and suddenly, ""Whoa. Didn't I just see this two weeks ago?""

140,theemuhammede,More of a comedy instead of action,7,14 May 2016,"This movie was good, but it had two major disappointments to it. This was more of a comedy movie than it was an action movie. It made the Secret Service and the White House defenses appear to be extremely weak.Humor in movies is fine, but too much of it in an action movie takes away from the focus of the choreography of each of the sequences. It also did not make sense to have so much humor in a time when the White House is being taken over and countless people are being killed.The Secret Service were taken down so incredibly quick, and it was annoying. They were portrayed as if the Navy SEALS went up against a group of teenagers. They were literally annihilated in no time at all. It was pathetic.Other than those two things, the movie was fine. The story had a nice twist to it in regards to who was responsible for organizing the attack on the White House. It was completely unexpected.",White House Down

It feels a like a throwback to action movies of the 80s/90s but with better special effects. I don't really like Channing Tatum or Jamie Foxx but I thought the cast were really good. My biggest complaint is that the ending was way too cringey.,White House Down

143,capelladewdrop,Great Comedy,7,29 July 2015,"So the president can target any city on the planet at any time he wants from his laptop? That's the laugh that made this whole movie worth watching.A clear rival to 'Olympus has Fallen' but with much more cheesy scenes especially at the end and a president who's supposed to be a duplicate of Obama I wouldn't take this movie seriously it was clearly meant to be a comedy and the bad guys had no clear motive for what they were doing. They demanded a ransom of $400million but it was repeated several times that it wasn't about the money and we were never told what their real motive was, apart from being given some hint that it might be due to insanity in the leader because of a golf ball size tumor in his frontal lobe.We also see a completely pointless scene where Air Force One gets shot down. Maybe it's to stop us getting bored?",White House Down
144,aldri-feb,Overlong and mostly predictable,4,27 June 2013,"After being successful on making some big-budget blockbuster movies such as 'Independence Day', 'The Day After Tomorrow' and '2012', Roland Emmerich continues his work by creating the fallen on White House in 'White House Down'. 'White House Down' is about John Cale, a policeman who applied job as Secret Service for guarding USA President and at once bringing his daughter to see White House. Unfortunately they visit at the wrong time, a group of terrorist was there to overtake White House and ready to blow up some countries. John Cale with his experience in the field, must save USA President and her daughter who is hostaged. There is no something fresh from 'White House Down', it's so predictable, overlong and too dramatized. Most of it is boring, dumb and feeling exhausted during watching the film. The problem is, there are two movies about terrorism in White House this year ('White House Down' and 'Olympus Has Fallen')which both of them is inevitably compared. Compared with 'White House Down', 'Olympus Has Fallen' is more serious, brutal, tense and in almost every aspect above 'White House Down', except in visual effect. On casts, Gerrard Butler-Aaron Eckhart also has more charisma than Channing Tatum-Jamie Fox. This time Roland Emmerich fails to bring impacts like he used to do in some of his movies. There are many weakness in 'White House Down' and motive of attacking the White House is too silly I think. Overall, 'White House Down' is one of the most disappointing summer movie this year. Watching this movie is wasting time and money. Just watch a better version of the attacking at White House in 'Olympus Has Fallen', it's more real and fun.Ratings 4/10",White House Down
145,shinsrevenge,Could be better,6,28 July 2018,"""White House Down"" is an okay movie. Funnier than ""Olympus has fallen"", with less action/special effects and a thinner story. The people in the movie joke around often, which makes it kind of entertaining, but it lacks any real tension.Two things stood out in this movie. James Woods' great performance as a likeable and complex villain on the one side and the weak end on the other. Trained pilots, carrying out the presidents order to prevent a global nuclear war, abort their mission because they spot a girl weaving a flag. Sounds legit.I give the movie a 6 out of 10. It won't really bore you and will do the trick if you have nothing better to watch, but don't expect too much.",White House Down
146,arnieiam,Um Yea.... This is totally Die Hard,6,7 July 2013,"Look, I personally found this film enjoyable despite knowing the director has this weird fetish of destroying American landmarks. Hey, at least he found a way to make it a plot point. As with any Emmerich film I watch it for the effects but sadly you don't get to see a wide variety since the film is geographically limited in plot, but they're still visually awesome.As with any Emmerich film, the characterization is pretty much non- existent. Although I will say Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx have chemistry. It did take me a while to buy Jamie Foxx as the President because of his comedic and musical background and its not his thing playing an articulated soft spoken guy. But then Jamie Foxx spoke in Russian and I was sold. Channing Tatum on the other hand, he seems to be having fun. The dude's now an action star why wouldn't he? The rest of the cast was good enough, Maggie Gyllenhal, James Woods, the guy from Zero Dark Thirty. Oh but I actually got really excited when I saw Lance Reddick, that's right Cedric Daniels from The Wire. That dude really nails chain of command parts.OK, so the similarities to Die Hard here we go. The most blatant one is the fact the posters show Channing Tatum with a gun in a wife beater. He has a family member taken hostage (and the media reveals to the terrorists who she is, seriously why are they stupid in these films?). He kills one of the baddie's best friends. There's a computer nerd who steals something for the baddies while all the explosions are happening. And get this, classical music plays while hes doing the computer stuff. The terrorists motives are not what they seem. And in the climax, there are helicopters, and a roof showdown where even Channing Tatum is mistaken for a terrorist.This movie is not at all original (although I do remember a particular moment where the wife of one of the terrorists actually condones his actions, pretty funny), but its great escapism.",White House Down
147,jcallows,lower your expectations. and then lower it some more.,5,20 December 2013,"""Oh my god! The quarterback is toast!"" was what I was expecting to hear at some point in the movie. Reviewers commented that Olympus Has Fallen was like a Die Hard set in the White House but after seeing this, White House Down WAS Die Hard in the White House. It came complete with a crew of bad guys with ulterior motives, a cocky computer hacker, a guy at the wrong place and at the wrong time, and a hostage he deeply cared about.Just because White House Down was another Die Hard wasn't a bad thing. Olympus Has Fallen was another Die Hard and I still liked it. The problem with White House Down was the cast, script and the PG rating. Let's start with the cast. Jamie Fox was unconvincing as president. He was too young, too angry and never appeared presidential. Then there's Channing Tatum. He has the charisma of a lamp shade. There's no way he can carry a movie, which was why he was teamed with Fox. He was wisely paired with another star, but unfortunately, it was the wrong star. Fox was miscast for his role and there was little chemistry between the two. The script was weak. No clever lines said here. And the restraint and act of compassion shown by the bad guys made them appear rather benevolent. Add the lack of graphic violence to the not-so-bad bad guys and you have a PG rated, made-for-TV feel of a movie that lacked any real suspense.James Woods was great, as always, and so was Maggie Gyllenhaal. And the story did have an interesting revenge aspect to it. But these weren't enough to keep me from being bored. Making things worse was this film's runtime of over 2 hours. In short, if you have to see just one White House disaster movie, go see Olympus Has Fallen.",White House Down
148,because-of-him,Political trash...,1,6 July 2014,"Jamie Foxx is the worst actor for this movie. He acts silly and overacts while imitating President Obama. It mocks politicians and law enforcement. This is the main reason the movie fails, i.e., it does not display the truth. It also mocks Rush Limbaugh and conservatives. Note, I am not a conservative: I hate both RipThePublicAns AND DemonCrats. The entire script of the movie is not credible and thus the movie falls flat. A better and more credible film is Olympus Has Fallen, but it too is lacks credibility as when the enemy is armed to the teeth...really? A problem in both movies it the political correctness. Neither wants to portray any Muslim terrorists. White House Down wants to say that Americans are worse than Islamic terrorists. May I suggest a very good movie, Executive Decision, made in 1996? It is very believable and 10 points ahead of this movie which should be renamed, White House, The Downer.",White House Down
149,jmmustchin,Now THAT'S a movie!,9,4 June 2018,"Despite the negative reviews you've no doubt seen, White House Down is actually a really good (not to mention tense and exciting) action thriller. Paramilitary terrorists have taken over the White House, and are lead by the head of the President's security detail! There are a few surprising twists and turns, which I will not spoil. Needless to say, see this movie for yourself! It's violent, but not graphic. They also have some good humourous moments. While there are some cliched moments, they don't detract from the movie overall. And when you think about it, how many movies DON'T have cliched moments or elements? A VERY good movie!",White House Down

I kinda didn't watch the movie for this long because I thought I had already seen it.Turns out, it was Olympus Has Fallen, the movie released in the same year with same premise. It says a lot about Hollywood, A LOT.The plot is same, a white guy saves the president of the United States and thus, saves the world (cause Mericah! is the world). Filled with average performances and average action scenes, there isn't anything new here. Though I DO think the action and CGI in this movie is slightly better than Olympus (bigger budget is my guess).Meh! Going to give it same rating as Olympus.",White House Down
151,slicedbread117,"The second best ""White House has been captured"" movie of 2013.",6,16 December 2013,"If you couldn't tell by my title, there was another movie released in 2013 before White House Down with the exact same premise as this film. Being the second best movie of two with the same super-clichéd plot doesn't fare well for any film, including White House Down.There is arguably no bigger cliché than the most secure building on Earth being overrun, so a movie that adapts this premise needs to make sure they know what they're doing and unfortunately, WHD does not. The plot never makes itself clear, at least in terms of the bad guys and there are twists that overall make the film a sometimes puzzling piece of work. I believe that it is the script itself that has too many holes thus creating a movie with several holes as well. The overall concept behind this film is pretty dull to say the least.Obviously a movie like this is going to have a plethora of action, and there is plenty of it here. The action can be viewed in two ways: if you try to take the movie seriously, then the action is painfully dull and clichéd, to a point where it leaves the ""it's so bad it's good"" realm. However, if you end up watching the film with the notion in mind that this is one big dumb action movie that you can laugh at, then sure, it could have a lot of entertainment value. I love a good action movie that turns clichés into awesome, bad ass moments, but WHD fails to deliver that with poorly edited action all around.Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx give the film a couple high profile names, but the chemistry just isn't there to provide the movie with any extra sense of emotion or depth. Tatum's character is sometimes just not the action hero you want to see, but also can be a pleasant surprise and show some entertainment. As the President of the United States, Jamie Foxx also does a okay job, providing some laughs but overall not very interesting.It's not easy to compete head-to-head with another similarly themed movie in the same year, with White House Down having to go up against ""Olympus Has Fallen"". While there might be some flashes of solid entertainment value, White House Down's poor script, undeveloped and uninteresting characters and action that overall isn't that great gives Olympus the edge in the year's ""which White House movie is better?"" debate.6/10",White House Down

I actually thought the action sequences snd last ten minutes were pretty decent, but you gotta wonder about the behind-the-scenes politics when one movie studio is simultaneously producing an identical film from other - wasn't ""Olympus Has Fallen"" released three months before this one? It's tricky not to make comparisons. I seem to recall the same thing happening with two Wyatt Earp movies a while ago. No big deal.Mr Tatum is certainly younger than Mr Butler and maybe that's the appeal here, but I kind of though Mr Foxx was pretty cool in this, as well as Mr Woods & Ms Gylenhall. Hey, that's the guy from the John Wick movies.Oh yeah, the White is taken over by bad military people and Mr Tatum thwarts their plans. Okie dokie. You can argue plot points & stuff, but so what? That's what makes movies fun. There's enough action here to make it okay, and maybe make you think about watching ""Under Seige"" again.",White House Down
153,SteveMierzejewski,White House 2 Thumbs Down,4,30 July 2013,"The good news is that this is a pretty good comedy. The bad news is I think it's supposed to be an action movie. Actually, I'm not really sure if the director or actors are quite sure of what kind of movie they were making. At times, it seems like the actors are suppressing smiles in what should be dramatic moments. That brings up the ultimate question: Why did good actors accept roles in this movie? Aren't they getting better offers? Certainly, being in a movie like this can't advance their careers, just the opposite. My favorite actor in this movie was Lance Reddick (General Caulfield) who does a convincing portrayal of a talking statue. So what did I get from this movie? Well, first of all, I learned that it's relatively easy to break into the White House with all kinds of weapons, including missiles. You know, you'd think they'd spot this but, I suppose budget cuts are to blame. You kind of know where this is going when Channing Tatum (Cale) brings his irritating daughter, played by Joey King, to a big White House event. You know she's going to do some amazingly stupid things and cause a lot of problems for everyone, but, you're, I guess, supposed to think she's so charming and perky that you forgive her. Well, I kept hoping she would be hit by a stray bullet, but, no luck. In fact everyone gets killed in one shot except Channing Tatum who is more indestructible than Superman. Some of the action scenes are, quite frankly, hilarious. But, without the special effects, some of which are good, I would have rated this lower.Anyway, if you're a fan of fairy tales, this may be a movie for you. But, to be honest, Humpty Dumpty had more unexpected plot twists.",White House Down
154,travisvincent,Die Hard in the White House,5,22 September 2013,"White House Down. Oh, where do I begin? WHD is strictly a formula film. The first 30mins or so is about character development and then the action begins. Let me start with the story line. Its weak with obvious holes in the plot. Essentially the plot is this: Foreign terrorists take over the White House trapping the President, a handful of hostages and a Private security guy (Channing T.) The action is pretty good but very implausible. After about midway through you realize you're watching a remake of Die Hard except it's in the White House. You have the foreigners who somehow are able to access private parts of the White House, which you know is locked tighter than Fort Knox. Second, Channing Tatum, while pretty to look at, cannot act his way out of a box. The acting by everyone is just horrible, but considering the script they probably didn't have much to work with. The odd thing about WHD was though it wasn't that great, it did hold my attention. I haven't seen Olympus Has Fallen but I've read the reviews on here that say it's the better of the two. We shall see.",White House Down
155,starbase202,An alternate ending could have led to many sequels,7,19 June 2015,"Maybe I have lived too long inside the DC Beltway and watched too many boring movies about DC. But I think the movie's ending could have been made much more interesting 'below the belt' - in line with current American society trends, and led to many sequels with the following alternate scenes: 1) While Cale is tending to the President's injuries they look into each other's eyes and then kiss passionately; and 2) As they fly away from the White House in the helicopter they again look into each other's eyes and then hold hands - Cale's daughter sees this and then smiles knowingly. On another note, I have toured the White House many times and was astounded at how accurately it was depicted. However, I must admit I have never been in the 'Residence' areas.

157,razvan-rogoz,"Huge potential, dramatic failure",5,24 July 2013,"It is hard to review such a movie.It is hard because you'll have to compare it with Olympus Has Fallen and even if it may be a good movie on itself, in comparison, it lacks a lot. So I'll try to give my best objective review.Olympus Has Fallen has a far more darker tone. It's more serious, more dramatic and lacks comical relief. White House Down has a lot of funny scenes in it, ranging from the amusing to the absurd. However, what White House Down lacks compared to Olympus Has Fallen and any good action movie is ... * A strong plot. There are plot holes so big you can drive a tank through them. I'm not talking about small elements of suspension of disbelief. I'm talking about how 12 people can take down 50 secret agents or so in less than five minutes, not to mention struggled weapons in what supposed to be the safest building in the world. * Pacing. The last 15 minutes or so were amazing. If at some points of the movie I was waiting for it to end and playing on my phone, the ending was so fast paced and so fulfilling that it made the entire movie A LOT better. * Being realistic. I don't expect it to be a documentary but even old Chuck Norris movies are more realistic than this. Ranging from the fact that 50 secret agents failed to take down even one mercenary to the fact that in the last 15 minutes, the hero transformed into some kind of predator and took down half of the terrorists ... to the fact that the are four damn snipers on the building and no one took them out ... to the lack of a strong military response and so on ... it simply lacked any kind of credibility. * Half of the movie, actually, more than half you don't know what the heck is going on. If in Olympus Has Fallen you get the point right away, here you get ACT 1 and ACT 3. * Actually bad special effects. How much did this movie had cost? 200 million? For 200 million you expect some better effects. * And finally, the trailer was very misleading. You know the scenes from the trailer? They account for 80% of all the good scenes in the entire movie.So this movie was dumb, bad execution, scenario with HUGE potential which lacked to deliver (actually, it seemed that adding a story was an afterthought). The good parts - the acting, the audio, the marketing :)If you want to see a good paced, darker, techno-thriller that will both entertain and make you think, watch Olympus has Fallen.

The White House is under siege in this action thriller from Independence Day director Roland Emmerich and The Amazing Spider-Man's writer James Vanderbilt in this Sony Pictures release. Channing Tatum stars. ~( Jeremy Wheeler, Rovi) The movie came out at a really bad time: cause we already got our White House Destruction fix with Olympus Has Fallen earlier this year. Just cause you add Magic Mike and Django doesn't mean we are gonna watch the same movie twice. And at least Olympus Has Fallen was a good movie, this is just plain mediocre. I'll just quickly list the good stuff: The leads have good chemistry, the acting is good, and the special effects are decent. The bad? EVERYTHING ELSE. Unlike Olympus, which took itself very seriously, which worked to that film's benefit, this film's tone is all over the bloody place. One minute it is supposed to be all ""Hoo hah America"", then next it is all dark and serious, then it becomes a comedy. No rhyme or reason, but the tonal shifts make it hard for me to get into the action. Speaking of which the action scenes here are edited horribly, like seriously stop shaking the goddamn camera. And to top it all off the script is a cliché ridden and poorly plotted mess. Let me just clarify: I don't hate the movie. It isn't an awful movie, just plain mediocre.

161,varnium,Great Movie,10,5 July 2013,"Ignore all other reviews that despise this movie. White House Down is a great movie! The story is dynamic and keeps you in awe all the time.Compared to ""Olympus has Fallen"", this is more varied and not streamlined. The story is quite logical when you found out that it take a lot of people involved, even closest ones to the president, to take down the White House in an organized way. Whereas in the ""Olympus has Fallen"" movie, it doesn't really make sense if the entire White House Security mechanism can be easily breached because one of the secret service agent is a traitor. How does he know everything if he's only 1 agent? It also doesn't make sense knowing the fact that all terrorist are from Korea. How did they smuggle the heavy weaponry to Washington D.C? So in short, in terms of storyline, White House Down is more reasonable.But it does have some drawbacks. In this film, it seems so easy to cripple the White House. Not much security team or special forces are around the White House. Whereas in Olympus has Fallen, there are so many people getting killed just to protect the president and the White House. And also, the president character does not really act like a true American president. He's more appropriate to be a comedian instead.",White House Down

But more importantly, the casting as the main hero and villains are better in OHF. Channing Tatum just isn't good in an action role and isn't relateable. whereas Gerard Butler is solid in his role and convincing as an action hero. The villains in OHF are North Koreans who take over the white house which make for a more realistic and understandable plot than a bunch of right wing mercenaries who have convoluted motivations. Action wise, OHF is much more brutal and bloody. the opening hour packs more action in it than the entire 2 hour borefest of WHD. I also prefer the more serious tone of OHF compared to this PG version which is more of a joke than anything (Air Jordan scene = ridiculous).Overall, I'd say OHF is the better popcorn film. It's a fast paced, action packed, kick a$$ movie whereas WHD makes Die Hard 5 look good. I wish I hadn't wasted my 2 hours on this flop.3/10",White House Down
163,CinemaCocoa,Emmerich delivers another entertaining action blockbuster,6,12 July 2014,"Probably one of blockbuster-director Roland Emmerich's better movies over the last ten years or more, White House Down ticks all the boxes as a solid action film.John Cale (Channing Tatum) is a man out to prove himself to his wife and emotionally distant daughter by signing up to become one of the US President's (Jamie Foxx) bodyguards. But just as he is declined, his chances arises when the White House is taken over from the inside by terrorists and everyone inside is held hostage.It is undeniable that the comparisons to Olympus has Fallen are rife with reviewers, both films released last year with barely a month between them (one of the reasons I wanted to review both back-to-back). There are weirdly similar elements besides the blatantly obvious (the titles are effectively the same!) both have scenes referring to the British attack on the White House from American history, and I'm sure both have a villain say the line: ""Welcome to my house"".For all its infrequent cheesiness and let's be honest here, ""Emmerichisms"", this film is better paced and has more emotional connection than its overly-serious counterpart. The setup feels more believable (incredibly, considering the tonal differences of both films!) our villains appear to have a thought out plan, the heroes become tied into the action with actual reasons. Heck, I even felt these characters were actually vulnerable, unlike the scenery-chewing Gerald Butler. Sure, when action hero Cale teams up with the US President we get quips, we get wise cracks and the film starts to become a surreal buddy action movie that... for all intensive purposes... makes no realistic sense. But at least White House Down runs with it, it knows what it is: a bit of entertainment!(there's no overbearing and trumpeting score, or any all-praise-America baggage here!)It is by far a good movie, its characters are pretty stock, the action and effects aren't actually as good as Olympus in my opinion, and it may have been a little long in the tooth by the end. But it has good pacing otherwise and doesn't feel restricted by its own presence and gravity. The levity comes from the dialogue, both from heroes and villains.Like with Olympus, I doubt I will remember this film for much longer, but I can tell you right now that this film was more enjoyable and... paradoxically for Emmerich... felt more genuine than the serious-toned alternative.A bit of high grade action fun, the sort of thing Emmerich is good for, without the ghastly ham-fisted nature of his worst movies!",White House Down

So I will continue with my review. First of the action scenes looks like two men having having a game of pull and push. Why did they play such loud music during action scenes? it made it less entertaining, annoying and it hurts the ears. The acting is also amateurish and boring.

Olympus adopted a serious tone with the North Koreans as the bad guys while this film cheekily reduces it to a action comedy throwing in big budget special effects.Roland Emmerich makes big budget disaster films, if you want to produce a film where an Armageddon is averted by a heroic American then this German is the go-to guy.This time his tone is very tongue in cheek, he gives us a film that refuses to take itself seriously and is downright campy is parts.His bad guys are hopeless parodies of bad guys and his good guys are goofy and ernest.There is not an ounce of credibility in the plot and the dialogues are downright cheesy.But this film is delicious in a ""Its so bad that its good"" way.Read Full Review on mostlycinema.com",White House Down

171,tiffanyyongwt,John Cale has just been denied his dream job with the Secret Service of protecting President.,9,26 June 2013,"This whole movie has been quite real yet really funny. The strained relationship between a father and growing daughter from divorced family, how he tries to be involved in her life, and pretend to know about what she does; the harsh fact about how jobs (even the secret service) requires high education level. This movie has the action, it has the comedy, it has touching moments and all the unexpected twists you need to get you saying, ""What? NO WAY!"" There are many GREAT scenes which I would love to share, but would spoil the surprise, so watch it to appreciate it!Channing Tatum, first know him from the movie 10 Years, I'm glad that he had gotten back the buff for the movie. I liked the particular scene when he was first cornered by the paramilitary group in the girls' toilet (when he was searching for his daughter), he cried and begged for help to use it as a cover. That really got me, and it's one of those scenes that I nearly said ""Bravo!"" The whole movie plot is somewhat like ""Taken"", where the dad is skilled (John Cale aka Channing Tatum is not as skilled as Bryan Mills aka Liam Neeson though) but a rejected applicant for the Secret service. The daughter was held hostage and what made White House Down a little more interesting was how the President is in action himself (You know how Presidents are usually protected and a puppet in most action films)For more, visit: http://tiffanyyong.com/2013/06/24/white-house-down-movie-review/",White House Down

174,Incendid,This movie can be summed up into three words 'white house promo',4,7 September 2013,"Jacob: White House Down is another Roland Emmerich movie meaning that disaster and action overwhelm the logic and intelligence of the movie. While this is in no way as bad as 2012 it is still not a terrific movie. I was expecting to get ""Die Hard in the White House"" but I instead got Michael Bay in a White House promo for some tourist campaign or History channel show. Other than a good action scene or two with some intense moments and the occasional funny joke, this film drags. The film is way longer than it should be. It starts slow and you think this time would be filled with character introduction right? Hmmm... We do not get to know the characters in any way. They are 2D dimensional cut-outs. The time period spent between one action scene in one place can make you forget about our leading characters. I suddenly found myself going, ""Oh yeah, Tatum and Jamie Fox are in this movie, eh?"" This seems to be a staple of a lot of Emmerich movies: big cast, lots of characters but little depth. There is an incredibly cheesy ending that made me cringe. It involves a peace treaty that is established in the beginning of the film and is cleared up in 5 minutes coincidentally after the attack on the White House. Then the remaining heroes do ""the thing"" which is basically flying over a building... ummm. Overall, average and shallow, hit and miss visuals, good action. 5/10Ciaran: White House Down, a copycat movie of Olympus has fallen fails to capture the audience in many ways including the lack of emotional connection that the audience has to the main character, also the lack of logical and cohesive plot and the slow but long running time of the movie in which the story fails to capture the attention of audiences. White House Down also disappoints with visual and special effects reminding us who is directing this film, Emmerich, like most of his other disappointing films, White House Down is just a film that will occupy a Saturday night for most audiences. In short, White House Down is just a disappointing low-budget action flick that will not be remembered in the long run. 5/10",White House Down

176,andre_rox99,"Great Chemistry, Good Comedy, Good Action AND clichés.",8,29 June 2013,"WHITE HOUSE DOWN is an action/comedy film directed by Roland Emmerich, starring Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx.The film revolves around John Cale, who tries to save his daughter, and in the bargain, ends up protecting President Sawyer while the White House is under attack by a group of invaders.So, we all know that White House Down is EXACTLY the same story as Olympus Has Fallen. The White House is under attack, and there will always be ONE GUY who can save the whole place while the trained military get killed. Fantastic. But, anyways, both these films are actually fun!White House Down has a smooth delivery with lots of clichés, along with some PG-13 action and quite a few laughs. The thing that actually causes White House Down to achieve its goal are two things: the chemistry and the comedy.The chemistry between Channing Tatum's role and Jamie Foxx's is EXTREMELY good, and proves as a plus point. I really don't know, but when you see these two together, cracking their jokes, doing their thing, like launching rockets and stuff, you cant help but smile and go like, ""Yep, they're doing it right...""The comedy is the sole item that differentiates Olympus Has Fallen from White House Down. While OHF has quite a serious tone throughout with some dark humor here and there, WHD has some funny moments during the action scenes which give a more enjoyable experience. However, in some areas of the film, the shuffle between serious and comical couldn't be balanced, so I don't think they thought that through.I would prefer Olympus Has Fallen over White House Down because it offers a more serious tone, whereas White House Down is fun, but lacks that serious punch that Olympus Has Fallen has... the brutal action, the serious tone, it rather makes you believe that the White House is under attack.Overall, I would say White House Down is a great time. Its no Olympus Has Fallen. But it is the PG-13 version of it with good chemistry and good comedy. Go watch it, I promise that you'll have a great time with Tatum and Foxx.WHITE HOUSE DOWN- 8.5/10",White House Down
177,DrLex,"Predictable, dumb, massively implausible,  and fun",7,9 November 2013,"It seems many people miss the point of this film. If you still do not realize that its only goal is to serve you dumb entertainment by the time the president grabs what appears to be a bling-bling RPG launcher with the presidential seal imprinted on it, then either you are thinking too hard or not hard enough.I don't know why some people think this film is trying to take itself seriously. Maybe the trailer was misleading, I have no idea because over the years I have learned to avoid trailers like the plague. The only purpose of a trailer is to trick you into watching the movie, not to give you a summary of the movie, not at all.Everything in White House Down is predictable, loud, often impossible, and there are no attempts to make the events grounded in reality. No, a few RPG shots will not destroy a real Abrams tank. No, Delta Force would not act in such a dumb manner as in this film. No, an ICBM cannot be used as a surface-to-air missile. And yes, the heroes would have died over and over again in every single action scene.This is a simple rehash of all stupid action films of the past 30 years and it does not try to hide this fact. The weak plot is just a vehicle for the action and we all know every plot device showed in the first dozen minutes will be used somewhere in the finale. The good and bad guys are all cardboard characters, there are silly one-liners, and we have seen it all before. But why would that be a bad thing? If it is reasonably well made, then it can be a lot of fun to watch, and I found that to be the case with this movie.I actually enjoyed this more than the suspiciously similar Olympus Has Fallen. That one did give more of an impression of trying to take itself seriously, but otherwise had the same ingredients — when I first saw a poster for WHD, I actually wondered ""hey, haven't I already seen this?"". If you're going to make something as preposterous as this, you'd better make it look the part, and I believe WHD does a better job at that than OHF.",White House Down

I was surprised with the results!Decent storyline with nothing new or twisting points occurring, the acting is great from our heroes and villains and the visual fx's are good but sadly I was annoyed by the use of CGI explosions (I'm more of a 'practical explosion' fan when it comes to action) but the choreographed action sequences make up for it (consisting of a car chase, fist fights, gun battles and explosions).Overall, a fun Popcorn Flick that does not need to be judged seriously and is worth watching on a nice night at home or with friends.",White House Down
180,spkelsekladden,Just when you thought things couldn't get worsethey made White House Down,2,8 July 2013,"This movie is so bad; it's hard to know where to begin. Jamie Fox overplays being a down to earth president so much that it makes you laugh. The scene where he has to change shoes and goes for the high top sneakers was just tragically funny, not to mention unnecessary. These supposedly highly trained professional terrorist's run around like idiots. There's a scene were they come out of a elevator,on the hunt to find the president. Were they just walk out like they are bulletproof. If he had been waiting for them they would all be dead before they even walked 5 paces.It would like to think that if the president was held hostage within the white house or any where else for that matter, they would have a media black out immediately. Not much point in the good guys storming the white house, when you as terrorist can watch it play by play on CNN live. I would also assume that as long as the president is held hostage he's nuke codes would be useless. But based on what I've read about our nuke system, he's codes a lone doesn't lunch a baseball at once. So there's really no point in getting the codes. Cause someone else has to push the button Since in all these movies they always just HAVE to use the new F35, (who I believe is still on a testing level and has yet not entered mass production, since most of the countries canceled the order when Lockheed couldn't keep the budget.)

185,jeddjong,Escapist thrills in the form of an action flick that's not a downer,7,27 June 2013,"After taking a short detour into the realm of speculative costume drama with 2011's Anonymous, director Roland Emmerich is back to doing what he does best: dealing out copious amounts of punishment to 1600 Penn. After all, he blew it to smithereens with an alien death ray in Independence Day and smashed an aircraft carrier into its south portico in 2012. It seemed inevitable that the maven of large-scale cinematic destruction would eventually make a film centering on the D.C. landmark. U.S. Capitol Police Officer John Cale (Tatum), with his daughter Emily (King) in tow, heads to the White House for a job interview, hoping to become a Secret Service Agent. Carol Finnerty (Gyllenhaal), herself a Secret Service Agent and John's former schoolmate, deems him unworthy. While taking a tour of the place after his rejection, John and Emily suddenly find themselves, along with other tourists and staffers, held hostage. A paramilitary group comprised of various dangerous miscreants and led by hardened mercenary Emil Stenz (Clarke) begins a hostile takeover of the White House. John finds himself having to protect President James Sawyer (Foxx), his daughter and the various others caught in the fray as a national crisis swiftly and violently unfolds. A summer blockbuster best described as ""Air Force One meets Die Hard, with Magic Mike teaming up with President Django"" just has to be entertaining – no two ways about it. And by gosh, White House Down is all kinds of entertaining. Sure, its PG-13 rating might disappoint fans of hardcore action and it's not going to start a renaissance of '80s- style action extravaganzas anytime soon, but this is the kind of movie which has the Presidential limousine drifting across the White House lawn with the baddies in pursuit. I can tell you there's an audience for that. James Vanderbilt's screenplay seems to have been written with just the right amount of self-awareness: the movie revels in its relative absurdity like a toddler in a ball pit and has a lot of fun with the premise, while stopping a safe distance short of mocking its audience. Duelling movies aren't new; moviegoers have borne witness to such battles as Dante's Peak vs. Volcano, A Bug's Life vs. Antz and Deep Impact vs. Armageddon. It's only fair that White House Down be compared to Olympus Has Fallen, 2013's other movie about a terrorist attack on the Executive Mansion. While it doesn't have the cooler title, White House Down does have more lavish production values and being a Roland Emmerich picture, has lots of stuff going boom. White House Down also doesn't take itself as seriously, at times it's almost a buddy movie but with the Prez as the buddy. White House Down makes better use of its setting and the film features some very realistic facsimiles of the rooms, halls and other areas of 1600 Penn. However, the afore-mentioned PG-13 rating means the violence in this one is of a less visceral variety and while the computer-generated imagery is done better here, it's still noticeable - particularly during the aerial sequences. Roland Emmerich's films are known as much for their ""casts of thousands"" as for their big-budget spectacle. While there aren't as many characters here as in, say, 2012, there still are a good number of players to juggle. Channing Tatum's protagonist is idealistic rather than world-weary and he seems to be having more fun playing the action hero here than he did in the first G.I. JOE movie. Jamie Foxx and Tatum make for a decent action flick double act, but Foxx just doesn't come off as presidential enough, though he makes up for his lack of a dignified air with cheesy/enjoyable moments like handling a rocket launcher and yelling at terrorists not to touch his precious Air Jordans. While this isn't a realistic movie by any stretch, the villains in this one somehow come off as more credible than the North Korean terrorists in Olympus Has Fallen. Jason Clarke is believable, scary even as a tough, scruffy former Delta Force soldier-turned coldblooded gun for hire. Jimmi Simpson is a hoot as a campy, bespectacled ""evil hacker"" stereotype who declares ""Skip Tyler is in!"" and seizes control of the nation's defense systems. Joey King gets to be more than just the ""kidnapped daughter"" and is something of an important supporting character. While Maggie Gyllenhaal doesn't get lots to do standing around in the Pentagon's situation room, at least she isn't relegated to the role of disposable love interest. Veteran actors James Woods and Richard Jenkins are also on hand to lend the actioner some gravitas, and Nicolas Wright as the comic relief tour guide is, refreshingly enough, not annoying. Emmerich has never been a critic's darling, but his films usually possess some sort of mass appeal and that's in full force here. Many of his films are set in multiple locations across the world, but the focus on the titular location actually prevents the story from feeling scattershot, and outlandish, exciting action sequences are not in short supply. And in this era of action thrillers being too self- serious, it's good that this strikes an adequate balance of intense moments and levity to not come off as a downer, but as a good popcorn- munchin' time.

It was a much more believable film than Olympus Has Fallen and more intelligent as well.While it wasn't completely realistic it was enough so in order for me to suspend my disbelief and give the movie a chance. I also enjoyed how the script tied back into early portions of the writing to give a feel that the movie was complete.The acting overall seemed average to above average, I didn't notice any major issues that detracted from the movie as a whole.

Emmerich has a knack for making big scale movies that conjures up the good old days of cinematic escapism.The problem is that White House Down is just NOT up to Emmerich's usual summer blockbuster standards, in fact, it is utter garbage, and quite possibly one of the worst exercises in screen writing that I've seen from a big budget movie. Ever.It's failings range from clichéd characters, to ridiculously unbelievable plot devices, to the blatant use of tired old caricatures and motivations (all ripped off from other, better movies), to some of the most absolutely ridiculous dialogue you will ever hear uttered by A-list actors.And the more the movie progresses, the more all of these things begin to pile up on one another until the movie implodes in on itself in an absolute clichéd mess of woeful storytelling and terrible film making.Look, every sensible movie-goer knows that you need to enter a film of this sort with a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief, however this movie is so ridiculously bad that it plays out like the biggest-budget B movie ever made.A far more rewarding and well crafted version of this exact same storyline is offered by the movie 'Olympus has Fallen'.The two things that I am surprised by are; how this film could have come from the same filmmaker who only just recently delivered the movie Anonymous, and why so many quality actors agreed to participate in this mindless schlock.I guess the pen really is mightier than the sword (in-joke for those who have seen the film), especially when that pen is writing large pay checks for actors willing to sell their soul for a few extra bucks.",White House Down

We are expected to believe that the pilot of an military warplane approaching at high speed spots a child on the lawn waving a flag, and thus decides to disobey his direct orders to drop bombs.

But after a Thursday night screening at AMC, I was completely blindsided by how entertaining it really was. The story is the ""Die Hard in....""- esque, with Channing Tatum as the guy whose in the wrong place at the wrong time. But he is actually a convincing lead here. Cast wise, he held it here. Foxx on the other hand seemed kind of flip-flop and confused. Yeah, he's stereotypical with his Jordans & all, but I let that slide out of sheer generosity and the fact that his & Tatum's chemistry really worked for me. Most of the supporting cast is scattered, Jason Clarke is a decent villain, and James Woods is....a villain again?! *gasp* But really, it is Tatum's show. The writing? Atrocious, but that's typical for an Emmerich film. WHD is packed full of action clichés, but some of them surprisingly worked. And where the film really kicks teeth in is in the action. The fights, explosions, and car chases were all entertaining. It's definitely a movie to leave your brain turned off for, but if you look past the fact that it's basically a PG-13 Olympus, you will have fun. 7/10Best Bits: Emmerich's pension for filming satisfying destruction scenes, Tatum's overall performance, the chemistry between Tatum & Foxx, some nostalgic clichés & subtle if cheesy humor (""Could you not hit me in the head with a rocket while I'm trying to drive?!"" lolz)Worst Bits: TERRIBLE writing, bland supporting cast, the rest of the clichés, too long at 137 minutes.",White House Down

Scores of the best military and intelligence personnel on the entire planet are smoked in a matter of minutes by barely a dozen disaffected ex-commandos. Our ""regular guy"" though manages to get shot at by thousands of bullets and escape with nary a bruise; not only that, but he cracks wise along the way.(3) The ""regular guy"" singlehandedly dispatches practically all the terrorists.

Really, I don't know why we bother having the entire U.S.A.F., DoD, special forces, intelligence agencies, etc. when all we need is someone like Agent Cale (one per city, or even one per state, should more than suffice!).(3) The antagonists (whom, despite my fervent patriotism, I couldn't help but start rooting for barely 20 minutes into the movie) drop hundreds of people coldblooded precision; yet, El Presidente and the obligatory precocious-yet-vulnerable kid are kept alive forever for ZERO good reason except to be ""heroically"" saved by our ""regular guy."" I therefore nearly creamed my pants when El Presidente got shot. Just a flesh wound though; he survived. But of course. Talk about anticlimactic. Not only did he survive: After lying ""dead"" for ten minutes he got up unaided and made a quip, too.(4) Speaking of which, the tone and appearance of ""the president"" are extremely evocative of Obama. I don't know why they bothered conjuring up the name ""President Sawyer."" I also don't get how come they released the picture after the 2012 presidential election. Obama couldn't have *paid* to have such flagrant propaganda churned out by Hollywood at his behest. Oh, and not only is ""the president"" depicted as a multifaceted, multitalented super-Obama, but the movie is laden with cheap political potshots at the military, the ""right wing,"" the Republicans, Speaker Boehner-equivalent, the advocates of military action against Iran, etc., etc.(5) The pathetic, eye-rolling ad misericordiam invoked every ten minutes. No, by Jupiter, we WON'T bomb the White House because of the 60-odd hostages' lives in there, even if it means millions of people dying as a direct result. Yeah, LET'S convince Obama -- I mean, Sawyer -- to launch the nukes aimed at tens of millions of Iranians by putting a gun to the cutie-patootie girlie-twirlie's head. (Naturally, the scene is not played out because, deus ex machina, the ""regular guy"" creates a diversion.) (6) The amount of deus ex machina is just astonishing, even for the level of asininity this excuse for a movie scrapes. Just when you dare to begin hoping the ""bad guys"" are about to drop one of the annoying protagonists, something happens to sidetrack them.(7) What was supposed to be one of the most poignant scenes, to wit, the cutie-patootie girlie-twirlie running outside the White House and maniacally waving the Presidential Standard, easily wins THE most groan-inducing scene award. And for a movie chock full of such scenes, that's some accomplishment! (8) The liberties taken by the producers concerning the Constitutional procedure are stupefying. Presidents are sworn in, sworn out, installed, toppled as if it was the Tonight Show! (9) Coup d'etat; I mean, coup de grace: The closing scene. President's helo. Six people. Three African-Americans. One strong, confident, high-flying woman in a power-suit. One early-teen cutie-patootie girlie-twirlie who -- despite all the carnage she just witnessed -- show not a hint of P.T.S.D. And one ""regular guy"" :) *sigh* I mean, what to say... This is just so f**king laughable and pathetic and silly and ludicrous and jaded and idiotic as to defy any analysis.When we get a Stallone or Schwarzenegger (or even Will Smith or Tom Cruise) picture, we know what we're in for. Forget suspending disbelief; we suspend all higher brain functions.This movie though aspires to something more serious, something more cerebral. It fails abysmally.I wasted two hours of my life and I lost two dozen I.Q. points.Forget waterboarding. If we want to make Gitmo terrorists talk, play them this movie on a loop. A couple of times should be enough to make even the hardest of them crack.",White House Down

196,alwaysplanb,Just your average flick,6,22 July 2013,"This movie has nothing new to offer. I'd suggest you rather watch Air Force 1 again! President trying to save the day, Dad trying to save his daughter, corrupt official trying to become President by creating chaos, etc. Think of any cliché related to President in a movie (or even a TV show), and its present here.The only reason I give it 6.5 and not 5 is because I enjoyed the crackling chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum. There were some good laughs in the movie. I liked the way the duo got together to survive and save. Apart from that, everything is so clichéd. The movie can't boast of its action either.If you watched and liked Olympus has fallen, its highly unlikely that you'll like this one. Olympus is far more intense than this one. Same goes for the action. After watching the destruction of white house in Olympus, you'll not like the same in this one as it ain't even close.All in all, this is totally a time pass movie.

WHD is a little bit better than Olympus because the plot was somewhat more believable. But when I was watching this I kept thinking about the similarities it had with Die Hard:(1) The hero being in the wrong place at the wrong time (or the right place at the right time depending on your perspective), (2) The action mixed in with a little light comedy, (3) A guy trying to save his family, (4) The rooftop scenarioWHD, however, falls short of being as good as Die Hard. And mainly that is because it didn't have a charismatic villain like Hans (Alan Rickman). The bad guy in WHD was about as boring and uninteresting as you can get. The ending I thought was also a little disappointing.",White House Down

199,wesperkins,Olympus did it better than this trash,1,14 July 2017,"This movie was so god awful bad. So many have written about it, that I'll just hit the things that irked me the most. First let's start with the take over scene. I just watched it again, and maybe a dozen people take over the entire White House and NO ONE EVEN GETS ONE SHOT OFF defending it. The first shot is not until they enter the room Channing Tatum is in, and by then they already have the White House except for the president. The terrorist hit every shot they take. They never miss. Until of course they shoot at Channing or the president. And how many people are defending the White House, 15? 20? At least in Olympus there is almost an army in it and they take out a few bad guys. It seems a lot more reasonable. Maybe they didn't want to pay extras the money. But it seems so ridiculous that the White House can be taken by a few guys walking around with pistols, and then equally bad that these same expert marks men can't hit anyone else after they take it over. I know this is true in a lot of action movies, but it's so bad and ridiculous here it's mind blowing. OK after that, why do they have to have the annoying little girl in this? Olympus did it right with the kid. He knew his role and what he was supposed to do. This girl kept making the movie super annoying because you knew nothing would happen to her., and she kept getting in trouble. And the flag waving scene they stole from the Rock? Who thinks of this stuff and actually likes it? It's awful. Like makes you hate the movie awful.And last, the left wing agenda is sickening. The only reason to give this a score above 3 is if your politics brain washes to do that. Olympus has fallen is better acted, better plot, better bad guys, slightly more realistic, and way less of an annoying kid. I would give White House Down 2 stars if the kid was not in it. It's not like Olympus is a great movie, but compared to this garbage it's a masterpiece. Maybe WHD appeals to a small demographic, but overall it is just junk.",White House Down
200,theredraylives,White House Down is mostly action-by-numbers,5,29 June 2013,"Roland Emmerich is mainly known for his big budget spectacles, but ever since the dismal '2012' he seems to be scaling it back a bit. His newest effort has only the White House under siege, but in this case, smaller isn't necessarily better. Here he manages to deliver a pretty stale summer blockbuster, in which both the action and comedy are just a step off. After watching, there isn't a discussion about ""was it good"" or ""was it bad,"" but rather, ""why did they bother?"" The film is tired, and it wants to masquerade as geopolitical commentary, but it fails on virtually any conceivable level. The film isn't even entertaining. In the end, there doesn't seem to be any real passion behind 'White House Down,' and it shows with every minute that ticks by on-screen. Spoilers to follow.The film stars Channing Tatum as a want-to-be secret service agent who gets caught up in an attack on the White House while he is there for a tour with his daughter (the surprisingly-effective Joey King). Tatum is actually pretty decent in the role, but is nothing spectacular or praise-worthy. His performance is simply good and believable, all one could want out of a summer blockbuster, but especially from Emmerich. Also believable is Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer, and while Foxx does add flourishes of depth to the character, these are brief and barely sidenotes once the action gets going. The film doesn't really spend a lot of time on Sawyer as the president, what he believes, or any of that- it simply focuses on the action plot so as not to try to make the film overly political. At least not yet, anyway. Maggie Gyllenhaal is barely effective as a secret service agent and isn't given much to do with the role but stand around looking concerned.James Woods also stars in the film as the head of the secret service, agent Walker, and is also the film's villain. This isn't a spoiler, since it immediately establishes this in the first moments he is on the screen. Once the actual attack begins, Woods turns out one of the hammiest performances in recent memory and has a lot of fun with his role, even if most of it is relatively nonsensical. The mercenary team that attacks the White House is able to dispatch all of the guards and secret service personnel therein within a matter of seconds; they might as well have been shooting at dummies. If anyone should be angry about the film it is the secret service, who are here portrayed as either traitors or ineffective wimps or target practice. Suspension of disbelief falls to pieces here. Sure, some of the mercenaries were well-trained, but Emmerich wants the audience to believe that the secret service is made of up retired mall cops and wanna-be security guards.For a big summer blockbuster, the film is a relative snore. Sure, it has some pretty effects, but none of its action set pieces, twists, or comedic moments hit the mark. The only funny moments come from Nicolas Wright as the White House tour guide, but they are peppered in as a distraction at best and probably to make sure the audience is still awake. Lots of things explode, and there is plenty of money on the screen, but none of it is really compelling or exciting to watch. Emmerich quite literally seems to have just thrown it on the screen, and it shows. It doesn't do anything surprising to throw off the audience or keep them engaged. It is literally action-by-numbers, quick comedic scene, quick heartfelt scene, exposition, more action-by-numbers. It was boring, Roland, and watching the Capitol explode shouldn't be boring. Its concluding action piece- the ""race to complete the mission before the planes bomb the building"" scene, is boring and is also standard fare. Nothing that happens in the film isn't predictable, save for the final reveal of the real villain, which comes so far out of left field that it is cringe-worthy. Throwing in a big twist at the very end to try to ""gotcha"" the audience is just lazy writing on the part of James Vanderbilt.Where the film is at its most-flawed, however, is in its blatant attempts at geopolitical commentary. While one can appreciate that no political party is ever given for Sawyer's administration, the film turns into an over-the-top political cheesefest with Vanderbilt's revelations that the whole attack was motivated by a military-industrial complex desperate to keep the war machines running. Sawyer makes note in the film that war equals profit, which is true, and while no one can argue that Eisenhower's warning about the military-industrial complex is a very valid point, it all comes off as an afterthought, and a halfhearted one at that. The film's decidedly anti-war and war-exhausted atmosphere is something that a lot of Americans can connect with, but in the end it all falls apart. It is a conspiracy script, desperate to give credence to the conspiracy mindset that there must be more at work than we can know. Like most conspiracies, 'White House Down' doesn't hold a lot of water, nor does it hold up to any kind of scrutiny in the end. Dwight Eisenhower's warning is as true today as ever it was, but it needs a better spotlight than this ineffective garbage.",White House Down
201,pux420,Average,5,10 October 2013,"I don't know where to start so i'm just gonna dive right in with the bad news.The president is supposed to be Harvard educated. Jamiee Foxx actually says ""i ain't do-in that s$*t"" in the ripoff president saved by lone patriot scene. I cant think which movie exactly they are ripping off, but i bet it had Bruce Willis. No one is better at the ""i just want a relaxing weekend but don't complain when i have to save the world"" bit, than Bruce Willis. Tatum was not problem here actually, Jamie Foxx is so poorly cast for the role of president. Foxx does not strike me as intelligent or educated, I feel he was given this role because he is at the height of his career and the current united states president is black. The lack of security while the shady camera crew of terrorists make scary noises in the dark is just slightly unbelievable.The movie wasn't a total loss. Maggie Gyllenhaal was good and James Woods was great as always. The action scenes where good with lots of cool guns. well done sound effects.This movie was not original in any way. I think if it had young Bruce Willis in place of Tatum and someone like Michael Douglas in place of Foxx (or ANYONE), that the movie could have been like 2nd or 3rd for a summer weekend in box office earnings. If there's nothing better on and you have got at least 2 joints and maybe some crack i highly recommend you put this movie on your 2nd monitor and sorta pay attention too it now and then while u dick around on Facebook and crap...",White House Down
202,cereyese,"Was looking for entertainment, and got it!",9,11 April 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie. It accomplishes what its designed for, which is to keep the viewer entertained.

Still, I would totally recommend it, I enjoyed every minute of it!",White House Down
203,tradewinds68,Better after a second glance,7,29 December 2013,"I was disappointed the first time I saw White House Down at the cinema (if you don't count the moment where Channing Tatum's character got his shirt off to the obvious delight of female audience members). On second viewing I appreciated this movie more and didn't take it as seriously as I had the first time around, which happened to be after watching its almost-twin and more serious version, Olympus Has Fallen.I was able to appreciate bits of subtle humour that I hadn't seen on the initial viewing and warmed up to the characters. Jaime Foxx as a young and passionate President Sawyer and Channing Tatum as John Cale, a returned war-veteran turned cop had some defining moments of understanding between them in the midst of chaos while James Woods played a solid role as an unhinged, dying secret service boss. I liked Maggie Gyllenhaal as Carole Finnerty, the go-between secret service agent trying to do the right thing and the young actress who plays Cale's daughter, Emily, gave an incredibly moving and believable performance. If you can sift through a little bit of corny scripting this movie is an enjoyable action thriller.One interesting fact is that if you want to see the full version, it will pay to get the Blu-Ray version, since the Australian DVD movie is a full five minutes shorter than the aforementioned. I haven't been able to find the reason behind this inconsistency which meant that some scenes I saw at the cinema were cut.",White House Down
204,richardv81,Fun time at the movies.,7,20 August 2013,"I went and saw White House Down, even though it bombed in the box office, over the weekend. I'll tell you I was worried about the film, due to it looking much like Olympus Has Fallen. My concern was on whether this film was going to be too much like the other. So it's time to break down the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.While on a tour of the White House, a Capitol policeman takes action to save his child and protect the President, as they are under attack by a group of paramilitary invaders.The Good –Roland Emmerich –Now we are talking about a fun time at the movies. This was your typical comedic, action, summer, popcorn type movie everyone loves to watch. It had explosions, made you laugh, and told a good story. Emmerich has a knack for making his films visually great to watch (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012) and he didn't stop here. He really knows how to bring his A game when making films. He made you care about Emily (Joey King) and the rest of the characters, which is something that some directors have a hard time doing. He put together a great cast of people that fit their roles perfectly.He brought the punch to the film. The fight scenes were what you had expected they would be with Tatum being in the film. He built it up really nice, making each battle seem more important than the last. He brought us one of the craziest ""car chase"" scenes you will ever see. It was on the front lawn of the White House and boy it was fun to watch.No matter how over the top some of the scenes felt, the movie just was solid from about 20 minutes in until the finish.Cale (Channing Tatum) –What isn't there to say?! Tatum was at his best in the movie and was perfect for this role. You couldn't help but cheer the guy on in his chase to get his daughter. Tatum fits the bill of an action star; he is a good-looking guy that is in great shape, and easy to believe that he can kick someone's ass at any given moment. I really started to enjoy his acting in last year's 21 Jump Street (Best Comedy or 2012) and he has been doing well since.Jamie Foxx (President Sawyer) –I really wasn't feeling his role to begin the movie. He just played a boring President, which made it pretty hard to get into at the start of the film. As the movie went on though, his character grew on me and I started to like his fit better. I wonder if that portrayal was set up purposely to get him out of his ""President"" shell.There is one scene in particular that was easily the funniest of the film. You see President Sawyer go into his closest and out he pulls his Jordan's. First, that in itself was funny but what came a little bit later was even better. There is a fight scene where they are in the kitchen and the ""bad guy"" grabs a hold of his shoe ""his Jordan's"". Foxx (Sawyer) proceeds to kick the hell out of this guy while lying on the ground screaming ""get your hands off my Jordan's"" and you couldn't help but bust out in laughter during.Joey King (Emily) –She played an annoying little know-it-all child that you really hate and she played it extremely well. You couldn't ask for a better performance from King.Jason Clark (Stenz) –He's played key roles in some of the best films over the past two years (The Great Gatsby and Zero Dark Thirty). Clark has the look of a bad guy; he has a smug attitude that was fitting to his character. This guy can act and do it very well.The Rest of the Supporting Cast –Tyler (Jimmi Simpson) – played a slimy weasel that you couldn't wait to die.Donnie The Guide (Nicolas Wright) – Probably had one of the most fulfilling kills in a film in a long time.Walker (James Woods), Raphelson (Richard Jenkins), Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) & (Gen. Caulfield) Lance Reddick – All good fits for their roles and were a great asset to the movie.The Bad –The 1st 20 minutes or so of this movie were pretty bland. Like I stated earlier, President Sawyer (Foxx) wasn't believable one bit at the beginning. His speeches came across as boring and looked read right off a teleprompter. Getting to where the movie was going took about 25 minutes too long from the start, but it paid off in the end.What's with everyone trying to make a film over 2 hours? This was another 2 hour and 16 minute film. With the movie being rough to watch in the beginning, I could easily see 30 minutes chopped off and the movie having the same effect by its ending.The Ugly –Truly couldn't find anything I really thought was ""the Ugly"" of the film.The Verdict –3 ½ out of 5 starsThis summer has been filled with some action packed films so far, and this one continued the trend. Even with the bad reviews and poor box office numbers, I would suggest you go see this flick. Tatum and Foxx bring you a good duo in a film that's worth watching. You'll see stuff blown up, you'll laugh and you'll cheer for the ending. What more could you want from a film?http://thesportsscript.com/2013/07/05/white-house-down-review/",White House Down
205,s-klose,Way better than expected,9,21 November 2013,"From day 1 I hated this movie. First it was because it had the same premise as a movie that was already released and more importantly it is rated PG-13 which is usually a very bad sign for an action movie. Today I finally saw it (To be fair: with really low expectations) and was really entertained. The two leads really work well together. The daughter isn't bad either. The movie keeps a pretty light tone, even though supposedly a lot is at stake. (although if you think about it not really). But in the long running time of 136 they manage to continually come up with good reasons to keep you entertained. I looked a Blu Ray Player once at the 46 minute mark to check how long it was running but the rest just flew by. Is it a good movie? Hell no. Is it doing it's job in entertaining you? Yes, yes it does that perfectly. Is it worth your Blu Ray Dollar or Euro? Yes is that too. PS: I wrote this under the assumption that the reader knows that plot of the movie.",White House Down
206,barbosa-vicki,An enjoyable action flick,7,29 June 2013,"I enjoy action movies. White House Down definitely fit the bill. It certainly wasn't cerebral, but I wasn't disappointed, as it was fun and the actors seemed to be having a good time making it. Joey King did a great job as the hero's daughter, and I loved that the video she shot from hiding went viral -- that's probably the most true- to-life part of the movie. It's always a pleasure watching Channing Tatum in action, and his acting was fine. It was fun also watching a president having to deal with events that were not in his normal routine, such as shooting and climbing up elevator shafts. The plot and some of the plot twists were barely believable, but having seen some of the shenanigans that go on in government, who knows? In real life however the plots are usually more subtle and involve fewer explosions. The bad guys were right wing extremist crackpots, but I would not call it a liberal movie; there was no discussion of any of the issues that separate the right from the left. I will definitely watch this movie again.",White House Down

I'm shocked at the negative reviews. Perhaps it's like my Grandmother reviewing ""The Matrix"". They just don't get it.If you are a die-hard,""Die Hard"" fan, you will enjoy this movie immensely. It does have a political message that I agree with, so that enhanced my enjoyment of the film.I saw ""Olympus Has Fallen"", and it was so bad that it was laughable.

Could it be any more blatant? Who paid for this flop? I certainly didn't. I saw it at a friend's house, who had rented it with a promotional code at Red box. Don't waste your time and listen to this very extreme political drivel. Is it possible that both sides of the aisle have valid points?

Renowned for several over the top movies in the past, including, (""2012"", ""Godzilla"",""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Independence Day"", it was no surprise then that he continued in that fashion and gave us another movie with plenty of action and very little substance. Let's start with the casting, Jamie Fox could have played the lead role but was out of his element as the president of the United States. Channing Tatum seems to be the ""flavour of the month"" but he gets roles like this because of his broad appeal and not for his thespian dexterity. James Woods has made a living out of playing demented political characters and turns in the same expected performance here.

210,in_shahieras_prince,Just Another Olympus Has Fallen?,6,29 June 2013,"White House Down - Seriously, why it should always about White House and ""Olympus""? Yes, it was the same, almost the same storyline like the ""Olympus Has Fallen"", which was screened a few weeks ago. Even the traitors were merely the same, except WHD never go internationally blaming the North Korea but only the Arabs. It was less serious than OHF I might say, but I guess the role of Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum with such action and a little bit comical was a great show too. There was even a child involved. Although this child was figured as a hero herself. I think the Olympus had a better villain than WHD but the twisted ending was so much better in this. But still, I can't help myself to see their roles (both in OHF and WHD), were all the same. *spoilers alert!* I like the OHF heroic Gerrard Butler style more than Channing Tatum but he was still a good actor here. The strategies of being mysterious and criminally intelligent were okay but still not enough. The actions were many but wasn't full-packed. I think this movie deserves much better reviews and stars to be liked, but the most important reason why not, is the fact that OHF had already been there on screen before it, and the beauty of it's plotting and storyline was too predicted.

I will just skip that and jump to acting.For me Channing Tatum is new on the big stage, but what an appearance. I love his style. Simple. Convincing and calm. He pinned down his character so good.

I watched in baffled amazement as this smug, self important drivel was basically vomited onto the screen. Channing Tatum leads the herd as your run of the mill cop who looks like a Calvin Klein model who is trying to attain his dream of becoming a Secret Service Agent. Of course he's estranged from his daughter and trying to save their relationship as per formula, but she's such an unlikeable punk it almost made me root for more estrangement. She's visiting the White House on a class trip and Channing is also present interviewing for the job. I wonder if something awful will happen and the dad will have to fight terrorists to save her, thus rescuing their damaged relationship? 
Enter Barack Obama, I mean Jamie Foxx, who's quest for world peace will draw the ire of white supremacist terrorists, evil conservatives, and the military industrial complex. The two join forces to fight off the terrorist invasion, but not before action hero Obama / Foxx has his basketball sneakers on of course. 
White House Down is completely brain dead, and that's fine. Die Hard was great despite being just a clothesline to hang action scenes on. But the key difference here is that WHD ACTUALLY takes itself very very seriously. It's really bizarre and pathetic.

The lack of logic and abundance of gun fire perfectly matched the popular Bollywood style and served to the needs of popcorn audience.Though there were many instances when the above lines were proved, to quote one, ""If they knew that the white house has been compromised by someone from inside, why would they suggest a secret escape route which was certainly not a secret to the insider? Do they really think that it was a random attack without any plans and the attackers wouldn't have thought this through?""But if we keep the logic aside and ignore the details, this movie can be considered as an entertaining flick. It contained enough action to keep me awake even after mid night and showcased various nice lines with a touch of valor and bravery. Humor was also mashed up quite well wherever required and the sense of patriotism was instilled at some points.I would recommend this movie to you if you can watch an action flick without using the stronger side of your brain.",White House Down
216,MovieMaster95,"Dumb, silly and A LOT of fun!",7,20 December 2013,"When you're making a Die Hard-esque action movie set in the White House, the one thing you need to remember is to not take it seriously. Unfortunately 'Olympus Has Fallen' didn't know this and ending up being a miserable, boring and incredibly stupid mess. White House Down on the other hand, goes for the tongue-in-cheek and fun route and its all the better for it. The plot is simple and probably has a couple of holes in it but who cares? The film establishes early on that you're just supposed to enjoy the ride and thankfully, the ride is very fun. We have Tatum and Foxx getting into shootouts, fistfights and car chases and its all well shot (No awful shaky-cam), fast-paced and over-the-top, in a good way. It gets so ridiculous that it had my laughing at times but it just reminded me of the glorious over-the-top action films from the 80s like the masterpiece formally known as 'Commando'. I was actually excited when the film was reaching its climax, unlike 'Olympus Has Fallen' where I was just waiting for it to end.Tatum plays the typical 'John McClane' type role and while he's nowhere near as charismatic as Willis' signature role, he plays the part well enough for us to root for him. I also like that he's quite vulnerable. Unlike Gerard Butler in 'Olympus Has Fallen', he's not an indestructible killing machine. He gets beaten up, runs out of ammo frequently, has to resort to hiding for a lot of the movie and often makes mistakes. Basically he's not perfect which also makes him very human and relatable which in turn makes the action more exciting. Jaime Foxx is also very good as the President. You believe him in the role and he's a lot of fun to watch when acting as Tatum's goofy sidekick. The two are very good together and have some great comedic moments, especially during the car chase in the limo.There isn't really much more to say about this movie. It is what it is. Fun popcorn entertainment. I will say the few complaints I do have involve the rating. I wish this was R-rated but for a PG-13 movie, they sure did make the most of it. Lots of violence from start to finish, but I just yearn for the days of real blood-squibs and hard F-bombs. I also wasn't a fan of the Tour guy as the comic-relief and I think the pacing could have been tightened up with a little trimming to the runtime. But whatever, bottom line is this is a fun movie. It's in no way a masterpiece and is a HUGE Die Hard rip-off but I can't deny I had a smile on my face throughout the movie.",White House Down
217,stephen-317,Doesn't make it pass the 5.0 threshold,7,4 March 2017,"Up against 'Olympus Has Fallen' in a bizarre year that has two films with identical subjects, this film falls foul of the 5.0 threshold rule. Whilst being an enjoyable romp that get's it edging over the IMDb 5 score, it then enters the zone of 'could this film have been better ?'. Humour around 5, love interest around 4 (after some heavy editing), action around 7 but very unconnected. Channing Tatum's film (he produced it as well) deserves a strong 6 but was looking at a 7 if the points all connected.",White House Down

It just happened at The White House and Tatum's acting was not very memorable. There are some flaws on the plot that is going to make you annoyed from time to time. The cast is somehow not very charming and believable. Baddies are too stupid even if they are highly experienced veterans which will make you even more annoyed. There are few gags along the way but not so funny. It is also too long for this kind of mundane plot. It's a typical B-grade plot with an A-grade CG. It can give you some entertainment but don't expect too much. I give it 5 just for the effort of the white house set and the realistic computer graphics that really deserved to be in a better film.",White House Down

It suffered very dramatically from 'bad guys have no aim'itis which seems very common in most films.... But it's what you expect from action films now, so you can let it slip. There are plenty of bullets in this film, that's for sure ! And a few little witty limes of humor too, that's the unexpected part. But it worked and I think it breached the line between seriousness and humor very well ! There are a couple of surprise plot twists which I did NOT see coming, so that's always a good thing and I can 100% agree with one of the lines ""This is Something you don't see everyday"".

221,matthewrudder,Disappointed,4,2 January 2020,I had hoped that with the headline actors that this was going to be a good action film however it failed on a number of points.Leaving aside the political commentary there were a number of scenes which just didn't make any sense.1. Given the threat to shoot down any aircraft in 10 miles why was a media helicopter allowed to fly continually overhead. 2. Why were they just driving in circles around the fountain. 3. There is an assumed terror attack on the White House yet bystanders are allowed to stand on the road outside. 4. The President is being shot at in front of the military yet they do nothing. 5. A tank is destroyed by a single RPG round. 6. A pilot having been told that a rogue nuclear launch is being authorized from inside the White House which is aimed at numerous cities around the world decides that one person waving a flag is sufficient to countermand his orders.If you want to watch this type of film go for Olympus Has Fallen.,White House Down

223,findingdevotion,Action flick with a hint f irony,8,16 August 2013,"White House Down came out after Olympus Has Fallen and for all intents and purposes it does look like a clone. The subject is virtually identical down to the smallest detail (preposterous story, outcast agent wannabe saves the president, there's a cheap betrayal twist too and so on).What separates the two is that while Olympus Has Fallen takes its cheap stale patriotism seriously, White House Down takes a more lighthearted approach.Firstly, whole OHF features no humor whatsoever, WHD has plenty of moments (and even introduces a geeky character for that purpose alone). I will have to mention the moment where the hero frantically turns on the video sensors on a presidential car when the windshield gets covered only to shout ""Mr president, we have a zombie situation out there"" only to have the president remark that it was just a movie his daughter was watching. Secondly: OHF tries to recycle external enemies (North Korea in its case) in one of the lamest such attempts. WHD remains slightly more conservative by choosing the weapons manufacturing mafia and sneak an anti-war message in the process.Lastly, putting one and one together, WHD throws in a lighthearted message and a good dose of humor making a forgettable yet momentarily entertaining action flick. OHF doesn't stand a chance.",White House Down

Jamie Foxx as the president. I like Jamie Foxx but his portrayal of the president is one of the worst I have ever seen. The Jordan sneaker wearing/urban slang speaking character of Jamie Foxx's is unbearable. I guess if you win an Oscar then no one will ever try to correct your acting ever again. Tatum is incapable of carrying a movie as the leading man in an action flick. James Woods? As the Secret Service leader turned bad because his son died in the line of service. This movie just goes to show that if you throw enough money into a movie you can release it world wide and make money. I hope this movie goes to DVD in 3 months...the sign of a truly bad film.

The Movie starts of slowly and as soon as it's gets the pace you are in a for a fun ride. The action sequences are shot beautifully and looks like Mr Roland Loves Destroying the WHITE House. Even The White House is destroyed in a Awesome Manner which looks satisfying.However, The Plot is CHEESY(What are we expecting) but still it grips you till the last moment.Nevertheless , We Have fine performances from Channing Tatum who is improving as an actor. He has the charm and screen presence which is required in a Leading actor. Jamie Foxx is extremely cool as the President. One of the major Pluses of the movie is the chemistry between these two leads. They gel up beautifully with each other and the one liners are extremely funny. Maggie is Good with her role. Rest of the cast in their Places.The Drawbacks of the movie are that firstly the script is cheesy, the girl who plays Channing Tatum's Daughter turns out to be annoying and Plus the movie takes time to set itself up.To Sum Up, We have a Fun Summer Movie Here.

Very painful to watch and I wish I walked out and never finished the film. A total waste of two hours.Not only that, it's a piece of left wing propaganda, where corporate America is evil and the peace loving muslims, and an obama look alike are the good guys.As if the army would watch the president being chased across the White House lawn, ten feet in front of them, and do nothing.

This movie is goofy. Period. I loved when Maggie Gylenhall and the rest of the guys just looked so amazed and aghast that the whitehouse was STILL under the control of a handful of terrorists as they stand in a big war room surrounded by 50 soldiers and agents of various types. Well, if all you do is stand around in a big war room then the bad guys can't be stopped right? The movie depends upon just about everyone in the film being completely incompetent at their job, except of course the terrorists who are supernaturally good at killing, and Channing Tatum, who is the new Bruce Willis in this die-hard wannabe.I wanted to laugh.

238,Afflock,Hollywood Movie Down,5,6 July 2013,"This may contain minor spoilers of certain action sequences but not plot.White House Down is similar to Olympus Has Fallen and Die Hard, minus logic, reason, character development, good acting (ok, Olympus Has Fallen has acting issue as well), and with cheesy lines and plot mechanics. It does have a level of entertainment value with a few characters that stood out as interesting. There are some logical, reasoning, and plot mechanics that have flaws which had me raising my hands and asking ""what the ...?"" Aspects of the film are noticeably forced. The antagonist hires help to assist with their diabolical plan which felt more like ""Despicable Me"" henchman than trained mercenaries. It has the Hollywood obligatory bad guys who can't hit the side of a barn with an automatic weapon while inside the barn. One of the main villains and a good guy say the hired help are all ""highly trained"". This sets up an expectation. But low and behold a city police man, formerly a Marine, bested them all with Spray and Pray. Really? Then there is the President who refuses to leave the White House under control of bad guys because his action hero savior won't leave so he can save his daughter. Seriously?? Apparently people can walk into the White House and start shooting guards and Secret Service and no one will use a radio to call it in until they check it out first and get shot - and not fire a return shot - plus there seems to be no cameras in the White House. A Secret Service vehicle mounted with a .50 caliber chain gun at less than a car length away and continually fires for a short chase scene and hit the good guy's car about a dozen or so times. Hmmm.... 1k rounds + per minute for 2 min and only a few hit. Then when it is turned on a person at point blank range . . . well it kept it's PG rating by avoiding realism, the operative word here is blank(s). Did I mention this car chase scene involving the President's limo was witnessed by 100's of Army Soldiers with tanks and they did nothing? Or that a non-armor piercing RPG could stop an Abrams A-1 tank? In the previews you see Air Force One being hit with a missile - which was fired from a Missile Sub in the Atlantic and travels to the skies over Ohio in about 30 sec and no one on Air Force One knew it until a couple seconds before it hit?? No counter measures. Plus the situation room in the Pentagon knew it was launching before it left the Missile Sub, but apparently the Pentagon did not know the location of Air Force one, they had to guess what the ""modified 747"" was (which has a fighter escort visible on radar, and per the radar shown in the movie, and also was almost on top of the largest US Air Force base in the world) only seconds before it hit, but no one told Air Force One a missile was coming. Did I mention in the end the President walked through a cadre of on-air reporters who did not notice him? Just so he could say a few words to the hero, who was standing beside Marine One preparing to take off with the President? His Secret Service call sign should have been ""Mr. Cellophane"".This movie is full of illogical and irrational behavior. There is much more but would encroach as plot spoilers (such as helicopters flying at physics/safety defying angles and altitudes, and jets taking 6 min for a 3 min flight and pilots defying orders because of something they saw miles away through buildings and trees while flying at tree top altitude near supersonic speeds).While it is a shoot-em-up movie and has some decent special affects and action, I found the flaws in rational behavior, logic, and reason to be too distracting and forced.Rent it if you wish as a popcorn action movie, but save your money for a more enjoyable movie admission ticket.",White House Down
239,chrysoberylz,"Bad or Not, This Movie is still Worth Watching",7,26 June 2013,"Star : 7 / 10Note this : I don't want to compare this to another Roland Emmerich movies so it will be just my opinion about this ""White House Down"". And, I haven't watched ""Independence Day"", which is ""White House Down"" compared to, so I won't compare them at all.When it comes to apocalypse-theme movie, I think we all agree that Roland Emmerich name will pop up in our minds. This amazing director once again brought us an apocalyptic movie. Not a nature disaster but a personal apocalypse for USA, a group of terrorist took control of the White House. It's an apocalyptic thing for USA itself.About how the terrorists / invaders could come inside the White House, it's predictable. An insider is a traitor. Typical ""terrorist"" movie that attacks USA, one of the good guys must be the bad guy. Nothing really special about this movie. But I can say some gags during the serious situation in the movie are hilarious. Mr. President can be funny too. I think this is a 100% serious movie but, I'm wrong.The first 30 minutes of the movie is boring, I have to say. I'm just like, ""bullshit"", ""crap"", ""get me the action already"", ""enough of this talking"", and ""goddammit start the terrorism already"". Then the rest of the movie is amazing, and some of the scenes are breath-taking. Not so tense, a bit of plot twist, explosion everywhere, guns, machine guns, Air Force One, Black Hawk, nuclear, yeah, put out all your weaponry, USA.Channing Tatum is doing good with his action in this movie. Although this is not his best movie appearance. But his emotional relationship with his daughter is not so deep, uh, like not really exposed. Our Django, Jamie Foxx is perfect for the black president role (referring to Obama). Serious and tough, but also can be funny. Joey King as Emily Cale is also worth two thumbs up. Her role is also important in this movie. Although I think uploading the invaders' video to YouTube in situation like that is a dumb thing to do. But the video also helped the Pentagon to identify the invaders. And yeah, this amazing actor, James Woods stole the screen. What else do you expect from him?To conclude all of the above, this movie is worth watching.

America can't be brought down by any external forces working at their own n they will need either president himself or a guy next to him to be involved to do such ventures ... N it's impossible ... 2nd is very alarming .... Even if president wants a dialogue n peace talks ... No one else wants this ... So even if he takes such measures those will be temporary ... On account of taking down White House well it's pure naive ... It can't be taken with such a meager force of attacker with such 3rd class weapons ... Yes I call them 3rd class cause ist it's impossible to move n relocate them so close without detection n 2nd the defense is much stronger to handle much more than that ...

I wanted this movie after a few of my friends that its a superb action and guns galore, so I thought ""lets see it"" and oh boy... I have stopped those friends for movie suggestions after this debacle. The story is about a guy who is having trouble in his life.. He leads a mediocre life always failing to produce results though we all know that he is capable (Can you get anymore clichéd). He is estranged from his political crazy daughter, who now calls him by his first name and not even father, but to patch things up he asks a friend to hook him up with a pass for his daughter to see the White House, on the same day a group of militants plan on taking the White House under siege. From there on its a struggle for life and death has Channing Tatum battles every militant all most single handed to save both the President (Jamie Foxx) and his daughter.The above story will sound interesting... the things that happen in the movie are at most laughable. Half the time was going like ""Come on, Seriously""... I don't know much about political systems, but one thing is you don't change presidents like changing clothes. But, in this movie.. well its one after the other. I was half expecting that Tatum will be sworn in as president in between. The scene were they call in the air strike with thousands of civilians still in the area. I mean at least make be want to believe. Either Roland Emmerich thinks the audience are so gullible that we will believe what ever is throw at us on the screen or that the only thing that matters is to blow up everything in site and make the good guy win the day and people will be happy. Lets on even talk about the casting. Jamie Foxx as the president just did not sit well with me. You expect the president of the United States to be a strong personality, not a comedian. Ya, I know that they did not want to make a serious movie. But, it just does not sit well with me. You decide want you wanna make, weather its comedy or serious.

Not to mention Channing Tatum played her Father, and this is probably my favorite movie from him (which says a lot since I am a huge fan of him). There is a bit of comedy in the movie as well, which really ties it all together.

243,borisreviews,A Sophisticated Masterpiece,10,25 June 2013,"From acclaimed auteur Roland Emmerich comes a dark, gritty take on Nietzschean philosophy masked under a tale of the White House under siege. Emmerich's critique of quasi-pseudo-antidisestablishmentarianism is relentless and incredibly convincing, with a hint of crypto- anarchism. While the plot is quite layered and thematically heavy, Emmerich handles it with grace. This is visionary cinema at its finest - it is highly entertaining and deconstructs the world we live in. Emmerich is not only a master of action and suspense, as seen in masterpieces ""10,000 BC"" and ""Godzilla,"" but he's a keen observer of the human experience in intense situations. A good script is always important, but for a movie to truly succeed, you need actors to convincingly portray the characters. Thankfully, the ever charismatic Channing Tatum, the enigmatic Jamie Foxx, and teen sensation Maggie Gyllenhaal provide just that and more!

When some gets killed, it's so bland, so generic.Editing was weak with this one. The movie also has a feeling of a TV flick...The positive elements were the villains, hilarious. I mean, you have a almost naked guy with a giant mustache, trying to show he is a tough man. You always have the expert hacker who acts like he is smart and polite, when he is really a dumb guy and gets himself killed by his own explosion...You have a guy who has a mental problem and starts shooting people and poiting the gun to the head of a kid.

246,ajepisode13,White House...way down,2,4 June 2014,"Yet again, Channing Tatum proves he is an actor of very limited talent. But perhaps the weakest aspect of this weak movie is its script. The dialog - particularly between Tatum's character and the President - is just downright embarrassing. Was this written by a school-kid? If this was the 1940s 0r 50s, this juvenile script would have been thrown in the trash. Even the ever-reliable James Woods appears out-of-sorts in this junk. Richard Jenkins works with what little he is given but his skill as an actor is evident. And the young girl who plays Tatum's daughter shows her potential. In fact, she displays more acting range than her father.Go watch OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN instead. It is no classic by a long shot, but more entertaining than this effort.",White House Down

It's not my normal cup of tea, but I grew up on action comedies, the kind that are fun to watch once, but not to revisit. (because they are very superficial) I think all the roles were spot-on. Channum Tating seems like he would be just like that in real life. Now Jamie Fox as the president is a long shot, but the humorous parts really worked because it was Jamie! Nobody else could have reached for those tennis shoes and made us laugh like that.Good rapport between the actors, good high budget action scenes, and some very clever comedy like doughnuts on the white house lawn were thrilling. Especially enjoyed the over the top action sequences, real life would have made this movie boring, but the outrageousness kept me engaged. A solid 7/10, generally above average for an action comedy.",White House Down

It is also very violent. I can't even tell you how many people were killed.The story makes no sense at all. First it starts off as a story of a divorced dad trying to impress his daughter by his applying to work for the Secret Service, along with taking her on a tour of the White House. At that point, the whole movie goes wrong, with the Head of the President's Detail plotting, the Vice President on a plane headed somewhere and the Speaker of the House along in the stupid plot. I think the highlight of the movie was the President in a limo with Channing Tatum driving in circles on the White House lawn.Please do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie.

I like Jamie Foxx and I hate to say it but he was miscast and pitiful in this role. And then to round it all off it was basically, as other reviewers have stated, a mish-mash of Olympus Has Fallen and Die Hard with Channing Tatum as a ""Lite"" version of Bruce Willis or Gerard Butler. Without the blatant plagiarism I may have given this a 5 if I tried really hard to be objective and treat it on its own merits but I can't so it gets a 2 for half decent action scenes.

White House Down shows us freedom worth fighting for. The cast was good. The writing and script was all right. The cinematography and special effects were decent. This movie is worth your time weather you think it or not. There are, of course, some things that I do not agree with in this movie. For one, they make the president out to be a complete moron. Between the script and the lake of caricature development Jamie Foxx plays a man dressed in a suit pretending to be something more. The plot could have been better. However! In the end this movie is worth seeing. In America we take things for granted. A lot.

However, having seen Argo and Zero Dark Thirty with Lone Survivor out now, I gotta say there was at least some kernel of truthiness in this movie. Why progressives can't rally around this, admittedly weak, story about the military-industrial complex, is beyond me. Seems like there was an organized rally behind Argo, ZDT and especially Lone Survivor no matter how good or true any of them were. I'm not even sure if Argo and ZDT were even ""good"" movies. The hype was such that we were expected to like them or we were told we just didn't get it. I felt the same way about After Earth. With it's 'danger is real, fear is a choice' tag line it seemed to be a rallying call for all sorts of people (Scientology-phobia aside).

261,ScapegoatsOfTheEmpire,Dumb Bubble Gum Mess,1,22 March 2014,"Anyone who gives this movie high marks, in my opinion, has a very low standard for good quality entertainment. This movie was very poorly plotted and scripted; and the actors forgot their job, which is to act. To me, it was just a movie with explosions, with no realism in the fights. The weapons Marines used to fight Moros in the Phillipine- American War in 1911 could not stop the Moros, who were high on morale and even higher on drugs. The caliber .45, M1911A1 was designed by John Browning to stop the Moros at the request of the U.S. Marine Corps, who was doing the fighting there, and the guns did the job very well. Any man hit with 45 caliber will go down; the bullet will not be stopped by a pocket watch. A .38 can be stopped by a pocket watch, because it just does not have the stopping power, which explains why the M1911A1, with design changes, has returned to the military, especially U.S. Marine Corps. The general in the movie does not even know how to salute. I was disenchanted within the first 15 minutes; I stuck through it, just to see how bad this movie was. I give it the same marks as, ""The Siege,"" which was just as bad. Martial Law was ruled unconstitutional by U.S. Supreme Court in the post-Civil Ex parte Milligan Case.

I went into this expecting a quick dose of dumb action and nothing else but this doesn't even deliver on that. Its really lackluster action with not much other than a few explosions and of-screen deaths with GUNS. Oh so many bullets yet it felt really tamed, I guess that's what a PG rating gets ya.But getting into the nitty gritty of this demo, I call it that because really its a demo for a better movie. This 'movie' follows the day, night and partial morning of White Action Hero and his less than ordinary adventure. Blah blah blah he gets refused his dream job of doing something and he is at the white house and then terrorists attack, something like that. His daughter gets in danger, he has to save her, then she gets taken hostage because the plot requires her to and then something else happens. Typically Hero saves the day, why wouldn't he? The ending really stepped it up a bit on the schlock factor, Roland trying to be heartfelt but just presenting it so awfully. I don't recommend this at all and its one of the worst things I've ever seen.

Channing Tatum, who seems to have been hired for his muscular physique, manages some chops and Jamie Fox does a nice job as the President (who seems to be a frustrated athlete eager to redeem himself by kicking terrorist butt).The special effects are spectacular. Lots of bullets ripping through walls, destroying offices, and general mayhem on a big budget scale. Nice sets. I had recently visited the White House, so it was nice to compare some of the tourist spots with these impressive recreations.CONS: Given all the above, why would I score the picture so low? One word: script. While the outline might have sounded great in a board meeting, the resulting blueprint ended up a collection of clichés. Tatum is given a precocious daughter, just to increase the audience identification. She's then placed in peril and performs numerous acts of bravery that help her estranged father rescue the free world. It's one cardboard cutout character after another, with the villains the worst.

I don't know how to describe it, but every time he appeared it really reminded me I was watching a movie. He seemed to be trying to so hard to act and he was not believable. It seemed like he didn't know what movie he was in and it's probably just me, but it seemed like he was on drugs or something...A colleague told me Olympus has fallen is a much better movie, so Im looking forward to seeing that.

And I can sure see why. The ""White House Down"" scriptwriter must be a card-carrying member of the Barack Obama Fan Club, since this is a VERY politicized flick: cue the telegenic black president who takes a very ""liberal"" leap-of-faith initiative to try to bring peace to the Middle East (good luck with that), while the villains who hate him for this are (big surprise) all white male conservatives who want to nuke the baddies over there. Oh, and the hero-cop's young daughter (trapped in the White House) is, of course, heroic as well, talking the time to video the bad guys at one point and then upload it so the media can broadcast it (yep, just like any terrorized 12-year-old would likely do). I could go on...but why bother? Both flicks have the requisite massive full-auto shoot-outs, but ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was at least somewhat less ridiculous in that regard than ""White House Down"".

Anyone else notice that trend lately?White House Down is ripped straight from the Die Hard mold. It even does a decent Die Hard impression for the first 40-45 minutes. Then, the plot begins to bog down, the one liners slow, the action fades away and we get to ""the story.""Which frankly is terrible. The good- Some decent action moments and laughable one liners.The bad- Almost everything else. The movie is 40 minutes too long. Every good guy in power is struck with stupidity, every good guy not Channing Tatum can't hit the broad side of a barn, while every bad guy can, unless he's shooting at Channing Tatum. The hilarious misuse of military hardware actually gets entertaining after a bit (ICBMs as SAMs? why not!). But overall the plot is so over the top and so poorly unveiled you just don't care and pray for the thing to end.The CGI is also not overly impressive for a $150 million feature. Its better than SyFy channel, but not on par with what I'd expect for a movie of this size. Possibly its also because I've become tired of the overuse of CGI when its not needed so it catches my eye more often.As action movies go this isn't horrible. But its painfully overlong to the point of you just don't care by the end. You mostly just want it to be done.

This movie lends credence to my statements. What do we find? We find that the military is behind the attack on the White House because the President (Jamie Foxx) is opposed to war and doesn't want any more military contracts – he wants peace in the Middle East.Enter a ""superman"" who is a former military man who served in Iraq and is now vying to join the Secret Service. In this movie even though out-manned and out-gunned, he performs one ""super feat"" after another. He defeats trained military personnel (mercenaries) , all in the name of saving his little girl, who is presented as being ""super"" in her own right. In fact, she is the real hero of the movie: she is the one who takes pictures of the bad guys who have infiltrated the white house and then emails it to officials; she is the one who stands up to the leader of the bad guys by staring down a gun, not once but twice. She is the one who takes the flag at the end of the movie and signals an air strike force not to ""blow up"" the White House saying, in essence, my daddy has everything under control.This pisses off the military decision makers and their ""in-house collaborators"" who enable military trained personnel to infiltrate the White House, blow up Air Force One (with people on board), gain access to missile systems and everything else. Jamie makes the point that America is not for sale and that the military is doing this so that they can continue making money. And this is an example of art imitating life.But what is the overriding message? A trainee who didn't pass muster when he trained for the Secret Service and a United States president can out-think, out-muscle, out-perform and outlast a squad of trained mercenaries. Even though they are white, don't forget that they are doing all this to capitalize on America's racist belief that ""terrorists"" (read: middle eastern brown men) are going to destroy their way of life, starting with taking over the White House.",White House Down
278,sita_chez,better than Olympus in almost every way,8,15 September 2013,"Tonight I sat and watched both White House Down and Olympus. Olympus is a good film with great action and a very serious storyline. There are great fight sequences which are very slick, a lot of people getting their necks snapped and stabbed in the head which is always good in a movie. but I don't know why anyone would set up a Nuclear weapon system where the codes cant be reset what a stupid thought. The actors that interested me were Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett and Dylan McDermot. Whilst Whd has Jamie Foxx, Channing Tatum, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Joey King as Emily, Tatum's daughter in the film. While both films have kids in them Olympus's kid is rubbish and does nothing but hide and wait to be saved, yet Emily sneaks up on the terrorists, films them and posts it online, has a gun put up to her head to get the launch codes and is prepared to die to stop millions in the middle east dying, what a kid!! She is actually one of the big heroes in the movie for more than I have just mentioned. In Olympus the terrorists are Korean yet in Whd they are American a few of them racist who hate a black president. Olympus has quite a few mistakes that I don't believe the President and his staff would make. Whd has many funny moments where Olympus has none, Whd had loads of great deaths including 2 that had me swearing out loud. Olympus is willing to turn the world into a war zone to save one man, where as Whd is willing to blow up the White House and kill 65 innocent people to stop the terrorists from destroying the world, which I honestly think they would do. At first I honestly didn't see myself believing Foxx as President but I warmed to him. Whd even has a car chase across the White House lawn with the Presidential limousine nicknamed the beast because its basically a tank and rocket launchers and a real tank.To me Whd is the superior movie, which I didn't think I would say in the end, I thought it would be Olympus. If you can watch both, but If your making a choice go with Whd, by far the better movie.",White House Down
279,Watcher120,Abysmal garbage,1,8 November 2013,"Lousy CGI. For Chris-sakes, Emmerrich, the director of Independence Day, can't even get decent CGI! The action scenes are boring and you have seen them a thousand times before in other movies. In addition, parts of this turkey are straight rip-offs of Die Hard. What is a great actor like James Woods doing in this mess?Jamie Foxx plays the president like some arrogant, obnoxious fool who thinks he is the cat's meow. The President in this turkey has the habit of having ""his"" chopper buzz the Lincoln Monument; in real life how do you think that would go over? The premise of this turkey is so bizarre it is hard to describe: some convoluted mess about the President discovering that Iran--of all places!!--is not really building a nuclear bomb and that it is all a plot by some US corporations to keep the US military in the Middle east, and . . . oh, never mind. Channing Tattum is no Bruce Willis and has zero chemistry as does his obnoxious daughter played by a repellent Joey King. Jason Clarke, a fine Aussie actor, is one of the main baddies, and plays some betrayed Delta force type with a grudge, but has a hard time hanging onto his American accent and basically just screams and scowls his way through this turkey. The semi-cute Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a totally clueless head of the Secret Service and . . . never mind. Turkey for Thanksgiving.",White House Down

Here we have a whole host of them. Of course the whole of the scenario is far fetched and as likely to happen as finding life on mars, but so what. If they had taken time to implant more character development, and they had as much as they needed, then people would have said it was too slow and not enough action. If they had put in more story line, then they would have said it was too ""talky"". There's no winning with some people. I knew that it was primarily an action flick, so I looked for nothing more, and was gratified at what took place. The special effects were great, though admittedly they did make the whole secret service, military et al look a little weak, but there you have it.

I can honestly say that I had an amazing time watching this movie! This had everything a summer blockbuster is supposed to be. You have two very likable main characters. Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx have fantastic chemistry. Then you have explosive action with fantastic special effects. One of the things that I found to be surprising is just the fact that this film had tons of plot twists. At times I wasn't even ready for a plot twist before I found myself mind blown! Then you have more coming down the road. One of the things I thought was extremely enjoyable was the fact that Tatum's daughter wasn't like most ""my child is held hostage"" films because she actually is a relevant character and is interesting to watch. A child role that is not at all useless she actually plays a nice role in the film and makes it more entertaining. If you enjoy action packed summer blockbusters check this one out.

The POTUS climbing around an elevator shaft, etc. There were a bunch more examples, but you get the idea.

289,DavidRsMail,The antidote to Olympus Has Fallen,8,6 July 2013,"If you want to compare the two, both of which are {highly unrealistic -a given in almost ALL:} action movies, White House Down has more realistic battles. Not by a whole lot, though.What makes White House Down the antidote to Olympus Has Fallen is that it's got a respectable president and honest politics. This fictional president's actual actions indicate that he has values in line with our founders: humility, willingness to admit mistakes, and real passion for non-interventionism, diplomacy instead of preemptive and dishonest wars, and separation from the military industrial complex and banking cartels which have helped destroy our republic.Some people have written that he is like a liberal, when in fact the actual politics of this president are in line with libertarians. It has been stated that this movie is divisive about republican vs democrat, but I disagree strongly with that position. It has also been said that this president's politics are that of obama. But that is simply untrue. Obama's actions have spoken: he is a wallstreet schmuck who cares little for our republic. He cares little for diplomacy. He cares nothing for staying out of wars. He cares belittles our founding fathers and our constitution. He cares nothing for humility and campaign promises. He cares little for real transparency and honor. Take off your blinders, people.Sony Pictures was righteous to create this film. It's a dose of reality that was sorely lacking in Olympus Has Fallen.

While you are watching the movie you would not realize that two hours and seventeen minutes of your life has passed by.

291,bohumil-cambalik,A truly great comedy!,1,13 October 2013,"I usually do not laugh when it comes to movies this bad. What they do, is make me angry and disappointed, but this monstrosity takes all the clichés to a whole new level. Don't get me wrong, this movie tries to be funny, but it all feels awkward and unnatural, given the circumstances, characters find themselves in. I watched Olympus has fallen - not much of a movie either, but at least they try to take it seriously.First half of the movie is actually a standard Hollywood action that we are used to, but after that... holy cow! You get all the clichés you would expect from a movie like this and MUCH MUCH MORE! I laughed so hard when the little girl waved the flag to stop the fighters from bombing the white house, I laughed when Tatum killed James Woods with a machine gun from 2 meters away and there was no blood at all (so this can be a family movie you rent on Sundays), I couldn't NOT laugh when Foxx actually found the chrome dildo RPG in his limousine or when I saw the hilarious acting of big-faced Gyllenhaal.With this movie you get all the clichés like patriotic music playing throughout half of the movie, the ""at the end of the movie"" good guy - bad guy final fight, the classic motive of using the nuclear weapons, the brave speeches, and of course the ""bad guy waiting to press the red button before the good guy does something"".Never before in the history of big-budget cinematography was there a movie more pathetic and stupid as this! I mean, who do you feed this to? Well, yeah, teenagers and people with IQ less than 90.However, I really had a good time with this movie.

293,lenvallairdjr,"6.4 my behind. First action-thriller movie I witnessed...and really liked. Well done, Emmerich.",9,15 November 2014,"I was kind of skeptical when I first heard of this movie. All I knew were 3 things: It was a Drama-action thriller movie, Jamie Foxx starred in the movie and it was directed by Roland Emmerich. I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I took the chance. This isn't my first introduction to these kinds of movies. What I see from these movies are scenes that look like a real life Call of Duty game with real people, a story and some good characters. What people usually want from these movies are the action scenes; They don't really give a heck about the story or characters from these movies which for me, as a movie watcher, I focus on strictly. I have a feeling some people don't focus on those concepts due to how lazy the people who make the movie are in that side of the movie which, believe it or not, is one of the crucial parts of making a movie great,meaningful and known.Now that I have that out of the way, let's get back into ""White House Down"". Let me just say this has to be one of the best thriller action movies Roland Emmerich directed and created. When I think of Roland and the movies he directed, he's more on the disastrous/suspense side of movies. Looking at his later movies he made like ""2012"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"", he shows his peril side and danger in a very mind blowing and breathtaking way; One thing's for sure, the special effects and CGI in the movies are eye popping and what makes your eyes glued to the silver screen or your TV screens. But in ""White House Down"", does he focus on that as he would usually do? No. He does focus on the action parts like the fighting scenes, shooting scenes and aerial/flying scenes but he adds a little more ""oomph"" on the storyline and characters to make them something we will watch more closely and see what they'll do next and I liked that feeling. It was a feeling that was missing from many action packed movies and surprisingly, it had it. The story speaks of a man named Cale, played by Channing Tatum(to many girls, a total babe), who has a job interview for the Secret Service agent, which is protecting the president named James Sawyer, played by Jamie Foxx(to many people, a talented man, having many major roles and awards under his belt). But, sadly, his dream job is denied and not wanting to make his daughter feel bad(daughter played by Joey King), he takes her on a tour around the White House. Then things go from bad to worse when the White House is under attack by a strong trained group of mater criminal anarchists bent for revenge on the White House. With the country and many other continents about to redo history for the 3rd time, it's up to Cale to protect the president, save the White House from destruction and prove to the world and his family he's not just an average man looking for a job to make ends meet, he's an American hero. Yo Cale! (Yes, G.I Joe pun intended.) So for the storyline, I'll give a 9.5/10. It's another real life underdog story that doesn't disappoint and we can relate to since we can imagine ourselves as that role. For the environment, I'll give a 9/10. This movie was nominated for the best portrayal of Washington, D.C and it deserves it. The way of how the White house looks is amazing, from the inside out and so does the other settings it shows as well. For the characters, I'll give them a 9.25/10. Each character, from the good side to the bad side, done each role with success and passion. You'll be thinking of them long after the credits roll. In conclusion, White House Down gets a 9/10! This movie is a great flick that'll really feed your sense of action and adventure with satisfaction guaranteed. The ONLY downside I seen from it was that the action scenes were a little rushed but the action scenes are great you'll hardly even notice. If you're in mood for a thriller with a compelling story, great acting and awesome action scenes, White House Down really delivers all that. So, leave the ""Die Hard"" movies for a while, put down that ""James Bond"" flick and check out this movie. You won't forget it; Take it from me!",White House Down
294,order-27,OK for something to do on a hot summer day.,5,30 June 2013,"White House Down--well, the Principle of Evil Marksmanship was blatantly at play here, and the film went on a little long, but OK for a guilty pleasure type of film. Yes, I expected things blowing up in the white house, but who'd'a thunk they could figure out how to do the mandatory car chase, too (although mostly to comedic effect).It's both different and the same as Olympus Has Fallen; Olympus's plot had slightly more plausible bits and made me ponder the possibilities a little more.You do have to leave your brain at home--the plot for WHD is pretty implausible and resolution a little ho-hum bordering on stupid. But I liked the quips and bantering and silly stuff, I liked that so many of the characters showed guts rather than there being only helpless victims, couple of the bad guys with guns bordered on being effectively threatening, and there was enough going on that it mostly kept my attention.

296,eraser_head2001,"A rip-off of ""Olympus Has Fallen.""",1,27 July 2013,"When I first saw the trailer for ""White House Down"" I knew that it was another version of ""Olympus Has Fallen."" When I went to see it in theaters my suspicions were accurate. This film follows ""Olympus Has Fallen"" nearly to the T; White House gets attacked and blown up, secret agent and the president work together to escape. The only differences are some characters and the enemies. The enemies in ""White House Down"" make this film into an overt propaganda film. The enemies are right-wing, ex-military fundamentalists who use the word ""sheeple,"" and they also mention that one of the enemies was part of a white supremacist group. How is the propaganda not obvious? The enemies in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" were more realistic and showed a more potential danger.The action itself was bland, filled with typical gunfire and trying to ante up on the amount of blood they can get away with. The dialogue unrealistic and terribly cliché. (Would you really hear a president talking about his Jordan's?) The characters are one-dimensional. The acting was robotic and tries to be hip with the modern-day audience. Jaime Foxx tries to keep the character hip and young while Channing Tatum tries to go back to his acting ways in ""21 Jump Street."" The scene where Foxx and Tatum are in the car, and Foxx gets the rocket launcher and accidentally hits Tatum, Tatum goes off on a failed, ""comedic"" tantrum like he did in ""21 Jump Street."" The filmmakers try extremely hard to be relatable with the audience. When Foxx decided to wear Jordan's shoes is completely idiotic and shoving product placement in the audience's face. ""Look, Jaime Foxx wears Jordan's. You, too, can wear these."" I can not recommend this film to anyone unless they wanna see ""Olympus Has Fallen"" told in a different fashion and told more like a comedy/action/buddy film.",White House Down

Some people are critical of the plot of this movie; not sure what they expected of a summer action movie, but for me it was pretty much on par with lots of other action movies, which is to say not particularly believable, but an entertaining watch if you're willing to suspend your disbelief.It contains a few unexpected (for me) plot twists that help maintain interest in the film. The actors are doing good jobs. There is action. There are explosions. There is a bizarre car chase involving luxury SUVs doing doughnuts on the White House lawn; why not wreck the lawn, since you're destroying everything else at the White House?It is fun, if you don't take it seriously. The only questionable plot detail for me (and, I gather, for a lot of other movie goers here) is a heavy-handed political message that emerges from time to time, relating to the self-serving agenda of arms dealers. I don't dispute that arms dealers are bad guys, but it kind of felt like proselytizing when this happened, and it jarred with the otherwise light, escapist atmosphere of the film.But overall, if you like action films, this is better than many although by no means brilliant, and worth seeing.Saw it with my two boys, ages 8 and 12, and they enjoyed it too.",White House Down

Yes, it's total make believe with some cheesy lines and patriotic imagery thrown in, but at least Emmerich and the actors knew that, and play along. But where it matters - the action that is - WHD delivers as any of Emmerich's past actioners have. The mayhem on screen - larger than life - but never felt overdone.

Lets just say the main criteria for Roland was special effects as usual and unrealistic cataclysmic events that occur oh and corniness. The president getting shot and then later finding out that he got shot in the pocket watch to save his life, disappointing. If a bad guy wanted to kill someone aka the president bad enough he'd shoot him in the head. Oh and then the little girl coming out with a flag trying to flag off the jets, unreal.. the girl would obviously be running for her life. I just call this movie a failed remake of Olympus has Fallen, great job Olympus has Fallen stars you definitely pulled it off compared to this awful movie. Despite all the negative remarks I made toward this movie, the only reason I didn't rate it 0/10 or 1/10 is for the small scenes of comedy and special effects Roland loves so much.

300,nnguyen0297,"Definitely not ""Die Hard"" by any means, but definitely not terrible.",7,14 February 2014,"When this movie first came out, it got a lot of criticism from people. Many criticized it's action sequences, others thought the story was stupid and overused, and honestly, I think they're right. There is a lot of flaws in this movie, but calling it terrible is a little to harsh. The story, as most of you could probably guess from the title, is about a group of terrorist who raids the White House and holds everyone hostage. There's a couple of twist and turns here and there throughout the movie but I won't spoil it for ya. The plot as you can see, is indeed overused. It's basically a guy running around a big building taking down the bad guys while trying to save the hostages. We've seen it in many blockbusters like ""Die Hard"" and ""Air Force One"". I'll also admit that the action sequences are really stupid. I swear every time Channing Tatum gets into a shootout he dodges every single bullet. I mean I wouldn't mind all of that if this was ""The Matrix"" but there's no mentioning of any of that red pill blue pill crap so it didn't really make sense. On top of that some of the dialogue in this movie could get reeaallly corny and it's makes you wanna strangle your television set. The CGI is really noticeable to. When they use real explosives in this movie, it looks good and you don't mind it. But when they try to use special effects, it looks it belonged to a video game. Despite this, I still think you should give it a shot. Why? Well despite having inaccurate action sequences, the action scenes were pretty fun. There's also a lot of funny moments in the movie that will make you chuckle a few times. And surprisingly, most of the actors did a good job portraying their roles. I especially liked Jamie Foxes performance. He was funny, cool, yet noble and serious when necessary. (Not to mention he allowed you to make a lot of Obama jokes). I kinda thought the villain in this movie was a little extreme though. I mean you do sympathize with him, but his intentions and goals are just way to over the top. And there's this one particular scene in the movie involving the news that drove me crazy. I'm not going to explain what it is, but let's just say, It's Fox News Stupid.

I could spent an hour writing up all the different parallels between the movies to a sickening degree. *SPOILERS* - Both involve a guy with killing skills in a place he's not expected to be when terrorists seize control of a building with one of his loved ones inside as hostage (among others) and slowly takes out each terrorist one by one by scrambling about the setting, slowly gathering more and more firepower by looting corpses, as well as scavenging a walky-talky that the bad guys use and figures out their movements and plans. - very similar action shots that could be mirror images of how they play out in Die Hard - ""They have Javelins - don't send in this helicopters!"" vs ""They have RPG's - don't sent in the Swat team in a tank"" with the FBI on the other side of the phone not believing him and sending them anyway, and everyone dying while he tries to stop it. - Finding out that he has a loved one inside via a prop, and then using it against him. (picture frame vs white house tickets) - Second in command on the ""bad guys"" team gets really angry with the heroine of the story because he kills a guy he cared about and wants no one else to kill him but himself. (brother vs someone he served with who saved his life) - very eccentric hacker on the side of the ""bad guys"" that is basically there to count watch a number grow to 100% - hacker also sees the military moving in and warns the guys with the RPGs/JavelinsI could go on, but it's saddening. but I'll add the fact that at the end of the movie, Tatum wearing a... white, beat up, grungy muscle shirt.",White House Down

Pee Wee's Big Adventure has more credibility that this film.Anything by Michael Moore is more believable than this. And that, dear readers, is really really sad.",White House Down
305,littlemisscandlewax,OK just needs improvement,5,4 July 2014,"OK let's just start with the fact that the president ( Jamie Foxx ) has decided to stop selling weapons to other countries which would never happen. I mean think about it the reason why countries have money is from selling weapons. War makes money. So the president wants to make peace I mean come on is this guy blind as well as stupid look at the world man. Any who people are not happy with this so the plan is to bomb the White House then tell the USA that the president is dead then the Vice President will come in then they will kill him then the next vice present will come in he will carry on selling weapons because he is in on the plan.So Why risk your life, kill thousands of people,keep people captive, go through lots of plans and hard work just to bomb the White House when you could just assassinate the president and the Vice President. Where is the logic in that. The film it's self was good but the plot was just messed up. I understand it's an action film so they want to blow up every thing, but between this film and another film ( Olympus has fallen) which is based on blowing up the White House, Olympus has fallen is sooo much better. The plot is way more logical and enjoyable.Overall I think it is an OK film, I would recommend you to watch it but it's far from my top 10 even 20. It's beyond my 100.",White House Down

Although similar in the storytelling, this one seemed...funner, somehow. I cared about the characters more and the stakes seemed higher. Having the president more of an every-man just trying to do good without being preachy was nice and it was easy to get on his side. Channing seemed less cocksure than Butler in OHF and had more to lose. He seemed more vulnerable, and that made him much easier for me to relate to. He was less surgical and looked to be always thinking on his feet, like you would in a crazy situation like this. It was a way-over-the-top action film in almost every way to be sure, but was also very fun and somewhat plausible even...save for the something-something intervention, (You'll see what I mean!) but what are ya gonna do? I felt the big reveal was a bit anti-climatic, but it did it's job and wrapped it right up. Good fun film.",White House Down

309,LoveMyTwoFerrets,Better Story than Olympus Has Fallen,9,1 December 2013,"I have to confess, I enjoyed watching White House Down much more than I would have thought possible as I am not a big fan of action films with a lot of blood and gore. However, I had seen Olympus Has Fallen so figured I would watch this one, too, as I love conspiracy movies. I honestly expected that I would have liked Olympus Has Fallen more than White House Down - after all, it had a top name cast and bigger budget, but when it comes down to the actual story, White House Down wipes the rest of the competition out of the water. White House Down is much more believable - especially in light of the political and financial situation in the world today. Also, the story is carried out with a sense of ""style"" with some mercenary madness thrown in for good measure! The interjected humor is just priceless!!! I actually found myself laughing out loud several times during the movie. I feel that while Olympus Has Fallen was played out to the max with blood, guts and violence, there was very little ""humanity"" interjected. However, in White House Down, the story far out-weighed the gratuitous blood and violence. I have seen it five times now, and I still love every minute of it!",White House Down
310,medic1990,Toooo close of the same scenario.,1,1 July 2013,"Does ""Olympus Has Fallen"" sound familiar? I don't know who was trying to copy whom? but having the two released so close together was pretty damn idiotic! example of the executives at Columbia Pictures of not caring and just trying to make money without truly thinking!! did they even try this on a test group? I know they knew when ""Olympus has Fallen"" was coming out. Was it even a possibility of even trying to have it out next year? Both movies are just for sheer action and it doesn't make you forget that you live in the real world. After watching the History Channel, the Discovery Channel and other documentaries on the White House, the Secret Service, the NSA, 9/11, Post 9/11 and the fact that I have been to Washington D.C. and have visited the White House and seen ALL the security that was visible to the public. According to all documentaries there are a lot of hidden securities as well. Making their movie implausible if not improbable. I actually had a better time watching ""Independence Day"". I guess the executives at Columbia Pictures view the majority of the public as ignorant and stupid. I think they were aiming at the ""Jerry Springer"" population. I truly think this was a waste of money. Did Jamie Fox and Tatum Chaning know of ""Olympus has Fallen""? do you think they would have did the movie had they had known of the other? If they did know of the other movie then thats a bad mark for their film career. I hope they don't keep making bad movie decisions like that or else they'll fall into the M. Night Shyamalan category.",White House Down
311,wandeljw,Non-Stop Action but Only Occasional Plausibility,7,4 July 2013,"The movie is a long full-scale domestic terrorism attack on the White House. The action never lets up and is well-staged. It may be fun to watch just for the excellently produced action.As a story, however, it is only plausible in isolated spots. The plot elements that need to converge in order to make the attack believable are an unlikely mix of political and personal motivations.Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx are only okay. Maggie Gyllenhall is always worth watching. James Woods plays his role with intelligence, like he always does. Richard Jenkins and Michael Murphy are also in this movie and they are two of the best character actors ever (in my opinion).The most stirring acting is done by child actress Joey King who plays Tatum's eleven year-old daughter. Tweens may want to see this movie because they can identify with her.",White House Down
312,Aleksandar_Amurov,"I was wrong, the movie is actually FREAKING AWESOME",10,10 November 2013,"I rented the blu-ray yesterday and didn't watch it. I was about to return it today but I ended up watching it instead. Super Cool!!!I was so wrong but you can't blame me for not having the urge to see it. We all know the old familiar plot about extremists trying to kill the president and the president on the other hand is transforming into this super action hero with all kind of MacGyver skills and saves the day. Well this movie is so much more than that. First off the cast is awesome, I mean really awesome and together with the director/producer they really make everything work and the final product is that nicely polished gemstone that automatically enters my favorites list. From beginning to end this movie delivers, no flat moments, it doesn't slow down, it doesn't lose the point and doesn't get boring. From start to finish it's a FINE PIECE OF ENTERTAINMENT. Action is supreme. Channing kicks butt better than Jan Claude Van Dame! Scouts Honor! Jamie Fox is the best president I've seen in a Hollywood production. If he ever decides to run for the seat he will win unanimously. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the brain of the operation and she is the one that makes the movie sharp and smart. Joey King is adorable as the daughter and she kept me on the edge thru out the entire movie. Very believable character and makes you care! This is nothing like Air Force One or any other in that sphere. The bond between Channing, Jamie and Joey is so strong that they remain friends in real life. Please check the song they made -(I Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum- and also see the Amazing 45 second Hand Shake. i love that movie!!!My reviews are not influenced by any company. They are independent and personal. I will never deliver a dishonest review. I don't work for anybody in this business, I am just the regular dude that likes watching movies.

Its about a terrorist attack inside the White House but it goes on and on as if the viewers do not have brains to analyze that that is just not possible. Hollywood has an ability to portray fluff well and often it has got away doing it because somewhere it sounded right, True Lies, for example. But here we have a merry-go-round that doesn't want to stop! Never mind the military is capable of overpowering the terrorists in their vulnerable moments but the director loved going on with the unbelievable and boring drama it became. It just was too much for me to watch and I started wasting my time, hence 20 minutes into the movie, I was out of it. Please watch something else if your time is precious.",White House Down

Awful acting, Jamie Foxx sounded more like a drug dealer than a US president, James Woods is supposed to be quite intelligent with a supposed IQ of 160, so why did he join the cast of this farce ? Its like Die Hard from the 80's except much worse acted - as if time had stood still since then. Save your time and skip this one, or you'll be so appalled by it you will actually bother to write an IMDb review as Im doing here.Im supposed to write 10 lines, but I've said what I want to say without extra filling.

That said, Channing Tatum, Jamie Foxx, and James Woods acted very well, especially the chemistry between Foxx and Tatum. I thought this movie was a fast-paced action- filled thriller that did not disappoint, and while it may not be realistic (I mean really who expected that?), what Die-Hard-like action movie is? The humor was what really set this film apart for me, I was cracking up the whole way through. And even though it may be cliché, just turn your brain off and enjoy an intense, comical, and heart-pounding action movie. I don't know why this did so poorly at the box office, I would assume if they hadn't released it so close after Olympus Has Fallen it might have done better. Regardless, I would definitely recommend this film if you're into thrillers with a lot of humor mixed into it!",White House Down
317,woralo,Why this movie is not that bad,7,12 September 2013,"A lot of criticism and bad reviews going around about this movie, but it's not that bad at all and if you ask me it has a lot more punch to it than Olympus has fallen. This movie touches some moral values and deals with some prejudice as well. The story isn't that great and you can see most of the things coming, but some things are still very compelling. Hey, what do you expect from this Genre? It's supposed to be an action movie.It showed that not all terrorism comes from the middle east, but there are also extremists amongst the American people, although this is also a form of prejudice taking on right wing extremists, it's a complete breath of fresh air, and who doesn't like so see racist rednecks get some ass kicking. The most important part about this movie were the characters, let me go into them a little bit more.The president/Jamie Fox I went into this movie expecting very little, because I don't picture Jamie Fox as the presidential type actor. It's more of a role for Dennis Haysbert who played a brilliant president in the 24 series. However, I think it was intended to give this president a little bit of an Obama flamboyance, being more of an average guy swearing a little and wearing sneakers and such. They wanted the president to be a normal guy and for that Jamie Fox is great, however I still think his roll in this movie was a little bit too much, he just doesn't fit the presidents roll. Cale Some dude with aggression issues and proper military training, that's about it.Emily For me, this was the star of the movie, she put down an amazing performance. Her acting was really good and believable, she was courageous, intelligent and adorable. Everything she did in this movie is an illustration of how anyone would want to be, but most of us are simply not able to be such an altruistic person. Some of the bad things. The bad guys one shot every security guard when entering the white house, but they can't manage to get a single bullet into the main character's big enough torso. Also, why didn't they demand Cale to come out of hiding as well when they demanded the president to surrender when they were threatening to shoot Emily. It doesn't make sense.All in all I liked this movie, Emily really gave me the feeling I could be a better person, but that just might be me. It's definitely better than Olympus has fallen, which has mainly action and nothing else.",White House Down
318,mpflipper-459-115255,Not as bad as everybody told me !,7,9 September 2013,"I wasn't that eager to watch this movie, because I had seen some clips on TV shows reviewing it, and read reviews in newspapers...and none of them were very positive.But on a rainy Sunday night, nothing else to do...i thought to myself...why not !? Have an open mind and go and see it.And i must say I was pleasantly surprised !!! YES every normal thinking adult must know that the things you see in this movie are outrageous and simply couldn't ever happen that way. But so is most of what happens in any Bond movie ! So just forget about that part of it all...and decide if the movie is entertaining, and i thought it was ! Channing Tatum, James Woods, Maggie Gyllenhaal and little Joey King did really good work ! The only negative for me in this movie was Jamie Foxx, and I don't even know what it was that bothered me about him in this movie, but I just didn't think he was the best choice for that part !",White House Down

But what keeps bugging me about this film(reason why I gave it 5/10 instead of 8/10) is that the politics of the movie are a bit too real for what's currently going on in the white house, congress and in the media. I can't help but see how they are making Foxx look like Obama as this big ""nice guy"" who's out to protect the world and all of these ""evil republicans"" are forcing him into a corner.If you like Obama then you will probably love this movie. This movie basically glorifies him in so many ways it's disgusting.",White House Down
320,hughesreviews-co-uk,"'White House Down' is over polluted by narrative clichés, but as films about the White House getting taken over go, it's probably the best.",6,27 October 2013,"Expect destruction of the White House in 'White House Down'. Not just because all the posters and trailers signify such an event occurring, but because destruction addicted director Roland Emmerich goes toe to toe with the President's home once again. The score, at the moment, is heavily on the Emmerich side, and going by his past work in 'Independence Day' and 'The Day After Tomorrow', I would not put bets on the White House to come out of this encounter unscathed.The copycat in question here is 'Olympus Has Fallen', which, in more ways than acceptable, is exactly the same film as 'White House Down'. When I look in my memory, I am already starting to forget which certain moment belonged to which film. Sequences seem to be taken directly from each other, almost as if the screenwriters were openly texting each other help with their screenplays. Both films feature a helicopter raid on the sieged building and they are identical to such a ridiculous degree; a clueless commander who orders the mission, our redemption seeking hero who tells them not to do it, and the inevitable disaster that ensues through the exact same means – missiles on the roof. The problem with both films, is the over reliance on narrative and character clichés that we have seen done thousands of times before. Our heroes peeved kid calls him ""John"", as opposed to ""Dad"". It's fair to say, this is not an original child character and because the protagonist is called John, it did, unfortunately for my blood levels, re-emerge locked memories of John McClane's recent father and son bonding in Russia.The two plots are exactly identical but the differences are what makes 'White House Down' a superior piece of throwaway fun. Their is a much greater grasp of comedy and it is clear that not one single person takes this film seriously; everyone is having a ball. Even Roland Emmerich is in on the joke, finding a spot to hilariously reference his own film when a White House tour guide describes the residence area of the building as being ""the big famous building in the middle, which got blown up in 'Independence Day'"" By the way, the guy who plays that tour guide is hilarious. As is a lot of the film, through it's sheer ludicracy that allows you to both laugh with and at the experience. 'Olympus Has Fallen' felt like an excuse to propagate fear in the American public and increase the Military's annual budget, but 'White House Down' does the opposite; it rightly makes the military-industrial complex the villains and instead of racial stereotypes, they are white American's and politicians. One strangely profound statement in the film occurs when a news anchor is reporting on the situation, and it is being watched by the man leading the attack. The television says ""It's most likely Al-Qaeda, or Arab terrorists"" but we, the audience, can see an old white man, in a suit and eating cake. It's much less of a laughably obvious piece of nationalist propaganda. Not as much trumpet wailing, or blatant xenophobia, or flag waving in this one. If anything, this is a parody of the films 'Olympus Has Fallen' was trying so desperately to be.The film turns into something of a buddy comedy when like-able Channing Tatum, as our hero secret service applicant John Cale, teams up with The President – played brilliantly by Jamie Foxx – to stop the para-military invaders and foil a very evil, anti-world plot. The two share great chemistry and clearly have a great comedic ability. Jamie Foxx plays the Obama people thought they were voting for; a self-aware joking President, who likes to refer and play with his powers like a kid – just as us normal folk would. He has the down-to-earth, nice bloke charisma Obama has; which comes across when he says things like ""wake me up if civilization collapses"" and ""the leader of the free world is saying pretty please"". He also has the Presidential ability to pick up a rocket launcher and dispatch bad guys if need be. Something all the voters need in their Commander in Chief (which is why Harrison Ford get my vote).Master of Disaster Roland Emmerich shoots the action well but it appears he has hired a lackluster editor. I researched his name but then forgot and now I can't remember; but as Al Pacino so eloquently puts it in 'Carlito's Way', ""Maybe I don't remember the last time I blew my nose"", so I am not researching it again. Maybe I am being too harsh on this unnamed editor but the film is very sloppy and choppy – sloppily choppy – to the extent that their are occasional blatant continuity inconsistencies in geography. Unless your Lars Von Trier, or Jean-Luc Godard, and I am expecting some serious pretension, some verisimilitude is required in a film such as this.It's an absurd movie, but in a way that is gleeful and non-demanding. Sometimes, that's all you want. 'White House Down' wants to be the 'Die Hard' sequel 'A Good Day To Die Hard' most certainly wasn't. Our hero likes vests and has a family member stuck as a hostage; who will eventually be used as bargaining. There are even the bureaucrats who make the wrong calls, the tech wiz henchmen and the brute henchmen who has a personal vendetta against our hero. He even crawls through vents like McClane. When John McClane does drag himself through those vents, he sarcastically says to himself ""Lets get together, have a few laughs"". What's worthy about 'White House Down', is that they took his advice, and you can too by watching it.",White House Down

Maybe White House Down showboated the explosions and gunfire, but I mean it's an action movie that happened after other action movies. So of course White House Down is gonna have more Gunfire and Explosions, just to be better than last year, and if a spin off comes out, it will try to be better than this movie, despite being a flop. Making movies should be about the fun you'd have making them, among other things.I especially enjoyed the father-daughter paring between Channing Tatum and Joey King. Never would've expected it. All I can say maybe apart from other reviewers is that in one month, I've seen this movie maybe 12 times, and that is since it's release on DVD, and apart from other people.

328,janmejay-vyas,"Overblown, senseless and mind numbing not worth the price of a ticket!",3,24 June 2013,"I managed to catch an advance screening of this Roland Emmerich directed flick in the theaters last Tuursday. I particularly did not have any high expectations going into this movie partly because the director's previous duds and also because the trailer didn't particularly excite me. But, one thing Emmerich does is that he always mounts his films on a grand scale and I'm guessing most of you will agree with me on that. Be it, Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow or 2012, you will always see a grand spectacle unfolding with a larger than life projection, and White House Down is not much different in that aspect.So you have John Cale (Channing Tatum) vying for his dream job with the Secret Service protecting the President of United States (Jamie Foxx) for which he takes along his high on political IQ, daughter Emily (Joey King) for an interview in the White House. As indicated by the title of the movie, the timing could not have been any better as within minutes the building is taken down and held hostage by heavily armed in-house terrorists, who have their own personal agendas on mind. The initial scenes manage to get your attention with some nicely executed scenes of the siege of the most important building of the world. But alas, its all downhill from here. Clearly, this is not the place to ask for reasoning and logic. An event of such a magnitude, needs to have a very strong intent but when the purpose is gradually revealed you seem to feel simply let down and you seem to ask this question ""Do the makers feel their audience is so stupid?"" None of the characters stand out. I'm not asking a Joker show here but at least the antagonist needs to have his motive clear. Twists appear completely out of the blue, I mean it should be a good thing but there should always be a good justification so that all the bits and pieces join together to make the twist believable. Simply saying how would you react if Alfred from the Batman trilogy turned out to be the villain in the last scene.Movies in which action does most of the talking, need to have deep rooted and believable characters, and this starts from the writing stage till the final casting but unfortunately this is one of the weakest aspects of the movie. I mean a simple way to gauge that would be to ask yourself, how badly you want the villain killed or the love story to end on a positive note or the leading man bash up the antagonist in the final act. In this movie, I felt none of those. I couldn't care less about any of the characters on screen, whatever happens I just want the lights back on ASAP, and that's not a good sign for any movie. On a positive note, you take back a couple of characters like Donnie (the guide) and Emily (Cale's daughter). Nicolas Wright as Donnie, the guide taking visitors on a trip inside the White House gets his timing right in most of the comic scenes he has particularly in the scene where Emily answers his questions beforehand or the scene where he takes a dig at blowing of White House in Roland's previous film Independence Day.That's the only thing you take back from an otherwise overblown, out rightly dumb and a flat film which offers nothing new only other that the White House being blown to bits. At a runtime of almost 130 minutes, it feels long, tiring and chances are it'll leave you with a migraine. I would definitely not recommend it to anyone, it's not worth the price of a ticket. Grab a DVD cuddle up in your couch and watch the Independence Day again, it'll definitely be the two hours well spent.",White House Down

But for the most part they were pretty even and pretty good there.Slight Spoiler: There was a duplicate scene from OHF in WHD where Tatum also falls through a glass skylight and lands on and breaks a table. I guess if the writers did similar research on the residential area of the WH, it was a gimme.",White House Down
332,sahusriti,A thrilling watch,8,20 August 2018,"1.Genre- drama, mystery2. Rating- 8/103. One liner- Completely enduring the perks of the military kaboom!! The intensity of mixing the president, white house and all the hostility around it makes the movie on the edge watch4. Plot summary- Story is about the terrorist group who takes control of the White House and plans to abduct the president of the United States in order to pursue a military nuclear launch. 5. Events- The scene where they discover that the secretary of state who was the now President ambushed President Sawyer to give the nuclear launch codes to Walker who was in revenge with the president for the death of his son Kevin and was supporting the terrorist group in supporting the mission, I guess the Limo chase scene by John Cale was also the highlight of the movie along with many gun sequences.6. Film making- Good effects of amazingly capturing the essence of White House, its history & its interiors. I think it was quiet commendable of things that they provide with ""Did you Knows?"" about the White House now and then7. Potential viewers- I guess those who enjoy a good drama content along with the whooshing of guns, military, arms and stuffs8. Verdict- As far as entertainment is concerned a total 10, the movie has quite a good amount of content to be able to glue the audiences to their screens.",White House Down

A lot may not like the movie because of that or the storyline, however I thought it was great, in my opinion. The storyline was interesting, it was serious with enough comedy and action within the film. The casting was great Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum as a team was different to see but it worked. We have seen both actors take on serious roles and they play them well, of course Jamie Foxx has to add in his one liners, but it was worth putting in. I did end up purchasing this film as I thought it was a well deserved purchase. Roland Emmerich (Director) should be proud of himself he put together a good movie.",White House Down
337,ajjones-198-340523,Great Action Movie,7,2 July 2013,"I had to review this movie after seeing the rant displayed by another reviewer. I have seen a lot of movies in my life and I can quote you lines and scenes. I am a fan of Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow. If you like these movies you already know that this film includes death and explosions.Channing Tatum takes on a nice action role as John Cale. He is quoted as the man who never finishes anything. However, he wants an opportunity to be in the president's secret service detail and he has worked hard to have an opportunity to interview for a position in the White House the day it is attacked. He gets to meet the president while he is with his daughter. And later he has the opportunity to save the president as the White House is taken down from within.The movie follows along traditional action story lines with plenty of gun fights and escape scenes. It does not lack in intrigue or action. The movie has an all-star cast and every single person plays their role.Pluses include another stellar performance by Jamie Foxx and minuses include a pretty predictable plot by mid-movie. If you are looking for a good summer flick or a date night movie this movie is it. It lacks the particularly bloody scenes that we see in movies now and that may just be to keep the rating under rating R or because the director doesn't feel you need the blood and guts with your serving of violence.",White House Down

340,aaron09912,Better than Olympus has fallen,6,23 May 2014,Just after watching this movie as well as Olympus has fallen an extremely similar movie about the white house being taken over. And I was very surprised to find I enjoyed this one moreSPOILERS FOR BOTH MOVIESIm not gonna go into great detail of the plot but it is very cheesy but I had expected and for the most part wont complain about it. Sure a trained soldier turned bodyguard is trapped in the white house and is the only one left to fight. The white house is taken over by about 15 people at a guess which doesn't seem reasonable to be honest but I think its better than the 40 that went in Olympus has fallen movie where they staged an all out war and the assailants lost 12 people running across the lawn. Anyway moving on this movie had a more obvious plot with people for revenge in the movie style cliché rather than the better motive in the Olympus movie. But the twists in this plot were better I thought.I would give this movie a higher rating if it wasn't for a few key moments that were complete rubbish 1. Emily (daugher of bodyguard Mike/Tatum) would really have been put all over the news when shes a hostage putting her in danger???? 2.Not blowing a hole in the fence with a tank to get the limo out rather than getting tank stuck on it 3.The air strike was called off because of a flag being waved 4. Crowds beside the army and then the army not pushing them back when the air strike was coming in 5. Why did he not force the president to put his hand on the briefcase for the missiles? that was really stupid 6.This happened over a veeeery small amount of time including travel 7. Last minutes before air strike would have taken a lot longer than the 8 minutes that we were told were left (The air strike was bs in other words) 8. No hostages diedI also have to say that towards the end of the movie Emily was one of the most annoying character ever worse than Carl from the Walking DeadThis movie was set out to be cheesy Olympus has fallen was set out to be a serious action thrillerWhite house down did a better job of what it set out to be and it was much more enjoyable,White House Down

342,ebadong,A thrill ride reminiscent of other blockbuster action films,7,6 July 2013,"Directed by Roland Emmerich (yes, the same guy who seems to have a penchant for destroying things, even the Earth, in movies like 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, and Independence Day), this movie is still about obliterating buildings, although the scale is smaller compared to the director's previous films.That smallness in the scale of destruction, however, doesn't necessarily translate to a less impact-ful action movie. In fact, I could be going out on a limb here by saying that among Emmerich's movies, the scenes in WHD can strike more fear compared to his films where our planet is in danger of being annihilated. This can be attributed to the higher probability of domestic terrorists invading the former 'Presidential Palace' (got the info from 'Emily Cale' when she was being toured around the White House by her dad, played by Channing Tatum) as opposed to our planet facing its own demise. The believability factor makes the fear a bit closer to home.I must admit that I enjoyed the movie (even eventually shunning the popcorn the minute the movie started to get interesting) all throughout. There was a generous sprinkling (if that's even a right term to use) of being-on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes that would really get you into the movie, especially when the supposedly most protected building in the world is taken over by uninvited guests (which can explain my ignoring the popcorn). There were scenes in the movie that were reminiscent of Under Siege 2 and the Die Hard series. The comparison to the latter is the amount of mayhem and body pain that John Cale (interestingly, he has the same first name as John McClane) had to go through and suffer. As for the scene that had a semblance of Under Siege 2, it's the paramilitary leader's discovery of Cale's relationship to her daughter Emily via White House tour passes that dropped from Cale's clothes after their brawl. Remember when Sarah (played by the lovely Katherine Heigl) was found out to be the 'companion' of Casey Ryback (played by Steven Seagal) when the leader of the mercenaries looked at the train's passenger manifesto?It had its heartwarming (and heartbreaking moments), too. There was this scene of Emily waving a flag on the lawn of the White House to try to ward off the fighter planes who had been ordered to attack the presidential residence as a last-ditch effort to put an end to the standoff, apparently to save not only her father but the president himself (the scene again brought to mind another action film, The Rock, when the character of Nicolas Cage was waving flares to the fighter jets to signal that they had accomplished their mission of disarming the rockets that would have been used to launch the VX gas). I'd say, though, that Jamie Foxx, even though he was part of (and very effective in) the bits of comic relief throughout the film that elicited laughs from the audience, was a bit of an odd choice for me as president of the US. There are roles that sort of grow on you while watching a movie, but this one just didn't do it for me.All in all, watching it was a thrill ride, especially when I realized towards the end of the film that there had been a second red herring (which, of course, I won't talk about). There were the expected plot holes (like how the mercenaries were able to sneak in as utility personnel in the most guarded 'house' on earth). But if you allow that suspension of disbelief while watching a movie get on you, you'll ignore those holes and just enjoy the movie for its cumulative merits.",White House Down

So I started watching it without any high expectations. To make a long story short I was absolutely entertained throughout the movie and it kept me on the edge of my seat and bought out all the emotions one would expect to feel and go through watching an intense action movie. The director did an amazing job keeping the movie moving at a fast pace without it being stuffed with unnecessary information or comedy, Everything was done just right.

An outstanding performance from Jamie Foxx and Çhanning Tatum, but the nine rating is because of not so great acting from Lance Reddick in particular, who played General Caufield.

347,peter1-8,Meh. It's exactly what you'd expect.,5,31 December 2015,"It's about a group of terrorists taking over the White House, and the washed-up aspiring Secret Service agent who inadvertently gets roped in to stopping them and rescuing the President (so yes; it's basically Die Hard in the White House). It stars Channing Tatum and Jamie Fox, and was directed by Roland Emmerich. That description, honestly, should tell you everything you need to know.The movie delivers, I guess, more or less everything one could reasonably expect from a movie with that premise, those actors and that director. It has explosions, shootouts and car chases. It has F15 fighter jets, M1 Abrams tanks, and black Cadillac SUVs. It has scenes of famous monuments getting destroyed, scenes of government and military officials sitting in conference rooms urgently discussing what do to, and scenes of frantic newscasts. It has a subplot about the protagonist reconnecting with his estranged daughter, and a subplot about the insider discovered to be collaborating with the terrorists. You know the drill.In sum, it isn't terrible like Battlefield Earth or Gigli, and it isn't great like Gone With the Wind or Schindler's List. It's just a generic, ho-hum, so-okay-it's-average summer popcorn actioner, like Armageddon, Face/Off, Independence Day, Iron Man, Jurassic Park III, The Rock, Stealth, xXx and any number of others. Those who love this sort of stuff, of which there are plenty, will get exactly what they expect. Those who hate this sort of stuff, of which there are also plenty, will get exactly what they expect.

Clearly, if you're capable of reading little bit of summary, or watched a trailer, you wouldn't get your expectations too high. even the movie title suggests appropriate expectations about this piece. So basically, we have an old school action film here with a bit more technology in their arsenal. one man army tries to save the day and prove he's worth something more in the process. we have a good old fashioned ""bad guys use innocent people to blackmail good guys"" kind of situation - good guys have to follow the rules, while bad guys are more liberated than that. keep in mind, that there's no grey area here, it's more like black and white - not very hard to pick sides. I must say, that Im not American, so I really have no knowledge about the realism part in this movie, but i sure hope that all that good stuff that can trigger WW3 is a bit more harder to reach than that. so yeah, the idea is pretty simple, doesn't require ""too much thinking"" and is usually a good choice when searching for something more casual for the evening. bad guys have been picked conveniently crazy enough to pull such operation off (for example one of them is a neo-nazi who blows up buildings based on how many minorities it contains), we have that usual heroic presidential icon, a loving father and a husband, who's just waiting for a nobel peace prize to be nominated for, we have a dedicated father, who's threatened by the distance between him and his daughter, though not much attention is given to the issue (rightly so, I must say). other than that, we have some twists to cover up a very predictable ending (which still leaves it very predictable), action scenes are smooth and well done, good amount of work is put to fighting as well, so on that end the movie is all buffed up. acting is fairly decent despite what other reviews are saying, Jamie Foxx does a decent job to appear as a charismatic leader and Mr. Tatum is a convincible, bad-ass hero with all the right virtues.

357,jjhora,White House Down (2013) is Roland's third best film; next to The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day!,10,8 November 2013,"White House Down is a 2013 Political Thriller / Action film from director Roland Emmerich who, in the past, brought us the 2009 blockbuster 2012 and the 1998 re-imagining of Godzilla! It is written by James Vanderbilt (The Amazing Spider-Man), with a soundtrack composed by Harold Kloser (The Day After Tomorrow). White House Down is the second ""White House Under Attack"" to debut in 2013, with the other film being Antoine Fuqua's Olympus Has Fallen; and stars Channing Tatum, Jamie Foxx, Joey King, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Clarke, Richard Jenkins and James Woods. The movie is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for Intense Situations of Peril, Violence, Language and Adult Content. Overall, White House Down (2013) is Roland Emmerich's third best film; next to The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and Independence Day (1996)!President James Sawyer (Foxx) has just put forth a controversial plan to pull all the U.S. troops out of the Middle East and officially end the War on Terror. Meanwhile, Capital Policeman John Cale (Tatum) has just been denied entry into the Secret Service by Special Agent Carol Finnerty (Gyllenhaal) and to avoid disappointing his daughter Emily (King), John decides to take her on a tour of the White House led by guide Donnie Smith (Nicholas Wright). During the tour, John and Emily become separated when a heavily armed paramilitary group led by Stenz (Clarke) and Secret Service Agent-gone-rogue Martin Walker (Woods) take over the White House and sabotage the U.S. Government. Walker and Stenz, with help from an unidentified traitor, are hellbent on using their recent act of domestic terror to make sure President Sawyer's plan does not get anywhere near the point of being passed and to ensure victory in the Middle East by the use of nuclear weapons. Cale must do whatever he can to both protect President Sawyer (with help from Finnerty, General Caulfield (Lance Reddick) Vice-President Alvin Hammond (Michael Murphy) and Speaker of the House (Jenkins)) and to stop the terrorists once and for all! When I stepped out of the movie theater after seeing White House Down, I gave it a two thumbs up and that still remains true to this day.Critics and audience members are going to slam White House Down, not because it's a bad movie (because it's not), but because they do not like Roland Emmerich himself. Critics and audience members are going to slam White House Down because they believe the writers were constructing this project to put forth liberal or left-wing ideas (which they weren't). Let me be clear on something, not liking a director or being a Republican (Conservative) when you believe Hollywood is just making liberal propaganda is not reason enough to cut down a movie (like White House Down) that truly has heart behind its character development and storyline; while at the same time containing excellent action sequences, dazzling special effects, a great cast, chemistry among the actors and a pulse-pounding storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat with a neat twist at the end! White House Down (2013) is a great movie! It shouldn't be compared to Olympus Has Fallen (even though they have a similar plot) because the two films, other than that key point, are very different. White House Down is not better than Olympus Has Fallen, just parallel to it. Both are good and entertaining films to say the least.Do yourself a favor. Ignore the hatred towards this movie (it contains a plot that is borderline espionage) and rent or buy White House Down! You will have a good time watching this movie, so just relax (you may need to check your brain at the door during certain and very few scenes in the film).

There was nothing fresh, or new; there was no wow factor.

The undeniable chemistry between Tatum and Foxx was like a consolation for a 99.9% cliché storyline. The light humor between the two might have just given the audience a couple of time-outs from the heart-thumping moments during the movie's intense sequences, making the somewhat draggy, long-winded two-hour film a little easier to sit through.

360,paulp-784-404178,Hit in the head with a rocket launcher,2,14 June 2019,"A little over an hour and fifteen minutes into this movie, Capitol Policeman Cale (Channing Tatum) has just busted President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) out of the White House which has come under siege by right-wing extremists. As he's attempting to drive the president to safety by tearing up the White House front lawn in the presidential limo, Sawyer finds a bazooka in the back seat and loads it. When the car is hit by another ordinance from the pursuing vehicles, the president smacks Cale in the side of the head eliciting this line of dialogue from Cale: ""Can you not hit me in the head with a rocket launcher? I gotta drive!""There are some movies where silly lines like these slip through the cracks and the viewer can forgive and forget them. Sadly, dialogue like this is not the exception in White House Down but the rule. This film was released the same year as the much better Olympus Has Fallen and follows the same general plot. The White House has been penetrated by enemies of the United States putting the president and, ipso facto, the Republic at large in jeopardy. One man, who happened to be in the White House at the time with a vulnerable child in the mix finds himself unwillingly responsible for beating the bad guys and saving the child and the nation.While the plot of Olympus Has Fallen is as unbelievable as White House Down, the former somehow manages to be not only a viewable film but ends up being an enjoyable one. The characters are passionate and believable and the direction by Antoine Fuqua is paced wonderfully with Fuqua drawing from his actors a kind of realism that makes the film work. White House Down ends up turning a nonsense story into an absurd one.This wouldn't be a bad thing, necessarily, if the farce was executed intelligently. Here, we have buffoonery on full display largely due to an awful script, poor acting, and bad technical execution. Director Roland Emmerich's Independence Day had plenty of farcical moments but the farce was a sub-text that was used to prop up an entertaining story. In this film, Emmerich seems to have abandoned any pretense of telling a good story replacing entertainment with a slapdash free-for-all. While Independence Day is pure science fiction giving the screenplay a lot of room to play with humor and pseudo-inspirational presidential speeches, this film is wrapped around an admittedly serious subject while at the same time using 2013-era political situations as punchlines. It starts out being uncomfortable ends up being unwatchable.When I see a movie like this I always wonder what compels fine actors like Foxx and James Woods to associate their names with these types of films. A big paycheck seems like the obvious answer but I question if the degradation to an otherwise solid resume is worth the money. I'm generally not a fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal but she ends up pulling off a believable Secret Service agent giving the movie its only whiff of credibility. Joey King also does an admirable job as the frightened, albeit stereotypically snotty, teenager. Finally Rachelle Lefevre lights up the screen and whose presence in this movie elicited one of the two stars I gave it.",White House Down
361,mdkoesma,More enjoyable than the other one...,6,12 November 2013,"I'm not a huge fan of brainless action flicks usually.Yet while White House Down didn't have the most sophisticated plot lines, action sequence or CGI, I still find it much more acceptable than Olympus Has Fallen. It's like they're twins, with opposite personalities.One thing I clearly liked better in this movie was the characterization.They are humane, more realistic and relatable to most people. Their interactions and dialogs are fluid and fun to watch (even though they're improbable in real life). You can find yourself rooting for them in the movie.Even the villains are more...three-dimensional. Walker had clear objective and well-explained personal motives that are actually quite understandable (but not quite agreeable). Kang's motivation was valid enough, but stoic, one-dimensional deliverance rendered it unbelievable.The other thing I liked about White House Down was that they included competent female and child characters instead of just using them as ""maiden-in distress"" kind of props. Waving a flag is much more useful than curling up in a ball crying your eyes out.While the terrorist vs. lone hero plot is definitely a cliché - it was surprising to see domestic hate-group terrorists in the movie. Usually, Hollywood depictions of terrorists are foreigners who speak in heavily accented English or no English at all.As with any other action movies, in which the heroes seems to deter bullets magically, the movie requires turning off half your brain in order to enjoy the ride. But the questionable details (aside from the whole white house security breach by janitors part) aren't so obvious. Not many people would actually know details about the Presidential Limo, the Air Force One or the U.S's homeland security protocols. The problem solving in the movie is so simple that it is quite justifiable to solve them by throwing off grenades and launching missiles.Unfortunately, the thing that cripples the movie the most is the action itself: the half hearted one-on-one fights that never show off the gritty, skillful fights people seem to expect from today's action movies; The machine guns used mostly to shred furnishings apart instead of doing serious numbers on body counts; The scarcity of blood and gore; The lack of fancy high explosive weapons and thus the absence of highly destructive explosive scenes. The list may cause a major let down for most hard core action flick fan. Then again this is a PG-13 movie...But I'm not saying an action movie with all the violent stuff mentioned above would necessarily be a good movie. Story always comes first.",White House Down

Two words to describe this film - an insult!! Every typical Hollywood Americana cliché is right there in this film - to such a degree it made me cringe. It's that bad I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors.Some use the excuse ""you know this film was cheesy before you watched it"".

363,gbean2397,A Dumb-But-Fun 'Die Hard' Action Film,8,12 May 2020,"Roland Emmerich, the director of Independence Day, is certainly a hit-and-miss director, most of his films are good (ID4, Stargate, Universal Soldier), others are not-so-good (Anonymous, 10,000 BC, Stonewall). But in this case, WHITE HOUSE DOWN lands in the former part. Is it original? Nope. Is it decent? Yeah, pretty much so. But is it entertaining? Hell yeah!It is a dumb-but-fun ""Die Hard in the White House"" action film for action junkies. The script by James Vanderbilt is clichéd as all hell, but the film's charm is what makes it watchable, specifically the Channing Tatum/Jamie Foxx chemistry, the humor, and action sequences, all competently put together by Emmerich's direction. Even the villains are entertaining to watch, especially James Woods and Jason Clarke. And this film is a nice change of pace from Emmerich's usual 'end-of-the-world' disaster films, here he's doing something a bit small-scale, more of a Die Hard esque siege film. And thankfully he DOES NOT use the ""Greengrass Shaky Cam"" technique as much as most other wannabe action directors tend to such as Olivier Megaton who directed Taken 3. Here Emmerich allows us to actually see what's going on in the action. But boy does he sure seem to love wrecking the White House a lot. ;DHaving just come out three months after Olympus Has Fallen (which features a very similar plot of a terrorist assault on the WH), and while I do enjoy that film as well, I found WHD more watchable and more enjoyable, mostly likely because of its lighthearted, somewhat humorous tone, which does help make the serious scenes have more weight to them.But seriously, even with its clichés and flaws, and even the supposed American patriotism aside, this film will keep you entertained till the end, the two lead actors' chemistry and lighthearted tone keeps you engaged, the plot has enough twists and turns to keep the film engaging and not boring. Just enjoy it for what it is, a fun action rollercoaster film. And maybe bring along some beer and your friends for such a movie night, and I guarantee you'll have a fun time.",White House Down

Comparing this to Iron Man is comparing apples and oranges, for one knows immediately that Iron Man/Avengers is going to be fantasy before any movie of the series begins. White House Down is simply annoying and filled with ignorance. The final straw was an Air Force One comment about attaining a cruise altitude in 40 seconds... Good luck with that (about 8000 feet-per-minute is THE best rate of climb)... This movie is simply more Hollywood alternate-reality formula, both boring and annoying.",White House Down

The villains in this movie were the only developed characters but they were killed off way too easily. There wasn't a single scene where it felt like the ""good guys"" had a real conflict.

367,latreenjohnson,OMG!!! My groins are all wet!,4,20 October 2013,"In my own screen-writing & directing analysis, this historical movie is the first to EVER be filmed with an incumbent president's Wang throbbing in the mouth of a director throughout the entire production process. After watching it- I now want to resort to a one-party system, get rid of the Constitution, and restrict the federal government to exclusively hiring black men and white women (who we all know are extremely trustworthy and patriotic in their votes).Also, they picked the PERFECT 'bad-guys': Bible-thumping, assault-rifle-loving Republican-terrorist-h.0.m.0ph0bes who hate women and mistreat children. In fact, the ONLY reason they picked Channing Tatum (a Caucasian) as the lead-star is not simply because he was the Executive Producer, a registered-Democrat, and the existing gossip among a 'certain' special-interest group that wishfully-swears he is ""bi""- it is because they would have at least ONE argument against the movie being reverse-racist, sexist, and politically biased.Through the eyes of a self-proclaimed extremist liberal-Democrat activist, this movie made me smegma myself and I will forever call anyone who objects to it a stupid 'troll'. Obama loves you; now go out and wear your supportive ""hoodies"", try a little harder to not violate existing gun-control laws before you try to pass MORE, and sign up for Obamacare... your awesome new bill will arrive around late January.Don't waste your time hating on me for this free speech analysis, go out and make changes in your society if you don't appreciate the unfortunate problems that I am simply bringing to your attention.

I just can't get past how the plot is so bad. I can't get past how the scenes are so one sided. One guy takes out 20 better trained soldiers. It's just bad. Period.

It's no-brainer fun perfect for a lazy Sunday; if you let go of its exasperatingly clichéd narrative, you may indeed find yourself hooked to the boisterous story, but the hackneyed and cheesy script is alas harder to forgive. The humor is largely hit-or-miss, but more importantly, unnecessary. Nonetheless you might find the occasional banter by Foxx and Tatum to be timely comic relief amidst all the explosions. Although it has been advertised as the new Die Hard, the action is thoroughly not close to being as striking, but it's a decent try. In short, there's nothing in particular to write home about, and White House Down will eventually fade into the distance, forgotten and overlooked when you think back on 2013's many summer blockbusters, the others of which are infinitely more impressive and notable.",White House Down

Sure there where some moments when you'd be asking yourself, 'what the hell is he doing?'(or what the hell are they doing? referring to all of the terrorists.', 'why did he say that?'and what not, but in the end, despite the President killing a couple of terrorists and telling them not to touch his Jordan's, the movie still had a serious plot, and was addressed in a way that was some what enjoyable.

But it didn't take itself too seriously, which I found completely refreshing and entertaining. Along with the suspense, danger, and revelations, there are some truly funny moments.I live in a frighteningly conservative part of the country, and I did notice that not everyone was entertained, even at the funny bits. It seemed to me the reaction was more political than anything, because there is certainly a political message to the film. (Not to mention the muttering I heard on the way out of the theatre.)

374,aindikt,What a stinker,1,31 January 2014,"While the action was passable, and Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx will give the 13-year-old girls a thrill (PG-13 rating in the US), the plot, acting and general malaise of the movie are why it bombed at the box office.I'm generally of the view that the US public, and others in the West aren't nearly as left-wing as Hollywood (no surprises there, except perhaps to those in Hollywood). This movie bombed compared to Olympus Has Fallen for a couple of crucial reasons: 1) the actors were superior in Olympus, but importantly 2) the plot has to in some way be believable.How do you take down the White House - Olympus showed a well planned and heavy assault on the building; White House Down had a few guys with a box cutter.Who would take down the White House - North Korean terrorists with well trained troops and a hatred of the US, with a goal to force geopolitical change; White House Down had a disgruntled head of Secret Service security and a - you guessed it - right-wing conspiracy of the military industrial complex. The Olympus plot was based on current geopolitical events, the White House Down plot was based in a left-wing Hollywood screenwriter's wet dream. Most of the US lives in the real world.They both have the generally implausible 'inside man' or mercenaries who seem to think they can betray the US and get away with a bucket of money. I recall the end of Air Force One with Harrison Ford being similarly silly. But White House Down breaches that level of believability that Olympus didn't. That's why it failed, not because it was released second. Even the 13-year-old girls saw through that!",White House Down
375,colcomp-573-719084,What was I thinking?????,1,29 June 2013,"What was I thinking, that this might be a decent movie with some good acting? Yes. But I was surely let down. There is plenty of CGI action, explosions, killing and gun fire BUT all of it a real stretch on the old imagination. I have already seen OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (which was also a stretch) but the acting was so much better and the characters were much more realistic. I mean who doesn't like Morgan Friedman as the President (or acting as the acting President for a good part of the movie).Foxx & Tatum do not make a good pairing and certainly didn't carry their own parts very well at all. I'm not a big fan of Foxx to begin with but I thought I'd give him a chance... not anymore, I'm done with him.If you want to see the better of the two movies go see OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN instead of this copycat, wannabe.

From the white wife beater, the elevator gag (both the terrorists coming up and the ceiling scenes), to rocket launchers, to the rooftop fighting, the medias exposing the family, the helicopters, the nerd terrorist hacking the system and especially the first action scene where he hides behind the couch same as McClane hides behind the stacked construction materials.

Still, I went to the theater just for Tatum and Foxx. To my surprise, this one was an absolute blast, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it. First off, let's just get something out of the way: White House Down is pretty unrealistic. During the film there were some dialogs and events that were laughably impossible. However, this in no way clouds the excitement and fun of the movie itself.The story for the most part is pretty cliché. However, it is complex enough to always keep me intrigued, and towards the end there was a plot twist that I totally didn't see coming. Where White House Down shines is its action. I couldn't get enough of Tatum and Foxx dodging bullets and kicking ass. What's more, the director actually managed to pull off an exciting car chase scene. Imagine that! Apart from those, there were the usual explosions and fighter jets and so on, all of which adds to the thrill.The director did a very good job in controlling the pacing as well as the emotional atmosphere of the film. Contrary to Olympus Has Fallen, White House Down had a very light feel to it, and funny lines and events were all over the movie, which is one of the main reasons I enjoyed it so much. Also, towards the end there was a scene that was so touching and inspiring that I almost shed a tear. As far as the acting goes, I don't have much to complain about, although I would have preferred it if Jamie Foxx's character was just a little bit more serious.All in all, White House Down was exciting, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable.

There is a difference though between suspending reality and being in a totally alternate dimension.Jamie Foxx has always been a terrible actor, but I thought more of Tatum.

A few weeks later I saw it on TV and decided to watch it, I was pleasantly surprised. The premise is completely ludicrous, basically the whole plot could and would never happen, but after accepting this fact it becomes a tolerable film. Tatum and Fox were both pretty decent and gave the movie a very lighthearted tone even though there's constant action. Sometimes its nice to sit down and watch a movie without having to think or invest yourself in it too much, White House Down is just that. Its a movie that I'll probably flip to whenever I see it on the guide, regardless of what part its in, because its just something fun to look at and doesn't try to be anything more. Expected this movie to be about a 4/10 but in the end I think it deserves a strong 6.

381,ILiterallyHaveNoIdea,Agonizingly bad.,1,9 August 2013,"This is genuinely one of THE worst movies I have ever seen. The words don't exist in the English language to convey how bad this movie is. The story is pretty simple: the White House gets taken over by right-wing terrorists because you know, the REAL terrorists are the Republicans, and its up to Magic Mike and President Barrack Malcolm X to stop them and somehow save the world and there's an annoying child in there and its all very horrible and agonizing to watch. Now, despite the political hatchet-work, the terrible editing, the awful special effects, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the nonsensical story,the worst part is the fact that its full of actors who are competent and enjoyable to watch. Jason Clarke, who was fantastic in Zero-Dark Thirty (and the gone-to-soon police procedural Chicago Code), Channing Tatum, who was comedic gold in 21 Jump Street (at least relative to his competition; I sure like him) and Jamie Foxx (whom I personally loathe but I guess Django was popular enough) all featured in this vomitous mess of a movie and you know what? It was awful just the same.And then there's frankly offensive treatment of pretty much everyone in the Secret Service, any police force ever, or the military. For starters, all our baddies are ex-military or ex-CIA. You know, those guys who devoted their lives to our country so that they could...something? Its never really all that clear what personal benefit they're getting. Money? Maybe its an ideological thing. Those damned military types. Never was there a falser patriot than those who volunteered to put their lives at stake on a daily basis for the US. Well, apparently so, anyway. And predictably, the Secret Service is grossly incompetent, as is the military, at pretty much everything. Oddly enough though, the White House tour guides are much more proficient with weapons than you'd expect. Who knew. If you fall into that category of people who are militantly leftist, have an IQ under 60 (seriously, otherwise your brain will hurt. Its that stupid) and yet enjoy cheeseball action flicks (I'm not sure if anyone like this actually exists) than maybe if you're willing to suspend your disbelief you'll kind of enjoy it.

People in the theater were laughing at several parts. As opposed to when I left the screening of ""The Purge"" and people were muttering about how stupid it was, people were clapping at the end of this movie.I know Emmerich likes films that depict the destruction of swaths of America and this one is no different; however, the comedic aspects offset the ""haven't I seen this movie 100 times before?"" feel. Envision an off-road race taking place in the Presidential limousine on the grounds of the White House as the world looks on by television and a newscaster states, ""well, that isn't something you see every day"" and you have an idea of what's in store. While watching a scene in which the life of the President of the United States is at risk, you find yourself laughing. If, like me, you're somebody who can laugh at themselves and understands that levity can improve even the most dire of situations, I believe you'll enjoy this movie.The characters were well cast and Channing Tatum's daughter has the eye-rolling ""I can't believe you're my parent"" teenage attitude down to a T. There are some cheesy, clichéd parts, but nothing that detracts too much from the overall enjoyment of the movie.If you go in expecting this to be a fun summer movie, you'll get what you expect. I rated the movie highly because it was enjoyable for what it is. If you're looking for a deep, thought-provoking analysis of American politics, well, you won't find that here.There are several twists in this movie before you find out who is really behind the whole plot to take down the President.

I haven't seen Olympus has Fallen yet, but I wouldn't compare them even if I had, probably. Any movie with Morgan Freeman is another category.I watched it purely as an action film True, the CGI sequences aren't top of the notch, but if I want that, I watch Pacific Rim. This movie has characters that have depth - you learn little details about the villains, like that one of them is diabetic, which is a hell of a lot more than most action flicks offer. The dialog is well-written and humorous a lot of times. Jamie Foxx delivers a great portrayal of a pacifistic President who is forced into a combat situation. Channing Tatum (if not the best of actors) really fits his role. Besides I cannot get over how well structured the screenplay was! They set up Channing's character as an ex-soldier who want to join the secret service but whom Maggie Gyllenhaal's character declines access when he comes to his job interview with his daughter in tow. He tells her, he probably got the job to make her proud; they even meet the President who looks right through Channing's lie. Then when the proverbial **** hits the fan and his daughter is a floor below where the terrorists are taking the guided tour hostage, Channing's character John has ample motivation to safe his daughter. He stumbles into the opportunity to safe the President.... ... and off we are on a thrilling ride with suspense of epic proportions that had me shouting at the computer screen a lot of times and took my breath away because you (well, I at least) care about the characters and even the fate of the world.

385,badrak2007,"Reminds me of Swiss cheese, full of holes and smells funny from a distance.",2,27 September 2013,"Unbelievable, irritating and illogical. This trash truly exemplifies the direction that Hollywood is going and gives the audience a nice slap as a parting gift.In film, often simple is best. Simple with respect to plot, premise and dialogue, is seriously key to any movie. 'White House Down' is recklessly messy in these departments, and fails to provide anything original, exciting or even entertaining for that matter. This should be sharp enough to put you off, alas let me elaborate.It is unfortunate that 'White House Down' unintentionally coincides with its far superior counter-part 'Olympus has Fallen'. In Spite of this, I believed there to be serious potential. Both Foxx and Tatum have been in fine form recently, most notably for Foxx was his part in 'Django Unchained' which was a delight all round and Tatum in '21 Jump Street' also followed suit. Unfortunately there was none of that on-screen chemistry movie enthusiasts dream about, this was mostly due to the poor script and terrible characters they had to carry. really, the only saving grace with respect to the actors would have to be Joey King, she is easily one of the better child actors going around and her performance in 'The Conjuring' is some of the best work scene in a while.The real reason as to why I decided to write this review will not come as a surprise to the most of you. Physics and Logic. Is it suspiciously irrational, to completely annihilate the threat of a Nuclear conflict? Since when do militant helicopters intentionally fly, a few meters above hundreds of civilians? When did flag-waving become universally known as a means to say, ""Please don't bomb me"".These are seriously just a few of the instances in the film that made me cringe a little. The Flag-waving subplot made me giggle, as did the Limousine chase scene. Character relationships was one messy ordeal, and finally the real sting in the tail was the antagonist motive.I preach to the rationally minded viewers out there, do not see this joyless piece of propaganda. Rather, view Inception, Looper or even Olympus has Fallen if White House Heists are your thing.",White House Down

I don't even know where to start, everything was wrong with this film!Jamie foxx, who in my opinion cant act for toffee and is only watchable in a supporting role in very small doses, is totally unbelievable as an American president, his acting true to form is wooden, forced and monotone! The week supporting cast make it so cringeworthy to watch, I can only liken the interaction to dalek dialect. I.am.a.dalek. I.am. an. Actor. We.are under.attack.oh no.what shall.we.do. awful just awful. Channing tatum doesn't work either as a tough guy, nice to look at without his shirt but soo unbelievable. Christopher biggins would have been a better choice! cheesy lines, a rubbish script, bad bad acting, stupid stunts and an apparently deaf director Itss fair to say I absolutely hated this film, action is my favourite genre and this was a complete Larry let down!

People moaning it was ""unrealistic"" well if you wanted it to be realistic it probably wouldn't exist and neither would the other movie you're talking about. It is for entertainment not for you to write notes down for tomorrows homework. You can get this movie rather cheap now and if you give it a chance and look past some of the ""intentional"" things that happen you might enjoy it. The movie starts of slowly for you to get used to what's happening in more of a slow pace and understand things more clearly and the ""irrelevant"" parts you will see from time to time has a certain purpose like trying to make you laugh or introducing something new.Now there is also parts in the move that people pointed out where the main villains could have been killed easily about 5 times and ended the movie, however, if they was to make a 5 minute movie by doing that then they would be here complaining about that instead.All in all it had some good action scenes, they put some bits in to make you laugh and it is entertaining so it think it's a pretty good movie",White House Down

And this is one of the better ones I've seen I must say.The beginning of the movie is too long and takes itself too seriously, and I had to push myself to carry through it and thought ""when is the fun going to start?"" but somewhere in the second act it loosens up and does go from ""dumb action"" to ""dumb fun action"".When it's over-the-top and silly, it makes you smile, but don't watch it looking for real character development.

391,thedarxu,"White House Down, MOVIE OR TV SHOW?",7,4 October 2015,"White House Down. The movie was very interesting to watch. The overall story-line was great but however it could be expanded even further. However the plot of the movie is very debatable. Somehow a group of 'maintenance workers' manage to sneak weapons into the White House and place a bomb in the US Capitol building! The plot could have been extended a lot more to make the scenario more realistic. For example when Martin's (head of Secret Service) son dies, the movie could have shown his death in the beginning to show why Martin did it. This could make the movie better. Also when Air Force One got shot down the movie could show what happened after, like did it crash into the ocean or in a town. White House Down seems also to be more like a TV Show. There are lots of shows and movies having almost the same story line. If it was a TV show it would have been more successful. Overall it was a great movie to watch with great actors,(Channing Tatum) and is recommended by me. Improvements are needed and the movie could also have been extended even more.Movie OR TV show?7/10",White House Down

The writers generated several tension-building plot twists leading to a strong ending, and the special effects are impressive. The writers included inventive dialog at the conclusion that reference events at the beginning of the film -- so if you listen carefully, you will hear some wonderful gems. Several actors deliver very good performances, including Channing Tatum and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Young Joey King is impressive as the young daughter. Jamie Foxx was respectable as the President (not as regal as Dennis Haysbert in '24', but still enjoyable). You can filter out the political commentary as an integral part of the plot development. If you go in to watch this movie as inventive entertainment, I believe you will see that WHD really delivers suspenseful and enjoyable entertainment.",White House Down

Started off OK before descending into the typical Emmerich cartoon second half. Not even a good group of actors (although Foxx as POTUS is a serious miscasting of major proportions) can save the rotten script. Joey King's depiction of the whiny ""spunky"" little girl succeeded in riling up some the audience to openly call for her to be offed midway through the show.This flick is very much a popcorn B-movie action show, entertaining enough with lots of booms and bangs to wow the pre-teen crowd. On the same vein, the plot is clearly suitable for the same age group, and should be regarded as such. Don't worry too much about reality and accuracy.

394,Sergiotasdelen,yes it was unbelievably bad but I still enjoyed it I think...,6,14 July 2013,"First of all let me notice everyone that I'm not a native English speaker so bare with me through all of the grammar and spelling errors.I've just finished watching this move an hour or so ago and really felt the need to review this movie.Let us just begin with the fact that this movie is simply entertaining! A lot of things did not feel right and I personally believe the ""military"" and the ""politicans"" were portrayed without any backbone or professionalism in their jobs as you'd expect people of those positions to act. I'm not going to go into any details revealing spoilers but I can say for 100% certainty that anyone who has some line of experience with a job in either the military or police or higher level of government will find the this aspect of the movie a disgrace and seriously as if written by a 10 year old.Having said that here comes the part for everyone to answer for them selves if you want to watch this movie or not; Can you handle the ridiculous portrayal of such high ranking men and their actions in this movie? If yes than you should give this movie a try, I have to admit that the movie itself does not really know if it wants to be a comedy or an action movie or a thriller but it is watchable and enjoyable if you approach it light heartedly. at times you will laugh out loud at other times you'll be like.. What the hell? oh come on?!! If your answer is no than avoid it at all costs. without giving away any spoilers but the thought of a fighter strike group aborting a direct presidential order because some girl is holding a flag in her hands is laughable at the very least.The movie has serious problems in the aspect of revealing ""reasons"" for what all is happening and also has serious trouble into making characters believable.Dialogue is utterly weak and plots have been welded together through a lack of intelligence on behalf of the ""writers"" in my opinion.Putting this all aside and even how ridiculous this movie is script wise it still is enjoyable if you just watch it as a pop corn movie. The actors do their jobs okay, I can't blame them for lousy dialog which greatly costs this movie points in my review. Good fast paced action all over the movie and some funny but enjoyable action scenes make up for the bad dialog and plot. Don't expect a top class movie and you can enjoy this one. 6 out of 10",White House Down
395,indahbsi,The White House Down movie!,10,15 May 2019,"The film tells the relationship between father and daughter involved in a grave incident, namely the fall of the White House and the hostage-taking of civilians by terrorists inside the building. In a terrible situation, John Cale faced a situation where he had to save his daughter, President, country and hostages. The White House Down film revolves around John Cale's action to save the President.Channing Tatum played his role very well, especially when he played dangerous scenes without using stuntman which became the main attraction. This is a special attraction and suitable to compete acting with Jamie Foxx who plays the US President. John Cale as a hero in this film, then together with President Sawyer tried to thwart the conspiracy action.The director presents this film with expert formulas. Talking about the relationship between a father and a child with a visual appearance through the many action scenes, massive explosions, along with views of the white house and its history, managed to become a differentfilm from other action films.

The plot of this movie is similar, but worse and even more stupid.For example - the scene with the limo driving in the garden. Fun concept - but WTF, there are hundreds of soldiers to shoot down the cars hunting the limo - yet they give up the same moment one tank is hit by RPG fire.
I can't tolerate the Finnety charachter. She's just so annoying (even though she contributes to solving everything in the end)
When Cale has found the president and they use his phone in the bedroom they talk REALLY LOUD.
The bad guys are really skilled in the beginning - taking out hundreds of guards - yet they don't even seem to react when Cale is starting to take them out.

It's easy to portray pain, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world...no other had done it before and perhaps no other will do it again.

405,geegeethree,Not as bad as I thought....,6,3 August 2014,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSWhen I first caught this movie, I caught it at the end when the black hawk helicopters come on the scene. The CGI effects were so apparent, especially on my HDTV, that it looked phony. And the CGI only gets more apparent from there. The acting from that point was horrendous. And I would never say that about Jamie Foxx or any of the other iconic cast members. But then I watched it from the beginning and I completely changed my views. Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum are great together! A comedic team. I loved them together! I LOL'd a great deal once Jamie and Channing paired up. I love the change of shoes! Of course the African American president wore Jordans! Hilarious!The tour guide, played by Nicolas Wright, was also funny. I especially liked his reaction when the helicopter's blades cut through the roof and back him into a corner.My criticism of Jamie Foxx as POTUS is that he acted more like President Barack Obama instead of acting like a presidential person and the leader of the free world. As a talent, Mr. Foxx is skilled at imitating people, but I'm not so sure how well he can act out a character that he did not develop. Joey King is a great talent in this movie. The camera loves her. She's darling. What bothers me about the movie, beyond the Hollywood fascination of taking down the White House, is the ineptitude of White House security. Really? No one can get a shot off to kill the intruders before Channing's character comes on the scene?So, beyond the CGI, and if you can believe Mr. Foxx as Mr. President, then this is a fun, action-packed movie.",White House Down

The only reason why their could be a low review is because some of the things they say and their props are inaccurate. Besides for that the movie is amazing and Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx are great in the movie. The seem to have great chemistry in the movie. Im not saying this movie had no flaws, as i sayed before their was inaccurate quotes and the way they used their props. without spoiling anything what do you think about the windows at the white house.

407,Misthaufen1704,"Passable action film, if you ignore the last 30 minutes",4,2 October 2013,"I went into this film with fairly low expectations. I enjoy dramatic, thought-provoking and original cinema, but I'm also a sucker for big budget, loud explosion films that don't require much in the way of brain function. From the trailer, you can usually tell when a film is going to require your attention, and when you're just going to be able to go in and enjoy the ride. White House Down certainly seemed like the latter to me, but even going into it in ""brain off"" mode, I was still disappointed.It all starts off quite well, and to be fair the first 90 minutes or so are what was promised. Predictable storyline, big guns, tense moments and some (albeit forced) comedy. Foxx puts in a mediocre performance as the US President (well, we all have bills to pay, I suppose), and James Woods is his usual forgettable self. Tatum, as an ex-military serviceman who fails to get into Secret Service duty (I wonder how that'll pan out by the end?) certainly looks the part, but definitely should cut back on the amount of time he has to spend actually acting, as opposed to running/ jumping/ shooting. But these can be forgiven in this type of mind-numbing action film. Even the clichéd, patriotic subject matter of the seminal US government building being infiltrated by terrorists can be overlooked, as long as we get a decent balance of good versus evil; the bad guys attack, the nation's defence springs into life and after some collateral damage and a decent fight, the good guys win and have learned a lesson.Unfortunately, things start to go rapidly downhill as the film progresses. Joey King plays an immensely irritating young ""journalist"" who runs her very own political expose YouTube channel (yeah, right), and throughout the course of the film becomes an all-American hero(in). She happens to be on a tour of the White House when it's hit by a group of terrorists, and risks her own life to upload videos of said terrorists to YouTube for the world to see. Meanwhile, El Pres transitions from softly-spoken politician to gun toting action hero as he attempts to flee the White House and get back to a working government. Things go pretty badly for him when he is killed (or so everyone thinks), and a new president has to be sworn in.Things go from bad to ridiculous as the film progresses. Air Force 1 is destroyed (with the newly sworn-in President on board), prompting the swearing in of yet another temporary President. This then drags on for a while, until the day's newest President decides to (shock, horror) order an air strike on the White House, destroying the most famous building in America whilst killing the terrorists and the innocent tourists inside. The order is given to assemble the raptors and destroy the White House. Will these hardened military pilots, given a direct order from the President, bomb the White House? Will the guys who think nothing of firing on innocents in Iraq under orders go through with it? Of course they will. That is, until they get near to the White House and see Joey King on the front lawn, running around waving an American flag. And yes, you did just read that correctly. The pilots then decide to disobey direct Presidential orders and call off the strike themselves (muttering something along the lines of ""I didn't sign up for this sh*t""), with the young girl becoming a heroin, and allowing the SEALs to instead go in and take out the terrorists.Surely that's the worst it can get, you say? Not even close. Not content with simply winning, Foxx re-emerges and (somehow) manages to have the latest President arrested as he was in on the entire thing. The irritating girl is a national hero, her YouTube video having had 700 million views in the space of a few hours, and to top it off she gets to spend some time with the President ride in Air Force One; a dream for activists, apparently. The White House is of course saved from destruction, the bad guys are all killed, the tourists saved and Tatum finally gets his chance to work for the Secret Service, as the President's personal bodyguard.Oh, and did I forget to mention that to top off the awesomeness of the US government and the ""little guy"" heroes they also managed to achieve world peace? Seriously, that happens. What a day for America, eh? I honestly expected the cast to break into song amid chants of ""USA! USA!"" Luckily, the worst of the dross is contained in the last half hour, which made the first 90 minutes bearable, and saved it from a 1 star rating. I would recommend you watch it this far, turn it off and imagine your own, less drawn out, ending.This clichéd lemon of a film is not only aimed at the American masses, it actively tries to alienate every viewer from every other country in the world. It's very much a ""look at me, look how awesome I am"" experience, which I have no doubt will be a roaring success in some American states, when watched by a particular demographic of people (for anyone outside of the US, try actually watching an American-made action film in New York, it's an experience you'll never forget!).

Good guy hides from bad guy, good guy fights and wins against bad guy, destroying some part of the white house along the way, more bad guys come in, repeat. For about an hour and a half, this went on, making us wonder when, for the love of God, will it end? It doesn't know when to stop. Even the introduction took too long to get to the point. I don't have a problem with movies being slow, but come on. This is a summer action flick with a terribly blatant message. If you can't win our hearts, at least entertain us.If the acting for this movie wasn't bad enough, the writing for it certainly was. It tries to portray the protagonists/antagonists as black and white as possible. Jamie Foxx might as well have said ""War is Bad"" and put that as the tagline of the film. There is no subtlety, thought, or logic, put into the motivations of these characters whatsoever. Speaking of logic, there were WAY too many stupid decisions made in the film. There were at least 5 moments in this overlong film where the main antagonist could've been dead and the whole thing would've been over. You don't, for a single moment, feel threatened by this guy. Another moment is when the president is being fired on by terrorists in a car with a turret, outside of the White House for all the innocent civilians and News Cars to see. Along with these people are some armed soldiers with a tank. Yet, the soldiers do NOTHING AT ALL. While their president is being fired upon, they do NOTHING. They might as well have been more civilians.And then there's the ""plot twist"". Just when you know you've had enough of the movie, the movie says ""Screw You! We've got one more ""surprise"" for you!"". I won't reveal what it was, but I will tell you that it was a complete waste of time and was completely unnecessary (just like this movie). I could name off so many things wrong with this movie and spoil everything along the way, but frankly, it's just not worth discussing. There is no value in this movie whatsoever. Nothing about it will help you feel like you've spent your money and/or time well on it. It doesn't even have a redeeming quality of it being so bad that it's worth watching. There is nothing to enjoy from this movie. It's boring, cliché', black and white at it's finest, and just downright stupid. I beg you to not watch this movie, in whatever power this review may have.

When opportunity presents its self he could have taken out more than half the enemy combatants with a single hand grenade which he had a backpack full of. This may have been how the story was written but it could have been portrayed as to not make the hero look like a amateur. As this is America land of the free and home of the 2nd amendment. I also think that the movie should express accurate ballistic effects. Example: a RPG will not stop a modern Tank.

You'll be grinding your teeth through 3/4 of it and just hate the rest; I don't wish that on anyone.If you can ignore the surprisingly (for this anti-political time) pro-politics script, and let the likable characters (mostly), good one-liners, good action, and good pace (the supposedly slow beginning didn't stand out to me), you'll have fun.",White House Down

If you liked Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow or 2012, you had to suspend reality. Don't you do that with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Star Trek?? Come on, most entertaining moves are not realistic. Was Terminator realistic? Is any science fiction movie realistic? Any 007 movie? Any movie for that matter?? jamie Fox makes a great President. He's funny and you like him. There is always a foil in the government to the ""good"" guys and this one has plenty of them. The old guys in power are a bunch of koots and can't be trusted. Channing is a stud and the chicks dig him. There is a lot of intense action and shoot em up. It is not boring and keeps your interest.

However, what it is, is a slightly different take on a white house attack that's refreshingly slanted, especially the novel idea of not having the president just be a static person who constantly needs saving and isn't able to help himself at all. Also there is just that interjection of comedy which is just right, and needed for a movie of this type so the tension does not become a frustration. Yes, the storyline has been overdone in the past, but the thousands of movies that we have seen by now means there will never be a movie you will see in your life again that is truly original, so don't let that be a reason to not give it a shot. I must admit however there were a few clunks in the flow of the storyline. That being said I would watch it again.",White House Down

I am shouting that for all those reviewers who forgot that!,7,28 September 2013,Personally the title of the film gave me an indication that it wasn't going to be an intellectual drama movie so I went along with my husband and 2 boys for what I expected to be an American Cheese Factory with a lot of action and guns - lots of guns! We were therefore not disappointed with what we got. The fact that it had a bit of comedy in it where we and the rest of the cinema laughed was a bonus and which led to me giving it a 7. As a family we thoroughly enjoyed the film - yes it did remind me of other films in parts but don't they all? It is what it is - an American family action movie with guns and if you go with that in mind you will enjoy it.PS. Channing Tatum in a vest is never a bad picture on a huge screen!,White House Down

Here we go, another DIE HARD reference,the hero and the president evade the bad guys by hiding on top of an elevator Come on guys get some original ideas!! Jamie Foxx was great and up to his usual standards but Channing Tatum has the same wooden acting that he had in GI Joe zzzzz!!!

They are also complaining that it's too much like ""Obama"". Well, I am not an Obama supporter, but I really didn't think much about him during this movie, other than the fact that they used Jaime Foxx to play the role of the president, and he's black. But who cares, Jaime Foxx is an INCREDIBLE actor. I mean come on, what an amazing job he did! (He always does). It's entertainment guys! It's really just to see something cool happen on the big screen, and try and imagine if it were to really happen one day. THAT'S IT. I don't think having a black president is the big deal here, whether he's republican or democrat, the real thing here is that they used an actor with a different name. So that right there gives the movie mad props for me! I was sick and tired of movies like transformers and a whole bunch of other movies always coming out with ""Barack Obama"" as president in the actual movie. Where as in past movies before Obama was elected, they always had a fake president with a fake name. It bugs me. So mad props to White House Down for actually using an actor with a fake name.

It is about an interesting story about a group of terrorists attacking the white house and the president. Channing Tatum did great in their role as father and security guard, as Jamie Foxx did also do a great job as the president. They were full focused on the main story and out came a great movie what does great for all total action lovers. I can recommend it for anybody who likes action movies in a way. The effects and explosions were great animated! I'd give this 8 out of 10 points , I would have hoped for a bit more besides the main story, such as emotional scenes.",White House Down

These ""Presidents"" in the movies would never get their hands dirty to save the U.S. Jamie Fox's performance was one of the worst of his career. The only partial excitement came during the last 20 minutes or so. I really can't recommend this movie to anyone unless they have an I.Q of 50 or less. One more thing, (Spoiler) When the President gets shot and his pocket watch saves him, have a strong feeling that this has been done in quite a few other movies. I just can't think of which ones at this movie. So, this movie, IMO, isn't worth a bag of popcorn. ~Robert~",White House Down

Jamie Fox handed in a performance appearing to have put in about as much preparation as one would expect for a SNL hosting gig. Channing Tatum, as another reviewer mentioned, did his best Bruce Willis imitation but nothing could save this dreadful script. **Spoilers Below** The pocket watch was almost as predictable as it was with the bubble-gum filled cigarette case in ""Johnny Dangerously"".In addition to all of the above, I could have done without the ridiculously left-wing nature of the film... There were so many that it was hard to keep track but here were some: Left Wing President, who wanting nothing more than peace in the middle east, essentially declares it so. His peace policy blocked only by the right-wingers and the evil military industrial complex, the only way that the evil conservatives can stop his plans is to get the right wing speaker of the house to enlist a secret service agent (whose son died in a botched military operation), a burned off-book spy , and a ""right wing"" neo- nazi. Their master plan: To assassinate the President and Vice President and make the world think it was done by Islamist Terrorists..If you are able to look past the obvious political nonsense in the film... your still left with a heaping pile of crap.

The cast were good. There were a few clichés in some parts. Over all, it was a great watch. Not something for the Art movie lovers. The background score, well, it is sheer masterclass. The little girl in the movie did a great job as well. One thing this movie managed to do better than White house down was keeping stuff more realistic. Also, there is a very interesting portrayal of the White House in the movie. I am an Indian and it usually is hard to get a patriotic feeling for another country. But trust me, at the end of this movie, I felt like I was an American! :D Sounds silly right?

The employment of actors who show authoritative rolls brought lots of life to the screen! Believable characters not crazy out of place people!

It seems to me that by in large reviewers just don't like movies. Not the intelligent reviewers anyway. They seem to be more concerned with how they look to their readers, pretending they know something about film. Reviewers are writers who want to be something else, filmmakers perhaps, and find it incredibly trendy and smart to disassemble and deconstruct the hard work of others; and to hate entertainment. They all seem to have this idea that they know better and I have little time for their self righteous, self important, pretentious bullshit thinly disguised as some sort of public service. Heads up: it does no one a service to be condescending or insulting. With that said I will now step off of MY self righteous soap box and say that White House Down is a damned good time time with excellent shots of DC (making it look like an attractive, interesting place to be as opposed to the hot and smelly dumpster it actually is...seriously, the place smells like a dumpster), in your face action, fine performances-- Jamie Foxx is pretty cool as the leader of the free world--a bad guy who you just can't wait to watch die (there are several bad guys in this movie, so I'm not counting that as a spoiler), and pretty awesome hero in John Kale.Now the movie gets a little long which is only an issue if you're a smoker like me, by the middle of the third act I was craving pretty hard, and there's some dumb lines of dialogue during one of the action sequences that didn't seem to fit the characters, but whatever.White House Down is a fun and intense action movie that I would gladly see again. 8 out of 10!",White House Down

Mike uses his abs to avoid death while the rest of the white house security and secret service and army and National guard (who actually do something! Who knew?) get mowed down. Lots of things blow up until one of the Mcpoyle brothers hacks into America, apparently, and launches a missile at a plane carrying the newly sworn in President because its too much of a hassle to see if the current president is really dead, (i suppose they just knew the people in charge of guarding the white house were that incompetent) anyway the 747 carrying the new prez and the short Jewish doctor from House gets blown out of the sky in stunning HD and the dead Dad from Six Feet Under gets sworn in as president. Meanwhile Harvey Dents dead fiancé says some forgettable lines all the while your just hoping to see her blown up again, Mike outruns every speeding bullet sent his way with super-stripper-hardcore-parkour and more stuff blows up until Mcpoyle gets blown up (by an extremely vague countermeasure??) and Ray Charles attempts to stop a bullet with his chest unsuccessfully and the only person in America (or the audience) who cares is Magic mikes lovechild/daughter Emily somethingorother. She does something to stop the government from carpet bombing the ish out of Washington DC and Ray Charles is magically alive because of blah blah blah his wife got him for some special occasion, but evil is still afoot in the form of the Dead dad from Six Feet Under... Obviously. Plot twist. Confrontation. Jail time. Credits. It was hilarious, but not on purpose. I want my Dollar back Redbox.My rate is actually 1/10 in terms of good movie quality.

It's fun.BUT...for some reason I can't get past the end when 2 seconds after everything's resolved, suddenly the little girl is talking to the press, and the press is 5 feet away from everything going on. And I know it's ridiculous to bring this up, but there's NO WAY someone who's just gone through what she has will suddenly be available to the press, who will ask questions about her vlog. Just the final 5 minutes made me laugh at the ridiculousness, and I understand the irony of that statement, but like I said, I could go along with the first 95% of the movie. And, ""This isn't over"" Gyllenhaal's character says. If by ""isn't over"" you mean there's still going to be a terse conversation with the speaker of the house.

I was out of interest at first, but when I began to follow the story, I started to love it. The story is really clear and easy to follow, even with all those action moves (which could make a scene in action movies quite complicated sometimes, but they didn't really bother me in this movie). However, the story is too clear to the point that it's predictable. So, I didn't really get any surprise element from this movie. But, I did get my heart racing while watching the fighting and the nuclear being armed, also when the vice president was killed. I was surprisingly enjoying the action scenes.What I love about movies is that we get something to learn from them. From this movie I learned about sacrifice. It's about the priority, which one would you sacrifice? this one or this one? Sometimes it's hard to choose, but we can't let ego or personal stuff get in our way. You'll see in this movie, where one person sacrifice his life for ego, while the other one sacrifice his life for others. You will be able to decide on your own which one is right while watching this movie. The other thing that I learned is that our past doesn't define our future. John Cale may not be qualified for the job with Secret Service based on his past, but his present, his actions make him qualified.

Channing Tatum played his role very well, Jamie Foxx was funny in parts and I thought the young girl ( Joey King) was also very convincing.funniest part of the movie in my opinion was when the tour guide had the gun and said "" tours over"" Good movie and one that I shall be buying in the near future. Didn't feel the film was too long and didn't think it was as predictable as it could have been.

People might say that it's not realistic, you can't attack the White House this easily..... Seriously, what do you expect? You want realistic movies? Where's the point in them, if it would be 100% realistic then we'd call it life. I'm sorry, but Jamie Foxx is amazing. He's a great actor and his acting was hilarious and perfect. For god's sake, he's wearing Jordans and kicks a guys face yelling ""let go of my Jordans!!"" Tatum and Foxx worked together well, they're chemistry was on the spot and the jokes were hilarious. And yes, the movie is loud. There's loads of explosions and everything is destroyed. It's an Emmerich. He's known for big disasters. Haven't you seen Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla or 2012? Great movies, all by Emmerich and I believe he deserves some kind of acknowledgement that his movies are amazing. I don't like writing or reading reviews, and I feel everybody who writes them is hating on the movie, for whatever reason.

A couple of times during this movie I found myself asking ""Can these guys actually do a thing like this?"", and ""What would happen if an event like this actually took place?"". But those are questions for another day.For me, White House Down was a film that can only be described as a mixture between Die Hard and Home Alone. On one hand you have all the bloodshed, guns and explosions found in a good Die Hard movie, with several action scenes(which in some parts seem a bit too cheesy to be true) involving guns, rocket launchers, helicopters- you name it! But on the other hand you have the terrorists, who twice reminded me how some criminals can be. White House Down has the same idea as the Christmas classic, only this time instead of invading a suburban family home, it's the White House.Ultimately I have to say I did enjoy this movie, but I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more had things been a wee bit more realistic.",White House Down

Driving the car in lawn. Full Army is looking like they are watching Horse Race @ racecourse Road. No shooting, no saving. 3. They bring 3 tanks, gang blow one. Two was just watching, did nothing? 4. President missing, now vice-president took oath.. But killed..., now another guy took auth.. How come finger print of first president worked on the nuclear launch system? 5. The hacker made whole security system, didn't know how to open his own designed gate, and blow himself up. 6. They sent 3 choppers, but blow and crashed to death. Then 3 Blackhawk, 2 blow, one managed for a while and 4-6 seal member managed to land via rope. Where they gone missing? 7. Army can see Mr President is safe, but not entering in the whitehouse. Waiting for him to die. 8. Army general is dumb; he only saluted in movie 3-5 times, with 4-5 lines of dialog. Did nothing. 9. They saw every possible room exists, library, kitchen, over office, balcony, elevators, ball room, bedroom, study room, tunnel, bunkers... was a nice whitehouse tour. Thanks. 10.

There are numerous obvious fallacies in the presentation of the security aspects of the film and the plot meanders. The movie seems to suffer from a identify crises, serious political thriller vs comedic quips. And it appears to be nothing more than a vehicle for Channing to perform impossible heroic stunts.

When I came back, I wanted to see what the rest of the world had to say about this movie. Before posting this review, I was, and still am, an average movie-goer who doesn't really care about all the details that all the other reviewers get into. I don't know what to tell you if you're reading this and you are a hardcore movie lover who looks into every single detail like you are a high school English teacher. If I had seen the reviews before I went, I probably would not have gone to watch the movie with everyone bashing the title. Luckily, for this movie, I did not read the reviews like I do for other movies. And I cannot be the only average movie-goer in this world that checks reviews before watching a movie. So if you are an average movie-goer that just wants to enjoy the action/dragged-out-story and have a laugh once in awhile, I would recommend this movie.",White House Down

In the interest of full disclosure, I am not normally a guy who likes mindless action movies (Die Hard 1 was good, 2-10 not so much), but it had Foxx and Gyllenhaal in it, so it can't possibly be as bad as, say, Independence Day. But, without research, I didn't realize the movies came from the SAME GUY.But ultimately I was right, ID was a 1 star and WHD is a 2.Character and plot development? They didn't have time, they had 2 million rounds of various calibers to expend so it was laid out in the fastest most cliché manner possible.I am a left leaning person but the ""bad guys'"" and their ""motivations"" were about a subtle as an anvil dropped on Wiley Coyote. And the bad guys were a grab bag of the worst nightmares of a liberal. It seemed like a Batman movie where the Joker, Riddler and Penguin all got together to fight the caped crusader Tatum. Really? The only saving grace was the $100 mil of CGI of the WH being blown up which offered momentary respite from the, gulp, dialogue.My brain feels insulted and I feel sorry that Jamie and Maggie were so desperate for a payday, they appeared in this.

That didn't take away from the movie for me.

In one scene, an Abrams main battle tank is being used to breach the guard fence around the Whitehouse to allow our heroes to escape. The bad guys fire a RPG-7 anti-tank round at the front of the Abrams, where the thickest armor is located. The RPG-7 round blows up the Abrams. Really! During the invasion and taking down of Iraq in 2003 by U.S. forces led by General Tommy Franks, one Abrams got involved in a protracted firefight inside an Iraqi city with Iraqi soldiers. The Abrams took 33 hits from RPG-7s. All external weapons and equipment were blown off the hull. But the hull was never penetrated and the main gun was never damaged. The Abrams and her crew kept fighting until relieved. One hit from a RPG-7 will not hurt an Abrams in any way, shape, or form.The bad guys decide to kill Air Force One while it is in flight somewhere over the U.S. The bad guys over-ride ICBM launch command and fire an ICBM at Air Force One. Of course, the ICBM connects with Air Force One and destroys it. There's just one catch. There is no way in this universe that an ICBM can be used to shoot down an aircraft. It cannot be done, period.Then we have Jamie Fox's President character with a political agenda that mirrors the political agenda of Barrack Obama.

To think anyone would take this film seriously is hysterical. It is predictable, the dialogue is campy and excruciating at times, and even though it had its moments, I felt it had too many comedic moments which took away from the ""seriousness"" of the plot. And regarding plausibility: is it realistic to believe a Delta Force team could be wiped out that quickly? Come on! Way to insult the elite. Wait for this film to go to network television.

It really annoys me how lazy Hollywood seems to be getting. Everyone seems to be producing the same movie using different actors.

The actors where great, (aspecially Joey King, for a fourteen year old girl, her acting was surprisingly good) the special effects where awesome, it looked very realistic when the white house exploded. although there were some jokes whom killed the moment a little bit and the ending was a bit cliché (there was, obviously, a happily ever after, for instance: all the villains got killed) but there was also a plot twist in the ending, and I saw it just a tiny little bit coming!!

WHITE HOUSE DOWN on the other hand is like the B version of that. First off, Jamie Foxx is NOT a believable President in my opinion. He needs to be cracking jokes or rapping or something. Where's Denzel? That cat is a good actor & he's believable. Second, I don't see Chaning Tatum's goofy, screw up of a character trying to save the day against a group of lame terrorists assaulting the White House. Bruce Willis I can see pulling this off but not Chaning. Was this a Die Hard script that got turned down? It's like they were going for some Die Hard kind of thing here & failed miserably. BTW, how did terrorists that dumb & unorganized take over the White House anyway. Third, I thought this was suppose to be some huge summer blockbuster, but I've seen 70's grind house movies more believable with better actors. How many 3rd rate actors can you count?

Also, no one takes their shirt off in Olympus.Hollywood did the almost the exact same thing when bringing Tom Clancy's superb novel ""The Sum of All Fears"" to the big screen. Instead of Arab terrorists blowing up Baltimore with a nuclear weapon, screenwriter Dan Pyne changed the bad guys into white German Neo-Nazi corporate terrorists because he felt ""Arab terrorists"" had become a ""cliché"" in Hollywood.White, right-wing terrorists are NOT a cliché in Hollywood? Please don't get me started.And don't get me started about the Hollywood treatment of Tom Wolfe's ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" masterpiece of a novel exposing political correctness and racial politics.

The special effects were dynamite (no pun intended) and the entertainment factor was a 10 out of 10. The story held me spellbound all through the movie (and that really means something). Channing Tatum was very believable and the girl who played his daughter was very good also. Jamie Fox, always a wonderful entertainer, was also very believable. Maggie Gyllenhaal gave a great performance as a lead actor. The bad guys were very convincing which isn't always the case. It makes me wonder what would really happen if the White House was attacked. It was a little too real when they blew up the Capital building and the White House - gave me chills after having 9-11 happened.

Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, on to the review! Oscar winner Jamie Foxx strikes a humorous balance between reality and fantasy as the President. And though Channing Tatum is unlikely to win an Oscar anytime soon, he's a pretty good fit into the Bruce Willis-esque role he fills in this picture.If you're looking for a level-headed examination of Washington politics, then you've walked into the wrong theater with this one. But if you need a kind of fun, escapist bit of fluff, then this one's right up your alley.The film had some genuinely funny moments, and it had some real tense ones as well.

Yes, the acting is limp and the dialogue is clunkier than a suit of armour falling down a large staircase, but this is where the entertainment comes in. I thought they couldn't top the wheel spinning on the White House lawn car chase, but then they went and had a young girl waving a flag to convince some pilots not to blow up the White House(and in so doing they refused a presidential order!).The plot is like a condensed series of 24, although i daresay Bauer would have tortured a few more innocents in the pursuit of ""the greater good"". It is basically like a crazy fusion of the aforementioned 24 with Die Hard along with a few elements of Olympus has Fallen thrown in for good measure.

The story moved along nicely, the transitions from scene to scene made sense, the acting fit the parts, and most of the action made sense. The two drawback of this movie was the CGI, and armor just sitting outside the fence as the car chase took place on the front lawn. One would think they'd move to break the fence and the concrete barrier and so save the president or at least give him an escape route.

Not like some ""modern"" examples, where everything is concentrated on last 15-20 min. and you can easily skip the first hour by sleeping or something. I liked very much the unusually good mixing with comedy elements. The part where Jamie Foxx is getting his ""kicks"" under the suit. The dialogs between him and Tatum.... Just perfect. Cons: Effects are not as good as it can be. Just too animated. At some moments it looked like video game. With techs nowadays its just doesn't seems OK. Jamie could talk little more ""caucasian"".

I really like Jaime Foxx as an actor and him playing the President is a good role for him in this movie. It's also great that they used an African President because it is relevant to pop culture.

It sounds crazy that no metal detectors have catched the weapons and bombs in White house. There was a time in the movie when plot has lost president and Tatum was combating with the only one of the terrorists.

Mercenaries take over the white house(substitute for any other location, missile silo, banks...) wiping out every special ops team on the planet killing innocent adults except one guy who is (Yawn) in the wrong place at the wrong time including his adorable little girl & you know he's coming for her (Zzzzzzzz sorry, still yawning). Jamie Foxx was far from believable as the President. He would've been better suited as a fumbling good guy, not the one in power. This movie would've worked had it been called Olympia Has Fallen... Again & It's Time For Everyone To Die....Hard!",White House Down
482,carniejim77,Left Wing Propaganda,1,31 March 2014,"I like a good action movie the same as anyone, but this one was really nothing more than a ""progaganda movie"" for obama and his socialist agenda.The casting, a black president, an agenda for ""peace"", old white guys turning on the government, and then all the countries agreeing for the presidents ""peace plan"" at the end of the movie....really? Hollywood is always working for the socialists in most cases, but doesn't matter, this movie will not help him.I just watched Olympus Has Fallen, and although the storyline was weak, it at least was a better movie to watch than this one. It would be nice if Hollywood would stop making propaganda films and stick to real stories. Nothing wrong with movies like this, just leave the politics out of it.",White House Down

484,raeganatchison,Just another day in Washington D.C.,7,3 May 2014,"The largest symbol of American freedom, the White House, is once again under attack, but this time the attack has come from within. The department of defense has no intelligence or known threat target. Who could be doing this? The fate of the free world rests solely on a capital policeman, Jon Cale (Channing Tatum), President Sawyer (Jaime Foxx), and junior hero, Emily Cale (Joey King). Was this film completely plausible? No! But, it is an action movie, if it were believable it would not be any fun. If you are wanting to see a movie that is more realistic and accurate then you want to see Lone Survivor, Black Hawk Down, or Zero Dark-Thirty. White House Down has a predictable script with typical foreshadowing and foreseeable plot twists. What do you expect when you have an action packed script, over the top special effects, A-list actors, and a budget of 150 million dollars? Columbia Pictures' intent was not to make an Oscar winning, ground breaking, and thought provoking film. This movie was made to make money.If you are into typical action films like Die Hard, The Marine, and Air Force One, then White House Down will fit the bill and fulfill all of your expectations; somewhat believable plot, acceptable acting, and a hero that saves the day. Like other action movies I expected horrible dialog, and even worse acting. But, surprisingly the acting was good and the script had a good flow. It was a nice unexpected surprise when they incorporated actual facts and history about the White House in to the script. While it was action based, it was peppered with reasonable and well placed humor.The cinematography for this flick was outstanding. If you have ever been to DC, you know it is a dirty and busy city. There are so many people in such a small metro area that the trash and pollution are out of control. You did not get that from the way the scenes where shot and edited. They used a lot of wide landscape shots that showed the lights and the skyline. They purposefully used the beautiful architecture to distract you from reality. My favorite part of the cinematography is when the security adviser radio the helicopter pilot that the President what to ""do that thing"" before landing at the White House. ""That thing"" was a sequence of aerial shots, buzzing the Washington Monument, skimming the refection pool, and finally banking a hard right just in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Visually it was spectacular. The editing department defiantly earned their paychecks on this movie. They make it look like a gross place like D.C. look like a magical place that you must visit.The actors did a much better job than I expected. I am not a fan of Tatum but over all his performance was good. I thought this was a strange role for Foxx, but after reading about his political views and thoughts about our current president, I am not surprised he jumped at this opportunity. As Mr. Foxx is a large media and financial champion for president Obama. The best actor in the movie was definitely King. This kid is a serious actress with a huge resume. At the age of 14, she has more versatility than all of her co-stars. Her character as rebellious but knowledge thirsty teenager was totally believable. She did what most kids would never thought to do. Keep calm and use her cellphone to take a video of the bad guy and upload it to YouTube, so the Department of Defense could use it to identify who was behind they attack.OK so the big ""no no"" in this movie for me was some major points of believability and its length. At the beginning I was happy with how the story unfolded, but as we got to the climax of the movie all plausibility went out the window. The final sequence of events was overdone and drawn out. It could have been done in about half the time. That was disappointing but it's what you should expect from an action movie.Overall, White House Down was not bad I was interested and entertained. At the end I cheered as the good guys won. It surpassed my expectations for a movie of its genre. I give this picture a 7 out of 10. If you like action movies then this is a must see, but no sequels please.",White House Down

Moreover, they hired great actors to give an extravagant vibe. Some people love watching this movie because who doesn't want to see Channing Tatum become the hero of the day? I'd say, don't throw the same ball into the same hole; audiences may have different view of the game",White House Down
490,villepartanenbujabuja,Funny bad.,3,10 October 2018,"The most bland, generic and lazy action movie I've seen in a while. If you have seen a movie....ever, you know how this pile of shit is going to turn out. After 5 minutes I knew the whole plot and EVERY twist that was coming. This could have easily been a ""dumb action movie"" parody. Every joke was forced and embarrassing like in every Emmerich movie. CGI was straight out of PS2 game. The lack of logic from every character was mind blowing, nothing really makes any sense when you stop and think about it sooo....don't think about it I guess but if you want to laught, leave your brain on. This was just another chapter in Roland Emmerichs disaster porn collection. (The 2 extra stars are from the ""comedy"" factor.)",White House Down

The combat scenes were enjoyable and varied a lot, the plot was well explained, the characters had a good background story and reasonable development and the actors perfectly portrait their roles. The gags were well placed (tho it were quite a few it wasn't overloaded) and I personally had to laugh about them a lot. 10/10 I'd say.",White House Down

Review by Krishan Patidar
Story line: While on a tour of the White House with his young daughter, a capitol policeman in action to save his child and protect the president from a group of heavily armed invaders.
Review: very good visuals, strong acting, humour, action packed, plot twist.
All the cast did a very well job, all the characters are well justified. The fact that the objectives of armed intruders who struck the President's residence is not clarified properly. Are there any political motive? For money? Or for any special demands.
The point of humour never down about the movie whether it is Emily's White House tour or combats of Mr president. Characters are well engaging in whole movie by action, drama, humour, music or conspiracy scene.
The film has won three awards nominated nine times, including MTV movie and TV shows award for 'Best Hero'.
Overall the movie is worthy to be watched and money and time would not be felt wasted in watching this movie.",White House Down
