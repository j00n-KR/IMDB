0,TheLittleSongbird,"This kingdom has enough magic to make one want to visit, if not quite stay",8,13 November 2017,"Having seen Sean Baker's previous films 'Starlet' (2012) and 'Tangerine' (2015) in preparation for seeing 'The Florida Project', there were high expectations seeing as both of those films, while not quite perfect, were very good indeed.The same also goes for 'The Florida Project', after seeing it and not being let down, being more or less what was expected. Not quite one of my very favourite films of 2017 (although actually it very nearly was), but as far as a wildly inconsistent year for film goes to me it's in the better half. It is hard to say which is my favourite or least favourite of 'Starlet', 'Tangerine' and 'The Florida Project', because they are as good as each other and are very good films in their own way. They have the same strengths pretty much and have very little wrong, at the same time it is very easy to see why they haven't connected with everybody.Perfect 'The Florida Project' isn't. Some of the tonal shifts feel a bit forced and abrupt and, although the final act in general is emotionally intense, count me in as another person who was underwhelmed by the ending, which for my liking felt tacked on, tonally jarring and strains credulity too much.On the other hand, 'The Florida Project' has a lot to like. While not as visually unique as 'Tangerine', it's a good-looking film that manages to make a less than attractive setting actually visually appealing somehow. Like with 'Starlet', while it may take some getting used to for some, the sunny and slightly bleached colours and slightly (but deliberately so) off-kilter but very naturalistic filming (that's very evocative and not amateurish like it can be easily mistaken as) was very striking. Appreciated the subtlety of the music, instead of having constant bombast which would have been wrong here.Like 'Starlet' and 'Tangerine', the writing shines once again. Standouts include the ominous tension between the child and adult worlds and the emotional intensity of the final act, that would have resonated even more if having the very ending scene in keeping with the rest of the film. There is a healthy balance of amusing humour, joyous wonder, charming warmth, understated sweetness and touching drama. The story likewise, it really made me feel warm inside, it made me laugh, it surprised me, it charmed me and it moved me.Baker continues to grow as a director, building even more upon the rich texture and intimate detail seen in particularly 'Tangerine' (both there in 'Starlet', but felt deeper with each succeeding film).Acting is uniformly good. Not just from the most well-known name Willem Dafoe giving perhaps his best performance in years, but also from Bria Vinaite giving a performance of searing intensity and especially an astoundingly mature beyond her years Brooklynn Prince who deserves to become a star after this. There is an improvisatory feel at points but this came over very naturally which is pretty incredible really because not everybody is comfortable with improvisation.In summary, a very good film but, despite the positive critical reception, like Baker's previous films it will divide audiences (already has). 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Florida Project
1,SnoopyStyle,Disney ending,8,11 March 2018,"Moonee is a young girl running around her Florida neighborhood with her friends. She lives with her mother Halley in a budget motel near Disney World. Halley does petty scams to pay the weekly rent. Bobby (Willem Dafoe) is the hotel manager who has a paternal respect for the girls. It's a world of passing tourists, and the working poor.This is an indie from exciting new filmmaker Sean Baker. Bria Vinaite and Brooklynn Prince are compelling newcomers. It has a nice cinema verite vibe. I don't know how Dafoe got involved but he's terrific as always. It's an entrancing watch although it does ramble around. There is no obvious plot or destination but it fits the characters. They live aimless lives. There is obvious pending doom awaiting this family. I don't know about the girls running to Disney World. It needs more setup to have a better payoff for that ending. Quite frankly, the pedophile has more setup than Disney World. It's understandable to do that ending but the audience needs preparation.",The Florida Project
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Good all around, even stellar at times",6,17 March 2018,"The 110-minute ""The Florida Project"" (sounds more like a sci-fi action movie from the title) is the newest work by writer and director Sean Baker. I am not sure if I have seen any of his previous films, but his effort here makes me want to. It's the story of a young girl told from the perspective of a young girl and we see how she spends time with her friends at a hotel during the summer holidays, but it is not a trip or something. Actually it is her mother living there and poverty is a big issue in this film. With the exception of the very end, it is almost a plotless movie. It is much more about individual situations and the atmosphere attached to these situations than really about telling a story, which means that most of the movie could have been randomly put together in a different order and it still would have felt chronologically. A lot of the film feels really harmless as we see it through the eyes of Moonee, the girl at the center of it all, even if it may not be harmless at all as we find out near the end when tragic events happen in quick succession. And still, the very last scene and final shot are a bit of a flight away from the problems and back into happiness once more before reality strikes inevitably. I like Willem Dafoe and it's nice to see him nominated for an Oscar again. He was a frontrunner at times, but maybe eventually the real significance is missing as these more serious moments, for example when he takes care of a pedophile, are the ones in which he shines the least, even if they are character-defining too obviously. It's more the heart of his character that makes his performance so special, similar to Bridges in ""Hell or High Water"" recently.And while everybody is talking about child actress Brooklynn Prince, I myself would rather talk about Bria Vinaite, who is not just breathtakingly stunning in here, but also gives a heartbreaking portrayal of a young woman trying to be a good mother while fighting all her inner demons, including drugs, violence and prostitution too. I want to talk about the one scene especially in which her character violently beats up her former best friend after she calls her a prostitute (actually the word which starts with wh...). We don't know if she started with prostitution at that point already, but if she did, then she really hates it and hates herself for doing it and also hates being humiliated because she does it. And if she didn't, then maybe she just thought everybody thinks she is a highly promiscuous anyway (the sl.. word you could say as well if you were allowed to), so who cares if she really does it. I found her portrayal really spot-on and touching and it would have been amazing if she could have scored an Oscar nomination too, or at least more awards recognition in general. I hope her excellent turn here gets her some good roles in the future. Yes, she was that good.With the screenplay not getting in at the Oscars and ""only"" Dafoe making it, the film ended up a bit underwhelming from the awards perspective. But it is still a really good work with scenes that easily could have made it a ****/***** and not just a ***/***** if they were more frequent. It is a success from the dramatic perspective, but also from the comedic as Baker's take on humor is very successful from start to finish: be it the woman from the agency at the end telling the girl to care and not fall down the stairs before she herself falls down eventually or the scene with the topless old woman and Dafoe's comment that it's so hot already and the kids can't take any more hotness. This was a truly funny film at times and a big success in my opinion. And eventually, there is of course at the very center of it all the take on childhood, the innocence that comes with it and maybe also the loss of innocence that the central character may have on her mind for the rest of her life when remembering this particular summer. I also liked the way in which they included her new best friend, initially the daughter of an antagonist, but harmony and friendship arise quickly when people are in similar situations. And yes, after all it's really just kids. The difficult parallel between finding happiness in the face of poverty is omnipresent during this film and it may have been where the movie succeeded the most and with how well this parallel fits in with our current times and economy, there is just one more reason to check this film out. It never drags and that's always a success for a film closer to two hours than to ninety minutes and now you really should have enough reasons to see this little gem. I absolutely give it a thumbs-up and I am positive so will you after watching it. What are you waiting for?",The Florida Project
3,Prismark10,The Florida Project,7,30 August 2020,"A lady once told me in Orlando. Good ole Uncle Walt. He bought a piece of swamp in Florida and turned it into a tourist magnet. He must have done a deal with the devil as well. Disney World is the only bit round here that has never been directly hit by a hurricane.The Florida Project is set on the outskirts of Disney. Motels with long term residents who are way down the socio economic scale. Living in the margins of society when others around the world see it as a dream Disney destination.Moonee, Scooty and Dicky spend the summer very much left on their own devices causing mischief and mayhem with their wild behaviour. Other kids descend to Orlando to visit the theme parks. These kids make their own adventure as going to Magic Kingdom is not an option for them.They are joined by Jancey who has moved into the neighbouring motel with her grandmother.Mooney's mum Halley is an exotic dancer who after losing her job becomes an online sex worker. Halley would do anything to survive, selling knock off perfume in car parks to scalping park tickets. Halley would even literally fight for survival and at the end she is is at risk of losing Moonee to social services.Only Bobby (Willem Dafoe) the manager of the motel is protective of the kids knowing the grown ups are having a hard time to make ends meet.Director Sean Baker has made a low budget independent slice of life film. In the absence of Dafoe's casting you would think this was a drama documentary. Baker has coaxed astonishing performances from his young cast. It actually made me think how he managed to get such naturalistic acting from the kids.The film does not have much of a plot and it is still better than many routine films pumped out by Hollywood. It is about the kids living aimlessly who get into constant trouble. There is a scene where Bobby spots trouble and confronts a dirty old man. However Halley's deteriorating issues begin to take a toll on her and Moonee.There is an element of magical realism with the ending. I had no issue with it and whether it was literal, figurative or metaphorical.",The Florida Project
4,kosmasp,Results are in,9,1 July 2018,"First thing you have to know before watching this: This is not an easy movie. And it also has people in it, that you may not find likeable. You may even think badly about the kids involved at times (the ""pranks"" they do). But the movie itself is not judging. It almost feels like this is based on personal experience. As you can tell by me saying that, I did not read up on how the story came together, which is something I do to not get spoiled about what the movies are about, I'm about to watch and therefor can enjoy freely.Although enjoy may be a stretch use for some in regards to this movie. So while I was hesitant at first and had some issues with what was going on at the beginning, I more than appreciate the ways the movie challenged me. If that is not your thing, it's ok. The acting and the raw nature of the film (edit, cinematography, direction, script) are impecable",The Florida Project
5,lee_eisenberg,I bet that this happens a lot across the US,9,2 April 2018,"I had heard a lot about ""The Florida Project"" before seeing it, so I wanted to see it for myself. Probably the main thing that a person should take from it is that throughout the US there are people struggling, even in the shadow of major attractions (in this case Disneyworld). While the adults try to make ends meet, the children often run around unsupervised, occasionally doing dangerous things.While the tykes are the stars, the important plot points center on the adults. The motel manager (Willem Dafoe in an Academy Award-nominated performance) tries to strike a balance between enforcing the rules and helping the tenants. The main girl's abrasive mom (newcomer Bria Vinaite) clashes with everyone around her and does whatever she has to do to stay economically afloat (even things that get her in trouble with the law).I thought that the most effective scenes were when the characters walked by signs advertising something Disney-related. Here in what's known as the theme park capital of the world, the characters are barely making ends meet. Disneyworld certainly hasn't done anything for these individuals. It merely shows them what they can't have, even as tourists flock to the area and stay in the motel to go to that theme park.I recommend the movie. It's not often that we see a movie focusing on class issues. While watching I got the feeling that what it portrays happens quite a bit across the US. Definitely see it.",The Florida Project
6,jboothmillard,The Florida Project,8,8 July 2018,"When this independent film was released to DVD, film critic Mark Kermode was giving it a lot of praise, I only knew bits and pieces of its premise, so I was looking forward to it, directed by Sean Baker (Tangerine). Basically in the Magic Castle, a budget motel in Kissimmee, Florida near Walt Disney World, six-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Kimberly Prince) lives with her young tattooed single mother Halley (Bria Vinaite). She spends most of her time during the summer unsupervised with her motel friends Scooty (Christopher Rivera) and Dicky (Aiden Malik), playing and causing mischief, scrounging and stealing from tourists, and getting in trouble. The three children are one day caught spitting on a guest's car, Dicky's father (Edward 'Punky' Pagan) restricts him from playing with Moonee and Scotty, his family later relocate to New Orleans, which saddens the others. While the kids are cleaning the car, Moonee meets Jancey (Valeria Cotto), who lives at the Futureland motel next door, she invites her to hang out with them. Bobby (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Willem Dafoe), the manager of Magic Castle, is protective of the children, this includes one incident where an elderly man is acting suspiciously hanging around them, he threatens to call the police if the man returns. Halley is struggling to pay her rent, she tries to sell perfume to many tourists in parking lots, and she asks Scooty's mother, Ashley (Mela Murder), to steal food for them from the diner she works at. But Ashley cuts contact after discovering Moonee, Scooty, and Jancey set fire to an abandoned condominium. To make more money, Halley sets up an online prostitution profile offering her services, closing Moonee in the bathroom when she is with a client. Bobby notices the activity and applies restrictions on unregistered guests in her motel room. When Halley steals a client's Disney resort passes to sell them, the man she stole demands them back; Bobby sees him off but warns Halley that he will evict her if she continues her prostitution. Halley is desperate and approaches Ashley to apologize and ask for money, Ashley mocks her for her prostitution, Halley beats her up in front of Scooty. The next day, Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) arrive to investigate Halley. She cleans up her room and gives away her weed, then takes Moonee to a resort hotel restaurant, charging the meal to a guest's room. When they return to the motel, DCF and the police are waiting to take Moonee into foster care pending investigation. Bobby overhears the commotion, but cannot bring himself to do anything, he just stands outside and smokes. Moonee runs away to find Jancey, they run away together to the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. Also starring Josie Olivo as Grandma Stacy. Vinaite is great as the just about managing single mother, Prince is impossibly cute and brilliant as the mischievous daughter, and Dafoe is terrific as the kindly motel manager, the theme of childhood innocence and the clash between adult and child worlds are very evocative, it is emotionally intense, but there good-spirited and funny bits as well, a fantastic drama. Very good!",The Florida Project
7,Quinoa1984,"""I love you, too!'",9,21 October 2017,"A.K.A. Harmony Korine's SMALL CHANGE(?) Or a slice of Italian neo-realism if nearly everyone was unsympathetic. Or maybe a continuation of what Arnold was doing with American HONEY, a look at those who are white and poor and with nothing better to do than be walking, screaming examples of, frankly, why abortion should remain not simply legal but readily available if needed. Baker never passes judgment for a nano-second on anyone here - he probably realizes his audience may do that for themselves - and it creates a disturbing and yet extremely lively cinematic experience.This wouldn't be the same as a book or a play or an album - this is something that needs an active stedi/hand-held camera that can give us bright primary colors and on people at this ""Magic Kingdom"" motel, in particular this very young mother Halley, played by Bria Vinaite in her screen debut, and her innocent-and-bratty daughter Moonee, who are for the most part non-professional actors brought on to be as natural as they want to be - and Baker knows this intuitively. His skill as a filmmaker is giving us nothing but behavior; there are events that happen and do escalate to a climax (something that, frankly, I imagine a lot of people watching this will think it has to lead up to, or is one distinct possibility for where this may lead to), but because we are simply seeing these human beings up there on the screen doing things and acting in this way or that, getting into, err, ""shenanigans"" at the least and criminal acts at worst (and that's not uncommon), it adds to the impact.A lessor filmmaker might throw on a ""lesson"" of some kind, or make the ending a little more syrupy with the acting and music and less of an uncertain beat. Here, Baker is totally confident with his players, and knows Dafoe can act with all of them like it's anything else; why should playing off of them be any different than the major stars he's been acting off of throughout his career? His character, by the way, is perfect as far as nailing this sometimes affable but also take-no-s*** blue collar guy who lives in this life as a manager, maybe against his better judgment but, hey, it's a job (I've been at jobs where I've seen this exact guy, and he and Baker totally get it).It helps too that he's there simply for the fact that everyone else - the ""adults"" who are often terribly irresponsible, but it's in their nature so, so it goes, and the children who have been raised to precisely *not* be raised to do what they do - because he's... well, not a moral center, exactly, but someone needs to be there to divert the occasional old child molester or to tell the eccentric lady to cover up her boobs when sunning by the pool. It's a massive, towering performance where, let's put it this way, he makes himself as natural and loose and playful and WHAT ARE YOU DOING! as everyone else.A part of me thinks I should see this again sometime soon, to take in all of these episodes that Baker lays out, all of these actions taking place over a hot and sticky and beautiful and dangerous summer in Florida. At the same time it is a sharp rebuke to the American dream, as sharp and poignant and dirty as one can experience in the cinema this year. I think my reasoning for wanting to see it is to think: what does Baker want his audience to take away from this tale of children running wild and parents who are at best trying to get by (one parent *does* work as a waitress) and at worst are doing everything wrong for their kids? I think back to Harmony Korine because of things like Kids or Gummo, where the intention is to throw us into a specific (yet very familiar) part of America, where it's a combination of no education and no responsibility and no respect and yet... they're human beings, so how does one go for empathy for them? It's not about connecting with them, or... is it? I know I found The Florida Project thrilling, experimental, daring in how it doesn't LIE about these people, which may be all we can ask for, and it's directed and performed with total confidence. It's a beautifully made slice of rancid life.(PS: I'm still not sure I'm totally sold on the very end, where two characters (spoiler?) finally do visit the Magic Kingdom in the corporate/dream-like sense in Orlando, Florida - I do get the point of it, I get it, but it didn't satisfy me after all of the hardcore realism of what came before, not to mention how it shifts jarringly in the technical sense from crisp 35mm to iPhones) 8.5/10",The Florida Project
8,writers_reign,Taking The Mickey,8,26 November 2017,For once I seem to have watched the same film as the majority of those who have expressed an opinion here. I knew nothing about the film or indeed anyone associated with it either behind or in front of the camera with the exception of William Dafoe but when it opened in London I checked IMDb to attempt to ascertain whatever I could about it. What I read was mostly positive but I was disappointed when neither the National Daily paper I take nor the London Evening Standard deigned to mention it but chose to devote space to inferior - albeit 'commercial' titles. I found a strong documentary 'feel' though it was clearly scripted and acted brilliantly by largely non professionals. It belongs squarely in the 'indie' camp and very near the top. Well worth a second viewing but though more than worthy of Oscars it will probably have a tough time getting ignored.,The Florida Project
9,george.schmidt,Hilarious and heartwarming dramedy indie with career best for Dafoe and amazing debuts by rookies Vinaite and Oscar-worthy Prince,10,26 November 2017,"THE Florida PROJECT (2017) **** Willem Dafoe, Brooklynn Prince, Valeria Cotto, Bria Vinaite, Christopher Rivera, Caleb Landry Jones, Josie Olivo. Wonderful indie dramedy about a Florida motel manager (Dafoe in one of his best and surprisingly low-key, poignant turns) who attempts the daily rigors of his demanding job include keeping an eye on single mother Vinaite (a newcomer worth watching) whose downward spiral lifestyle brings some serious concerns for her free-spirited and hilarious precious daughter Moonee (an amazing natural debut the likes unseen since the heyday of Jodie Foster and Tatum O'Neal and if there was any justice an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress; That Scary Good) causes daily jeopardy for the trio. Filmmaker Sean Baker (who collaborated on the well conceived script by Chris Bergoch) has the air of improvised documentary about his storyline eliciting some truly remarkable acting and a heartbreaking soul running thru it. One of the year's best films.",The Florida Project
10,evanston_dad,A Sad Story about Those Who Live on the Fringe,9,6 June 2018,"In 2015, director Sean Baker stunned me with ""Tangerine,"" a hidden gem of a film that vaulted to the top of my favorite movies list for that year. I didn't warm to ""The Florida Project"" quite as much as I did to ""Tangerine,"" but that's because it's not as warm a film, and I don't mean that as a criticism. ""Tangerine"" took characters living at the fringes of society who most mainstream Americans would label as freaks and then made us fall in love with them as people over the course of the movie. In ""The Florida Project,"" he again gives us people living on the fringes, but these people don't trigger our empathy in the same way. The main character especially is a despicable person, really, and it's very difficult to care about her or her plight.Which makes ""The Florida Project"" a fascinating film, because it challenges some of us who would label ourselves as liberal, compassionate people to see just how far our tolerance extends. My sister adopted three children through the DCFS program, so I know something about the workings of that institution. It frequently causes as many problems as it attempts to solve, and it can play around pretty casually with children's lives. Many times kids are taken away from situations that they shouldn't be. But in this film, it's pretty objectively clear that removing the child from her mother is the right thing to do, as this particular mom is a disaster of a human being. She's what most people think of when the term ""welfare mom"" is thrown around, someone who uses their poverty as an excuse to sponge off any and everyone and take absolutely no responsibility for themselves or actions. The actress who plays this character, Bria Vinaite, gives a minor miracle of a performance, not the least because she has the courage to play such a relentlessly unlikable character without succumbing to the temptation to give us any nuggets with which we can sympathize. Willem Dafoe received an Oscar nomination for playing the manager of the sleazy hotel in which these derelict, transient people live, ironically on the front door step of Disneyland but as far from the dreams that amusement park manufactures as the other side of the moon. He's pretty good as a man who has failed to some degree, at least in his own eyes, as a husband and father and so becomes a sort of father figure for the lost and needy, whether they want one or not. And then there are the kids....oh, the poor kids, who are the true victims (aren't they always?) Mostly oblivious to the sad circumstances they live in, they find fun and adventure where they can, making their own amusement park out of the parking lots and convenience stores that define their boundaries. Until their parents' actions catch up to them and the kids' lives are the ones most affected. The film contains a sad message about how someone will eventually be held accountable for those who take no accountability for themselves, and those someones are many times the ones who least deserve it.This film really got into my head and stayed there for a long time. I immediately put ""Starlet,"" Baker's first film, on my Netflix queue because I want to see more by this impressive filmmaker.Grade: A",The Florida Project
11,AlsExGal,Indie slice-of-life drama,6,16 June 2020,"Set in Orlando, Florida, the story follows single mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) and her young daughter Moonee (Brooklynn KImberly Prince) as they struggle to survive. They live week-to-week in a tacky tourist hotel gone to seed managed by the compassionate Bobby (Willem Dafoe), who tries to help the various misfits and rejects that occupy the place. Things are looking bad for Halley, though, as she's lost her stripper job and her options are looking more and more limited, while the often-unsupervised Moonee gets into all sorts of trouble.I'm sure director Baker wants the audience to sympathize with these people living on the wretched edge only feet away from the tourist capital of the US, to think about the dichotomy of the overly-colorful, often grotesque architecture like something out of a child's dream serving as a backdrop for the struggles of the poor, and especially how it effects their kids. But often the film comes across as an illustration of how modern Western society has collapsed, and the only ones to truly blame are ourselves.The misbehaving Moonee is not much of a surprise when her mother is such a car-wreck. Halley is her own worst enemy. Willem Dafoe has won many supporting actor awards already for this movie, and at first he seemed like a shoo-in for a long-deserved Oscar. However I can't really see why Dafoe was nominated. He's not bad at all, but there's nothing to his role that seems worthy of the acclaim.",The Florida Project
12,ferguson-6,More Baker brilliance,8,18 October 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" has long been a Disney catchphrase. The irony for those living on the road to Disney World is the focus of the latest from ground-breaking filmmaker Sean Baker. Mr. Baker was the creative force behind the remarkable TANGERINE (shot entirely with iphones) a couple of years ago, and his most recent film solidifies his brilliance at bringing us the fringes of society – those we don't typically see on screen. Beyond that, these are the folks many of us pay little attention to in real life.The Magic Castle Motel is a lavender monstrosity that belies the daily struggles of those who live behind its purple doors. It's actually a seedy extended-stay that caters to ultra-budget guests. Included among those are 6 year old Moonee (Brooklyn Kimberly Prince) and her friend Scooty (Christopher Rivera). As we watch them spit on a car below their perch on the motel balcony, we quickly judge these as kids with a bit too much free time and a shortage of parental guidance. As the summer days roll on, we tag along as Moonee leads Scooty and their new friend Jancey (Valeria Cotto) in some boundary-pushing adventures. Their fun ranges from typical kid mischief to accidents with more serious ramifications. The brilliance here is that through the child's eye, we see joy and excitement and fun. We hear the purity of giggles and giddy screeches as the kids bound between tourist traps, ice cream parlors, and rooms forbidden as off-limits. All of this miscreant activity occurs amidst the adults who trudge on simply trying to survive another day. While we might be tempted to recall Cat Stevens' lyrics, ""while the sinners sin, the children play"", it's director Baker that refuses to pass judgment. Moonee's mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) was recently fired from her ""dancing"" job, and is now constantly on the prowl to make enough money to cover the weekly motel bill. She clearly loves her daughter, but is too proud and angry, and just has no idea of how to pull out of this vicious cycle of poverty. The artificial dreams that are prevalent in so many films have no place at the Magic Castle Motel. It's about the next meal and keeping a roof above. Don't go searching for plot here. Instead, at times it feels like a documentary on Moonee or the spirited need for fun and laughter that is in the DNA of kids. We are just following a real kid around, and that's a tribute to the marvel that is Brooklyn Kimberly Prince. She steals every scene and most of the movie  and that's in spite of the terrific performances from Ms. Vinaite and screen vet Willem Dafoe. It's a rare ""normal"" role for Mr. Dafoe, and he makes the most of it as Bobby, the motel's manager. He is also a father figure, mediator of disputes, bill collector, and protector of damaged souls. With no hint of saccharine or Hollywood mush, Bobby is unable to detach emotionally from those who live at the hotel, not because he is soft, but rather because he is human. We see his demeanor change drastically when the owner of the hotel arrives for inspection. Bobby understands the fragility of his own situation due to what he witnesses each day.Director Baker is a master of color use and the blending of abrupt framed images with the handhelds in close proximity within motel rooms and personal interactions. His story (co-written with his TANGERINE and STARLET collaborator Chris Bergoch) never feels condescending, preachy or romanticized. There is no blatant political statement being made. These are folks living their lives as best they are able within the confines of their situation. The police and Child Protective Services are always hovering as a reminder that the next mistake could significantly alter lives. Somehow, the film is both hilarious and heart-breaking. The obvious comparison is to last year's MOONLIGHT, and it could even be viewed as a prequel to American HONEY. Mostly it's a slice of rarely seen life and further proof that Sean Baker is already an important filmmaker, and one that likely has more to say. As for the debate around the final scene, does it really matter? There is no better place for a child to escape reality  even if it might only be in their mind. Sometimes that's the only escape we get.",The Florida Project

Located near Disney World, the local motels have become a haven for the homeless and working poor who can't afford to pay rent. Halley has a drug problem and raising her daughter, Moonnee at the Magic Castle Motel. Willem Defoe played the motel manager, Bobby, who does more than manage the hotel. He is basically the father figure in Halley's life. He cares about his residents. The children in the film play around the motel in the summertime. The story has plenty of reality especially child services, lack of money and substance abuse. There is violence.

14,deloudelouvain,That kid can act as the best,8,6 March 2018,"It's been awhile since I did enjoy a movie as much in this genre. Although there is a lot of social drama and poverty the movie managed to make me smiling several times. And although Willem Dafoe is the big name of this movie it's the young Brooklynn Kimberly Prince that steals the show. At one point I was wondering if they just asked that kid to act like she is normally instead of performing her script. It all looked so natural. I can only see a great future for that kid in the movie industry. I'm not a big kid lover myself, quite the opposite, and several times I was imagining how it would be to live in a hell like that, but credits to the director, script writer and actors, they made this movie a gem. I really doubt anybody would not like watching The Florida Project.",The Florida Project
15,namashi_1,MAMI Film Fest Review: The Florida Project.,9,19 October 2017,"Childhood is the most important & innocent chapter in each of our lives. Its where we begin to understand what the world is all about. Its where we learn to speak & when to speak what & hope to get into a school where education makes us realize how the world functions. Now imagine, a Childhood in a purple painted, unclean Motel in Florida, which, incidentally enough, is close to Disney World, a dream of every child out there (mine too as a kid, and I did go there). But the trip to Disney World isn't possible for all & 'The Florida Project' is about such kids, who despite knowing there is magic awaiting for them, have no option but to create a world of magic without any fireworks. Writer-Director Sean Baker delivers one of the FINEST films ever on childhood & shows us a side of a America, not many us usually stumble on in cinema. And guess what, this realistic & affecting film, is among this year's very best films!'The Florida Project' Synopsis: Set over one summer, the film follows precocious 6-year-old Moonee (An Astonishing Brooklynn Kimberly Prince) as she courts mischief and adventure with her ragtag playmates and bonds with her rebellious but caring mother (A Fantastic Bria Vinaite), all while living in the shadows of Disney World.'The Florida Project' is about creating the magic in the world you've born too. Moonee, the protagonist, is foul-mouthed, brash & adventurous. She may not have a school to go to or a family to support her needs, but that doesn't stop her from being fun. She finds her joy in spending time with her mother or creating a ruckus with her ragtag playmates (who also live the same life as hers) or bullying the Motel's Manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe, In A Career-Best Performance). She also binges in ice cream & sometimes, a pizza (minus pepperoni, despite that being the topping she craves for, but its expensive). Moonee makes the most of what she has & reminds us how childhood is what we make out of them. With or Without money, with or without education or, with or without, of course, Disney World.Baker & Chris Bergoch's Screenplay touches upon the bleakness & the monotony on the lives of the poor in America, with gut-wrenching honesty & believe it or not, laugh-out-loud humor. YES, you read that right! Despite the nothingness in the surroundings, 'The Florida Project' uses humor, for the most part, to tell its story. We watch the children go through the same old routine of life, but its shown with innocent humor & a sense of immovable circumstances. Baker & Bergoch's Screenplay is simply excellent. This is an important, affecting & heartfelt film, that really makes you think about kids out there & how one should help the underprivileged. And its done with a hammering impact! Baker's Direction is outstanding. His work is among the year's most compelling efforts. I seriously hope the Academy is brave enough to honor Baker & Co., for their exceptionally fine work here. Alexis Zabe's Cinematography captures the claustrophobic setting with great results. Baker's Editing, also, is perfect. Art & Costume Design are fabulously done & add to the authenticity. Performance-Wise: Willem Dafoe steals the show. Dafoe, an actor par excellence, delivers a career-best turn as Bobby, the Motel's Manager/Father to all his residents. His empathizing connection with Moonee, is the film's emotional core. Subtle & Masterfully Restrained, Dafoe redefines the power of Acting with his stellar work here. He's Oscar-Worthy from start to end. Academy, do him proud! Brooklynn Kimberly Prince is astonishing. She brings Moonee to life with right mix of innocence & brashness. Bria Vinaite, as the mother, does a fantastic job. Her portrayal is natural to the core! Valeria Cotto, Christopher Rivera & the rest lend remarkable support.On the whole, 'The Florida Project' digs deep & takes a piece out of you. This is a brave film, that unfolds in sheer power.

It's one that's filled with drama, despair, downside, and prayers for hope!",9,5 December 2017,"""The Florida Project"" is one film that touches your emotions as after watching you feel some pain as you see a segment of society that has pain and prayers for hope are needed to help with their dreams of life.

17,Hellmant,Like seeing the world through a very poor 6-year-old girl's eyes!,9,29 November 2017,"'THE Florida PROJECT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An indie drama directed by Sean Baker, and written by Baker and Chris Bergoch (the same duo that also brought us the 2015 critical darling 'TANGERINE'). It tells the story of a 6-year-old girl and her friends, that live in a motel community of extended-stay guests (in Kissimme, Florida), one summer, with very little adult supervision from their parents. The movie stars Brooklynn Prince, Willem Dafoe, Bria Vinaite, Valeria Cotto, Christopher Rivera and Caleb Landry Jones. It was shot on 35mm film, with just a $2 million budget (although Baker admits one crucial scene was filmed illegally on an iPhone). It's received a limited theatrical release in indie theaters, nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics (much like 'TANGERINE' did), and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well. I found it to be a very moving film.The story is set during the summer, in Kissimmee, Florida, at a cheap motel with a small community of extended-stay guests. One of those regular guests is a 6-year-old girl named Moonee (Kimberly), who lives at the hotel with her single mother Halley (Prince). Moonee receives very little parental supervision from Halley, and runs around the hotel doing pretty much whatever she wants with her friends, almost completely unsupervised. With the exception of the caring hotel manager, Bobby (Dafoe), who helps Halley look after Moonee, and the other children, from time to time. The movie tells Moonee's story, that summer.The film is intentionally very slow-paced, and seemingly aimless in it's storytelling. Over the course of the whole movie we learn so much about what it's like to be a girl like Moonee though, in that kind of living situation. The film is like seeing the world through a very poor 6-year-old girl's eyes. It's seemingly very natural and realistic, at pretty much all times too. It's almost like watching a documentary, and I wonder how much of the film was improvised for that reason too. Dafoe is great (like always) as the central male character, and Kimberly is very impressive in the lead too. I definitely recommend it.",The Florida Project
18,cherold,What children are really like,7,8 May 2018,"In film, children are cute, or, in horror movies, dark and disturbing. In The Florida Project they are both.With a documentary feel, this movie follows a band of feral children living in a run-down hotel near Disney World. The children are, like most children, casually savage yet still innocent; they do awful things because, well, they have to do *something*.The pack leader is Moonee, who lives with a heavily-tattooed mother disinclined to discipline Moonee for any infraction from spitting on peers to setting fires, and in fact seems to find it all charming. The mother, Halley, excellently played by first-time-actress Brian Vinaite, is a low level hustler, but she is also a loving mother. My girlfriend (who hated the movie) found Halley entirely unsympathetic, but I liked the fact that she never seemed to consider her child a burden or a bother, instead playing with her, taking her along for her grifts, and feeding her crazy amounts of food.The hotel is managed by Willem Dafoe, who gives a wonderfully real and nuanced performance as a nice guy dealing with a not nice world. He is not the movie's center, and so the script tells you his story in asides, most notably in the ice-machine-moving scene, which offers a lot of information yet doesn't spell anything out.The ending is peculiar, and I didn't know what to make of it, but the wikipedia entry on the film includes the director's explanation, and I accept it intellectually even if I might have preferred either that he spell it out or that he simply go with something as realistic as everything but that last five minutes.I read an interesting negative review of this film that said it failed to explore the inner life of its characters, and that's for the most part true. But exploring the inner life of a young child strike me as about as sensible as exploring the life of a spaniel; at that age children are more chaos and instinct than anything else, and I feel movies that portray their inner life are often nothing but projection. Children have big obvious emotions and react in extreme ways, so nuance becomes the enemy of truth.I don't normally like plotless slice-of-life films, so it's worth explaining why my reaction to this one is different. Part of it is that I instantly recognized the truth of those feral children (I wasn't a feral child, but I considered many of my peers terrifying savages, although they were middle class rather than poor), so it fed into my appreciation for a truth I rarely see. And part of it might have been I was sleep deprived; I don't know if the film's leisurely pace would have bothered me otherwise.",The Florida Project
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A charming and realistic low-fi drama that makes a few missteps but is ultimately a tonally rich and strangely calming experience.,7,12 November 2017,"Sean Baker's realistic, low-fi slice-of-life drama is a beautifully shot and strangely calming experience - especially considering all the boisterous kids, heated debates and generally loud central characters. Its apparent lack of plot isn't so much an issue as it is essential both in capturing the specific time and place of its mother/daughter dynamic and in putting us wholly within the perspective of the central character, allowing us to perceive the events of the film as only a child could. As such, much of the story is delivered almost second hand. Astute viewers will pick up on important cues throughout the exposition-less piece that place each person within the world and connect them to each other in wonderfully honest ways. This texture combines with the background narrative to make a really tonally rich film that has an almost palpable ambiance and evokes an odd nostalgia even for those who find the depicted situation pretty much totally alien. The flick does suffer from a few missteps, though. The the most notable is its off-note and seemingly tone-deaf ending which breaks every rule laid out before it, slipping too far from reality (intentionally so) to be taken seriously. While it can be read a couple of ways, with a rather obvious metaphor perhaps being the most appropriate, it is a rather sour note on which to end this charming yet honest piece as it seems as though the filmmakers perhaps think we aren't quite mature enough for the true ending. 7/10.",The Florida Project
20,ThomasDrufke,Keep Dreaming,7,4 March 2018,"With an almost entire cast without any experience acting in a major hollywood film, The Florida Project is one of the most unique films of this Oscar season. Director Sean Baker made a clear choice in attempting to display a different side of life and not really pulling any punches. Although it takes place only a few miles outside of Disney World, there's no genie with 3 wishes or magical princess to come in and save the day. It's simply just a gritty and a relentless downer - with a hint of hope.Because of Baker's choices to make this film feel as real as possible, there isn't really a ton of plot points or a strong through-line that presents itself, which is fine, but the film has to have a conflict at some point. I guess it's similar to Boyhood in that it's just snapshots of people's lives at moments in time, perhaps there's never an intention of making anything more than just a viewpoint we've never seen before. In that regard, The Florida Project certainly does its job. I think I could have used at least one particular arc to be more traditionally told, but I can't necessarily argue with the result I got. With an original film, I'm not sure you really can.What I found fascinating is Baker's explanation of his take on the ending and story overall. His implementation and subtle use of Disney as a background and a sort of ""Heavenly place"" for these kids was creative and certainly emotionally impactful. The interpretation of young Moonee making her own Disney World inside of this few square mile radius with a very low quality amount of hotels, is an inspiring idea. An idea that can only further inspire dreaming, and I think that's the message here. Make the best with what you have and dream for bigger and better things.7.5/10",The Florida Project
21,gbill-74877,The vicious cycle,8,7 April 2020,"This film immerses us into the world of lower-class people in Florida who ironically are staying in a cheap hotel next to of Disneyworld, where a set of four magic band bracelet tickets goes for $1600. There are excellent performances all around, especially from Brooklynn Prince, who plays a tough, mouthy, and yet sweet little girl with an arresting honesty. The character is just six but in many ways seems older, growing up too quickly while left mostly on her own to roam around with her friends.It doesn't take long to feel sorry for the children in this situation, with no structure or guidance, and horrible role models. In ten years we can easily imagine the little girl grown up to be a similar mother, and ten years ago we can imagine how the mother must have grown up. Without even a hint of this message from director Sean Baker, who shows masterful restraint, we see how hard it is for someone to rise out of the lower class or a difficult upbringing - not impossible, but not easy. The film may be an ink blot test though, because I can also imagine the response of them getting what they deserve, since the mom doesn't get a job as others around her do, runs scams, and resorts to prostituting herself, and I have to say, feeling empathy for her is a real test. Just watching how poorly she behaves is one of the turn-offs to the film, even if it's honest.The little girl is easy to feel sorry for because she's still just six; this is what happens with awful parents. But the mother was also likely brought up in a difficult environment, so the film begs the question of what to do about vicious cycles like this while wisely not attempting to answer it. Instead it just gives us reality, as cringe-inducing as it may be at times.I loved how it was edited, with cuts tending to shorten scenes. I think that was a wise move, since a lot of the film is simply showing us a series of vignettes without the machinations of a big plot, and this kept it from lagging. I also loved the character Willem Dafoe played - what a tough job he has, and yet he's a model of empathy and kindness, an absolute angel under the façade of a grizzled hotel manager, never judging anyone. He plays the part perfectly too, without embellishing it with sweetness or anything that doesn't feel completely authentic. How it resolves is great too, because you can see both the tragedy and the need for it, after everything we've seen.",The Florida Project

But why? What kinds of clichés are really going to make this meaningful? I think people like this movie because it shows them things they want to see-a kind of armchair voyeurism-but I don't think that's enough at all. Even if you identify with the problem or have empathy for it.I know that the movie has gotten a lot of high praise, and that could be a welcome sign that there is a craving for movies that have substance, and that are not only about effects and pizazz.

25,zkonedog,Lack Of Message Dooms This Odd Film,2,17 February 2018,"I'm open to new things in cinema. Especially over the past few years, I've really tried to embrace new filmmaking techniques and visions in understanding that everyone has their own unique stories to tell. That being said, because cinema is (at the end of the day) an entertainment medium, I also strongly believe that a film must have a message. That message doesn't have to be overtly political or overtly any one thing, but for me there does need to be some over-arching concepts that justify why this can be an entertaining experience. That is exactly where ""The Florida Project"" severely let me down.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Moonee (Brooklynn Prince), a child living in a dilapidated motel on the outskirts of Disney World in Florida. Moonee basically runs around with a couple of other friends her age having adventures and stirring up much mischief along the way while her mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) is jobless and must ""hustle"" (in multiple formats) to keep a roof over their heads. The owner of the motel, Bobby (Willem Dafoe), also struggles between being a ""good cop"" or a ""bad cop"" to the activities he sees at his motel on a daily basis.""Florida Project"" is obviously supposed to be about as gritty, bleak, and true-to-life film as has ever been made. In my mind, it actually succeeds at that far too well, in a sense. If the overall goal of the picture is to showcase what poverty looks like (and I think it is), why not just film reality? It's not like this film really adds any storytelling structure of its own, instead meandering from place to place following Moonee. From the very beginning, I didn't know what I was supposed to be watching (or watching for, if you will), and I was no closer to that realization once the credits rolled.Another major issue I struggled with in the movie is how there does not seem to be anything redeemable about any of these characters (aside from very slight glimpses). Sure, Halley seems to love her daughter...but also uses her to scam people and evoke sympathy. There is never any mention of Halley trying to find a job or otherwise help their extreme poverty. A similar line of thought can be applied to Dafoe's character. Yes, he ""helps"" Halley bend/break the rules a bit so she can continue to stay at the motel...but isn't he really just enabling her? The bottom line, for me, is that when Child Protective Services came to take Moonee from Halley in the end, I was actually glad to see it, not sad like the film wanted me to be. Obviously, then, the rather dramatic ending sequence did nothing for me.All of that being said, I also realize that I seem to be the outlier here, as the film is getting generally very positive reviews and ratings. As I said in my opener, I think that is because I need to see more of a message in a film to really get behind it. Besides showing extreme poverty (which I argue could be done in any major city in the U.S. just by setting up a camera), I either did not understand or did not fall in line with what director Sean Baker wanted to project onto the viewing experience.",The Florida Project
26,eddie_baggins,A unique look at life in the shadow of the American dream,7,28 January 2018,"There's a lot to like about Sean Baker's newest critically lauded slice of the anti-American dream (Willem Dafoe, the discovery of Brooklyn Prince, the haunting vistas of seedy motel life), but this documentary-like experience that exists without a true narrative drive has a very big weight holding it back in the form of one of the most unlikable and detestable creations of 2017 - lazy, unlikable and terrible mother Halley.Played by social media personality Bria Vinaite, Halley is the type of mother you wish you could slap and say ""wake up to yourself"" to, and while Vinaite therefore does a great job of portraying a mother unfit to raise a child or even look after herself (just as Baker obviously wanted it to be), her ever-present appearance in The Florida Project makes Baker's largely aimless feature an often hard to endure experience.You understand that Halley is supposed to be this down on her luck trailer trash-like mother, but with zero backstory on how Halley became the vile and irredeemably depressing persona we get to be with and with her character quite blatantly not thinking about bettering her lifestyle or that of her daughter's, Halley is not someone deserving of our attention.Baker's clearly aiming for realism here and to shine a light on America's rampant unemployed and underprivileged, but after an hour or so of Halley's frequently unlikable and feral behavior, the shine of The Florida Project's many noteworthy elements begin to be washed away by having to endure Halley's fiercely grotesque comings and goings.When Baker focuses his dreamlike (or equally nightmarish) attention to Prince's energetic young girl Moonee and her unsupervised adventures around her motel, set in the shadows of Disney World, or on Willem Dafoe's kindly motel manager Bobby, The Florida Project shines as a humanly real character driven slice of realism, that captures a raw and powerful portrait of America that many other filmmaker's could only hope to attain.Had Baker allowed more screen-time to the savvy debut of Prince or the pitch perfect execution of Dafoe, The Florida Project would've become the film many have unjustly labelled it to be, even if it's still one of 2017's most unique low-budget and independent offerings.Final Say -Much of The Florida Project is great but the despicable creation that is Halley holds this visually captivating and hauntingly real feature back from greatness, but with Dafoe and Prince working wonders in their roles, Baker's film is still worth checking into.3 1/2 soda hunting strangers out of 5",The Florida Project

28,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Remarkably sensitive, sometimes magical depiction of difficult lives in the shadow of Disney",9,26 February 2018,"We normally associate Orlando, Florida with the vibrant commercialism and magic of Walt Disney World and the Universal Studios theme parks, but in the shadow of Cinderella's castle lie motels like the Magic Castle, where indie filmmaker Sean Baker invites us to journey in ""The Florida Project.""This dive into the unglamorous, lower-class side of a place home to big dreams and fantasies echoes the spirit of Baker's previous feature, ""Tangerine,"" also co-written with Chris Bergoch, which followed black transgender hookers in Hollywood. Both films go light on plot with Baker opting for a verite style to convey authenticity. In ""The Flordia Project"" in particular, the empathy factor multiplies given the focus on 6-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince), who has created her own magic amidst her life's harsh realities.Baker's style necessitates actors with strong improvisational skills, and somehow he nurtures those abilities in Prince and her fellow child actors, Christopher Rivera (as Scooty), Aiden Malike (as Dicky) and Valier Cotto (as Jancey). This motel band of little rascals give the most honest portrayal of children I can recall on screen. Normally, kids in movies show uncharacteristic maturity or are unusually precocious. Moonee has a smart mouth, but her motives feel genuine to her being a child, not in service of the script.In addition to following Moonee and her friends, the film gives a window into her life with her young mom, Halley (Bria Venaite), a complicated relationship that provides a lot of the film's moral ambiguity. Halley willfully engages in immoral and illegal behaviors in order to pay her weekly ""rent"" to the motel, does not supervise Moonee most of the day and fights ferociously against authority to protect her status quo and give her and Moonee the life she feels they deserve. Her behavior gives the impression that at some point Baker will drop the moral hammer, but it doesn't quite happen the way we think. Baker and Bergoch show almost a disdain for melodrama in the way their story unfolds.Also critical to their story is motel manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe). Initially he occupies the role of lovable side character - the grumpy middle-aged man keeping the order, who won't stand for the kids' hijinks or Halley's violation of motel policy. But as the lens tightens on the reality of the motel's circumstances, we see Bobby for so much more than that. Dafoe articulates all this nuance while staying committed to playing a quirky, character role. Few characters are easier to love.The world of this seedy knock-off Disney strip of Orlando has a deeply immersive quality, one that Baker carefully constructs through consistency in camera angles and shot techniques. He coaxes the magic hiding in these little crevices to come out on screen and complement the harsh contextual realities of the characters and their situations. This balance allows us to consider how these characters and people whose lives resemble them actually feel day to day, rather than to just fixate on everything that's wrong and bad about it. We know that no one should have to grow up like Moonee, but we can also relate to having created our own happiness and comfort within tough circumstances and consider how it feels lose that.""The Florida Project"" could have been written and told with more dramatic peaks and valleys and a concrete sense of movement and structure. This version would have also been a remarkable film drawing tons of awards attention. Yet there's a beauty in the way Baker works so diligently to give audiences the sense that he was hands off in this process, that the story and characters have a life of their own and he was just there to show it to us. He does not ask us to think one way or another about any of it, rather to make sure we know that stories like this are in fact real and right under our nose.~Steven CThanks for reading!

29,paul-allaer,"One of the year's best movies, period",9,11 November 2017,"""The Florida Project"" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of 6 yr. old Moonee and her young mother Hallee (in her early 20s or so), living in a trashy motel and barely getting by financially. As the movie opens, Moonee and a couple of her friends, all on summer break, are mulling about the large motel complex ""Magic Kingdom Inn"", not far from the real Magic Kingdom. It's not long before the young kids case (minor) trouble, bringing out Bobby, the motel's manager. Meanwhile Hallee needs to come up with money to pay the weekly rent. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Sean Baker, who previously gave us the equally excellent ""Tangerine"" a couple of years ago. Here he takes a look at a neglected underbelly of American society: the barely scraping by folks who literally live week-to-week, or even day-to-day, to the (almost) complete ignorance of their young children, who in turn live their daily lives as any young children would, rich or poor. The movie is blessed with a thorough humanitarian touch from Baker. William Dafoe (as Bobby the manager) is the sole ""big name"" attached to this movie, and he is wonderful. But the true star of this movie is young Brooklynn Prince, who is nothing short of sensational. Bottom line: this movie brings a real slice of life as seldom seen. No, there aren't any ""action scenes"", but instead we get to know ""real"" characters, living their life as best as they can.

30,Turfseer,"Newcomer Vinaite is a smash as neglectful mother in this over long, uneven take on denizens of a Florida welfare motel",5,28 November 2017,"Sean Baker is back as director and co-screenwriter of another one of his unflinching portraits of characters living on the fringe. He covered a lonely porn star in Starlet, two trans people in Tangerine and now a 22 year old denizen of a welfare motel in Kissimmee, Florida, located a hop, skip and a jump from Disney World. Baker's protagonist is Halley played by first-time actor Bria Vinaite who Baker discovered while flipping through her Instagram page. Vinaite is a natural, wholly convincing as a 22 year old tattooed hustler who also happens to have a 6 year old child, Moonee (played by the adorable Brooklynn Prince).Baker's focus is on the rarefied world of the motel and Halley's relationships with the other occupants who are her neighbors and others who live in neighboring motels. The story is told more like a rambling docudrama then a narrative that features a suspenseful plot. Willem Dafoe plays Bobby, the motel manager, perhaps the only anchored presence in an atmosphere of confirmed seediness. It's Bobby who is constantly reminding Halley to pay the rent on time, but the irresponsible mother seems always to be short of cash.A good part of Baker's tale is taken up following the misadventures of Moonee and the other unsupervised children who are left to their own devices while their parents are nowhere to be found. As I mentioned above, Moonee is adorable as a kid who is always testing her mother to see what she can get away with. The kids are sometimes up to innocent fun by hustling tourists for change so they can buy ice cream but their activities often lead them into the realm of juvenile delinquency (this includes arson--the setting of a fire in an abandoned building not too far away from the motel).Despite the cuteness of the kids, Baker spends too much time focused on their machinations and this distracts from his main story-Halley's lack of insight and decline into criminality. Initially, Halley appears to be guilty of misdemeanors, buying perfume wholesale and selling marked up bottles to tourists in the adjacent mall parking lots. With Moonee in tow, Halley manages to scrape up enough cash from sales of the perfume to satisfy Bobby's entreaties to pay the rent on time.But after she's chased off by a security guard in one of the parking lots, Halley resorts to prostitution to procure enough cash to stay afloat. There's a good scene where she has a falling out with her one-time friend, Ashley (the mother of one of Moonee's friend--also played quite convincingly by another newcomer, Mela Murder) who calls her out over consorting with her tricks (while Moonee can hear everything, separated only by a flimsy curtain inside their room). Halley and Ashley end up getting into a frenzied cat fight, with Halley besting Ashley, resulting in a nice shiner for the ex-friend.Baker does well in chronicling Halley's lack of insight and eventual fall from grace when the child welfare authorities come calling, following accusations of neglect concerning Moonee. The denouement is pretty predictable and one must conclude that Baker still needs to improve on how to build suspense. Ultimately The Florida Project is an exercise in episodic screen writing which might have been more effective minus some of the more drawn-out scenes (maybe 30 minutes of less footage would have done the trick!). The Florida Project is by no means standard fare as Baker is a director of considerable talent.

The one positive note is the brooding motel manager, the great William Defoe. Halley is a chain smoking, vulgar mouthed mother of a little girl named Moonee. She sells cookies to tourists visiting the kingdom of Mickey Mouse. Her daughter gets into some trouble with a couple of adventurous playmates. The screaming is non-stop, and as someone without children, I was worn out by all the noise. I am mystified by all the Oscar buzz for best picture. The movie looks like a documentary about the underclass of America. Unfortunately, the characters deserve little sympathy from the suffering audience. The only heartbreaking aspect is the innocent little children. We cannot choose our parents, and some kids just are born to mothers who should have had the sense to remain childless. You may cry for Moonee in the finale; but at the same time you will curse out Halley.",The Florida Project

Tiny Brooklynn Prince, as 6-year-old Moonee behaves with the naivete and innocence of a little kid and the brassy precociousness of someone forced to grow up way too quickly. Willem Dafoe, essentially the only known entity in the film, portrays the sad-sack motel manager with his distinct earthy aplomb. It's often a cringe-inducing movie, though, because the part of Moonee's mom is so one dimensional.",The Florida Project

THE FLOR!DA PROJECT is a commendable effort to expose the so-called ""Sunshine State"" in general and ""Disney World"" in particular for the Hell Holes that they are. THE FLOR!DA PROJECT is filmed entirely just inside Disney World, or just outside the misnamed ""Magic Kingdom"" in the purple-painted ""Magic Castle,"" one of its overflow motels. THE FLOR!DA PROJECT reveals that most of the local ""hospitality workers"" are bra-less single moms with tattoos covering half their bodies, who split their time between flipping pancakes for the deluded tourist dudes and turning tricks for them to stretch their paychecks enough to cover the rent for the squalid motel rooms in which they live. The Pre-School Tykes of these deplorable chicks are grossly neglected, as likely to torch the abandoned condo project next door as not. As the flames soar skyward, the moms commend the Young Arsonists with shouts of ""Aren't you excited?! This is better than TV!"" These Lip-Pierced Skanks wear pads instead of tampons, so that they can reach into their hot shorts and whip them out to plaster on the nearest window in public view whenever they get upset at a tourist, boss, or authority figure.

34,st-shot,Florida Project is wonderfully prepared.,9,19 April 2018,"Moonie and her friends are an incorrigible lot wiling the summer away like most unsupervised 6 year olds getting into mischief. Holly ( Her ink and drink addicted welfare queen, part time hooker mother) loves her and displays it intermittently but is easily distracted allowing Moonie to go free range along the adjacent highway near Disney Land skipping through a series of gauche strip malls. They live at a local low rent purple emblazoned hotel where the local manager (Wilhelm DaFoe) patiently puts up with the out of control antics of Halley who rubs nearly all she meets the wrong way.Director Sean Baker does an outstanding job of directing and allowing his child actors to cut loose and gets wonderfully naturalistic performances from all especially Brooklyn Prince in the role of Moonee evoking and holding her own with Jean Pierre Leaud's child in The 400 Blows. Bria Vinaite as Halley delivers more than a share of tattooed rage (between child like play with Moone) that borders on feral in a powerfully unsympathetic portrait. William Dafoe's tolerant manager is beautifully measured balancing his authority with understanding.In addition to getting wonderful performances from his cast he and his cameramen Alexes Zabe offer up a solid share of striking canvases around this isolated underbelly, that does not wallow in depravity but rather constant assault from the din of the highway with nearly all terra firma around it pavement. In addition to some wonderful stolen shots around the fringes of this tourist mecca Baker pulls some outstanding tracking shots around his static location following the children at and on their own level and initiating tension as well as subtle detail, including an outstanding moment of foreshadowing that informs and intensifies the film's climax in this highly original work.

They live in poverty at a garish pink motel nearby Disney World. Almost a cruel tease of the happier world so close yet so far. They roam around, pester guests and the hotel owner is William Dafoe who has to keep things in check as he is the only real adult.

Easy to guess some reasons and thankfully, the film is unbiased and tells it straight, raw and depressing as it is. It highlights some hard-hitting realities.

It tells of the have-nots living on the outskirts of Disneyland & the other magical realms of abandon in Florida where from a distance, the environs are colorful & tidy but who inhabits them sing a completely tune. Giving full sympathy to the tatt'd mother & smart-mouthed daughter, we see what happens when opportunities are squandered & forgotten & lives just go w/the flow, letting things happen as a matter of eventuality rather than willful decision.

The film is quite lacking in plot, and at times can be a bit frustrating, but also provides a realistic view into the world Baker is trying to bring to life. The film can be a bit dull, as in result of the little plot, and it's these moments that I feel are the films biggest problem, especially when they had some much time to delve into deeper issues the film is withholding within. The acting is quite impressive, with Willem Dafoe, Bria Vinaite, and Brooklynn Prince being the obvious standouts. The cinematography provides a very amateur, but very moving view of the atmosphere it tries to convey, and does it quite well, and is perhaps my favorite thing about the film. In the end, The Florida Project can be a bit dull at time, but its an impressive work of cinema, that is certainly unique, and certainly an important experience that shows what it is truly like to live the lives of all those involved.

43,dierregi,Bunch of obnoxious people we should feel sorry for,1,6 December 2019,"A lot of IMDb's blurbs are just fanciful, non-descriptions of plots. In this one, the character of Halley is described as a ""rebellious, but caring mother"". Halley is a charmless single mother, who thinks that being covered in tattoos means having a rebellious personality.Besides, she is lazy, rude, aggressive, vulgar, irresponsible; she shouts profanities non-stop and chain smokes, next to children. She is also involved in illegal activities and locks her daughter in the bathroom while she's turning tricks.I am not sure in which book that can be described as ""caring""... anyway, her ""well-cared for"" daughter is the equally obnoxious Moonee, an ADHD brat who shouts all her lines, overacting in a way I thought impossible for children.The real plot - or lack thereof - consists of following Moonee and her bunch of equally annoying friends goofing their summer away, completely unsupervised and doing a variety of stupid things, inclusive of: spitting on people's cars, causing power cuts and burning buildings... hey, but they're just kids and so well cared for.Mummy Halley is busy smoking, watching TV, insulting everybody and using the F word every time she gets a chance. She also beats up her female friend and prostitute herself... hey, but that's what rebellious, caring mothers do.It just beats me that the critics loved this film, maybe because we're supposed to be chastised for not caring enough about white trash and all the problems of the world. If you think you deserve punishment, then I'd definitely recommend this film.I don't mind a good, realistic drama, but I do object to this sort of shameless manipulation.PS also glad to know I am not the only one who wished the kids to be run over by a car, to put them out of their - and our - misery.",The Florida Project
44,jadepietro,"No, The Kids Aren't Alright",8,24 January 2018,"GRADE: BTHE FILM IS RECOMMENDED.The kids are not alright in Sean Baker's intimate drama, The Florida Project. The children are regularly unsupervised, crossing dangerous highways and walking miles from home, which seems all commonplace to them and acceptable behavior for the adults around them as they ignore their safety. Waffles, jelly sandwiches, and pizza is their regular and affordable diet. A rare shopping spree at a dollar store becomes a special celebration. All of these small touches elevate the power of this film's message.But children see the world with different eyes and that can be a good thing as it hides some of the ugly realities in this world. It protects them from the harsh truth. We meet little Moonee and her friends during their summer vacation, living at the Magic Castle Inn, near Futureland, both flea-bag motels that house welfare families and lower class residents such as her trashy and volatile single mother, Halley. And while the sunny weather may shine in this Sunshine State, all is not happy and aglow. Mr. Baker shows his larger-than-life characters living at poverty level with his camerawork capturing the squalor and desperation. On a small budget, he takes us into this unfamiliar world to many of us. The screen is awash in gaudy pop architecture painted in vivid purples and hot pinks as its setting, a lost land of 60's kitsch and undeniable hardship. He also depicts the innocence of children, filling their days with games and activities, like sharing an ice cream cone after begging for change, playing hide-and-seek in deserted tenements, talking into a fan to hear their altered voices, playing with a cigarette lighter. It is all shown matter-of-factly in a cinéma-vérité style. His strength is more as a director than screenwriter. His screenplay, co-authored by Chris Bergoch, needs more focus on its narrative structure and some rewrites.The cast are mostly unfamiliar faces which adds to the authenticity and grittiness of the story. Except for a fine Willem Dafoe as Bobby, the stern but caring motel manager, the film takes its characters and their dire situations and forces us to see their lives on display. The aforementioned screenplay is becomes an effective character study about these ""low-lifes"" rather than a well-plotted story. Mr. Baker tends to allow scenes to go on too long with too much improvisation and more atmosphere than substance. He tends to use his strong imagery well, although he repeats himself too often with some of his settings and story-lines. (And let's not go into an incomplete and awful ending that undercuts his fine narrative. It absolutely makes no sense and one leaves his film with some dissatisfaction after investing your time in this fascinating characters.)Aside from Mr. Defoe's subtle portrayal of a man trying to be a little girl's distant protector, the acting throughout the film is uniformly strong with Brooklynn Kimberly Prince as a precocious six year old Moonee. She gives a breakout performance which is quite natural and heart-breaking...and very impressive for such a young actress. As her mother, Bria Vinaite takes on the most difficult role as her mother, a very unlikable character and makes her vulnerable, yet hard, unfit to care for her daughter, angry and frustrated with her lot in life. Everyone in The Florida Project is trying to survive.It's a hard knock life and The Florida Project makes that perfectly clear. But the question still remains: Who will listen?",The Florida Project

46,bkrauser-81-311064,Sean Baker is the Maxim Gorky of Our Time,9,9 November 2017,"Much like the feral children of the Magic Castle – the tacky, rundown Orlando motel where we lay our scene not the Disney Cinderella castle - my early childhood was one of constant flux. Part of that was built into the whimsy of being a kid. A new neighbor would become your best friend with a simple invitation to play outside then become a perfect stranger by the week's end. But to me there was also the added complication of living the semi-nomadic lifestyle. Every few years my parents would move and after a day or two of travel I'd be ricocheting off the walls of a brand new place, ready and willing to meet my new potential besties.It was on that level that I deeply felt for and connected with Moonee (Prince), the troublemaking Floridian youngster that breathes life into the neons, pastels and verdant greens of The Florida Project. She, along with her friends Jancey (Cotto), Scooty (Rivera) and Dicky (Malik) playfully terrorize the denizens of Orlando's crusty motel rooms and gravelly parking lots to stave off the boredom and the heat. Courting mischief at every turn, the rag-tag group of friends runs wild; finding excitement in everything from pasture fields to abandoned housing projects to the greens just outside the Disney World theme park where on a clear night, you can see the nightly fireworks.Yet as the children have their delirious fun, the complex, dangerous and cruel world of adulthood lays always at the periphery, threatening their unending summertime fun. Moonee's mom Halley (Vinaite), hardly more mature than her six-year-old, takes the brunt of every consequence of systemic, individual and moral poverty. The lack of education, lack of mobility, lack of future prospects braces uneasily against Halley's worse instincts. She keeps the authorities at bay with flagrantly desperate hustles yet without really trying, she only makes her situation and thus Moonnee's situation much worse.The Florida Project was once the name of Walt Disney's top secret land development initiative that would eventually become Disney World, Orlando. One can't help but feel the title is a slight on the part of director Sean Baker whose previous films have found beauty in unexpected places. And here there is a lot of beauty but there's also a lot of ugliness in what many would call the closest thing to paradise on earth. Gross neglect and heartrending degradation takes place just outside the manufactured fun and fairy-tale street signs of the infamous park. Those in need of vacation come and go as they please, with little knowledge of their complicity in what is captured for the screen.Yet despite all this, what makes The Florida Project truly special is its light touch. It stops short of judging its characters - or worse still moralizing what could have amounted to poverty porn and giving its characters socio-political halos to wear. Much like Bobby (Dafoe), the unappreciated manager of the Magic Castle, we observe them through lenses of world-weary empathy. A beaten down but still ticking humanism that has learned to accept some things as they are yet still on a happy search of that innate goodness from within. A quiet grace, a foul-mouthed optimism, the remnants of arrested development grinded down by the realities of life; in short we see in this movie, real, actual people.All in all, The Florida Project is incontrovertible proof that Sean Baker is the Maxim Gorky of our time - an exemplary writer and gifted visual director with an eye and soul for great human dramas. Additionally the movie provides an unforgettable showcase for debut actresses Brooklynn Prince and Bria Vinaite and a career highlight for the indelible Willem Dafoe who stops just short of being a thankless bargain bin Gabriel and somehow pulls it off gracefully. Finally, while some may perish the thought of watching a movie like this in general and may not be as receptive to the overall message as myself, the accuracy with which The Florida Project portrays the innocence of childhood is powerful enough for everyone to watch at least once.",The Florida Project

51,pyrocitor,"""To all who come to this happy place: Disneyland is (not) your land""",8,13 November 2017,"A cynic would contemptuously advise you to never bet against the 'Slumdog effect': audiences and Academy members exposing themselves to a film foregrounding the difficult living conditions of impoverished communities around the world (provided the telling is joyful enough to not make us wallow in it TOO much), and subsequently showering them in awards as a form of social penance. This doesn't have to diminish the truth of the stories being told, or the quality of the telling. Still, it can be difficult for the discrepancy between lavish gala celebrations of films about extreme poverty not to rankle. Still, if there were ever an (almost assured) awards darling poised to embrace the irony head-on, it's Sean Baker's The Florida Project, and its parable of families broken and defeated by the 'American Dream' slumped at the foot of its biggest fantasy icon, Walt Disney World (oops – sorry; can't say the 'D-word').This sardonic streak of dramatic irony gives the film teeth, and a rough-and-tumble authenticity that helps it stand out amidst more saccharine or pedantic 'social issues' indie film contemporaries. Instead, Baker's film, conventional subject matter notwithstanding, is as mischievously playful as it is devastating, and achingly sincere in its gaudiness, packing enough of a punch to ensure (gasp!) a shelf-life beyond the inevitable awards circuit. The dreamy, lackadaisical editing, popping colours, and cheerfully jittery cinematography may conjure an ambiance of the lazy, carefree days of a perennial summer, but Baker is adamant to differentiate his film from an archetypal indie account of cute, quirky kids learning life lessons from adversity. For one, protagonist Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) and her cronies are purposefully a lot crueler and more manic than the typical indie childhood cherub, and their harder-edged hijinks romping around their welfare motel (playing with fire, circuit breakers, and some particularly gross vandalism) take some acclimatizing to, with a fair helping of sharing in the condescending wincing of the fellow adults on screen. It's acting out in every sense of the word, as the children's 'play' reaches Tasmanian devil levels of wanton disturbance, partially due to a lack of proper supervision (poignantly, many of their un- or under-employed parents are scarcely more than teenagers themselves), and partially an existential cry of destructive defiance in the face of a world with frighteningly little to offer them past the protective cushion of youth. Their antics, and the shambling, largely improvised banter accompanying them, are at once cacophonous, hugely funny, deeply sad, and often without immediate narrative point – in short, the quintessence of childhood. Still, it's this aimless exuberance of youth that Baker acutely taps into. His film floats with a freeform breeziness, even as the perennial threat of real world consequences looms like an ominous haze of firework smoke over the silhouette of the elusive Cinderella castle. Here, potential catastrophes like a house fire and visit from a (hastily evicted) pedophile become an afternoon's entertainment, while the perennial threat of eviction, arrest, and social services are transmuted into a giddy game of heists and cons (while Moonee's comically recurring baths serve as a sordid punchline, and a terribly clever flourish of Baker forcing the audience to share in blissful childhood ignorance). The feverishly Sisyphean editing conveys the sticky, sweaty ambiance of the motel and the dispiriting claustrophobia of having no escape from it with unsettling authenticity. Still, Baker finds a perverse, surreal beauty in the phantasmagorical gaudiness of the Disney-knockoff souvenir shops flanking the motel (one tracking shot shot of the kids running down the strip is a beautiful albeit horrifying kaleidoscope of tacky excess). And if his shambling pacing proves somewhat too indulgently free-form and a touch too sleepy at times, particularly in a less focused first act, it settles into an entrancing haze that allows the noxious weight of artificiality and poor circumstances and choices to practically sink into the audience's pores. And that ending – a flight of fantastic fantasy all the more infectiously soaring in its incongruity and cathartic, anarchically unauthorized ballsiness – just may stand the test of time to be one of the most jubilantly hopeless finales in recent cinematic history. Baker's cast of non-actors bring a ragged authenticity to their performances so compelling that it adequately compensates for their occasional rougher patches when the dialogue leans more on script than the flexibility of improvisation. This year's Jacob Tremblay-calibre discovery, Prince is exceptional beyond her years, brimming with fiery, combative charisma and snappy 'take-no-sh*t' repartee, and Baker is content to her her play, and celebrate the sheer mischievous joie-de-vivre she stirs up. She's so disarmingly fun that you practically ache to protect her from the encroaching horrors of reality she whimsically skips between, and to let her just be a child. Similarly, former Instagram model Bria Vinaite is remarkably powerful as Moonee's hazy mother. Vinaite flaunts acerbic airs of belligerent trashiness, acting out as destructively and alarmingly as her daughter (including a hilariously disgusting gag with a sanitary pad), only to allow them to crumple inwardly with beats of genuine jubilance and fleeting self-loathing that are masterfully affecting. Finally, Willem Dafoe is as affecting as he is subtle as the softly parental guardian angel trying to hold together a building full of broken people, and watching hints of silent pride or cavernous disappointment colour his face is impressively moving. His standoff with a flock of cantankerous herons also stands out as one of the year's heartiest laughs. Whiffs of the devastating innocence of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves and a sweet- but-sour helping of dramatic irony lend Baker's film legs beyond indie Oscar bait du-jour, into something consummately more moving and memorable. So, next trip to the magic kingdom (or to one of its multi-million dollar cinematic releases flanking Baker's), spare a thought for The Florida Project, and its real-life denizens. It's a small world, after all. -8/10",The Florida Project

Everything about this film feels so genuine and real, from the characters to the script and plot. It works brilliantly as a character study and I'm sure we can all relate to main character Moonee and what she goes through in the film.This is a very slow moving film with a simple storyline that definitely won't be to everyone's taste, but those who enjoy subtle, stripped back storytelling and engaging character studies will get a lot of pleasure out of this film.

The children of both films seem oblivious to their difficult circumstances and find fun (mischief and trouble) with whatever is available to them.The narrative for ""The Florida Project"" is a series of many small scenes - each telling their own little story while building up to a very powerful dramatic conclusion. While a few scenes could have been cut, the film succeeds in its overall purpose.""The Florida Project"" can also be praised for its fine acting. Dafoe plays against type as he is the most stabilizing force among a community of misfits and troublemakers. In subtle ways, he shows his inner conflict: he is rightly annoyed by the worst behaviours of the residents but he can't help but have a soft spot for them. He even occasionally falls into the role of surrogate father to the various children especially in a gripping scene when a stranger approaches the kids when they're playing.Prince is superb as Moonee, deliberately the total opposite of 'sugar and spice and everything nice'. Her strong work easily recalls other great recent child performances including those of Millicent Simmonds in ""Wonderstruck"", Sunny Pawar in ""Lion"", and Jacob Tremblay in ""Room"".Vinaite gives the film's standout performance as she easily gives the viewer conflicting feelings about Halley. It's really easy to hate Halley for the terrible ways she treats people especially a neighbour who is also a single mother. But there are scenes that show her trying as much as possible to give her daughter as good a life as she can despite very limiting circumstances. Credit for this full characterization can also be given to co-writers Chris Bergoch and Sean Baker (the movie's director).This fine film can also be credited for putting a spotlight on an ignored but growing population: the poor.",The Florida Project
55,maurice_yacowar,Six-year-old truants enjoy last liberty,10,30 October 2017,"The title ""Florida Project"" refers to (i) the projects type of crammed, seedy community these working and unemployed denizens are crammed into, and (ii) writer/director Sean Baker's undertaking to record the life children and their single moms live in the American underbelly. This Florida digs beyond the fantasy of Disneyworld to the seediness of the cheap old motel where the transient can afford to take temporary root. This is the world that the liberals disdain, Hillary's ""deplorables,"" the people who see no other hope than voting for Trump. In an early scene a honeymooning couple find they've booked into the cheap motel Magic Castle, not the Disney luxurious fantasy. At the end little Moonee and Jansey run toward that Disney dreamworld, in futile attempt to escape their unaccommodating reality.Tom Sawyer meets Thelma and Louise. The bulk of the film is the amazing spectacle of Moonee and her friends bouncing through a life of simple adventures. Fueled on sugar the kids are constantly running, dancing, jumping, doing everything especially the forbidden. ""We're not supposed to go into that room. Let's go in anyway."" The blackout they cause the whole motel brightens their day, their unharnessed mustang spirit. When they burn down the vacated condo complex the blaze excites the kids and adults alike. But it forces a rift between the two kids' mothers, Moonee's Halley and the girlfriend who has been giving them free food from her diner. The motel women provide a spectrum of responsibility. At one end is the African American grandmother raising her daughter's child. She knows discipline should not be fun. Then there's Scooty's hard-working waitress mom who is close and generous towards Halley until she feels her son endangered by Halley's example. At the other, Halley is more immature than her six-year-old daughter. To earn money Halley lives on the fly, hawking cheap perfume, feeding off friends and fraud, finally turning to prostitution, which loses first her best friend then Moonee. Apparently Moonee has not been going to school. She has to be told what ""recess"" is, because her life has been one long recess. So has Halley's, which makes her eventual loss of her daughter inevitable. Tragic, but inevitable. The film's themes and emotions are propelled by the children's amazing performances, especially Brooklynn Prince as Moonee. In the concluding wallop Moonee runs to Jansey not to seek refuge from the social agency — which we first expect — but to say goodbye. She knows she has lost her freedom, her mother, her particular childhood. When the once goodie-goodie Jansey takes her hand and runs away with her, the kids make one last grab at the life they want to live. Like their mothers, they'll have to lapse into the life to which their social and economic status restricts them. In the opening shot, the motel wall provides an abstract composition of pink and grey. The two squirming kids seated in front of it inject life into that abstraction, as the characters do to terms like ""the projects"" or ""the deplorables."" Indeed the range of settings frustrates any attempt at generalization. The motel embodies the life Florida tourists ignore. The commercial landscapes are a surreal eruption of crazy buildings and garishness. Against those two forms of denaturedness, two scenes find Moonee freeing her imagination in escapes to nature. In one she sits in what she declares her ""favourite tree"": it fell over but still carries on. That prefigures her own conclusion. Then she takes Jansey on ""safari"" — to a field of cows. The games and adventures Moonee keeps inventing are her spontaneous attempt to imagine a richer life than her situation provides. It's a livelier alternative to her mother's armour of tattoos. Presiding over this world is motel manager Bobby. Willem Dafoe is more familiar as an edgy, crazy character, which lends weight to the moral and character centre he plays here. His responsibility continually pitches him against Moonie's mischief and Halley's truancy. But he cares for them both. He achieves a modest heroism when he spots and assails a child molester, then when he drives off Halley's threatening john. But when the social agency and police get involved, Bobby can only stand aside, sympathetic but helpless. Bobby tries to keep up the motel's image. He repaints the walls and plans to fix the washers. He tries to enforce the laws. The owner instructs Bobby to have the tenants move their bikes off the front balcony. Clearly he wants to upscale the place — like the other motel Bobby tries to get Halley into. The wheels of the economy grind on. Soon even this Magic Castle will go upscale, casting out its desperate tenants and challenging them even more. These are the characters America has left behind.",The Florida Project

57,sharky_55,"'Cause it's tipped over, and it's still growing.",8,4 March 2018,"No recent film better conveys the idea that children are a product of their environment quite like The Florida Project does. It's Sean Baker's take on the topsy-turvy lives of the families that squat in the Magic Castle motel complex in Kissimmee, Florida, just outside the real magic Disney castle. Baker begins his tale with a jolt of cheery irony; Kool & the Gang's Celebration over loopy opening credits, and kids scurrying around in excitement at some newfound discovery. That's the only musical solace we'll hear - for the rest of the film, in lieu of a soundtrack, a diegetic drone infiltrates the scene, masses of cicadas, the summer break traffic jams, and even the odd helicopter (police or luxury). Peace and quiet isn't a concept over here. The setting makes some desperate appeal to its namesake. These are real buildings cast off from the eventual amusement park a few miles away, painted in garish shades of pastel lavender, pink, green and yellow to give the impression of oversized plastic doll houses that have fallen into disrepair. Early montages of the children's daily adventures shuttle through the tacky appeal of the gigantic attractions that have since gone to seed: Orange World, the gift shop, the giant-sized ice cream store. Baker and his cinematographer Alexis Zabe shoot with slight wide angle lenses so the edges of the frame curve and make these behemoths bulge. It's as if the rest of the park just moved on without them. They're the rejects of the magical theme park experience, frequented by the rejects of society. Baker begins with whimsy, seen from the POV of six year old Moonee and his friends, who act as if Magic Castle was their own personal playground. He contrasts the uncomfortable truths of semi-permanent residency in a rundown motel (""The man who lives in here gets arrested a lot."") with unwavering childlike innocence. There's a neat wide shot of the entire complex milling out of their rooms, grumbling and protesting at the lack of power, while the naughty trio scurry up the stairs and make their escape. A humourous sequence midway sees a honeymooning couple mistake the motel for a far prettier location than its name suggests, yet Moonee and his friends weave and duck through the lobby, playing all the same. Even in relative poverty their imagination shines through. Baker does not think of moralising their situation, or even pitying them. Why should he? Moonee doesn't know what pity is, she lives as if she were a princess. Yet the spell cannot be maintained forever. While Moonee and co. continue their adventures, the visual focus of the film shifts ever so slightly, gradually revealing the squalor and risk associated with this type of living. Shooting from hip height, the camera observes the world from Moonee's gaze while adult torsos are cut off, but never truly invisible. Shallow focus zeroes in on her playtime while her mother Halley frets and trembles in the background, struggling to make ends meet. She juggles her commitment as a young mother (she's more of a big sister in reality, their tag-team selling of perfume a real bonding moment) with other distractions: partying, drugs, sex. Newcomer Bria Vinaite struts around Magic Castle with the same authority as her daughter, but turns venomous in a split second when anyone dares question her parenting style. Her delivery is key; half her dialogue is a favoured three word phrase when something doesn't go her way, and she all but spits the last word. Her palm is splayed out, half in mockery, half in confusion, and you can see the same vein of arrogance already forming in Moonee. Willem Dafoe gives a crucial performance here, as the motel manager who can't marry his exasperation directed at his most troubled clients and the concern he holds for the fractured families he sees time and time again. On the surface he's old and weathered, a hardass who won't tolerate any step out of line. But a closer look reveals a guardian who has quietly ensured the survival and safety of many Moonees over the years, so much so that he barely has the energy to focus on his own personal issues. The inevitability of the ending breaks him, although he can't show it. Brooklynn Prince is the real star in the making, able to effortlessly convey the joy of childhood in the face of such adversity. Does she know why they must flog perfume in the parking lots of nicer hotels, or is it just a game to her? Here and now, she shows glimpses of understanding, mixed with a casual sass (creeping into arrogance and disrespect) that she picks up from her mother. But when the full face of reality hits her, she simply crumples, and instantly we are reminded of her age. No six year old should have to face this. That final handheld iPhone shot racing through the actual Disneyland, a breathless retreat from reality, is heartbreaking. The illusion is shattered. Magic Castle is no more.",The Florida Project
58,aciessi,Magic Kingdom,9,25 October 2017,"Somewhere in the shadows of tourist traps and Walt Disney World is a story waiting to be told. An unconventional, unsettling story about childhood memories within a purple motel filled with the disaffected, forgotten members of American society. It is no place for a child to be raised, but that doesn't destroy the imagination that every child has. Even in the most desolate of areas, happiness can be found.The Florida Project is a profound film. The appropriate spiritual successor to Sean Baker's last film, Tangerine. It's another side of an overlooked portion of our population. Instead of the lives transgender sex workers roaming the streets of L.A. we are introduced to a community of downtrodden, unemployed, poor folks trapped in the heart of American family tourism. They are more commonly known by wealthy Americans as ""white trash"". The breakout star of the film is Brooklyn Prince as Moonee, a really bad little girl of sorts who lives an average childhood in a not so average world, of which she only knows. Her mother is a thief and prostitute who has no business raising children of her own and by the end, the authorities let her know this. Willem Dafoe, in an outstanding turn, plays the manager of the motel. Almost akin to a father figure to all of these people, he keeps order with a stern grip. Dafoe is usually known for playing villains and sickos, so it's especially refreshing to see him play a genuinely decent guy.Sean Baker has matured as a director, for sure. He explores this world with stunning cinematography. He even goes back to his smart-phone roots towards the end of the picture, in what is an incredible montage of the girls running into the Magic Kingdom to escape. This all came without the permission of the park. Now, we know why nothing is ever filmed at the ""happiest place on earth"".

60,rockman182,The Florida Project (2017),8,7 October 2017,"Boy, did I hear some great things about this from film festivals and from critics I follow on social media. Trailer didn't blow me away but I knew there had to be something special about this film. I haven't seen Sean Baker's previous effort, Tangerine, so I didn't really have a barometer for what to expect. I can safely say the film works so well. It's incredibly well acted, and utilizes a charming and emotional script to convey an experience you won't soon forget.The film follows a young girl named Moonee (played by a really good young Brooklynn Kimberly Prince) and her mom who live in an extended stay motel managed by Bobby (Willem Dafoe). Halley, Moone's mother, has trouble making ends meet and does whatever she can to raise her daughter but her brash personality and lifestyle makes life difficult during their stay at the motel. Bobby tries his best to watch over them but realizes how tough it is keeping them as guests.Its hard to say much more without giving away key plot points. I have to say this film is a joyous good time. The kid performers are mostly yelling loudly and running around on adventures. you know, being typical hyper kids. Its done so well though. I think Baker may have legitimately had the child actors improvise their lines because everything felt extremely natural. Newcomer Bria Vinaite, wow. She is livewire. Love or hate her character, she is loudly unapologetic and rebellious and just wonderfully portrayed. Defoe is also typically great. Bobby is such an identifiable character.Baker uses his lenses to study a part of under-represented America. We don't get a lot of films about struggling families who find it hard to get by, definitely not the typical ""Hollywood"" character story. The film is definitely going to hit a lot of viewers hard at the end. Its a rather beautiful ending that reflects the innocence of the mischievous but ultimately innocent children. This could really be an Oscar contender.8/10",The Florida Project
61,jon.h.ochiai,The sadness that heals,9,13 November 2017,"""The Florida Project"" is funny, poignant, and ultimately sad. Astonishing Brooklynn Prince is 6 year-old Moonee, who lives with her Mom Halley, amazing newcomer Bria Vinaite, in the rundown Magic Kingdom motel near Disney World. Moonee is the innocent free spirit playing with her friends Scooty and Jancey, played by good Christopher Rivera and Valeria Cotto. Halley is the singularly unfit mother, who peddles wholesale perfume to hotel guests, and casual prostitute to make rent. Willem Dafoe is the generous motel manager constantly giving Halley a break. Dafoe is at his most humane and vulnerable. His performance grounds ""The Florida Project"".As the child Moonee is both unaware and accustomed to her circumstance in Writer and Director Sean Baker's cautionary narrative. After Halley's unforgivable cruelty, she and Moonee joyously play in the rain. This is beautiful and resoundingly sad. In Baker and Chris Bergoch's story, character is destiny. Moonee survives with free breakfasts from Ashley, kind Mela Mupher, and begging for ice cream money. Life is the inherent paradox. Baker brilliantly exposes the ugly and joyous in Moonee's innocence. There is subtle heartbreak as Moonee plays with her toys in the bathtub while Halley has sex for money. The authentic sadness in ""The Florida Project"" is not the healing sadness, rather the reminder of what had likely gone before in younger Halley. Director Baker's power lies in this self-consciousness. It's one thing that drunken fiery Halley does her very best, but she is no Mother. That missing costs Moonee her very being. Prince amazes as little Moonee. Her Moonee loves her Mom with all her heart, perhaps choosing to turn a blind eye. We eventually glimpse through Baker's lens that Moonee deep down knows something is just not right. Prince is touching in her shining resilience and her keen awareness. She tells Scooty, ""I can tell when grownups are going to cry."" But when does Moonee get to cry? Prince and Vinaite have authentic screen chemistry. We pull for Moonee and Halley out their love for each other, but that is not enough to save the day. Dafoe's Bobby is well aware. He really can't know what's going on inside Moonee and Halley, all he can do is have compassion. The world at times can seem unfair, and love alone may not save the day. Yet, Baker says even in this, perhaps something greater is possible. Maybe the sadness does heal in the end.",The Florida Project
62,RforFilm,"Under a darker shadow of Disney World, sits The Florida Project, about a poor child at a colorful motel",10,22 December 2017,"For tourist cities like Orlando, Florida and Anaheim, California (both are homes to Disney theme parks), everyone assumes that since both places have large businesses that generate profit, then everyone living there is well. Well...that's like assuming because there are a lot of wealthy celebrities living in Hollywood, then everyone must be just as well off. The honest truth is that, like any high population centers, there are wealthy and poorer areas. What they have in common is that both are filled with people chasing the American dream. What exactly draws them in is up to them, but for those living in Orlando or Anaheim, they are probably hoping to catch a bit of that Disney magic, hoping it can inspire them.Both places are also filled with several motels, restaurants, gift shops, and anything that can take some advantage of the tourists. A lot of people work in those places and some even work at the parks. And of course there are those that only live under the shadow of the Disney castles, accepting it as a part of life as they go on with their own goals. In the case of The Florida Project, we get a viewpoint from the lowest end of the economic spectrum.In Orlando, there are sets of low-end motels that also act as housing. For those places that don't have the budget of a Marriot or a Hilton, they try to lure in people by replicating the Disney experience by adding bright colors or themed names like Futureland or the Large Orange. The majority of the story takes place at the purple-colored hotel called the Magic Castle. Among living there is young mother Halley (played by Bria Vinaite) and six-year-old daughter Moonee (played by Brooklynn Prince)It's established from the start that Moonee is mischievous and badly behaved, constantly cursing at adults, mooching off of tourists, and just causing trouble. It doesn't help that her mother does nothing to nurture her and even encouraging her. The closest thing to a father figure is the building's manager Bobby (played by Willem Dafoe) whose only doing so reluctantly to ensure that rent is paid. What's worse is that her mother doesn't want to work and uses Moonee to help for extra cash. Over the course of one summer, Moonee goes trough trials and hardships of gaining and losing friends, dealing with her mother, and trying to make any situation fun.We've seen a lot of movies about childhood and even of bad children, but we rarely get one like The Florida Project that examines that at such a young age. But what's scarier is that there are families with kids that are like that. The Florida Project feels like an honest look at that kind of situation. Putting it within the background of the gate of Disney World adds a lot more style that's visually interesting (both ironic and a relic of another time). But let's talk about the three big stars.First on Willem Dafoe, who does well, playing a man who you can tell really wants to help those in his motel, but also knows that there's a line between a landlord and a friend and often can't cross it. I can tell that people watching this will have mixed emotions towards him, but I'll let the audience decide. Next, Bria Vinaite as the young mom, is a lot like many parents we've come across; the ones that have already given up and are just trying to get to the next day, regardless if anyone's hurt. Even the one thing she cares for, her child, is not even safe from her toxic lifestyle.Finally, little Brooklynn Prince as Moonee does more then a great job; she takes the material, a lot that a child shouldn't even have to deal with, and emotes in every fashion that's natural. I'd love to see just how director Sean Baker coached this little girl into understanding the dark material without spoiling the innocent side of her that's present. It would have been easy to simply make her a bad seed and nothing more, but see's like a well built mess that only her environment could have made her. Though your mad at her in some parts, your more likely to be mad at just how she got there.I'll give this ten motel tourist traps out of ten. It may not be the easiest sit through, but The Florida Project presents the opposite effect of successful towns in an engaging way that most filmmaker would have been afraid to tackle. Check it out and get a better understanding about mischievous children...and their innocence.",The Florida Project
63,cultfilmfan,Sean Baker's The Florida Project,10,14 January 2018,"Sean Baker's The Florida Project is an absolutely perfect if not maybe too painfully astute look at what is currently wrong with America today and what seems to have been a problem for far too long and yet little to nothing seems to have been done about it. And no, I am not talking about President Trump, or how he is residing over the country, or giving an overall favourable, or negative opinion on his presidency because that is neither here nor there and does not effect the purpose, or intent of this review one iota. I will just say that after this weekend's faux pas over things said in a meeting that were overheard and made public and these were not exactly words, or language that depict, or show the president in the best kind of light, but all I will add here is that if he wants to remain president and seek a second term, he will really have to be careful about the words that come out of his mouth, whether they be in public, or behind closed doors and that also includes being cautious and considerate about how you use and what you write on certain forms of social media, in this case the one with the cute little bird. There enough said and done. As for The Florida Project, it addresses the long standing issue of poverty in America, and shows an unflinchingly realistic portrayal of the lives of several people, particularly in focus being a young mother named Halley and herv daughter Mooney. People watching this film can come away with many different opinions, or theories based upon what they have just watched. I am personally of the opinion that Baker here is neither glorifying these people and how they live, or personally finding fault, or blaming them either. Maybe there stems a much deeper problem and issue here than what lies on the surface. There are examples of how the motel they live and can hardly pay rent for is one thing, but also how they have no real sense of how to spend, earn, or even save money. If money is so tight do you really need to go out and buy all those cigarettes you are seen smoking, because I do not know about America, but here in Canada they are heavily taxed and if you are anything even close to a chain smoker you probably blow a large part of your monthly income on the deadly and yet very stupid things. You can also look at Halley and her friends and instantly notice that they are covered from head to toe in elaborate tattoos that encompass their entire body. There is more of their body that is covered in ink than that is not. Again tattoos depending on the size and the elaborateness to them are not inexpensive either and again you are not really investing your money here in the best way. Halley also seems to be a person who unfortunately is her own worst enemy by having an extremely rebellious attitude towards any kind of authority, or just basically people in general. While Halley tries to scrape together some kind of income to afford the small room her daughter and her call home, Mooney is meanwhile out with her friends getting into all kinds of mischief just for the sake of doing it, including such things as vandalism, arson and even begging other people for money. Halley you can tell as much as is possible for her, truly loves Mooney and yet she is setting an absolutely terrible example for her by the way she lives her life on a day to day basis and when Mooney is reprimanded by the kindly yet firm manager of the motel named Bobby, Halley just shrugs it off and then seems to forget about it until more problems ensue and what begins as just harmless pranks become more and more harmful and Halley herself also seems to be spiralling out of control with both her temper, her wild lifestyle and just having no sense of self control, or knowing when to call quits on this destructive lifestyle that is not only damaging her, but also her daughter's image of a mother and role model is in very sore and sordid shape. One can argue that perhaps if Halley had continued on with her education, or perhaps done some volunteer work, or gotten involved in some extra curricular activities she would be a lot further ahead than she is right now, but the film asks the question of who is really to blame here. Is it always a government's responsibility to play nanny to it's citizens, or should the powers that be offer more in ways of incentives and encouragement and maybe even social programs to help out, so that these kind of problems don't risk the tipping point. Maybe also the individual needs to be a bit responsible for themselves and try to put their best foot forward in life and not be afraid to try new things to better one's self. There are no easy answers to these questions and yet poverty and the type of behaviour I have mentioned is still on the rise and it is definitely something that needs to be addressed one way, or another. The Florida Project is not always the most easiest film to sit through because of the very disturbing self destructive behaviour that is on screen in front of us. And yet, I was glad the film gave us a no holes barred look at the problem and allows us to think, pray and grasp about the problem at hand. This is a powerful film that should definitely be a wake up call to any and all people in government as well as to educators and parents as well. The performances here are the best of any film this year from mostly a crowd of new faces, but they all do such a fantastic job here and Willem Dafoe as Bobby, is one of my favourite, if not absolute favourite performance I have seen him in. A tender man with a good heart who also knows how to be firm and authoritative when he needs to be and yet he knows the trouble of those around him. This is a powerful film that will hit you hard whether you want that, or not, but there is no denying it's impact and the questions that arise from it. One of 2017's best films.",The Florida Project
64,bankofmarquis,Not Strong Enough To Keep My Interest,5,18 February 2018,"THE FLORIDA PROJECT is one of those ""slice of life"" films, shot on a low budget that doesn't really have a plot but exposes the audience to 2 hours of what it would be like to live the life of someone - usually a disaffected fringe group. There is no real plot, so the film needs to hang itself onto how interesting the characters - and the situation they find themselves - are.These types of films are not usually my cup of tea, and this film was no exception.THE FLORIDA PROJECT, conceived, written and directed by Sean Baker (who did a similar-type of film about the transgender community, TANGERINE), is about the community of people living just at the poverty line in the shadow of Walt Disney World. These people are constantly scrambling to earn money to eat and live and to pay rent at one of the seedy, rundown motels boarding just outside ""the happiest place on earth"". We see this world through the eyes of Moonee - a ""precocious"" (I would say farel) youth who lives at one of these hotels with her mother, Halley. Moonee runs wild all day, doing whatever she wants and just 'living her life"" while her mother hustles to make ends meet - all under the watchful eye of the motel's Manager, Bobby.There is no real plot to this film. We just follow Moonee and her pals Scooty, Dicky and Jancey as they go about their day getting into misadventures. 6 year old Brooklyn Prince (in her film debut) stars as Moonee and she is an engaging enough presence, but not nearly strong enough to keep my attention for the entire 2 hours of the film - and that's the issue with this film. It relies heavily on the audience's fascination with this 6 year old and I wasn't fascinated enough to watch her for 2 hours.Much more interesting to me to watch was another new actress, Bria Vinaite as her mother, Halley. I said she spends the film hustling - and I mean that in every sense of the word. Every interaction with another person is laced with the thought ""what can I get out of this"". She is always working an angle, looking for the quick score. She was a fascinating character, and I would have preferred that she would be the focus of this story.Overseeing these two - and the other denizen's of his Motel - is Willem DaFoe playing against type as the kindly, caring Manager, Bobby. DaFoe is nominated for an Oscar for his work in this film - and it is strong work (it's good to see DaFoe with something to sink his teeth into), but is it enough for an Oscar? I don't think so. Much like Mary J. Blige in MUDBOUND, I think it is a very good performance, but I kept waiting for the ""Academy Award"" scene from him, and it just didn't come.Ultimately, a labor of love for Sean Baker. It looks like a film that was made on a shoestring budget - and I'm sure that was intentional. The look and feel of this film mimics the circumstance that the characters find themselves in - including some ""guerilla"" filmmaking at Disney's Magic Kingdom itself. He made the type of film he wanted to make.It just isn't the kind of film I wanted - or am interested - in seeing.Letter Grade: C+5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Florida Project

67,kjproulx,A Slow-Paced Image Of Life,9,3 January 2018,"It can be very hard to get invested in a film when the sole purpose is to display a setting and have you feel for characters in certain situations, especially when it's not really building to much of a climax. The Florida Project is the epitome of this type of storytelling, but I find these risky ventures extremely interesting. Although very different movies, I've always loved Richard Linklater's style of storytelling, having a group of characters evolve throughout the film, being the only true through-line of the film. The Florida Project does exactly that and I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this film, simply because it felt so real. If you're a true fan of the film medium, then here's why I believe The Florida Project is one of the better films of 2017.Many people go to the movies to get immersed in a world outside of their own, but forget that a generic story isn't always the best story. Sure, movies like Star Wars or Harry Potter are huge events and deserve to be seen by everyone, but when a film like The Florida Project can transport you to a real place and either have you relate to the characters or feel the need to praise your own life in comparison with the ones presented on-screen, I feel like that is just as enjoyable sometimes.Following young Moone (the most central character) as she travels around the grounds of her apartment complex, she must cope with being poorly influenced by a terrible mother, while still enjoying the trouble she causes everyone with her friends. At its core, this is a film about moving on from a life you don't need, plain and simple. If a film like this can't interest you, then I can't recommend it. Personally, I found this film very hard to dislike, mainly due to how it was all put together as a finished product.The grungy look to the movie (almost as if it was a homemade feature) really sucked me into this film. I found myself feeling for each of the characters and loving to hate others. Although Brooklynn Prince and Bria Vinaite are the true standouts for carrying this film, I was blown away by the performance that Willem Dafoe gives as the hotel owner. His interaction with each of his guests felt real. Dafoe has never been better, embodying a man that most viewers can relate to in terms of trying to understand the good and bad in everyone, as well as protecting the vulnerable and trying to be a stand-up guy. The movie isn't without a few minor issues, however.This complaint will seem more like a nitpick, but I feel the need to mention it. It's very hard to make a perfect movie and when you're entire film revolves around characters hanging out at a hotel, it can become tiresome at nearly two hours. I did feel the length of the movie when watching, but upon reflection, I feel that was needed. I found this movie to be draining upon first viewing, but I now feel that's necessary to the film itself.In the end, The Florida Project probably won't go down as an independent 2017 classic as I feel it may deserve, but it's a damn good movie that I feel film lovers should wrap themselves up in. The unique editing styles and committed performances combine themselves together to create a loveable little film. The Florida Project is a fantastic little film that I believe needs more attention. Movies like this don't gain enough mainstream attention, which I have always found to be upsetting.",The Florida Project
68,Movi3DO,Incredible and beautiful and sad,9,17 August 2021,"So it's My Neighbor Totoro but depressing as well.So the A24 peeps usually bring up this movie, so I decided to watch it. And wow this movie was quite something.The bulk of the movie surrounds Moonee, a young kids living in the poor side of Florida with a young mother, living her days and playing with her friends. They embarked on many activities and adventures together. At the beginning, everything looked and sounded happy for the kids. The cinematography was amazing showing the surreal-looking apartment complex and the streets of Florida. Like in Totoro, I felt like another kid accompanying Moonee and her friends on their adventures.Of course, slowly and slowly, reality creeped in and became a contrast to the innocence that radiated from the kids. I have seen this done before, but this movie executed so well. Sometimes it felt meandering, but that's probably the point. These kids' lives are just meandering around living day by day.I loved the symbolisms in the movie. The color and name of the apartment complexes compared to what was happening within was sheer contrast. It's also shocking to see the way Disneyland was used in this movie. The name of the kid, although sounded cute, actually reflected the core theme of the movie about childhood imagination as a way to cope with reality.About the ending, it threw me off a bit.

The young child actors in this movie are amazing, especially Brooklynn Prince as Mooney an out of control neglected child let run loose with her companions causing havoc and at the same time humour with their off the radar mischief caused entirely by their economic and emotional family or lack of circumstances.
William DeFoe , nominated for a best supporting Oscar is the sandwich in the middle trying to be supportive to the residents of the Magic Castle Motel , all round nice guy who as motel manager has to play private detective and maintenance man for the owners , while at the same time trying to protect the Adult Children and their offspring.
The film shows perfectly the failure of society and trickle down economics where you have a mega wealthy billion dollar Corporate and tourist Mecca minutes away from a welfare dependent and low paid community, where vice and petty crime are the only way for some like Halley, Mooney's trashy lazy Mum , who probably is only a victim of the cycle she was passing on to her daughter can survive.
It's a sad movie , especially as it offered no solution and asks the question what will become of these characters, well worth seeing.",The Florida Project
70,brankovranjkovic,The Florida Project: social awareness documentary about the the poor community that lives just outside Disney World,9,17 November 2017,"Produced by B.F.I. a documentary drama that paints a perfect picture of life from the outside but dig a little to reveal a slice of disadvantaged lives and the damaged environment from the inside. This is an authentic social awareness documentary about the the poor community that lives just outside Disney World, the focus is the rundown motel being used as low income housing. Willem Defoe is the very likable motel manager struggling to keep control and order but has affection for the tenants, he maintains great chemistry with all the tenants but particularly the latchkey child character 'Moonie' played by unknown actor Brooklyn Prince, who has little adventures and is always getting into trouble and her mother character 'Hayley' played by unknown actor Bria Vinaite, who represents the under life in Florida – single mum, young, poor, heavily tattooed. She takes odd jobs, including sex work to pay bills from week to week. Hayley is a real disgrace and clearly not ready for motherhood.At the end we see Moonie being collected to be taken into care but she escapes and runs away to Disney World. The ending is an abrupt black screen, leaving the audience to decide what happens next. I enjoyed this look at the world mainly from a child's point of view, but not in an entertaining way, very much in the same way as 'I Daniel Blake' did for me. It's a tough watch where 5 audience members walked out at various times during my screening (I can't say whether it was too tough for them, or whether it just wasn't their cup of tea due to lack of exploding cars)",The Florida Project
71,rajdoctor,Wonderful look at Innocence...,7,22 February 2018,"The Florida Project was inspired from Little Rascals (1931) movie during thirties depressions where children without school have hilarious times.The movie is set in Florida near Disney Park in a dingy Motel which is used by homeless to stay for short periods of time.Here Halley (Bria Vinate) stays with her child Mooney (Brooklyn Prince) in a one-room with attached toilet motel. Mooney and her friends Scooty (Christpher Rivera) and Dicky (Auden Malik) invite Jancey (Valeria Cotto) to join them and they are at their children's best - doing mischief, being naughty and trying to search a little replica of Disney Park in their own little ways by venturing into nearby places, seeing cows, and abandons condos, eating ice-creams.Their pranks are tolerated by Hotel Manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe) is protective of these children.To meet ends Halley turns to hooker, at times does road-side marketing and selling of wholesale rate perfumes, and eating at star joints without payment. This lends Halley in trouble and the law catches up with her - and comes to take Mooney away to a children's rehab.In the last act, where Mooney runs away from the cops and counselors to Jancey's place to tell her goodbye - thinking that she is never going to meet or see her friends again. Jancey seeing Mooney crying drags her and runs away to the Disney Park. That is what Mooney always wanted.The Director has done commendable job in extracting amazing acting from the cast, especially Brooklyn - who over shadows every character with her perfect natural acting of a spoil brat. Many elite may find the children intolerable, but that is the reality of single-mothers without work, raising kids in today's USA.A special mention has to be done of the casting. Bria Vinate was casted through instagram and this is the third outing for Brooklyn and gracious Willen Dafoe brought life to a good hearted Manager's role.The shooting was mostly done near a motel in Florida Disney Park during summers - observing the strict USA children's labor laws of 8 hours shifts only.The movie was good, the ambiance and apathy of characters living such life was an eye-opener. But the real joy of the movie was the children's acting. From the first shot till the last the director Sean Baker did not lose sight of the core purpose of this movie to show happiness that children see in little things and how happy they make us - seeing them in their own little world.Wonderful look at innocence...also makes it a box-office successThe last scene when Jancey runs away holding Mooney's hand is extremely touching, and brings tears to the eyes. It tells so much about pure LOVE and that personal connect - that even small children non-hesitantly find courage to do things that brings joy to each other. It is nominated for one Oscar, and already won 55 awards and nominated for more than 100 awards internationally.I would go with 7 out of 10.",The Florida Project
72,Andres-Camara,I can not empathize with anyone in this movie,3,17 March 2018,"Well I'm going to take a risk and knowing that everyone is going to mess with me, because of what I've already heard about the movie, but I'm going to write what I think about it.As I see it, I can not help thinking that when I was a child, none of my friends or I were so badly educated or so unpleasant. If they told us something, we would bend our heads, we would not think of answering anyone. The education in the world must have changed a lot, worse I can not stop listening, more lovely children go and to me the opposite is true. It is not about being poor or rich, but about having an education and respect. The mother of the girl, gets so unpleasant that I can only think, how will not be the girl so unpleasant. What education will you give if you do not have it? We also did pranks, but they were healthy and not like these children.
That the children are very well? And so much so that they are very good, they manage to look as unpleasant as the director is supposed to want. And the mother is the same. All the actors are fine, but not for the Oscar. Does Willem deserve the Oscar? Well the truth, I think it has many better interpretations than this. In addition, there is very little on the screen.The movie is not going anywhere. It's just a stretch of summer, which could have lasted half an hour or so and that's a failure for me.He has an independent film photograph, he does not have a photograph. It has too much light and it does not help the plot.I do not like the address. Nothing. Why do not you go anywhere? Only get good interpretations. The camera is always wrong.Well I imagine that I will rain criticism from all places, but what are we going to do, I see it",The Florida Project
73,MrDHWong,Paints a raw and unrelenting look into a side of American culture many try to ignore but at the same time cannot look away from,7,26 July 2018,"The Florida Project is a drama film starring Willem Dafoe. Directed and co-written by Sean Baker (Tangerine), it a raw and unrelenting look into a side of American culture many try to ignore but at the same time cannot look away from.In the city of Kissimmee, Florida, six-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) lives with her anarchic young mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) in a run-down motel. To pass the time during Summer break, Moonee spends her days with other motel resident kids, causing mischief, conning tourists out of money, and getting on the nerves of the motel's manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe).The film makes no attempts at sugarcoating its depiction of lower-class civilian life in America. As unsympathetic as many of the characters are, they all seem like realistic people most will have encountered at some point and director Sean Baker chooses a more down-to-earth approach at showing their lifestyles rather than the usual Hollywood-manufactured sentiment. All of the young child actors were fantastic and gave convincing performances. However, it is Willem Dafoe who shines the most as the serious but well-intentioned motel manager Bobby as he tries to help his guests deal with any outbreak of chaos. This is not an easy film for a casual viewer to sit through, but if one can stomach some of the more extreme moments, then I suggest seeing it at least once.I rate it 7/10",The Florida Project
74,Alexander_Blanchett,Good but slightly overrated,7,7 January 2018,"Solid film but not the masterpiece it is praised to be for me. 
It was touching and I cared a lot of the characters and it wonderfully characterized the characters wonderfully. 
Also I loved how the two different worlds, the one of the poor at the edge of society is so close at the world of Disney World, the world of the well-beings. Two different world, that could not be more different.
The acting was great. No doubt about that. Brooklynn Prince is a great discovery and especially during her scenes in the last ten minutes she really got out everything out of her little body. Great job. Bria Vinaite is also a wonderful discovery. She really understood her role and played it very down to earth. Seeing those two it felt like watching a documentary thats how good they were. Then there is of course Willem Dafoe who gives one of his most natural and down to earth performances of his career. But I did not think it was one of the best things of the year, as he is getting universal awards attention. Don't get me wrong, a great performance nevertheless. 
Good editing and a very rough and cold look in general but that was needed for the realistic environment the film creates. Still I had loved to have more on the story side to make it even more appealing to me.",The Florida Project

76,statuskuo,Under The Shadow Of Disney,8,20 October 2017,"It's only fitting that in the shadow of the corporate mouse...a society of people who live on the fringe would exist. In Florida (specifically Orlando) the desperate existence thrives on people who go off the beaten path...and actually get lost. That is where Halley (newcomer Bria Vinaite) and her daughter Moonee (played by another newcomer Brooklynn Prince) exist. Halley...seems to be a club kid who got knocked up by a man who shortly abandoned her. In some tribal/white trash code of religion, it seems she thought having a child would make her grow up. Not quite. Because the princesses' castle is within reach, it's still a world away. And that is heartbreaking. Imagine being a person unable to grow up (like what Disney promotes). Those dreams withered and died, but the worst residual effects remained. Which is the Magic Castle. A hovel of a (what one unsuspecting tourist calls a ""gypsy project"") dump managed by Bobby, played wonderfully sympathetic character Willem Dafoe. Bobby patiently overlooks the ship of fools and sometimes, babysits, though by default. Most who live there have feral children who explore the grounds and beyond out of boredom. The residents here are...they are who you think should live there. Look, this film is about character. There is zero plot, so don't go looking for a story. The reality of the people who live here are brutal. Like...on edge scary where you're not entirely sure you want anyone to exist here. But they do. Moonee is a lovely little girl caught up in an adult world she doesn't fully comprehend, but is forced to deal with. Halley is obviously a broken toy herself. And in a very quiet effective scene, we see glimpses of Halley coming to terms with what the world requires of her as parent (""pepperoni costs money"").This is art at it's highest degree. A well paced, sometimes hilarious glimpses of life at the fray. I really hope Willem DaFoe gets nominated for an Oscar. There is a moment in the film where he becomes the knight in shining armor, unbeknownst to the complaining tenants of the complex. Essentially protecting their children from the monsters that are within grasp. And no one thanks him for it. His character Bobby just wants to make it to the end of the day like everyone else. But he is also...us watching and wanting to hug these people hard.",The Florida Project

78,latinfineart,"A brilliant character study, that blends a powerful story with great humor",9,20 October 2017,"I really liked this film, as unorthodox as it was. The first hour was uproariously funny, before becoming a deep, and poignant study of the millions of lives of Americans who are living on the fringes of society, just barely surviving day to day. There is a shocking lack of cinema devoted to this underclass, and seeing this small film, was refreshing, enlightening, and surprising, and a refreshing contrast to the plutocracy we see all around us today. The performances were outstanding. I am not sure where Bria Vinaite has been hiding, but she was astonishing as the mom, Hailey. Her daughter and all of the other kids were great, and their interactions, behavior, dialogue and play was hysterical. Then it kind of morphed into a more serious story, that was credible, and powerful. Willem Dafoe was his usual masterful self, and played a very real, very likable guy. A tough guy with a heart of gold. I highly recommend this film. Not for everyone. Several people walked out during the film. My presumption was that they either thought the film focused too much time on the kids, or they were living in a state of denial, like so many Americans these days, pretending that this huge underclass does not exist. Regardless, it felt like a story that needed to be told. And it was told very well. Kudos to the filmmakers.",The Florida Project

It's slow especially at the start, and it's overall sad, but in no way does it feel manufactured. It feels like a documentary, or cameras following kids around in the summer, not even realizing the struggle of real life. It reminded me a lot of my youth, and how oblivious I was of my parents struggle to keep a roof over our heads, while I ran around for miles, unwatched and feeling free. Is it Oscar worthy?

The film seems very realistic, and very depressing. And the horrible touristy places around them make it seem even worse! Bria Vinaite is perfect in the role of messed up mom, and Brooklynn Kimberly Prince is amazing as Moonee! When she cries near the end, my old heart nearly split in two! If that little girl did that on command, holey mackerel! In fact, all of the children actors are pretty awesome! And Willem Dafoe is good too!

81,CineMuseFilms,a montage of moments in the pitiful ordinariness of living in poverty.,7,5 January 2018,"How you see The Florida Project (2017) depends entirely on the lens you use. There are several options: it could be seen as a drama about a precocious free-range six-year old living on the edge of squalor; a reality-mockumentary about the gritty texture of life in the shadows of Disneyworld; or a post-GFC critique film that examines what inequality and hopelessness looks like in what is now Trump's America. Of course, it can be all of these at the same time but the one thing it is not, is pleasant to watch.There is no plotline in the traditional sense, rather a montage of moments in the pitiful ordinariness of living in poverty. Instead of a beginning there is an entry point; the middle has no discernible narrative arc; and the final chapter is inconclusive. Six-year old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) lives with her unemployable stoner mum Halley (Bria Vinaite) in the run-down Magic Castle Motel adjacent to Disneyworld. It is temporary accommodation but most of the residents cannot afford to live anywhere else. The manager Bobby Hicks (Willem Dafoe) is a salt-of-the-earth humanitarian, dealing out tough love and genuinely caring for the residents. Moonee makes mischief just to watch grown-ups react: she is bright, funny, adventurous and likes junk food. The constantly slurred Halley struggles to provide food and shelter while Bobby tries to protect his wards from themselves. The trio are the human anchor points around a series of everyday happenings that are trivial, except that Halley's inability to pay the rent inevitably leads her to renting her body and stealing, and state child welfare authorities intervene.In many ways, the characters and events are not the point of this film. While the three actors excel in their roles, their performances feel like cameo roles or avatars for an underclass of people denied a fair share of their nation's wealth. 'The Florida Project' was the name given to the massive commercial development that became Disneyworld, and using it for the film title is a metaphor for unfinished work. These Disney neighbours have no hope of paying for a ticket inside. The helicopters landing and taking off all day bring the incessant flow of wealthy tourists dropping in for fun but never seeing what lies just outside the lavish gates of this capitalist paradise. Viewers see it all through Moonee's eyes, with camera angles at her height looking up at a world that offers her so little, expecting her to remain dispossessed.Hardly entertainment, this is a deliberately disturbing film. Some commentators describe it as beautiful. It may be so only in the sense that an as yet uncrushed daffodil on a battlefield can provide aesthetic relief from what is ugly. Despite its joyless offering, young Brooklynn Prince shines a warm light into a dark place and Willem Defoe gives a quiet portrayal of unacknowledged heroism. Several viewers walked out of my cinema and it is obvious why. I'm glad I stayed, but the memory is far from sweet.",The Florida Project

What were they thinking while making this film?
There is nothing happening throughout the film. This torture could have been cut down to a 10 minute short film and yet it would have been so boring.

83,MovieCriticOnline,Cool movie with flaws,7,31 December 2017,"Absolutely LOVED the kids in the film, especially Moonee. Willem was great too. The newcomer Bria over did everything and wasn't very likable and I think majority of the stuff she said and did wasn't believable. I just don't buy anyone would behave that way, i.e. always making things worse when she is trying to survive. She would have been more flirty and manipulative to get by, not fight, argue and curse everyone out that could help her, or worse, could hurt her. That just made no sense and took away from what could have been a much better film. If you are basically on the verge of homelessness you don't fight and curse out the people that could potentially help you. And not just once, but over and over again. I hate characters that just have ZERO self-preservation, like when CPS shows up, she behaves like THE WORST mother ever. Made no sense. One thing that didn't make much sense either was Willem not liking them in the beginning and really wanted to evict them, but then all of a sudden (without a specific event) started to stick up for them.I think the problem with people thinking we should just improv to make it more ""realistic"" don't realize that improv can be as bad as bad acting. This is prominent in the scene where Bria gives Dafoe her late rent and then spat over it. The script (you should read it btw) is short, but then they just added improv and it can be seen as they almost break the line when they start to laugh, but keep going. There are other points where you can tell it wasn't ""real.""It's like the fake pranks online that are so badly acted it takes away form the realism. Or Curb Your Enthusiasm, where a lot of the actors over acts the improv.It really doesn't matter if you are doing scripted or improv work. At the end of the day, it is either believable or not believable. For the most part it was believable, except Bria and the other girl Mela playing Ashley (although better than Bria). The failure is part of the director not to do a better job of getting better (more believable) performances.I did enjoy it and loved the 80-90% realism. Best scenes were with the kids doing their daily adventures.I think the film could have been better by cutting about 30 minutes out, especially a lot of the repeated stuff. Over all very good film, but could have been great if some of the things had been fixed.Like others have pointed out nothing much happens for about 1:40 minutes, and then the predicted ending, totally resulting from Bria's actions over and over and over again. It would have been more sympathetic if she would have acted with the NORMAL mother behavior throughout the film and in spite of that someone called the CPS. The prostitution was fine. It was her interactions with others that drove me nuts. No one would do that to themselves or their daughter.So yes the ending was SAD but I only felt for Moonee, not Bria, as she totally unnecessarily created that situation. And how on Earth did Moonee just run away form the CPS worker?So yes it was emotional (espcially the end), but I wish it didn't have some of the issues I pointed out. But for those who didn't get the ending, it was all in Moonee's imagination, the same way she went on a ""safari"" with Jancey and imagined her own place at the abandoned buildings.In summary, read the actual script and the intentions in there, and you'll see a lot of it never came across in the film, like Dafoe on the verge of losing his job.But despite all the issues, I still fell in love with the kids and their lives so I would highly recommend it.",The Florida Project
84,WhimsicalVonia,Worth it Simply for that Rainbow,8,21 April 2018,"The Florida Project (2017) 
Director: Sean Baker 
Watched: April 2018 
8/10 I was skeptical. ""Tangerine"" was good but not awing. Watching this seemed to be asking for a depressing couple hours. I should have known, based on Baker's work, that he also balances it with love and redemption. His work is never maudlin, always raw and honest. He does his research and it shows. Cinematography was key here. 35 mm. Open shots, wide shots, almost Tatami shots to start with the children point of view. Natural lighting. Bright colors. Soft background. Plenty of nature use. And that rainbow they captured over the motel? Amazing. I would wonder what they did to get that, but I would guess it was a good eye, good timing, and some Magic Castle luck. As per Baker's style, aside from DaFoe, all little known actors and actresses. Impressive performances for the most part. Not a fan of Vinaite, although the verdict might still be out on that. All I can say is that I hope she is a really good actress that wanted to seem like she was overacting-yelling-total-nightmare-everything-is-a-production because that was the character. She recklessly does whatever she wants- larceny, prostituting, soliciting; its wrongness compounded by the fact that she does it with Moonee, sometimes even involving her. When things do not go her way, she whines, throws a tantrum, or uses violence, verbal abuse, or a panoply of other creatively explicit actions to express her hatred towards the world, selfishly disregarding anyone else. The effect was far more distracting than effective in the film's flow. One can empathize with most all the characters aside from her, since she seems set in her ways and refuses to listen to reason- despite the negative effect it has on her daughter. Free ice cream via soliciting patrons with their cute kid faces. Where do they get it from? Accompanying unemployed mother, reselling wholesale perfume by soliciting a nearby hotel. Then running from the golf cart security guard. Playing house in abandoned buildings, then lighting a pillow in the fireplace, burning the place down. Bread bags from the donation service that comes around to the motel. Peeking out through the motel's crenellations to see Gloria's breasts as she glorifies herself at the pool. Playing bath games with bubbles, ""Orlando's favorite station"" abominably loud on the radio as her mother prostitutes in order to afford the room. Like many kids not yet wearied by harsh realities, Moonee sees not only figurative but literal beauty, like the uprooted tree they have a picnic on, something growing even though it has been uprooted. A symbolic meaning here, for is this not what all the characters, what many of us all aspire to do? To prosper and succeed, despite being uprooted? To wake up smiling, despite the obstacles inherent in life? Poor DaFoe as he tries to balance these kids (essentially acting as the father to some of them), their parents, and managing the motel under the (rarely present) owner. What does this entail? Everything the more wealthy turn a blind eye to. Trying to minimize prostitution, keeping an eye out for pedophiles on the property, covering up nudity by the pool, supervising characters that tend to default to violence. All this drama that almost seems pitiable- in addition to the usual cleaning, maintenance, scheduling, researching competition, diplomacy with the clientele- although of course this looks very different for a $35 a night motel than for a couple hundred dollar resort. This brings me to my favorite scene, the most indicative of the aforementioned socioeconomic discrepancy. A wealthy (spoiled) Brazilian couple accidentally books a room at what they thought would be a fabulous night at The Magic Castle- although one less ironically named. As the husband frantically tries to get the taxi driver to wait for them and clear up the misunderstanding, his wife seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Or about to throw a tantrum. Moonee says ones of the most adorable, yet telling things here: ""She's about to cry. I can always tell when adults are about to cry."" Adorable because she says it as if she has a superpower- then again, maybe the ability to look from outside the box when psychological insight is indeed something to be reckoned. I hate to admit this, but I have spent some time living in motels in a couple different cities, and it so happens that one of those cities was Orlando. Sean Baker and his team have this subculture down pat. This film eloquently explores the harsh realities of poverty, motel living, and its most unfortunate victims- the children. With imagination and the tenacity to look at the bright side, Moonee and friends have managed to survive, even flourish in some ways. For all her maturity and sophisticated understanding, she is either in denial or misses the gravity of her situation. The penultimate scene shows The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) arriving at the purple motel to take Moonee to her new foster family (Halley finally experiences some karma, since they were notified by her once friend Ashley, a neighbor she pummeled after Ashley prevented her son from seeing Moonee anymore as a consequence of their adventure at the abandoned condos; Ashley also made an unwelcome comment regarding how public Halley's prostitution was.) 
 
The ending? Sean Baker is a genius. To see Moonee cry at the end, her tough kid exterior finally stripped away. She is a little girl again. Phenomenal. And as best friend Jaycee knows, what better way to take away those tears than the He managed to strike a balance of sentimental and sweet without being overly saccharine. Yes, it requires some suspension of disbelief for viewers- since it is not possible to simply run into Disney from the outside like that- but the result was effective enough to overlook this. To be honest, it lends itself to a little magical realism, something to be appreciated rather than criticized. The credits roll. With background accompaniment. I call it ""The Sounds of Disneyland"", what seems to be a recording of exactly that, taken in a quiet(er) little area, away from the main walkways and rides, where you might hear a myriad of muted excited conversations and the band off in the distance).

87,emuir-1,The other side of the Magic Kingdom,10,9 August 2020,"One of the most unforgettable and disturbing films I have ever seen, and which I consider on a par with City of God. It shows the reality of the forgotten dwellers in the welfare motels adjacent to the 'happiest place on earth'. A place far beyond their ability to afford to visit.On first viewing I wanted to slap the annoying little foul mouthed brats, but then I came to understand that it was all they knew, and they were trapped in a repeating cycle of poverty and would eventually become clones of their dysfunctional parent (most had only one parent). I watched a second time as my perspective often changes on second viewing. This time I saw it less from the dysfunctional adults point of view than through the eyes of the children who did not see the despair around them, rather through the magic vision of childhood, the summer holidays with endless days to have fun in the purple painted Magic Castle motel. The bright colors of all the buildings along the trashy US 192, exploring the unknown and getting into mischief. Begging for ice creams, selling knock off perfumes to unsuspecting buyers, scamming Disney Park passes, eating pizza in bed, cadging free food at the diner, was all fun to them. Where they had annoyed me on first viewing, their rudeness and bad language was now understandable as it was all they knew. They did not see that the motel rooms had no kitchens and cooking was not allowed, even though like many of the broken rules. They lived on pizza, take outs, and meals from the diner. Selling knock off perfumes and cadging was a way to survive.The manager, who is probably not paid more than the minimum wage (this is Florida after all) has to cope with tenants behind on the rent who also flout the rules, bedbugs, broken appliances, brawls, the police and welfare folks, single mothers 'entertaining' men in their rooms while their children are shut in the bathroom. His boss, Mr. Marek, is an Asian owner who appears to be trying to upgrade the place and encourage tourists.Many of the people living in flea bag motels are technically homeless and cannot get a decent job as they have no permanent address and likely have a police record and bad credit, which prevents them from renting a decent home or apartment. Likewise they cannot vote, get a driving license or open a bank account. I have lived adjacent to an I-4 off ramp and have have seen many people arriving from the northern states with their children and all their possessions in a clapped out old car, hoping for better prospects in Florida where it is warmer. They end up existing day by day as Florida wages are too low. Most Americans are said to be one pay check from disaster, the people in the welfare motels are one day from disaster.Many reviewers have criticized it for the lack of a plot. Why did it need a plot? Real life day by day doesn't have a plot - it just goes on. A 'plot' would have been contrived and artificial. What did they want - a murder? The possible pedophile snatching a child and eventually apprehended after a fast car chase and shoot out down US 192? This was not an action drama. It was more like some of the slow moving Japanese and Chinese films about human relationships I have enjoyed, such as ""King of Masks"". My only complaint was that sometimes the children, albeit old beyond their ears, did not speak as children would. One example, when Halley referred to being able to tell when adults are about to cry, a child would have called them grown ups.

89,kaptenvideo-89875,Almost two hours of colorful nothing special,6,10 March 2018,"I read a lot of children's books when I was young, and one that has stuck to memory even many years later is by this Estonian author, Iko Maran, titled ""Pikk päev"" (""The Long Day"").It tells about one day in childrens' lives who spend it at their summer home with grandparents and parents.One of the central messages of ""Pikk päev"" is to illustrate that time seems to move slower for a child, and seems to speed up considerably for adults. Just one day can seemingly stretch to forever and contain so many activities and adventures.Here comes the movie which could be called American (mostly white) trash version of Marans's children's book. The central characters are children who live in two motels, and just hang around, trying to find something fun to do which usually involve annoying adults, especially the manager of one motel (Willem Dafoe).As their parents and their friends are far from model citizens, the children - mostly two girls and a boy - shout and curse a lot, never back down from mischief if it promises to bring some fun, or just gladly help the parent do something legally or ethically questionable.Come to think of it, a description such as this easily fits probably most children regardless of the background and social status. But this environment they inhabit is surely a colorful place to witness for couple of hours, especially portrayed as believably as in here.""The Florida Project"" is a social commentary in the form of fast-moving and often fun movie but first and foremost, I would say it's a modern ghetto movie - albeit with much less violence.The characters belong to this enclave or separate bubble of ""real world"" that doesn't have that much contact with society at large.Each day is either celebration of life and/or fight for survival, people don't much care - or even know - about what is considered ethical or acceptable among other parts of society. The life is not easy enough to spend energy thinking about what's good or right, or what the others think.And for children, often left untended by parents, life can be like one day seemingly stretching out to forever. As the story takes place during the summer, there's not even school to consider with.""The Florida Project"" is certainly a movie dealing with important topics, and as a bonus, can both entertain and make one think, but there's one major thing that bugged me for most of the time watching it.The authors have prioritized depicting this (way of) life as realistically as possible but care much less about showing something, you know, interesting.Most of the time nothing really important happens, just hanging around, begging the question: does it really have to last nearly two hours? The movie could easily be 30 minutes shorter, and the viewer would still get everything there is to experience.Maybe it's just me, annoyed by the fact that every movie needs to be last something close to two hours these days, even if the amount of meaningful content is (much) smaller.But watching ""Florida"", this nagging feeling of emptiness became a problem. The scenes are cool individually but they don't really add up or lead to anything intense. At least there's something coming in the end, so the long period of doing little can be justified as preparing for it.It could be argued that ""Florida"" is a state of the mind movie, concentrating on someone's psychological side, so the lack of ""interesting"" events is not necessarily a minus.But there are no particularly interesting or deep characters here. The most intriguing thing is how they live (at least for those who don't share it), and what happens to them, not what they think about stuff or which state of mind they live in.Having said that, acting is mostly, so the colorful motel people doesn't disappoint. The mostly inexperienced lead actors feel natural in their roles, if not particularly expressive.There are also some known good actors around, mainly Willem Dafoe, who was nominated for supporting actor Golden Globe and Oscar for the role, losing on both counts to Sam Rockwell (""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"").I think that Rockwell truly deserved the awards, but it's kind of sad that veteran such as Dafoe is usually ignored by Oscars. Although the man is a great actor, his previous nominations came in 1987 and 2002, and he didn't win then either.So, ""The Florida Project"" has something to offer. But there are at least two similar, better movies that come to mind, offering similar experience.One is also 2017's ""Lady Bird"", masterful at depicting a young person's life in small moments, giving a lot of meaning to what could be called just an ordinary life. And the other one is 2009's ""Fish Tank"", with not-yet-famous Michael Fassbender, showing the ""white trash"" existence in UK.",The Florida Project
90,jb_campo,Pretty terrible. Don't trust the reviews,3,3 February 2019,"The Florida Project is a hard movie to watch. Not because of the toughness, but because the movie just is terrible.The characters are all struggling to survive in low-income lives. OK. I see that. I see how rich people fly into Disney World on helicopters while you live in this crappy 2-bit hotel. While the acting is ok, the story lacks any depth. The day in, day out drag of life just drags this film into oblivion. Nothing happens in this story. Absolutely nothing.The kids are hard to watch as they just get taught to behave like little brats, destroy, steal, spit, curse. But this just goes on and on and on day after day, till you just say, is anything going to happen in this story? Nope, nothing happens.I'm amazed this poor story won any awards. I found it extremely boring, fast-forwarding thru much of it because nothing happens.Suggest the producers do better review of screenplays before producing messes like Florida Project. Even the well-respected Willem Dafoe could do nothing to save this terrible movie.",The Florida Project
91,dommercaldi,A Beautiful Take on Childhood Innocence,9,14 April 2020,"Pros:
1. The movie is shot wondrously and the bright colour palette mirrors the liveliness of the Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) and her friends.
2. Willem Dafoe (Bobby), Bria Vinaite (Halley), and Brooklynn Prince all deliver phenomenal performances.
3. The chemistry between Brooklynn Prince, Christopher Rivera (Scooty), and Valeria Cotto (Jancey) is truly what carries this film.
4. The interactions between all of the characters all feel incredibly real and grounded. Especially the child interactions of who are all blissfully innocent of their circumstances.
5. The humour is inserted sporadically via the everyday events and activities and how the characters respond to them. It works greatly.
6. The movie provides intelligently woven social commentary on how people on the periphery of society live, and what they do to cope with it.
7. All of the characters are either likable, interesting, or at the very least they are sympathetic.
8. The ending is gut-wrenching and sad, whilst also being heart-warming and magical, as Jancey and Moonee run away to Disneyland.
9. The different sub-plots throughout the film are stitched together amazingly, and they never overshadow each other.Cons:
1. The lack of a structured plot means that the movie starts to feel a little repetitive towards the end.",The Florida Project
92,trublu215,DaFoe is utterly brilliant but the film leaves much to be desired.,5,14 September 2017,"The Florida Project is the third feature film from writer-director Sean Baker and, while being an improvement over Tangerine and Starlet, The Florida Project is still missing the heart it needs to be an everlasting and impactful film. From his cinematic conception, Baker has had a knack for showing very dingy lifestyles bursting with a color palate that would make George Miller weep. But underneath the colorful array that he includes is a superficial mess of a film. One that thinks it is smarter and more heartfelt than it really is. Telling the story of a young girl living in a by-the-hour motel ran by a seedy motel manager (Willem DaFoe) with a heart of gold and having a drug abusing, prostitute mother doesn't exactly translate to feel good. The young girl decides to let her imagination take wind and shield her from the harsh realities of life. While this sounds like it should hit hard, it doesn't. Not even a little bit. The problem that Sean Baker has in all of his films is his characters. All of them are begging for sympathy when sympathy is the last thing they deserve. While I think the young girl, Moonee, deserves our sympathies, no one else does. Every one in this film has gotten themselves here by their own doing and Baker tries desperately to make us feel for them. It may work on some audiences but it was wasted on me.Overall, this feels like a cheap grindhouse drama that really doesn't do any favors to the actors. The cinematography in the film is top notch and definitely shows that Baker has a visual eye but, as with his previous 2 films, the story is severely lacking. While I definitely think Baker has talent, it doesn't lie within his original stories. For those of you who enjoyed Baker's Tangerine or Starlet, give this a shot. Anyone else, you might want to skip it.",The Florida Project
93,dallasryan,The Florida Masterpiece,10,12 June 2018,"A harsh reality look at lower class, and poverty beautifully super charged into this fine film which plays out like a documentary masterpiece. The performances are so raw and engaging, it's incredible to learn that the mom played by Bria Vinaite was discovered off of Instagram and this was her first acting gig! And she's amazing in this film! I can understand why the director cast her. She has an authentic quality and swag about her that only a non actor could bring to the character. Not even a Meryl Streep could have pulled off Bria's role without it looking like 'acting.'There's an authenticity to all of the characters in this film. Willem Dafoe is at his finest and has a brilliant scene in the film where he shows a man where he can buy a beverage (without spoiling anything). A fantastic film, and one in which we can all identify with in some way as we all know people like this in the film. The Florida Project should have been nominated for a lot more awards.

96,thenolanfan,Review - The Florida Project,6,22 June 2021,"Most of the time, when a film directed by a capable person disappoints me, it is because the directing doesn't suit the statement or the screenplay.It is exactly the problem there. The Florida Project isn't a film complaining about the human condition in an unoriginal way, and I can't deny that it goes to great lengths narratively to put itself on the level of Moone. Although, I wonder why the film needed to create an aesthetical, with the uses of colors and lenses similar, that replicates what you see on Instagram. It worked beautifully by itself but, it had no reason to exist in such a film. Does a child see the world true an iPhone 6? I doubt it. I don't talk about the ending since I would have to spoil the film, but with the same idea, I disliked it.Anyway, those are my main complaints about the film, and they are major ones. Otherwise, I appreciated the performances. Willem Dafoe's performance is unsurprisingly excellent in this film. But Brooklyn Prince is the true revelation, her performance for her age was great. Even if, at times, she was slightly overplaying, the hyperactivity of her character didn't strike me as being unrealistic.",The Florida Project
97,darkreignn,"The wonder of childhood, the hardship of adulthood",6,12 March 2021,"""The Florida Project"" is at once uplifting and heartbreaking - depicting adults living in poverty surrounded by children who don't know any better makes for an extremely uncomfortable viewing experience. However, because the majority of the film focuses on children, there is a sense of childlike bewilderment to the goings-on that is genuinely charming to watch. That said, as an adult watching this movie who recognized the horrible situation the children were in, as well as the mostly horrible adults who surrounded them, I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel stressed out for the majority of this film.""The Florida Project"" depicts the hardship of adulthood through the eyes of children who are not yet old enough to recognize the awfulness of their living conditions. Brooklynn Prince plays Moonee, and the film largely focuses on her relationship with her groups of friends, and with her mother, Halley, played by Bria Vinaite. Her friends and Bria give incredibly perfect and true-to-life performances that feel so realistic you'll almost think you're watching a documentary. And watching Moonee interact with those around her does have that gleeful carelessness you'd expect from a child. She wanders around Florida with her friends eating ice cream and harassing strangers, and she plays with her mother, engaging in tickle fights, impromptu photo shoots, and dancing outside in the rain. From the outside looking in, you'd think that everything was peaches and cream.Where ""The Florida Project"" differs, and why it was so uncomfortable for me to watch, is because every child in this movie is surrounded by adults who are failing them. Moonee's mother leaves Moonee mostly unattended, allowing her to stray far from the motel where they live. Because of that, Moonee gets in situations where you can easily see something going horribly wrong. Additionally, practically every adult in this movie is, arguably, unfit to be a parent. Yes, you can tell that Moonee's mother loves her, but she literally never stops putting Moonee in situations and environments that have a possibility to cause serious harm to her child. Whether she is inviting strangers over while Moonee is taking a bath, smoking a blunt in front of and in the same room as her child, cursing in front of children, or otherwise doing things that any reasonable adult wouldn't do around kids, watching adults engage in this type of behavior around children is genuinely unnerving, and I was teetering on the edge of anxiety during the entire movie, expecting something bad to happen.The movie looks good visually, with a really delightful color palate to it. It's directed very well, and the cinematography is gorgeous - there are some genuinely fantastic shots here, notably a scene where Williem Dafoe smokes outside, and another part where Moonee and her friend are watching fireworks. So, at the least, the movie is aesthetically pleasing, which does lessen the impact of the poor environments the children are living in, and makes the film engaging to watch. I also appreciated the slice of life style of the film, even though I do think the movie went on for a touch too long - there are many repetitive scenes that, while they were not necessarily boring, were not necessary to the overall whole of the film. A shorter running time would've probably made the experience stronger.That said, I did not enjoy the ending of this movie, or more specifically, the final 30 seconds. I will obviously not spoil what happens, but I went from a feeling of genuine emotion to utter confusion so quickly that I'm surprised I didn't get whiplash. I understand what happened in the ending, and I get the point the filmmakers were going for, but what happened before the ending was so packed of emotion and so riveting that, for me personally, the final 30 seconds completely ripped me out of the film and left me shocked, and not in a good way.This is about the strongest 6 out of 10 I can possibly give. ""The Florida Project"" looks great, and has acting so good that you'll be glued to the screen. However, watching children living in such horrible conditions, surrounded by horrible adults, didn't lend itself to an enjoyable experience for me personally, and the ridiculous ending left me underwhelmed and unsatisfied.",The Florida Project
98,Aly200,A Touching Look at Childhood and the Complications of Life,7,16 November 2017,"From acclaimed indie director Sean Baker comes this beautifully crafted tale of a little girl, Moonee (Brooklyn Prince), living with her deadbeat mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite) in a Florida motel, the Magic Castle, run by the kindhearted yet grumpy Bobby (Willem Dafoe) and her adventures with her young friends throughout the Floridian backdrop.Many viewers will complain that the film has no real plot, but that's the point of the narrative as the film details the day to day life of the residents of the motel. Right away director Sean Baker throws us into the daily mischief that Moonee and her friends, Dickie (Caleb Landry Jones) and Scooty (Christopher Rivera), get into like spitting on cars, begging for food at a local diner that Scooty's mother, Ashley, works at in order to help Moonee and Halley eat each day, enjoying ice cream and running about pestering the motel residents; especially Bobby and any tourists that happen to stop by. We also get to watch Moonee and her mother perform illegal sales of perfumes (procured legally from a resale shop) at local country clubs and the allusion to Halley performing other illegal activities to support herself and her little daughter which are revealed at the film's end. Baker's film is a harsh look into the poverty of everyday people particularly when the film focuses on Moonee and Halley's exploits.Baker chooses his cast extremely well particularly with Brooklyn Prince as little Moonee. The unknown child star at the heart of the narrative is just like any normal six year old except for her vulgar mouth (learned from her mother) and bad behavior like the aforementioned illegal perfume sales. Moonee is still a sympathetic child as we see how desperate her living situation is and how neglectful her mother, Halley, is which allows the little girl to engage in her disruptive behavior. Little Prince has a wonderful chemistry with all the other child actors and even the relationships with the adults are believable particularly in Moonee's tenuous interactions with Willem Dafoe's Bobby who is the only adult willing to protect her when her mother doesn't bother to correct Moonee's antics. The most heartbreaking moment from Miss Prince comes during the heartbreaking climax when Moonee is faced with being taken away from her mother and decides to run away with her naïve young friend, Jancey (Valeria Cotto), to nearby Disney; the moment Moonee begins to cry makes you want to just hug the poor little girl and help confront her reality.The film's other standout performance is of course from the wonderful Willem Dafoe as Bobby, the Magic Castle's overwhelmed manager. Still one of the most respected character actors since breaking out in the 1980s, Dafoe provides one of his best performances of the recent decade. Portraying a man who obviously has his own troubles, Dafoe imbues Bobby with a kindhearted personality who looks out for the young children (Moonee, Jancey, Dickie and Scooty) despite all the trouble the kids cause and he even cares for Moonee's mother, Halley, though she is vulgar and rude to him; the script alludes to Bobby being divorced as his son helps him out with repairs round the Magic Castle. Bobby is even an unlikely hero demonstrated in him scaring off a local vagrant who has a history of inappropriate contact with minors and though his everyday tasks of keeping life as normal as can be for the residents of the motel.The cinematography is breathtaking from the blue skies and sunshine to the famous Florida rainstorms, gorgeous sunsets, fireworks in pitch dark night to the colors of pink (the prominent color of the nearby Futureland Inn)and purple (the Magic Castle's primary color) and the overall local landmarks of Florida. The camera-work is a bit dizzying as director Sean Baker shot his breakout film 'Tangerine' on his iPhone and that is also true of this film where several shots are hand-held, but there is enough Steadicam to keep your head still.This indie gem will definitely become a classic in its own right.",The Florida Project
99,austin0731,A beautiful film about the experiences of childhood,9,29 January 2018,"The Florida Project stars Willem Dafoe, Bria Vinaite and Brooklynn Prince in a stunning indie about life on the poverty line and deals with themes of innocence and injustice. The theme of innocence and a coming of age can be observed in the way in which the film establishes a subtle tone and quiet musical notes that follow through the entirety of the film creating a dreamlike sense that reflects both the innocence of childhood and the sense of darkness.What exactly do I mean by the sense of childlike innocence and the sense of darkness? Well I think the film does a great job establishing the contrast between the mother and child characters, the child: Mooney representing an innocence in coping with the world she lives in and her mother's alcohol and drug use symbolizing the self paralyzation that pushes her through life. The big 'irony' of the film is of course also a very fascinating exploration as we realize that the 'magic castle' in which our characters reside in is just off the corner of Disneyworld, dubbed the happiest place on Earth. There is a bitter sentiment to that idea and I believe stands to symbolize the sense of joy that Mooney still manages to possess in spite living in poor conditions and being oblivious of certain truths that surround her.At the end of the day, The Florida Project had brilliant acting from all the actors, Willem Dafoe who conveys a character of his own conflictions, but expressed through warmth and cold. From scene to scene he can swiftly maneuver through his warm tone to bitter and harsh, a great portrayal. As of the other two leads, Vinante and Prince I think also did a fascinating job, they convey the sense of realism to great lengths and were genuine and authentic throughout the entire film.",The Florida Project

His upkeep of the bright pink motel creates some majestic shots of Floridian skylines, creating one of the most unique cinematic backdrop I have seen for years.The mother-daughter duo of Moonee and Halley are the centre, living lives that are both monotonous and totally alien; mood swings and foul language are rife throughout, all lending to this insane - but also completely human - story.",The Florida Project
101,Lewis_Heather787,Great directing and one good performance but not much else!,7,30 December 2017,"This film overall was a little disappointing considering the Oscar buzz that this film is getting, I was expecting a lot more than I got. That is not to say that this film is terrible, its fine erm......good in places but not very memorable. There are two areas that the film is strongest in, Firstly the directing by Sean Baker which is fantastic considering the circumstances of the location. Now I could be completely wrong here but I'm positive I watched an interview with Willem Dafoe where he said they shot the film in a real motel. He continued to say that there were people living in the motel whilst they shot the film, going about their day to day lives. That is an extremely ballsy thing to do because anything could happen whilst filming is taking place. If this is true that is amazing and shows the authenticity that Sean Baker was looking for in the motel setting because thats where all of the film takes place. Anyway his directing overall is brilliant throughout, there are some really nice wide panning shots following the kids on their ""adventures"". As well as some interesting ""hand held"" camera work that is lower to the ground to make us believe we are there on the journey with everyone. Really nicely done. Oh.....just forgot to add.......there is an interesting element to the film which is the location of the motel outside Disneyland. Its as if they are the opposite sides of the same coin in a strange way, quite interesting??Willem Dafoe is a great actor, I'm pretty sure that everyone one can agree on that, and in this film he is no different. He is brilliant in the role as the manager of the motel, going about his day to day routine and making sure that people are ok. Its a great performance that I think everyone can gravitate towards because of his generosity and care for the motel. Unfortunately thats about it for all the good elements in the film, yeah following the kids around the motel is funny at times especially when they set an abandoned house on fire. Apart from that the rest of the film is just fine or a bit boring, mainly due to not being able to connect with the character of Halley. It is essential that you are able to connect with her story and situation otherwise, like me, you don't care at all. In the end your happy that they take her kid away from her because she is horrible throughout the film. There is however one piece of constructive criticism that I will give the film without just trashing it and moaning. I wish that we had more time and focus put onto Willem Dafoe's character, yes what we got was great but I was left wanting more. This is especially considering that the other characters and story lines weren't as interesting as following him around. Take out some of the kids and single mom stuff and maybe add in a bit more Willem Dafoe. That might just be me, oh well.Overall the film is ok........nah actually good 70% out of 100 the directing of the film is probably the biggest strength with Willem Dafoe's performance close behind, however I was left wanting more form his character. I'll probably never watch this again I was expecting a lot more than I got, which is unfortunate considering the amazing response to the film. Its worth a watch but don't rush out and see it!",The Florida Project
102,treywillwest,nope,9,23 October 2017,"Beautifully humane film that at times recalls Italian Neo-Realism, at other times the child-based films that are so popular in Iran. That it was made in the USA, with a real if humble budget, seems surprising and is a testament to the commitment of the filmmakers. Subtly going back and forth between the perspectives of the child and adult characters, the film has, at times, an almost magical realist vibe, though nothing remotely supernatural or surreal transpires. Indeed, this is a film steeped in harsh reality, but also one that captures the almost mystical sense of discovering life on the part of the children and sometimes, momentarily at least, even the adults. On the other hand, the film also offers a very visceral sense of the stress of trying to survive amidst the scarcity of the margins of American capitalism. The acting is incredible, all the more so given that, with the very notable exception of Willem Dafoe, the performers are all either non- actors or unknowns.",The Florida Project

Overall it was an impressive film.The premise of the movie is simple, but very relevant. It explores the concept of poverty through the lens of a young child and her group of friends in Orlando Florida. The movie does a great job portraying the difficulties faced by those living in poverty while attempting to get by. You really felt for the families and the hardships they have to face throughout the movie. The characters were depicted in a very realistic manner and we're not simple caricatures of poverty.The director did a great job with this film. It was shot in a simple manner that made it feel like a documentary. On top of that the movie made excellent use of its location of Orlando Florida to immerse the audience. These factors made a very realistic viewing experience.Acting wise the movie was solid all-around. Willem Dafoe was great but that's to be expected. The real stars of this movie though are the children actors. All are quite young and most have no other screen credits to speak of. The raw acting abilities of these children was outstanding. The children's dialogue felt real and was delivered perfectly. The movie did have a rather ambiguous ending, but that didn't bother me much. The film is also on the slower side, but again it doesn't take away from the film. I certainly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a unique but realistic depiction of childhood poverty, a 8.5 out of 10.",The Florida Project

Brilliant performances from Brooklynn Prince and Willem Defoe bring you along for the ride while Bria Vinaite, though not a natural actress, brings so much flair and attitude, you can't help but sit back and wish more films would have this uncanny combination of reality and fantasy. Every character carries with them a naturalness, reminding us of people we have all encountered in our lives. A big step up from the commendable ""Tangerine,"" writer/director Sean Baker gives the viewer the sense they are walking among the characters; every heartbreak, every cheap thrill, every smile, every tear becomes part of the experience.

I tried to hold on and wait to see if there was a point to all this but I couldn't keep watching, half an hour and I didn't enjoying it a bit.
Well, I liked the photography to certain point, but definitely not enough to watch the whole thing. Maybe I will be missing a good story development, but half an hour hating the movie is too much to continue watching.
At least, a really bad 30 initial minutes. Cant judge the rest of the movie.EDIT: After writing this review, I've read more reviews to see what's the general feeling, and I got curious about the ending. Terribly filmed, not great at all in content. Glad I skipped the hour and quarter. I would lower the rating now, but I've already wasted enough time on this movie.",The Florida Project
109,ccorral419,Films abrupt ending says it all...,5,2 January 2018,"Director Sean Baker, known for his gritty look at society and/or the down and out, brings yet another such film to the big screen. This time, the characters live in a gaudy purple motel just blocks for the glamour of Disneyland. Moone (Brooklyn Prince - ""Robot-Dog, Airborne"") is a tough, foul-mouthed kid who is as carefree, careless and as rebellious as her mother (Bria Vinaite - ""The Beach Bum"" - 2018). When the cats away, the mice will play, and both continually push the limits of respectable human beings and the guardian/child relationship when not in each others presence. Keeping the motel a float is Manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe). While Dafoe is currently up for a Golden Global as Best Actor, with little to do in this role, it's probable safe to say he won't win this time around. The kids (including Prince, Aiden Malik - ""Secrets and Lies,"" Valeria Cotto and Christopher Rivera) carry this weak and wondering story line, and the abrupt ending to the film is proof this film really didn't know what it wanted to be and/or say. Mela Murder and Josie Oliva successful play follow equally stuck motel mom's. Baker has captured the distraught surroundings and lifestyle of his characters, but I needed more to truly care. The only legitimate reason this film is garnering attention is because Dafoe is attached and little Prince, whom I'm guessing was probably improving most of her scenes, pushes the film along. Even if Dafoe wins a Global, I'd recommend waiting for the film to come to DVD or streaming.",The Florida Project

The subject is really interesting, and I would've loved to see a movie do this subject justice. But this was disappointing and ultimately boring.It felt like the direction they were taking this movie was a wannabe-documentary. But without all the real, gritty, interesting parts. And ultimately got me to actually skip through the movie quite a bit. There was just so little substance in this, nothing to think about, or catch on to.Most of the movie is just watching kids wasting their time and walk through some nicely set up shots in front of some visually interesting buildings.I'm having a hard time writing this review, there's too much and also nothing to touch on.

112,WubsTheFadger,The Florida Project,7,7 May 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe Florida Project tells the story of a ""family"" living in the shadow of Disney World. The story is extremely mundane and mainly focuses on the average life of low class citizens. There are a few moments of drama and the end is hard to watch but is justified. I found the characters to be very annoying, except for Defoe's character. All the characters spoke and acted like ""white trash"". They were disrespectful and blamed everyone else for their problems. Even at the end, the ""mother"" blames the DCF officer for being irresponsible even though she was prostituting herself in front of her daughter. I did the find the end very good though.The acting is okay. Willem Defoe clearly performs the best. His character is a relatable man who just wants order but can be very kind. Brooklynn Prince also performs very well. Her acting skills are best displayed at the end. Bria Vinaite plays a very annoying young women who blames the world for her problems. I found her to be despicable. She is the epitome of ""white trash"". And for me, she got what she deserved.The pacing is very slow and the runtime feels overlong.I would not recommend this film to the average moviegoer. If you do enjoy story and character centered film then I would recommend it.Pros: Simple yet interesting story, a good ending, Willem Defoe's great performance, Brooklynn Prince's performance, and how Halley got what she deservedCons: Most of the characters are annoying, Bria Vinaite's ""white trash"" character and how she blames everyone else for her problems, very slow pacing, and an overlong runtime.Overall Rating: 7.0",The Florida Project

114,PotassiumMan,Compelling film about innocence and poverty,7,30 October 2017,"Sean Baker's film about a small group of children who live in a seedy hotel with their impoverished single young mothers near Disneyland doesn't always live up to the hype. It's a solid, but curiously flawed work. It has opening credits that feel like closing credits and the editing is awkward almost from the start. The pacing of the film is not its strong suit; it can seem lackadaisical and sometimes downright aimless, although admittedly that barren backdrop might be in keeping with a film that depicts children growing up with little or no structure. At occasional moments, one might wonder where the film is even going.With all of this being said, however, the film does go on to finish strong. We find out that these are not well-behaved kids early on and their near absolute freedom is derived from the young women who raise them and who have a ways to go in terms of adult responsibility themselves. There is a frequent sense of angst for the children's safety as they reap the benefits of minimal adult supervision and haphazard discipline. Baker's film is about growing up on the fringes of society where fathers have virtually no presence.Performances here are nothing but exceptional. Willem Dafoe is excellent here as the kind but hardened hotel manager who has to balance his sympathy for one of the mothers with his steadfast refusal to tolerate criminal behavior in his establishment. He looks out for the children vigilantly even as they test his patience. Newcomer Bria Vinaite makes an impression as a troubled young woman who will do anything, including engage in prostitution, to provide for her daughter. Although the film ends on a very uncertain note, it is in keeping with a compelling portrait of innocence toddling through a squalid adult world of poverty, crime and despair. Almost anyone one who watches this attentively will compare it to his or her own childhood, no matter how dissimilar. Recommended.",The Florida Project
115,bastille-852-731547,Well-Acted but Somewhat Empty Indie Drama,6,1 October 2017,"I had been looking forward to seeing this new film directed by Sean Baker ever since reading the rave reviews for it that came out of Cannes and Toronto. While I can say that this film is beautifully filmed and features strong acting, it doesn't quite hit the mark. The film is about a poor young girl, raised by a single mother, and her friends who live in a run-down motel close to Disney World near Orlando, Florida. Baker uses a simple and low-key filmmaking style to deliver excellent cinematography. The film has a strong and commanding color palette to its simple aesthetic. The performances on display in this movie are very satisfying for the most part. The child actors do a very good and convincing job, especially given their ages. Williem Dafoe is very good as the manager of the motel, although it would have been better if he had been given more of an emotional range to work with in his role throughout the movie. Unfortunately, the film does have some notable flaws. The tone of the movie is all over the place, with joyous childhood wonder juxtaposed sometimes abruptly with more edgy and mature themes. Such abrupt changes in tone and motif hold back the movie's message to some degree. Some audiences will dislike that the movie is considerably darker than its trailers make it seem, although I was fine with that. The same concern over abrupt changes in tone is also evident in the movie's writing, mixing puerile scatological 'jokes' from the kids with more sophisticated and powerful material. Finally, the film's final scene feels like a cop-out. Without giving anything away, the way it is done also makes one (unfortunately) wonder if it was filmed on impulse, or if the filmmakers ran out of budget.I really wanted to love ""The Florida Project,"" and it's certainly not a bad film, but I just wish it could have been better. 6.5/10",The Florida Project
116,torrascotia,American Honey 2.0,7,24 October 2017,"Willem Dafoe plays a housing complex manager who is trying to maintain order while out of control kids run wild and their parents run wilder. This film is beautifully shot around the Florida area with many backdrops using the local stores which have oversized and frankly bizarre looking designs which incorporate vivid colours and huge cartoon like figures mixed with neon lights which makes the town look like a brought to life cartoon landscape. This has the effect of making the children look like they are in a wonderland and at the same time making the adults who are themselves trapped into childlike behaviour patterns seem unable to break into adulthood proper. There is a strong sense of community within the housing complex however the fragility of some friendships when adults are acting like out of control teens is no surprise. This movie focuses on poor white America, struggling to make ends meet and parents who think nothing of playing explicit rap music on their phones while they bathe their young kids. The effect of this style of parenting is plain to see in how the kids antagonise the adults around them.While we are in no doubt that the main female protagonist loves her daughter who is obviously loving the freedom afforded to her by her mother,but just how long can the kids be allowed to run wild without consequences? I'd say that if you enjoyed American Honey this film is for you. At just under two hours it certainly seems much shorter. Recommended.",The Florida Project
117,babyjaguar,An ethnographic portrait of Motel homelessness,8,13 May 2020,"Although one can applaud the director for artistic effort of showing the resident life of voucher-assisted families, but it's always hard to create an honest insight. What can be taken from this dramatic film is the director's influences and inspirations.Sean Baker, this film's director has said that the ""Little Rascals"" was an inspiration for the characters of Monee, playfully helmed by Brooklynn Prince. It is interesting how Baker took images of the great depression and place them within a 21st century Millennial narrative.Additional performances are the same source in which many other directors have employed. It's shot in a documentary styled manner similar to Walter Salles, like his 1998 film, Central Station, where the director recruited actors from the urban streets.Where as Baker used social media to locate the actors in this film like Bria Vinaite who played Halley and other actors are said to be from actual motel homeless families.",The Florida Project
118,Davalon-Davalon,The Downfall of Western Civilization,2,25 November 2018,"Other than Willem Dafoe's performance and several beautifully intense and moving moments near the end, I cannot recommend a single thing about this film.I am not going to detail the plot as that can be found elsewhere, but in brief this is a story about people living in poverty in a motel near Disney World in Florida. Although Willem Dafoe, as the manager of the motel, makes valiant attempts to help those people in whatever way he can, it is beyond his limited abilities. As such, it is a waste of time to help them, because he ends up not helping them.There is no doubt that the type of people portrayed in this film exist. There was a deeply disturbing undercurrent of reality coursing throughout the entire story. But the problem is, it was hard to care about anyone because they were singularly off-putting. The two main children (""Moony"" and ""Scooty"") are both vulgar, disgusting and completely without any sense of morals. Moony's mother, ""Halley,"" is a stupid, angry, righteous, delusional, pathological lying white trash welfare prostitute. Although she has love for her daughter, her view of reality is so distorted that it would require years of 24/7 therapy before she should be allowed to reenter society. Scooty's mother at least has a job, but both mothers have no compunction whatsoever about leaving their children behind at night so they can go to some cheap resort area and talk trash about men, smoke, and, I assume, try to attract members of the opposite sex.There are vast stretches of the film where it feels we are in a slightly enhanced reality show as we follow Moony, Scooty, and their new friend Jancey as they find ways to get themselves into trouble (burning down a building doesn't seem to be an issue to them). Jancey is the only one who has a sense of right and wrong, but she's overpowered by Moony and Scooty, who rule their tiny universe.And in this universe, they are supposed to ask strangers for money, lick ice cream as if they are performing a sex act, twerk their behinds as if they are professional twerkers, and, as far as Moony goes, have belching contests with Halley.As the movie unfolds, you see that people are living in the paradise of Florida... the glorious weather, the bright, cheerful colors. Everything is big and bright and colorful. And yet... these people's lives are so horribly sad and devoid of the things that most people take for granted that you will find yourself hugging your spouse and/or your children (do NOT take children to see this under ANY circumstances!), and thanking whoever you thank for all that you have.It is easy to see, as you watch this, how America has spiraled into a sinkhole of the haves and the have-nots. As for the children in this film, beautiful children, their lives are ruined forever by the mistakes of their parents and the cycle will go on unbroken.There are many problems with this film, but the main one is: Halley never has a moment of redemption or realization. She remains the extremely foul-mouthed, self-centered mess we meet at the beginning. She doesn't seem to learn anything at all. Near the end, where she is screaming bloody murder at child care services staff, she keeps telling them to ""get off my property!"" -- but she doesn't have any property for them to get off of! She's a squatter at a hotel expecting people to pay her three times the amount she pays for some stupid cheap perfume, and if they don't, then she begs for money. It apparently never enters her mind that she should get a job and take care of her child. No, she'd rather have her own child take borderline pornographic pictures of her, post them somewhere, then turn tricks in her hotel room while her child is in the bathroom, forced to take a bath!I understand the director wants to make a point about all that's gone wrong with America in this microcosm of hell in Florida. On the other hand, it was one thousand percent wrong what he did to these children. And for him to quote ""Our Gang"" as an inspiration! What an insult! Yes, ""Our Gang"" involved a group of unsupervised children getting into mischief, but it was funny. It didn't involve spitting on cars, ""kissing"" ice cream, twerking and sitting by while their own POS parents got stoned.Three more points:-There was some apparent subplot hinted at when Willem Dafoe and his friend/son/stepson/employee (?) tried to get an ice machine into an elevator. The subplot went nowhere.-The ""child molester"" scene. The poor man pressed into service to play this role was a pathetic old man. I really felt sorry for him. While it's great that Willem sensed that this old man was going to be trouble, the scene felt shoehorned in, and served no purpose other than to show (once again) that Willem cared (too much) about the people living (illegally) at the hotel.-When Halley brutally, brutally beats Scooty's mom, the camera shoots the scene from behind Scooty as he sits in silence and watches. He doesn't shout out ""Mom!"" He doesn't try to stop Halley. He watches it as if it were some game on a video screen. If this was the point the director was trying to make, how we have all become numb to everything, he succeeded; if not, then he failed, because a child will instinctually try to protect its own parent if the parent is being attacked.As for the end: as others have pointed out, the movie ends abruptly and its conclusion is wholly unsatisfactory. My husband and I left the theater with a bad taste in our mouths. I cannot on any level recommend this film and I think those people that critically praised it were hoodwinked by a tragic rambling mess that is a step above a reality show.",The Florida Project
119,ReganRebecca,Haven't been let down by Baker yet,8,5 February 2018,"I've really enjoyed every single Sean Baker film I've seen and The Florida Project is no exception. Set in Florida, the film takes place in the slums around Disney World where the cheap motels shelter families who can scrape up just enough cash to not be homeless. One of these families is Moonee and her young mother Halley who, despite barely having enough cash to live week to week, are both filled with a laissez-faire and joie de vivre that is infectious. The film centres around one summer in the life of this family. While we don't get much backstory what we do get is a compelling look at Moonee, her mother, and the community they have surrounded themselves with all struggling to keep their heads above water but still willing to share and laugh and fight with one another. One of the most remarkable things is that once again Baker is dipping into the world of people on the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum and yet he manages not to be condescending or use them as some sort of inspirational poverty porn.The film luxuriates in the garrish bright colours of the world its set in. Acting is top-notch from everyone, especially newcomer Bria Vinaite who plays Moonee's mother and delivers a knock out performance.",The Florida Project

Whether it's Antichrist or The Florida Project, there's a real lack of economic status to be found between the deep crevices on Willem's mug.Perfect, I suppose, for a movie about what it's like to be a poor child or poor single mother in the Greater Orlando Area. Is it ironic they live in the decrepit Magic Castle Motel, so painfully within running distance of an actually Magic Castle at Disney World?The poor kids don't know they're poor until they see what rich people eat or golf towards. They're adorable and cute, they go on adventures without iPods or iPads or Nintento Switches, they make mistakes, and they make friends. The meaning of innocence lost is lost until the final scene which inappropriately adds a robust score as we escape, too, into the world that is outside the theater doors, only to realize we haven't been to Disney World for some time, and we still have a few days of use-it-or-lose it PTO before EOY.It's hard not to think of poorer children, possibly a billion or so more, crawling around trash heaps in Brazil or India or Africa. Is the message that America has lost its way and we have our own poverty problems? Or is the message that it's actually not so bad here, because we have clean water and toilets what flush it?Or should we simply take solace that we will always have a Willem Dafoe to stare into while we wish for a less unjust economic system?",The Florida Project

The acting is spectacular, the kid actors are some of the best I've ever seen but so are the adults, Willem Dafoe is the most famous of the cast and he is at his best here, this might not be his best performance but it has to be at least on his top 5.
The story is great with a heart wrenching finale and I love the cinematography and all the colours, all adding up to a film that just feels so humane.

The love between Halley and Moonee is depicted very well in all scenes. I particularly liked the scenes when mom and daughter run around in rain, drenched , drinking drops of rain water. Bobby is extremely sympathetic towards all his guests and looks out for all the kids who live in the hotel. Bobby is a kind man and helps Halley to maintain residence in Hotel. Moonee and her friends Scooty (well acted by Christopher Rivera) and Jancey ( acting by Valeria Cotto)are excellent and their simple, innocent, childish pranks are very well directed by Sean Baker. The movie shows poor kids having simple fun and running around and doing childish stuff very well. All the actors did a great job. Mela Murder as Ashley who is Halley's only friend did extremely well as her friend and also as Scooty's mom. Ashley after getting punched in the face and hurting has no hesitation in accepting Moonee's genuinely caring and sympathetic ""feel better soon"" with a hug. Florida Project is all above love not costing anything and all about caring for each other. When love is questioned by DCF, Moonee seeks refuge in land of wonder. The movie is great.

123,jaredpahl,When Verisimilitude Goes Bad,6,7 November 2019,"The Florida Project begins with three kids screaming at each other repeatedly. ""Moonee!"", ""Dicky!"", ""Moooonee!"", ""Dickyyy!"", ""Moooooooneeeee!"", and so on. I was wincing. The sound was physically bothering me. Like the volume was set too high on my tv or something. It was irritating, and needlessly so. This awful opening diddy was an omen of what was to come. The Florida Project, one of the most celebrated films of 2017, is skillful and perceptive of its subjects. It puts us right in the middle of a specific nook of America. It very effectively captures the lives of some of the worst people in the country. To director Sean Baker I paraphrase the great Roger Ebert, ""I admire what you did, and I hate it.""The life we are privy to in The Florida Project is that of Moonee (Brooklynn Kimberly Prince), a rambunctious young girl, and her single mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite). The pair lives in a discount hotel outside of Disney World in Orlando, and the plot follows their struggle to stay above water financially. All this is framed through the eyes of our tiny protagonist, who of course sees her world as its own kind of magical place. In order for this slice-of-life to work, I'm supposed to find little Moonee adorable. Charming, even. You really need to empathize with this kid for the movie to succeed on the terms it creates. Well I found her and her bratty friends intolerable. And so, you guessed it, the movie and I didn't get along.The best way to break down my frustration with The Florida Project is to break down the characters. Let's begin with the ones front and center for most of the movie. Moonee's gang of rabble-rousers are just like real-life children of a certain age. They run around causing mischief, screaming in high-pitched voices, and laughing at everything. They feel so authentic that they quickly become annoying. Baker's commitment to realism means the kids just ""do kid stuff"" for the film's entire run time. So, you're trapped. Trapped in a movie with a bunch of screeching devils. I'd wager being trapped in a movie with annoying kids is not exactly preferable to being trapped in say, a bus station or a restaurant. Either way, the physical reaction is the same; a furrowed brow, a scowl, and an internal monologue screaming, ""Shut up!""Then there's Willem Dafoe as Bobby, the hotel manager. He manages to be a fabulous character. As a patient, hard-working babysitter for these monsters, Dafoe exudes quiet charm. The role is the opposite of showy, and yet Bobby comes out feeling truly vibrant. He's the only character I could connect to. The only one I didn't feel was banging proverbial pots together next to my face.I've put off discussing the worst character for long enough. Moonee's mother, Halley, is one of the most horrid movie characters I've ever seen. How to describe her? White trash dumpster fire? Hellish scumbag? I think I've settled on Swamp Rat Trash. Her life is worthless. She sits around watching TV all day, banging strange dudes all night, and always instilling the same reprehensible worldview to her daughter. She'd serve the world better in jail or dead. Her sole contribution in life is the creation of another parasitic monster. I hated her. Now it is a rare thing for a film to elicit that strong a reaction in me. I must admit, I didn't hate the actress or the dialogue. In fact, a thought occurred to me multiple times, either this really is some trashy Instagram personality, and she's just being herself, or it's one of the greatest performances I've ever seen (Even that dreadful urban black accent she puts on morbidly fascinated me). It turns out Bria Vinaite isn't a trained actress. I can only assume the worst. But the character is really what I want to talk about. Unlike Moonee, I cannot imagine that we are supposed to empathize with Halley. I also think that's kind of the point. She's a bad mom, and the whole situation she is wrapped up in sucks. But at what point is this message, if you can call it that, worth my investment? I have to sit there and be assaulted by noise and colors and tantrum-throwing girls for almost two hours in order to come away feeling that, ""y'know, poverty really is brutal""? It isn't worth the trouble.How to review this movie? For the most part, The Florida Project is a highly effective glimpse of a specific group of people. A glimpse into a world of horrible trash adults raising horrible trash kids. Of wallowing in the perpetual filth that is poverty. Of aimless animals, scrounging for money like rats, and never dreaming of anything else. The Florida Project is scarily real. I can feel the utter hopelessness of Halley and Moonee's plight. It makes me angry. And in that sense, in provoking a response from me, the movie works. At the same time, I hated these characters. I hated listening to their voices. I hated looking at them on the screen. I had a bad time. Whatever merits The Florida Project has, it's not worth having to deal with these people. Let's leave it at this. In the big climactic coup de grâce of the film, Halley screams ""F you!"" at the top of her lungs, straight into the camera. If that don't sum it all up.55/100",The Florida Project

127,cappiethadog,Goofy president,8,9 December 2019,"The newlywed husband(Andrew Romero) never breaks eye-contact with the Magic Castle as he emerges from the running taxi cab. The rich American, who has dual citizenship in Brazil, knows that he made a shambles of the honeymoon plans, and tries to blame the driver. Surely, he has the wrong address. His blushing bride(Carolina Grabova) doesn't look pleased. ""What is this?"" We are not even on Disney property,"" the high maintenance Brazilian woman says in curt Portuguese. There are two Magic Kingdoms, side by side, which isn't so different from Sao Paulo, where rich and poor alike are consolidated, for better or worse. In Jason Kahn""s ""Manda Bala(Send a Bullet)"", a documentary about Brazil's most dangerous city, the audience sees random skyscrapers against the backdrop of low-income housing, poorly-built shanties; a juxtaposition not so dissimilar from Sleeping Beauty's castle being within walking distance from the cheap motel in Sean Baker's ""The Florida Project"". Moonee(Brooklynn Prince) lives there with her single mom, Halley(Bria Vinaite), who is more big sister than mother, in what passes as a favela to the Brazilian national, bristling at the sight of ragamuffins such as Moonie, and her best friend Scooty(Christopher Rivera) carrying their expensive luggage unbidden, similar to the street urchins back home, hustling for spare change. Since Moonie doesn't understand Portuguese, she is unaware of the class warfare being silently waged by the visitor, because like Ma(Brie Larson) in Larry Abrahamson's ""Room"", Halley creates a world that seems bigger than it really is. The tourist knows poverty when she sees it. Moonie's home is no magic castle; it's a slum. Beyond their cul-de-sac is where the real world begins.Doo-doo, a stick; the blonde girl, with nothing else to play with, picks up the doo-doo with that stick and paints the wall. The children of ""George Washington"", David Gordon Green's debut feature, live in rural North Carolina, a small town in Winston-Salem with no public parks or recreation centers. Nasia(Candace Evanofski), our narrator, speaks in the past tense, from the perspective of an adult looking back at her twelve-year-old self and the people she knew as children, with nostalgia, not truth. ""I like to go to beautiful places where there's waterfalls and empty fields. Just places that are nice and calm and quiet,"" she narrates over images of unspeakable poverty. This disconnect between memory and reality functions as an atonement, a beautiful lie, because as a child, Nasia thought of herself as being more sophisticated than her contemporaries. The narrator makes corrections to her unformed self. ""When I look at my friends, I know there's goodness,"" are words spoken in a subjective voice and in the present tense, which makes Nasia a fallible narrator, because we don't see her interacting with any of the kids who find wonder int he post-industrial wasteland of abandoned building, junkyards, and empty lots littered with other people's junk. ""George Washington"" is subtly, a period piece, set during the era of the first George Bush administration. The audience sees Nasia's categorical dismissal of her environs, and the available boys who habituate the place as trash, agreeing with her older sister: ""You gotta get out, go traveling,"" she parrots, in spite of her strange affinity for George(Donald Holden), a slow boy who wears a football helmet to protect his fontanelle. Washington, a moniker that references our first president, is Nasia ascription, transforming George into a myth of her own making. Before starting on the screenplay for ""The Florida Project"", the filmmaker must have screened the David Gordon Green film. Nasia, the wizened narrator, sounds like a parent to Nasia, the child. With the benefit of hindsight, she reconstructs skid row into an enchanted place, a complete prefabrication as a balm against guilt.Nostalgia can do that; you misremember. Her narration precludes any mention of Buddy(Curtis Cotton III), the boy she dumped for George; the boy who died. You forget what you want to forget.Heavily-tattooed and a recreational pot smoker, Mooney's mom isn't like the other moms. A stay-at-home mom by default, Hallie, an ex-stripper, leaves Mooney unsupervised in the Florida projects that masquerades as a low-rent theme park, where instead of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, the onsite characters who mingle with the public are a child molester, an aging femme fatale with a penchant for sunbathing nude by the motel pool, and the homeless. Jancey(Valeria Coito), Mooney's new friend, lives in Futureland, an aqua-colored motel, named as such to suggest its handsome doppleganger Tomorrowland. A parked car, the only ride in Futureland, doesn't take Mooney anywhere. While other children and their parents, and also, the wealthy Brazilian couple, laugh and holler on Space Mountain, Mooney and Scooty excitedly wipe spit off from the parked vehicle they doused in saliva. Grandma Stacey(Josie Olivia), Jancey's legal guardian, recognizes the situation for what it is; restitution for an act of vandalism(it's her car), whereas Hallie, practically a child herself, sees nothing but harmless summer hijinks that gets needlessly overblown by an uptight tenant. Shirking her responsibilities as a parent to teach Mooney right from wrong, this abdication makes Halley as ancillary to her young daughter's development as any weirdo who trespasses onto the violet-colored motel premises. She gets away with it, this Lord of the Flies method to mothering, but the neglect, inevitably, catches up with her. While Ashley(Mela Murder) works double-shifts as a waitress at a nearby greasy spoon, she relies on Hallie to look after Scooty, her son. Free-spirits both, the gainfully-employed mother, however, knows where the party stops and real life begins. The ensuing brouhaha begins in earnest. The three autonomous kids leave Futureland and The Magic Castle behind to go gallivanting at the nameless deserted condominium complex, a sort of unofficial Frontierland, being relatively far-removed from civilization in miniature. Adventure turns into misadventure, when Mooney encourages Scooty to light a fireplace. Frontierland, a tinderbox to start with, goes up in smoke, just like Halley's friendship with Scooty's mom; an engulfing that spreads to their children, the arsonists. Scooty will miss Mooney. He preferred her imagined world instead of the real one in Kissimmee, an Orlando ghetto. The boy was complicit in passing along the fantasy to Jancey, a willing participant to their matrix-generating juvenilia, since neither she can afford the price of admission for Disney World either. Therefore, the alternate world continues, without Scooty's contribution to the fictive landscape. A pasture, through Mooney's eyes, turns into simulacrum, an imitation of Animal Kingdom, a Disney World mainstay, where instead of lions, antelopes, and rhinos, a safari in Kilimanjaro is highlighted by cow-watching.Nasia takes care of a cat that belong to her cousin, a Florida resident. Nasia is like Mooney; she reinvents, but instead of a place; it's a person. She rebuilds George on the very spot where Buddy was rooted, in her heart. The wise words she attributes coming from George's mouth were actually Buddy's words. While wearing an alligator mask, the dead boy from Nasia's past recites Job 29:6 on an outdoor stage, whereas George is nowhere near as eloquent. Buddy was the real George Washington. The alligator mask works as a metaphor for The Florida Project, Disney World's real name.The DCF(Florida Department of Children and Families) comes for the girl. Bobbie Hicks(Willem Dafoe), The Magic Castle manager, had no choice but to turn his tenant in when she starts working from home. Mooney, bereft of any remaining imagination, runs to Futureland, and knocks on Jancey's door. Inconsolable, at the prospects of being separated from Halley, the only mother she has, Jancey takes Mooney's hand in hers and the girls run away to Sleeping Beauty's castle. But Goofy is the President of the United States. And Mooney is poor.There is no Tomorrowland.It's a small world after all.",The Florida Project
128,emryse,A Different Side of American Society,7,25 July 2021,"This film plays out very slowly, with a threadbare narrative going through it, but despite this or perhaps because of this the film feels incredibly real, less like a movie and more like a documentary.The film follows Mooney, a 6 year old girl who lives with her young mother in a motel near Disneyland, every performance feels very real, especially Willem Dafoe's who as per usual feels like the highlight of the film, the cinematography is also pretty good and from a technical point of view this film is very well made which is even more impressive considering the low budget of $2 million. I do feel that this film will have a very limited audience though and I myself did have some problems with the movie, mainly the ending which I felt was too open ended and was shot surprisingly badly, going for a shaky camera look that would have been more at home with Jason Bourne, the music at the end also felt very overbearing, but on the whole I feel this film was pretty amazing. I didn't love it and it did drag at points but it's well worth watching, give it a try if you're interested.",The Florida Project

130,Equalizer16,One of 2017s best and most affecting,10,18 November 2017,"An marvellous vision into the working class struggles of the residents at the Magic Castle Motel in Florida, just outside of tropical Disneyworld.Sean Baker' triumphant drama takes us into the poverty of young parents and their adventurous children. Creating a wonderful performance of joy and sadness through this adult story but fantastically illuminated through the eyes of the young.Moonie (Brooklynn Prince) an ecstatic six year old girl lives with her labouring mother Haley (Bria Vinaite) in the purple Magic Castle motel in Kissimmee, Florida, where she and her friends gallivant the colourful Disney established community. Making the world their own playground the modern group of little rascals cause their own array of mischief which brings much irritation to the assertive manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe) and the local tourists.From the maker Tangerine (2015), The Florida Project is a masterpiece of childhood and humane realism, Sean Baker brings the melancholy story down into young level bringing us into the universe of these joyous children. While in the backdrop of the play time, we also see the despairing truth of the poor well-being that these children are living in.The visual marvel of the film is exceptional, the vibrant Florida community full of standout colour schemes in beautiful design of the wonderland from the motel purple to the orange land bright yellow and red. As the kids course around the community it is a tender excursion of these intrepid children's fantasy. This originates from the pragmatic cinematography from Alexis Zabe. A fantastic low level framing bringing us down to the height of these children, entering their playground of a world in delightful perspective . The fluid movement of the camera gives life into the sublime setting and explicit lighting to the Florida ""paradise"".The Florida Project visibly strives in one of the best ensemble performances of the year. Brooklynn Prince along with the rest of her friends gives the best realist child performance since Tremblay in Room, being that innocent and energetic lead at the centre of the films heart. This is also shared by her crass but exuberant mother, as Bria Vinaite phenomenally portrays the straining Haley, we may loose respect for her as the film progresses but Vinaite's performs it brilliantly that still tugs our hearts for the mother daughter relationship. Willem Dafoe's supporting role is another standout aspect to take away, as the defensive landlord, who although may find the small rascals a pain, shadows a caring love for them, which Dafoe provides astonishingly on screen.The Florida Project is one of the years best and most moving films, an instant classic construction of childhood life and poverty. A must see experience with an awe-inspiring range of break-out performances.",The Florida Project
131,stefstars,Great Subject Matter,7,5 September 2020,"I love that they chose to tell the story of the people who are living just outside ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" yet the most they can enjoy of this perk is seeing the fireworks in the sky from time to time. I love that they centered the story around the kids. Despite not being able to go inside the park and living in sad conditions, they make the most of it and make a Disney World out of what they have. The little girl is wonderful, she does a great job in her role. Her cries at the end of the film got me teary eyed because the entire film she had been a happy, carefree, street wise kid who wasn't letting the circumstances let her down, but rather making the most of it, and then reality comes to end it all.However the film does leave you conflicted. I feel bad for the little girl because she loves her mom and I hate that she has to be taken away but at the same time I know that's what was best for her because she really wasn't safe with her mom. There are no redeeming qualities to the mom, she annoyed the crap out of me the whole movie and I think that comes down to the acting. I feel like the actress over acted. The screaming and scratchy voice can only go so far. I couldn't sympathize with her like I did with the little boy's mother - who's working a waitressing job and is actually protective of her son.Another flaw with the movie is that I think it tried really hard to be gritty in a lot of instances. Take for example the in your face scene with the kids sitting in front of a mural that says ""take one"" (subtlety, not even once) and they stay on that shot for like 2 minutes. It's nicer and more powerful when it's subtle, like when the little girl and her mom are walking down a road that has a sign that reads ""Seven Dwarfs Lane"" and they're on their way to scam people - the shot doesn't last long and it hits you that all these things are happening in a location that the world associates with fantasy and happiness. The ending was a let down, I get that they attempted the ""leave you wondering"" approach cos you'll wonder if they really made it into the park or the little girl is imagining it, but it was done so abruptly that it's more annoying. The events that just happened and that's how you end it ? That was pretty disappointing. Guess you can't be in Orlando without including Disney World park in some way.Willem Dafoe is great in his role, he brings a lot of depth to the character, playing the tough guy with a soft heart. For me, him and the little girl gave the best performances in this film. Apart from the story, I think they're big reasons for having to see this film at once, to appreciate their performances. As another user mentioned, if Willem Dafoe wasn't in it, you would think this film was a documentary by the way it's set up. You would think the mom is a real life outrageous woman, but no she's an over the top actress.",The Florida Project
132,SimonD1900,Innocence in a harsh reality,10,12 July 2020,"Very much a slice of life movie, pretty much doesn't really have a plot even. A bit long and not exactly that entertaining, still notice my rating. Just a very beautiful movie I thought, but almost a bit too real for me, I mean that in a good way, it's just that this movie comes of colerful and easy going but it's actually kind of heavy, again, I mean this in a good way, this is actually this movies strength, to me.It's about the lives of the people that lives at this cheap motel in Florida near Disneyland. Mostly centers around the happy go lucky kids that grows up in this environment and tells the story from this perspective and otwards from that.As already stated, perhaps a bit too long, could have shaved of 20 min or something perhaps, in my opinion.

133,eve_dolluk,The Anti Disney Movie,9,2 January 2018,"MischievousMischievousI like Disney films, yes they paint a pretty picture of life in many films but in others its not all roses. This film is set quite close to Disney world in the cheap motels around the area and it certainly doesn't contain any princesses. This film was brilliantly shot and acted, the characters seemed real and the kids just seemed to do their thing with no forced dialogue. William Defoe was excellent as the motel manager trying to keep it all together, there was no pompous performance or grand opus of dramatic output. This was a subtle yet effective character performance. The kids were brilliant, mischevious yet adorable. Most of the time it felt as if the cameras just followed them around doing their thing. Near the end however I saw one of the best child performances that literally brought me to tears. The film is basically a summer in the life of a mother and daughter who have no money, husband, father, or much support from anyone. I guess if your not interested in watching poor people struggle then this film may not be for you but at the same time there is something more within the confines of this existence on screen. I found it harsh, mesmerising, trying, disturbing, sad and fun all within the 90 or so minutes run time. Its the first film I've seen from this director but I think I will be checking out more. A definite 9 out of 10, its rare to see films like this done in an honest and natural way. Bravo",The Florida Project
134,Irena_Spa,The kids are the pure beauty of this movie,9,28 November 2017,"As someone already wrote in these reviews, the kids stole this film. Magic!!! When kids are in the story almost the main characters, it is inevitably that we will be involved emotionally in it. The movie starts with old, but still good theme ""Celebration"" by Kool & The Gang, which gives us sign that we will see something what is worth seeing. When speaking about the music, it ends also with that theme, but in the other version, orchestral, made by Lorne Balfe. Not to write about all what I've seen, but it is enough to say that there are many good people outside and everyone can come into some bad situation and it is good to help if you can and if you are in that position that you can give some help. Such behavior is shown through Willem Dafoe's character, motel caretaker Bobby. Not to forget to mention that he is good as in every role he's played. After playing Jopling in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", where he is unrecognizable and incredible good as a bad guy, here is very recognizable as we know him visually, but this time as a good guy who has a big heart. As I wrote in the title of summary, this film shows us the pure beauty of life through every child shown in it.",The Florida Project
135,texshelters,This is a well done film with good acting that doesn't go deep enough to be truly great.,6,10 November 2017,"The Florida Project: It would have been better as a documentary. The Florida Project is compelling, wondrous and bleak. I don't mind bleak. I loved ""Moon"", ""Moonlight"" and ""Monster,"" among other bleak cinema. And like those films, The Florida Project is full of great performances. But to what end? It goes nowhere. The film is a series of concentric plot circles leading to the same conclusion over and over. It plays as a fantasy in many ways. The problem? The situation presented in the film is all too real, and it would have been better as a documentary. The filmmakers find a way to make the dismal landscape of low-end hotels neighboring Disney World visually interesting. Not once did the angles or edits disrupt the excellent performances of the actors. The children were particularly excellent in the film, but the adults also shine. The film wasn't expensive to shoot, but it was inventive. Let that be a lesson to all directors and cinematographers: cranes, planes and helicopters are not needed to produce compelling visuals. The music was pleasant and subtle. Finally, a drama that finds the story compelling enough to not flood the audience with insipid music just in case they didn't get that a war is DRAMATIC! Feel, damn it, feel! I'm talking to you John Williams, and now you, Hans Zimmer (see my Dunkirk review). And guess what? It's less expensive to have simple orchestration and sound. The conflicts in the story reflect the real struggles of real people who have no reason or chance to invest in politics or community, people who never know if they will have a place to sleep or food to eat the next day. In other words, they are people the politicians in D.C., state capitals, the media and most citizens ignore. They are the precariat. I assume the writers (Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch) and director (Sean Baker) made this film fictional so more people would see it. However, if the point was to criticize our capitalist system that leaves too many behind and suffering, then it misses the mark. It's a nice film that audiences will forget tomorrow and nothing will change for the actual people living precarious lives like the characters in this film. The ending to the The Florida Project works, and doesn't. It trivializes the situation of the characters and detracts from a touching moment between two of the outstanding child stars. However, the ending fits with the film's themes of escapism and survival. Go see it and decide for yourself. Rating: Matinée. The film is well done but too long. Perhaps the tedium of events in the film was used to show the tedium of the lives of the characters. But film needs to go beyond a presentation. If it addresses serious issues, it need to blend elements of character, plot and setting to imply a third meaning. In the film's efforts to create dramatic realism, The Florida Project misses a real opportunity to show the problems with our economy and inequality in the world in general. The film skirts above the surface of the issues and lacks the depth and grit to be truly impactful. In the end, its subjects become mere objects for us to wonder over like displays at Disney World.

136,filmtravel101,1 Terrible boring movie - Should be a Documentary instead of a film.,1,31 December 2017,"This film is not something i would recommend except as a Documentary about A Day in the Life of Florida poor trailer trash living near Disneyworld. Sure poverty exist in America but do i want to pay money for a film and watch this as supposed entertainment. Maybe on Youtube or Docu channel.The shocking part is that so many reviews are claiming this as a movie worth a 8 rating which is tantalizing and disrepectful to other real film makers. There is no art to the directing which feels more like someone with a video hd cam walking behind children or long shots that are exhausting, and there is no story plot or any real journey you feel is worthwhile except to show poverty and a group of people that truthfully you prefer to not know about. End of story. Save your money and wait for this on netflixs as most of the people in the theatre walked out. Yes. Walked out because they were bored and not interested.

I have also been to Disney with my kids more than once and I gave this a 9 rather than a 10 because being from Florida we had the reaction anyone who's been to Disney would have about that ending; What??? U can't just run in there & up to the castle unnoticed lol it's a pretty big hassle to even get to the main gates u get in a couple different groups like cattle take shuttles boats and everything just to get to that point from the parking lot! And lotsa security!!..I mean I get the idea of the little girls running to Disney to the castle & all but I wish they woulda showed maybe how they snuck in - like did that hotel have a location where there figured out a secret way in or something??

138,wildsparrow16,Brats running amok........but never a dull moment...,6,12 February 2018,"This movie is about a struggling single mother living in a purple motel near Disney. I am not sure if she was meant to be portrayed as a victim of society, but I found her pretty dispicable. It's okay that she was a dancer, it's okay that she struggles - it's NOT okay to use intense profanity in front of your child, beat your ex-BFF to a pulp, and find it amusing to learn your child has spit on another child. She finds a burning house more ""exciting that watching TV"". She is young, very attractive and healthy. It seems she should be able to find gainful work. Her child is obnoxious as one would expect from no discipline. However, no child should have to live in a motel, and for that, we can empathize. The child befriends a gentle little girl from one of the other buildings, and ultimately, this movie is about their friendship. It was beautiful to see how this childhood friendship develops and by such different personalities - one aggressive the other so gentle. DaFoe is brilliant, as always, and plays a kind and patient motel manager. But he can be tough, and I love the scene where he confronts a pedophile. Overall, this is an entertaining film, but the mother should have been made for us to have a little bit more sympathy for her. She was just too hard and lacked even the slightest remorse for bad things. But she loves her daughter, so we can continue to watch the movie knowing at least that much.

Wow!..A childish frolic, a tattily close-up of a lone-parent family along with near-ascetic neighbors in a budget motel, flickering relationships between friends (namely, Halley - Ashley), new bonds that are being established between people in the area (namely, Halley - Grandma Stacy, Moonee, Scooty, Bobby, Halley - Jancey), faul language and gesture that are common even between friends / children, seemingly bad parenting (especially of Halley's), effort to make both ends meet until the end of the week (Halley's struggle), meanwhile no end to juvenility and prattle... This is life.Let's dare first evaluating the acting.The chil actors, namely; Mademoiselle Brooklynn Prince, Mademoiselle Valeria Cotto, Jeune Christopher Rivera, Jeune Aiden Malik, were incredibly convincing. It is as if they were in a real life environment and we could somehow monitor their behavior without interfering. This is hard... this is art!Ms. Bria Vinaite does what she is supposed to do. And she is successful in keeping us believe and be a part of that awful state of affairs which sucks all of her power and will to stand on top of the black look she's to be given probably on every single day of her life! That is why she convinces us that Halley barely holds it together and acts without computation. Without any complaisance or help!Okay, she might have chosen to live far away from her parents out of the youthful temper, or she might have given her love to someone old through a bad romance, or she always has a week spot for mischief in society (smoking drugs etc.) or she might have been a victim of rape... You / we don't know any of these! We cannot know for sure!But she keeps her dearly loved daughter Moonee as happy as she can... even by acting childishly, ever partying! But she is probably still a child! Therefore; this movie, with the acting of Ms. Bria Vinaite, shows us how easy it is to judge and not show the ropes out of love for life and order!Mr. Willem Dafoe, oh Mr. Willem Dafoe!.. He builds trust in us in his character with how he deals with problems and treats people, especially kids for they are fragile and somewhat vulnerable, that as if he's been doing the managerial task for all his life! He, for all we see, deserves an oscar.As Ms. Mela Murder does not have an upholding role / character in this movie, his character seems to represent the people who would not look out for others if there is anything to their possible ""downside and disadvantage"" in times of caos and despair.

Have a little better than the mechanical humanity for a heart, please!.. No psycological, biological nor biographical history checked! 
But the obligation to take away a child; the family, the dream, the future remains!..At this juncture, it needs to be said that in our neighborhood there are or could be people like Halley; and for we are responsible for one another, we need not touch down in our ""ivory towers.""We.Need.to.Act.webdl!..

While the adults cope with all their problems and societal conflicts, the kids explore the world that they find themselves in, and try to make the best of it. Bobby as the motel manager, is a tough bloke, but totally fair in his dealings with his clients.

This feeling should stimulate thoughtful comment, but instead it produces outrage fueled by fear. ""There, but for the grace of God and years of habit, Go I.""God-fearing, good Americans might be two paychecks and a case of beer away from the street, but they assume that if they joined the ranks of the homeless, they'd sit, in somber contemplation under the overpass, praying and building a church, and getting a good job, even in fast food, and learning some new skills, like how to treat multiple burns on the hands while half-washing dishes in hot water.But us good Americans would still be sober and sane and respectful.

I also laughed a lot. The kids stole this film and whoever wrote it knows kids. They also knew how to write about healthy parental love which this film had some of despite the inappropriate profession Moonee's mom was in. Ben Mankiewics of TYT's ""What the Flick"" panel calls her the worst mom in movie history. Here's how I answered that on You Tube: DISAGREE WITH BEN MANKIEWICS' ""WORST MOM"" COMMENT (Spoiler warning)Halley was a great mom in some ways and a so-so mom in others. She swears and breaks rules in front of Moonee-- giving a bad role model but her worst sin is her hooking partly because it's illegal and causes her to be taken away which is devastating to Moonee. When it comes to loving her kid (and by that I mean enjoying being with her, Halley is near the top: games in the rain,, burping contests, taking bikini selfies, taking her with her on her sales endeavors). . . (some of which are fairly harmless). Compare Halley as a mom to the mom in the movie Moonlight. Chirone's mom is a drugged out hooker that doesn't give one s*** about her kid. And Chirone hates her. If he were removed it would be a godsend. Also, I, too, had trouble with the abrupt ending. It was sort of like the Thelma and Louise ending but they didn't get killed (probably just arrested). But it opened up more questions and then just left you there.Basically, Moonie is a happy kid who likes herself . . . likes living. Life is fun.

The pastel exteriors and novelty signs paint a twinkling sheen that covers welfare moans. Reservations are made in carefully segmented intervals, and the guests are never described as permanent. A purgatory for those with child ankle weights.Bobby is the benevolent duke of the castle, a man residing beside his subjects, more of a servant than a ruler. His neck is always exposed, and his gracious disposition steamrolls his body into a doormat. Bobby's highest loyalty is to the children, unschooled, unchaperoned, and undisciplined. The little Moonee is the three-foot terror that attempts to usurp the throne with prohibited ice cream and science experiments. She has recruited a rag tag team of mini hustlers. Stealing cues from her mother, Halley, she works the streets in significantly more innocent ways, yet retains the same sinister motive.Stuck protecting doomed fragments of families, Bobby builds a secret charity under the nose of regional management. An alternative lodging option for families not fortunate enough to stay within the Kingdom, his operation melds Floridian and out-of-state sensibilities in often vicious ways.Scams and unsanctioned transactions of service comprise the income of drowning mothers. Abandon crack houses and hurricane remnants provide jungle gym sanctuaries for foulmouthed but imaginative rug rats. The safaris and mystery hunts culminate in vibrant childhoods undervalued by the state.A war of financial attrition rages as Moonee becomes a giant prune in a bathtub play prison. Bobby trusts Halley at an unreasonable level, but he is trying to rewrite a history that has pushed his last ""Halley"" beyond communication.

163,longcooljolie,"Seamy underbelly of ""The Happiest Place on Earth""",8,8 November 2017,"Very often, to experience the best in cinematic art you have to go small and The Florida Project is the newest, shining example of that.It's a movie that contains only one recognizable star, Willem Dafoe, and was location-filmed in a couple of run-down hotels within a short jaunt of the Magic Kingdom and Disney World. The story is told through the eyes of a trio of small children and centers around their misadventures during a typical, steamy Central Florida summer.Only a mile or so away thousands of children their age get escorted through a wondrous make-believe world filled with Mickey and Minnie, the Frozen characters, and other fantasy archetypes like Cinderella and Snow White, yet little Moonie and Tancy must make their own fun out of what their circumstances afford them, whether that is invading a shuttered condo complex or panhandling tourists for enough change for an ice cream cone.At night Moonie takes long baths while playing with her dolls in the water and shows twinges of bewilderment as she might be wondering about the rustling and odd moans coming from beyond the closed bathroom door. Other reviewers have remarked that The Florida Project is plot-less and episodic, but at the same time it manages to show the colorful big- ness of the world through the children's exuberant spirit while the harshness of the adult world around them spirals through sweeping changes. There is tumult and ambiguity at the end, but at the same time the story ends perfectly and beautifully.

It had some mildly entertaining points, but not enough to make up for the boring points. It was also way too long, and would have been so much more bearable if the runtime was cut down a half hour, especially in the middle. I did enjoy the great child actors, especially the lead, and the use of colors in the cinematography to make it seem like this film is seen through the eyes of a child.Also, why was there so much emphasis on the helicopters? That could've lead to something, instead of simply being 'it makes the movie realistic since there's so many helicopter tours around Disney'.

167,rblenheim,Sean Baker makes a masterful human document,10,9 March 2018,"One of 2017's most charming films is Sean Baker's ""The Florida Project"" which tells of a rambunctious six-year-old little girl named Moonee who lives with her single mom in a seedy budget motel on the outskirts of Disney World. Her rebellious mother exists partly on welfare, partly on selling stolen goods and, when necessary, on casual prostitution, and although her love for her daughter is sincere and unyielding, she is unwittingly unfit. Willem Dafoe is superb in the role of the conscientious if caring motel manage of the sleazy Magic Castile motel, but even more amazing is Brooklynn Prince as the precocious child, the film's most astonishing acting discovery. Particularly praiseworthy is how the film is told from the children's viewpoints and its parallel point of view of the mother's -- and no matter how indigent, deficient and even precarious Mooney's daily life remains, the film's main emphasis is the joy she and her mischievous friends have in living their carefree lives just being children, as they carouse the area raising hell with the motel's inhabitants.

It was really intriguing to see this sort of film from the perspective of children, mainly from the character Moonee, due to the tough life of poverty that they live through. I felt it was also interesting to note how the aesthetics were oversaturated to reflect how the lives of these children were very colourful and full of variety despite living in a budget motel.All of the performances were brilliant, particularly from Willem Dafoe who shone as the protective manager of 'The Magic Castle' Bobby. The acting from all the children was also surprisingly mesmerising, given that for most of them it was their first time acting in a film. It was seemingly a very realistic portrayal of children growing up in those sorts of conditions. The direction and cinematography was also accomplished and made it very easy on the eye.I enjoyed the film more and more as it went along, as it slowly became more sobering due to the difficulties for Moonee's mum Halley to obtain money to pay the rent (e.g trying to sell perfume tourists). It was always quite predictable that Moonee was going to be taken away from her by the end of the film, but it didn't lessen its emotional impact. Props to Sean Baker and his team for constructing a story that needed to be told.",The Florida Project
170,Wwmbrd,White Trash: The Documentary,8,20 September 2021,"It must seem cruel, tragic, or otherwise unfortunate to see the unstable, quasi homeless trash of society in this way. As someone who grew up near, but not amongst, these fringe of society people, I'm of two minds about this film: one: it paints a realistic image of the down and out, grasping at stability, but with no actual chance of it happening. Two: although misfortune befalls several of the adult characters, and the kids are the true victims, in the real world, these individuals often experience much, much worse circumstances than their limited depths to fall presented in the film. That said, it does not detract from the presentation at all. The idyllic, rosy view of children is played excellently as much of the film is seen through the lens of two six year old friends, Moonee and Scooty, as well as the ever watchful Willem Dafoe as Bobby, the manager of the slum-tel, as the Brazilian lady calls it.I think one of the movie's greatest successes is having been shot largely from the perspective (and eye level) of the children. In almost all of the shots with authority figures, their heads are out of frame, or blurred out with the children in the foreground, and this softened vision of the events of the film really help it to play out in less of a sad, head shaking way, and imbue a sense of wonder and confusion that the kids experience.Parts of the film seem nearly documentary-level with how casually the camera captures the action, like some car accident captured by a gas station security video tape as part of a compilation on youtube. There's a level of detachment in some of the most potentially damaging parts, such as when Bobby runs off a pedophile. This scene in particular shows some of the great filmmaking- it doesn't have to be grotesque or hamfisted for the audience to get the idea, and it doesn't have to tell you that this man has ill intentions with words or overt actions- you get the idea the same way that Bobby does, and while he was perhaps a bit genteel in his dealings, it again captures the essence perfectly- these are unattended children on the fringe. If Bobby isn't watching, who is?Speaking of, Willem Dafoe is great in his understated role as a property manager with far, far too much on his plate, and a demeanor that is befitting someone above his station in life. First time actress Bria Vinaite is perfection as Halley - a tatted up, dope smoking white trash mama in Orlando. It's hard to feel any empathy for the character, though- as all of her issues are self wrought. Her friend Ashley has a job and tries to better herself, and others are seen as being giving people, even with what little they have, Halley is stubbornly selfish, shortsighted, and vindictive. When the final scene rolls and child protective services are ultimately called- the movie plays like a tragedy from the perspective of young Moonee. Again, it's hard to feel the least bit sorry for her mother, even as the walls of Magic Castle come falling down around the kingdom when Halley doubles down on her awfulness. Halley taking Moonee's picture in front of the burning abandoned house also captures the essence of trash excellently. There are so many little moments that just work perfectly, right alongside drinking beer and videoing a fight in the parking lot at night, yelling ""world star!"". Again, we realize later that ""swimsuit selfies"" aren't all fun and games, and the acts committed by Halley that go unrecognized by Moonee certainly wash over the audience.8/10 good family fun.",The Florida Project

I also felt bad for the people in the motel. They live right outside of Disney World, and while people are having fun at the happiest place on Earth, they're struggle to make ends meet. This movie showed that not everything is fun and games. Sometimes people have to result to prostitution, stealing and scamming others just to live their lives. People can also lose their kids and be arrested. But yeah, that ending. Oh man. As my good friend said, ""it looked like a commercial for going to Disney World"".

173,adam-may-bower,Raw and Beautiful,8,2 June 2018,"'The Florida Project' offers a raw look at impecunious families in the United States, while being both exuberant and heartbreaking at the same time. This film, directed by Sean Baker, has received immense critical acclaim for obvious reasons. Baker presents a story centring around six-year-old Moonee and her life living in a motel with her destitute and rebellious mother. Instead of focusing on a plot, Baker prefers to simply showcase day-to-day incidents of the characters around the motel, which is primarily what the first two-thirds of the film is about. In doing this, the film almost feels like a documentary of underprivileged individuals and can feel slow at some points. However, what separates this film from being a bleak documentary, is the fact that it is so abundantly full of life and colours. Brooklynn Prince, who plays Moonee, is undoubtedly riveting. At such a young age, this actress is able to pull off a phenomenal performance and perfectly plays a high-spirited girl living in poverty. The realism of Prince's acting, alongside her co-stars, truly brings this film to life. Willem Dafoe and Bria Vinaite are also outstanding in this film, particularly considering the latter had no acting experience prior to filming and was able to do so well. This film is also dazzling, with beautiful direction and cinematography. Full of vibrant colours and striking shots of Florida, mostly shot on 35mm, makes this film a visual masterpiece. The final scene of the film, surprisingly shot on an iPhone, is certainly a bold and risky move, but did not take away the heart of the story and as the credits rolled, one knows that they just watched a phenomenal film. In summary, 'The Florida Project' is certainly a standout film in 2017 with it's moving (and confronting) subject, phenomenal acting and beautiful visuals. Although one may not want to watch this twice, due to it's underlying dark themes, it is certainly worth watching for it's bountiful amounts of energy and life.",The Florida Project
174,fletcherc21,Birth of a Con Artist,8,18 November 2017,"The Florida Projects follows the adventures of a six year old girl, Moonee, over a summer living in a motel with her deadbeat mom. We are able to view the world through her eyes and see it with the excitement that she does. Moonee is perhaps the most profane six year old you'll ever see, yet she is incredibly endearing. The scary part is that you can see what she is becoming without ever being aware of it. She manipulates people without really trying or realizing that she shouldn't. It is because her only role model is her mother, who is perhaps the worst role model a young impressionable girl could have. Moonie is being taught how to behave by watching how her lazy deadbeat mom treats others and herself.Willem Dafoe excels as the motel's manager, Bobby. He is a good person who tries to do what is best. He represents perhaps the only good influence on Moonee, though she is unaware of it. Dafoe should get an Oscar nomination for his excellent work.The most tragic aspect of The Florida Project is that Moonee's mom really loves her. She wants the best for her, but she doesn't realize that she is hurting Moonee by shaping her in her own image. The best thing she could do for Moonee is to get out of her life, but she loves her and can't face that fact.There isn't an abundance of plot throughout the film as it operates more as a series of connected stories, but those stories are impactful and emotionally gripping throughout.",The Florida Project

176,cB391,Enjoyable.,8,24 November 2018,"The story was quite interesting to me. After having seen some rather poor quality movies where the sole idea in the movie revolved around money or simple action, it was nice to come across this one as I await some of the movies to come out online for 2018.The story focuses on a small motel, beautifully painted, near the Disney park. World?Land? Don't know, don't care.The two central themes are the struggles that some people face, while still being able to enjoy their existence. It shows the human aspect of poverty. It does highlight how hard it is for some, and the serious dangers there are in society where many gray areas exist.The other theme, after the economic disparity, is the idea of responsibility. It is very clearly pointed out when Dafoe is confronted on two occasions. If you watch the film, you will understand the importance and the disconnect, though it isn't clearly stated.The constant shifts do make the movie worth watching.
The end is a bit out-of-whack. Make of it what you want. Beats reality.
The acting is believable. The accents are a bit annoying, which make it a bit hard to pick up at times.All in all, would suggest watching it if you are looking for a good standalone film.",The Florida Project

It took three arduous attempts, to finish.The ONLY positive thing I can say about this movie, is that it's beautifully filmed. From a technical perspective, the wide-angle shots, and saturated colours are wonderful.Sadly, the performances captured on camera, are severely lacking, bordering on insufferable. The plot, non-existent.The premise is simple enough: capture the fringe of society, in The Sunshine State. Anyone who's travelled through Florida knows the gulf between the upper and lower classes. In the shadows of Disney/Universal, lies a contrasting reality to the fantasy sold in the Amusement Parks.But there's literally no depth to the actual story. Every scene seems loosely improved. It's one thing to capture/convey the grittiness of living on the lower economical edge of things, but without a basic story arc, it's quickly becomes an exercise in banality.And it just goes on, and on. For an hour and forty-five minutes.All culminating with a finale, which could've salvaged everything before it, only to have it end in the laziest of ways.Perhaps if this were a documentary, one would get invested in the characters. But as a fictional work, it failed to do so, with me.Truly baffled by the glowing reviews.",The Florida Project
178,HillstreetBunz,There's a film and a filmmaker in here somewhere....I think,4,12 November 2017,"First, the good. I'm always pleased to see a movie that talks of a community less represented, and it's clear that there is a filmmakers sensibility in there somewhere, the one that shows these underdeveloped adult children living in a world not unlike the primary coloured plastic toys that the real children play with carelessly, so it deserves genuine consideration. But while there is a visual language of brightly coloured plastic toy worlds, and an endless fascination with the unhealthy fake precocity of the central child character, alongside apparently unconscious musings on the various degrees of emotional immaturity of almost all the adult characters, it doesn't add up to a story. It reads like a documentary (how fashionable) but it isn't, and as such, for my twenty bucks, I feel entitled to more care by the filmmaker.If you have nothing to say, don't make movies, if you do, have the courage to say it, if 'saying' for you means merely posing the questions and not delivering the answers then you need greater skill as a filmmaker, and more respect for the audience. The films ending is the most egregious aspect of the film, in that it isn't an ending at all, its weakness undermining the better parts of the movie and making it even less substantial than it otherwise might have appeared up until then. If we are to revere something just because it is naturalistic and as meandering as some lives, then we don't need storytellers to apply form at all, but that doesn't work for me here. It's not new to resort to a fetish for what appears to be a child/adult, especially a female child, but, others have offered more. If it's a slice of life it isn't an especially illuminating one. I see that it has garnered some real plaudits and I can on,y assume that it does so because it stands defiantly in opposition to the truly dull bland mainstream. But being the opposite of bad doesn't guarantee it's good. It may have more integrity, and be more genuine, but it's just another version of not good.",The Florida Project

This movie felt so real and was so ugly and so beautiful.,The Florida Project
180,paul-2148,Best Film of 2017,10,13 April 2018,"This film got overshadowed by the Shape of the Water and Phantom Thread and it's a shame. This is one of the most powerful films I have seen in awhile, and if I had an Oscar vote I would had given it best picture over those other 2 dogs. It's so realistic that you soon forget that you are watching actors following a script. It's hard for me to discuss it without giving too much away. It takes place in a cheap hotel in Orlando. If you have ever visited Disney World and wondered what life is like just a few blocks away, well maybe now we know. The film really centers on the life of 3 kids who live in cheap motels one particular summer. All the kids are amazing and a lot of it feels like it was improvised. Like that film Kids but with 6 year olds. The kids are joyfully happy. Most of the film is spent watching these kids giggle and play in the beautiful Florida sunshine. Slowly the single mothers of these kids come into focus and that's were the tension is. Real adult problems start to seep into the film. There are moments where you wonder where the film is going but the characters are so terrifically developed that you don't really care because it's so enjoyable to watch. I will say this. When the film ends it's not exactly a plot twist but it feels like one. It's more of a philosophical twist. When it ended I was sort of speechless, realizing that we had been set up in a way, where I suddenly realized what a profound statement the film end up making. Suddenly I was forced to do some deep thinking about the nature of childhood and exactly what makes. A good parent. It's quite brilliant really. 
William Defoe is sublime in this. He is the moral center of the film, but he has his secrets too. This is a film about family and you wonder why he wears a wedding ring but you never see his family. Or do you? He witnesses this heartbreak all around him but he's like a protector. He's the sole father figure in a film about kids and single mothers.I can't say enough about how much I admire this film.",The Florida Project
181,Siebert_Tenseven,Alternate Endings,1,24 January 2018,"This movie would have been excellent with an alternate ending: 1) William Dafoe, wild-eyed and crazy, machine gunning the white trash waste product and her little little snot of a hopeless offspring, or 2) White trash waste product and her brat getting run over by a tractor trailer driven by Jim Jarmusch at the intersection of US Highway 192 and Interstate Four, or 3) A 50 megaton nuclear weapon detonated at the apex of Cinderella's Castle instead of the daily fireworks presentation at Walt Disney World.The actual ending was a soggy milquetoast of sentimental hogwash, demoting this movie to the level of a Hallmark Channel one dimensional dumbo dorky end wrap, sanitized for your protection as a feature presentation to be mulled over by movie critics and the Academy. To be honest, this movie hit a sweet spot for me in my most intense hatreds: The State of Florida and children between the ages of zero and 21. How I ever sat through all of it is a complete mystery to me. Obviously, I was waiting for one of the alternate endings!",The Florida Project
182,zkiko,dynamic within a minimalistic physical range,7,1 January 2019,"Interesting movie. Very dynamic within a minimalistic physical range. I found it freeing to watch the liberty the kids experienced. Children can be very imaginative and find ways to have fun. Of course there are many things to say about the upbringing by the seemingly classic Borderline Personality mother but also how she gave her (creative) love and patience at the same time..Makes for an interesting depiction of a truth. Anyway.. I enjoyed it and it may seem weird, but where they live seems actually very nice with the weather and 'spaciousness'. (Always loved motels and parking terrains.)",The Florida Project
183,doxxman5,the best crescendo of the year,10,27 July 2018,"Above all, this is a movie that captures a specific time and place with uncanny precision. It is a story that takes place over a couple weeks, but defines an entire way of life for certain poor people in the country, in this case in the hotels of Orlando, Florida. That the movie is told from the perspective of a child for the majority of the run-time is special as well (Brooklyn Prince is the leading actress performance of the year in my opinion), and this is no adorable story: it is a child doing what children do like spitting on cars, starting fires, and questioning everything. It is a good idea that other characters are followed as well to give the movie more depth, especially the landlord Willem Dafoe and the despicable mother plated by Bria Vinatie, but not all characters are likable, and everything is portrayed with the realism of a documentary. The ending of the movie has been much debated, but it is the best crescendo of the year in my opinion and the film carries you every step of the way.",The Florida Project
184,jrwygant,Over-rated,2,16 May 2018,"Remarkably over-rated. Willem Defoe is great, but there is no story and there is nothing funny about the irresponsible adult characters or their feral kids. This is almost a documentary, but it fails as a feature film.",The Florida Project
185,EnoVarma,Biggest disappointment of 2017,4,26 January 2018,"Because I expected a lot from this little movie. And it does try. It also scores in the acting department. Yet, it's never as involving as one hopes it to be, and it's curiously aimless. As I was watching it, I couldn't quite put my finger on what made it seem so flat. Now, that I have had time to digest, I think it's because it doesn't manage to fully contrast the existence of its poor protagonists with the tourists of the overshadowing Disney resort.The movie also tries way too hard to milk cheap laughs with cursing, misbehaving children. We've seen this already, dear film makers. And although the movie presents the idea of children mimicking the bad behaviour of their parents, there is no substance behind the notion.Actors, however, are great even if the characters lack certain insight. Sean Baker is a wonderful director of children, as showcased by the energetic Brooklynn Prince. Bria Vinaite as her prostitute mother is almost disturbingly authentic.And yet, it's the old pro, Willem Dafoe who really steals the movie. He brings substance and layers upon layers, not only to his character, but to the whole film. I really hope he is granted an Oscar.I would say, that most people don't try, and fail. Therefore there is no shame in trying and not quite succeeding. Sean Baker is a film maker to keep an eye on. In the end, The Florida Project doesn't really know what it wants to say, accentuated by its disruptive ending that doesn't quite ""get it"".",The Florida Project
186,gphgrm01,Mother and daughter from hell.,1,20 February 2018,"I see what might have been the initial intention of the film, and it even looks that original idea probably was good and promising. Describing the life of the lowest possible class and children born in it just on the edge of the Disneyland, a children's paradise, should have been an important issue to observe. However. Everything else in the film is deeply miscarried out. Cast, acting, directing, everything. Everything is pretentiously overdone, and left completely out of the focus. What we see is a hyperactive dangerous child who might be occasionally cute at the age of the 6, but still a kind of child who might burn your house or throw you under the bus at her age of 9, just for fun. Actually, she has already burn the house at the age of 6 in the film, just nobody has died by accident. The child is occasionally scary, and clearly deprived of any guidance of consideration for the others, or for herself. So, its obvious that the child is growing into a delinquent, being a thief, liar and offender at the age of 6, without leaving any space to see a girl as someone who might grow one day into a person with notion of responsibility. Next to her, there is a mother who is an adolescent herself, who also generates, as the film is progressing, more and more absence of any kind of self control and responsibility or understanding for the others. Stealing, prostitution, aggressiveness, violence and all sorts of pathological behavior in the presence of the child cannot be compensated by her, pretty unconvincing, kindness to child. Here is actually the main slippage within the film. In the very beginning it looks that the mother is still somebody with some notion of what is good or bad, or what is a necessity, just pretty unconventional and troubled. However, as the plot is developing, the mother is getting more and more unbearable with her behavior, acting like a worst kind of delinquent without even any sign within the plot that she might be aware how devastating her behavior is. And this illogical turn in her behavior is marked with a pretty lousy acting - irritating and completely out of place. This effect goes so far, that it is really hard to understand the Dafoe's character, a motel manager Bobby, who is a good guy in this story, and why he has been tolerating for a long time this misconduct under his premises, which makes him an accomplice in a seriously irresponsible treatment of the child by her mother. So, when the police and social workers come in the end to separate the child from her mother, the empathy for a mother losing her child, or child losing her mother, is close to zero. Nobody should be separated from her mother, but, since this child was in a constant danger everyday, wondering around without supervision, it is really hard to have an understanding for this kind of parents trouble. To sum up, I guess this film should have triggered some questions about people from the margin, and the problems of those ones who are really powerless in the face of social reality, people who cannot find the honest job, children with parents incapable of parenting, supporting them, etc. However, instead of thinking about the injustices produced by the social system itself, we are in end happy that the child is being removed from her biological mother, who is completely unfit to be anybody's company, let alone mother. The worst thing is that there is absolutely no sign that the child could move on from an inclination to amoral behavior: the child is absolutely sharing her mother's worldview. The other film, Tangerine, was an excellent movie, showing street sex workers as human beings, with all their mistakes, but still in need of love and friendship like everybody else. In The Florida Project we have two delinquent characters, mother and little daughter, who do not show signs of any deeper emotion than being bad and pass without consequences. Failed movie in my opinion.",The Florida Project
187,andrewbunney,Most walked out,1,19 December 2017,"This is the story of a bratty six year-old Moonee (Brooklyn Prince) living at a crummy motel with her appalling mother Halley (Bria Vinaite- cast from her outlandish presence on instagram), and motel manager/father-figure Bobby (Willem Dafoe). These motel dwellers are a new kind of welfare recipient / working poor demographic. Some are what in the US are commonly known as ""Trailer trash"", others are battlers on struggle street. While this situation should be fertile ground for look at modern USA, the film is a slapdash and unengaging portrait of life on the fringe. A very low 'production values' condescension to the range of real people caught in this precarious position.Casting involved asking folks from the community if they were interested in becoming involved at the local Target Store (like Snowtown- but a far inferior result). It looks to be highly exploitative of the young actors, with the film makers obviously egging them on to behave badly.Willem Dafoe who has always impressed me is ok but he's not given much to do. One suspects he lent his name to the project for a large fee and a very short shooting time, probably a day or two. Apart from that, there's lots of cigarettes, foul language, tattoos and naughty kids to enjoy, but no real plot or character development. The many rapturous professional reviews for this film are unfathomable to me and many others. Reading the IMDataBase audience posts, huge numbers of people walk out. Being one of that substantial number of the under-whelmed myself, I would suggest saving your time, money and compassion. A shocker.",The Florida Project

While the plot may seem thin on the ground to some viewers, there is no denying that the characters are very grounded and deep, giving you an insight in to these people's lives, which drives the film forward.The colourful cinematography and setting looks fantastic and is the real highlight of the film; it really compliments the coming of age aspect of the movie.

192,charbelelaro,This film really doesn't feel like a film at all,8,4 April 2018,"The Florida Project is directed by Sean Baker and is a film which follows the day to day lives of unconventional families who live in a budget hotel just outside of Disney World. This film really doesn't feel like a film at all. It's as if the audience is watching the daily lives of individuals who are just struggling to get by. This is pulled off so well due to the outstanding performances by both the adults and children casted for the film. In particular Willem Dafoe, who gives such a constantly complex performance, portraying a strong and firm hotel manger, who deep down has true empathy for his guests. Moments in The Florida Project reach intense and emotional climatic highs, which impact the audience on such an authentic level. Although, as for issues, because this film depicts everyday life, there are moments where pretty much nothing happens. Also I wasn't too pleased with the last few minutes of the film. The abruptness caused the moment to begin and end very quickly without spending a few more minutes to really feel the emotional weight of the scene. All in all this was honestly the most realistic movie experience I had in 2017. My care for the characters and their daily problems was so authentic, and to accomplish that in a fictional film is so rare. I enjoyed The Florida Project a lot more than most films nominated for best picture. This film is a true accomplishment so therefore i give it an 8.",The Florida Project

195,littlemankazoo,TRASH...in the best way possible,7,13 March 2018,"'The Florida Project' is probably one of the more interesting animals of 2017 for me.I was extremely excited to finally see this film, as I had heard praise showered upon it for multiple aspects of it. I was told it was a great Indie film, was trashy and unapologetic, and was told the performances were all spectacular. Heck, I even stayed in the same 1-mile stretch of Kissimmee, Florida that this was filmed in only a week or so ago!In the end, though...this film is TRASH.When I say 'trash', I don't mean it in the deriding, demeaning manner. I mean it in the FEEL of the film. This film spends its time covering a surprisingly ignored but very much present reality of the bottom class of modern American society.Taking place in the shadow of Disney World in Florida, this film strives to depict the harshness of the lives that these people face. I am almost reminded of the film 'Gummo', which depicted the life of slums in Ohio in an extremely similar manner. In fact, I would almost consider this a companion piece to that film. Considering this comes 20 years after the release of Gummo, I can believe they are tightly interwoven in their 'film DNA', so to speak.But enough about me comparing this to cult indie films. You probably want to hear me tell you whether it's GOOD or BAD, right? Whether it lives up to the hype or if it's 'overrated'?In the end, I feel it is an odd mix of both.The performances in this film are SPECTACULAR. Willem Dafoe turns in a subtle performance that has the most humanity I've seen from a character he's played in a long time. I'm almost upset that Sam Rockwell turned-in as good of a performance as he did in 'Three Billboards', because this is easily one of Dafoe's best performances and easily could have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor if it wasn't such a tight year for it.The real highlight of the performances featured here, however, is 7-year old Brooklynn Prince. Having worked with children for 6-7 years now, I cannot tell you how PERFECT they captured the way children speak in this film. They behave exactly as I'd imagine them to, and Brooklynn manages to capture a rough, childlike innocence that is really at the center of a story about children and the places they grow up in that influence them, positively or negatively. If there's anything I can point to that works at an incredibly high level, it is certainly the child acting. I cannot imagine a world where Prince does not have a career in the next 5-10 years.Other than the performances, another attribute the film has going for it is its gorgeous, sun-baked cinematography. Filmed on 35 mm film (Except for one sequence which we'll discuss later...), shots in this film evoke postcard-like imagery that makes the environment shine. Whether its something grungy and disgusting or natural and beautiful, this film looks incredible even on the smallest possible screens. Massive praise to Alexis Zabe, who'd likely get an Oscar nomination if Blade Runner 2049 didn't exist.The points of contention begin to arrive and the film becomes subjective when it comes to the story itself. Coming from my point of view, a man who really LIKES three-act structure and a coherent story, this film...really does not have a story at all. It is about a poor community that struggles to live with each other, perhaps? Or perhaps it is about children and what society does to corrupt them? Or perhaps it is a critique of society in general? I could not tell you, as the film flows freely and lets its imagery speak for itself.At times, the film feels bloated. There was a certain point around the hour and a half mark where I truly began to feel the film drag its knuckles and lose me. Again, a sacrifice that comes from such a free-form concept for a film, but it's not as if the film is ""too long"", as some have complained. It is simply just a very loose film, which requires a patient audience. Thankfully, I am patient. But not everyone is.Finally, we come to the thing that has gained infamy about this film; the ending. While I will not dare spoil the ending, it...is indeed as bad as everyone has made it out to be. It's jarring, it doesn't really work with any of the plot threads or character attributes established, and due to the nature of it, it is not even filmed in 35 mm and can retain the beauty of the rest of the film. It feels unneeded, and almost as if director Sean Baker struggled to find a cohesive way to end the film. If you ask me, endings to independent films are ALLOWED to be abrupt, which is why this attempt at a 'tying it with a bow' ending feels cliche, jarring, and just...bad.All of that aside, and with flaws taken into account...I think this film is still absolutely lovely. The performances are all excellent and sell me that the characters I see are fleshed-out, real people. The cinematography looks postcard-esque and captures a city I have been to and can validate is spot-on in its depiction.'The Florida Project' is uneven, but perhaps it has all the right to be. It is about characters who are rough around the edges and have their own issues, which we simply watch as their lives move along and they simply try to live by their means. It is a fascinating look at a part of the country that we sometimes forget exists, and I certainly can say I was not upset that I gave it my time of day.Despite it being rough and uneven, even by an indie film's standards, I recommend you give it a look! I think there's something to love for everyone in this film.",The Florida Project

Sean Baker is one of my GOAT directors now I cannot get over how he directed and edited this beaut of a movie. Brooklyn Price had me bawling my eyes out at the end with her performance that took some time warm up to. Willem Defoe was a lovable force he really used his talent for being so endearing and likable to morph into Willem DeFriend. The script had me in shambles and walks the knife's edge of showing us the brutality of the adults' world with the idyllic children's point of view.

An unusual compliment but one assuredly. Makes me feel like this is a Heaven Knows What that all came from a crew members true lives and with non actor cast the way it's so immersive and natural. Rough in all the right ways and polished in the other the narrative for this to win the Academy Award is the same for Nomadland, showing people we don't often associate with in a human light.

The characters are not all appealing, but there's a mix of them which brings a serious spark of real life that's absent from even the best of the more popular movies. The characters are clear individuals with complex personalities.The Florida Project made me uncomfortable at times. I didn't really need to know this much about the underbelly of central Florida. If I ever visit Disney World, I may avoid the cheap motels. ;-) Of low-budget films I've seen in my life, there are several I liked better. But this one is likely to stick with me.

205,epat,Dreary slice of life.,5,7 April 2018,"Florida Project is another one of those films whose trailers concentrate deceptively on the upbeat scenes to create a false impression of carefree exuberance. The real story is a dreary two-hour slice of life in the low-end motels of Orlando's Disney World fringe, where even the gun shop professes a dubious Disney tie-in. The only saving grace - tho not quite enough to save the day - is an excellent performance by Willem Dafoe as Bobby, the long-suffering goodhearted manager of the run-down motel that serves as the locus of the film.The lead character, precocious six-year-old Moonee (Brooklyn Prince), is frequently adorable, but two hours of her & her friends' shrill hyperactivity is wearing at best. In true cinéma verité style, the dialog is rapid & often mumbled, making it hard to follow what little ""plot"" there may be. Moonee's mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) just misses being likable. She clearly loves her daughter & we can't help sympathizing with her straitened circumstances, just a poor foolish girl trying to make her way as best she can. Yet her inability to prevent her foul mouth from running away with her at the slightest provocation tends to erode even the most obstinate sympathy. Her efforts to scam a living & her occasional forays into prostitution - bringing a John home while Moonee is consigned to a long bath in the same motel room - tend to confirm the authorities' conclusion that she really isn't a fit mother despite her best intentions.Thru most of the film, we witness Moonee's joie de vivre, her laughter, her impudence, but it isn't till the authorities come to take her into foster care that we see her truly angry. She manages to elude them & flees to her best friend's house & here for the first time we see her in tears. Her friend is so moved by her anguish that - without even needing to know what the trouble is - she grabs Moonee's hand & the two children run away together. To Disney World, no less. Significant symbolism here, I guess eh? The innocence of youth seeking refuge in the beguiling illusion of a glitzy hyper-marketed amusement park. Just another of those unresolved endings so common in films nowadays. Happily ever after, the end? Yeah, right.",The Florida Project

They love more and make friends much easier. They are ""fearless"" in a unique way, but they still get scared, since they see the injustice of the wrongfull world they live in, and make no mistake, they also understand how that affects everyone.We see these children live in a place, not so beautiful, not so friendly as it should have been, a trashy place that lacks of the basics. But what an irony, just next to their residence, lays the largest playground of the world, a place they have never visited. Yet it seems to be far away and somehow unecessary...they have their own ""creations"" to play with.You can see deep inside the eyes of the mother, not an indifferent person, not a ""bad mother"" as many may characterise her, but an individual that tries everything to survive, not for her own self, but for her little angel who she loves unconditionaly. She struggles alone, she has no one to support her directly.This is a wonderful film. It calls to us, as viewers, to keep our eyes wide open and see what is going on. To understand the chaos of being without support, the gap that exists, forshadowed by a false progress and prosperity. Is there truly a salvation for all these?At least a temporary ""shelter"" may be found by a child's innocent yet truly mature heart. A shelter of colour and castles, noise and music. Not for having fun but to hide among the many, among ""the masses"", disguised, became unrecognisable in that ephimeral fairytale of well being.",The Florida Project
207,mmendez-22089,The Practice of Accepting a Situation as it is,9,20 September 2017,"I had the privilege to catch an early viewing of this film along with a Q&A with writer/director/editor Sean Baker. Many know him from his breakout hit Tangerine (2015); I was sucked into his world since the release of Starlet (2012). Something that he never ceases to portray is the messed up realism that is hidden within our world and the Florida Project capture this in the most purest and colorful of ways.The story follows a ruthlessly mischievous 6-year old named Moonee who, along with a couple friends, explore, disrupt, criticize and takeover a simple hotel complex just on the outskirts of Disney World. She lives with her young, tattooed mother, who seems to have issues of her own, but seems content and manages to pay rent (almost) every week. Taking place over the summer, these kids are free to do as they please, that is, since there parents are not too strict. And being around tourists who can't afford the Disney Resort, they can make a lot of fun out of it. From panhandling money for ice cream to turning off the electricity in the hotel, these badmouthed hoodlums do it all. One thing this film captures well is the freedom children have and how far they go to test the waters of life. It was very easy to get lost in this film, making it completely enjoyable. I was worried about the kids being a bit over exaggerating, but they really weren't and every thing they did seemed natural and true to their character. I especially want to point out Halley, Moonee's mother, and her performance. I have never seen a character like her played so superbly and so factual. You will see as the story unfolds that she is a very complex person who, like a child, struggles to maintain complacency with the people around her.Another element I would like to touch up on is the camera work. By far one of the best storytelling methods for a film such as this that is mostly from a child's point of view. The colours being so vibrant and wide angles that show how big the world really is. The gorilla-style as well really depicts how on-the-go they are and trivial most disruptions are.One last thing I want to touch up on is that there is a number of great shots with a helicopter zooming away. I am unsure if it was intentional or if there was a popular helipad near by, but this was a great part of the film that was subtly used. To me it represented freedom, and escape from the world, referring to how fast it can get away. It is not everyday you come across a film like The Florida Project and I definitely intend on seeing it again, as it is simply rewatchable. Getting a taste of authentic realism in art nowadays is one of the most beautiful gifts we can receive. Enjoy!",The Florida Project
208,mariamakesmusic,"The good, bad and the ugly",4,15 April 2018,"The good - Dafoe, the directing, the set, the editing/timing - just technically this is a work of art. The bad - Moonie and her mother. While many people who don't like this movie say the three kids were ""bratty"", it's Moonie, the child who in many scenes comes across as the ""ring leader"" among her ""friends"" who isn't just bratty but is a down right sociopath. The idea that she could be ""whisked"" away by ""children's aid"" and this would change is totally not the case in this situation at all. The idea that poverty is to blame for their behaviour and/or that the dysfunctional parenting is to blame, is really where the UGLY comes in. I think the ugly of this movie is that it portrays that many people who are in marginalized circumstances like this have a very high probability of ending up like these characters when not only are there alternatives to their situations, but there are so many impoverished kids who DO NOT behave in this way and that there are many privileged, well-to-do kids WHO DO behave just like these kids did in the movie and/or who have parents just like this. So what does this film do - absolutely nothing. There wasn't even an ending which goes to further prove - a whole lot of nothing. If this film did ANYTHING it was to further degrade and stigmatize ""the poor"" and reduce them to helpless, degenerates - which can't be further from the truth. Sociopathic mental illness does not have a price tag, does not have a gender, race or culture. This was a pseudo-documentary subjecting the viewer to witness one sociopathic act after another and for what purpose? Shock value? Saddistic amusement? Either way the lens was highly distorted and while it comes across as a ""realistic"" portrayal of impoverished/marginalized sub-cultures, in my opinion, this can't be farther from the truth.",The Florida Project

210,mbruce007,A tale of bittersweet lives in the shadow of DisneyWorld...,8,9 October 2020,"It is true that nowadays many cinema-goers, or TV viewers, for that matter, have a penchant for what's ""real"" or ""realistic"" about the complicated world in which we live today. To use a technical term, you might say that many budding young filmmakers are on a personal quest to create ""verisimilitude"" in their films. It is this arguable semblance of truth that director Sean Baker attempts to uncover in The Florida Project. I was offered a free ticket for this film (a perk of having an annual membership at my local cinema). I had also seen a short trailer for the film preceding another feature a few months ago but, not knowing the work of Sean Baker, the prospect of watching it did not resonate with me immediately. However, merely two weeks ago, the tweeting of enthusiast film buffs and critics alike appeared on my radar. (I use the term figuratively, and I'm not just talking about the confines of Twitter). I decided that a much talked-about film, (and a freebie, at that), was too good to pass up. My verdict: one of the most simplistic, yet profound, films I've ever had the pleasure of watching.The film follows a group of young children, headed by 6-year old Moonee (the wonderful Brooklynn Prince) whose families live in neighbouring cheap motels, the most prominent of which is ""The Magic Castle"", Moonee's ""home"". The manager of the business is Bobby (a seamless performance by Willem Dafoe, which has already brought him Oscar-hype). Bobby attends unfailingly to the maintenance problems, as well as being mediator in the many domestic disputes which surround him. The cause of most of these problems is Mooney's mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite), a dysfunctional young single parent who is scarcely able to get by with her rent, and, the money she does earn, she gets by improper means.With no concrete story-line, The Florida Project is best described as a ""slice of life"" of the, perhaps, unseen Florida, the largely downtrodden sphere which hangs in the shadow of the money-spinning mecca that is Disney World. With the Cinderella Castle and other wonders remaining only a figment of the children's imagination, they are forced to create their own fun, often running amok, with not a parent in sight. They get into variously funny, serious, and embarrassing situations. The leader of the pack, the aforementioned Brooklynn Prince (a precocious young actress) has a certain joie de vivre that befits a young carefree child. However, this is, at times, curtailed by her being a premature witness to the harsh realities of life, often when we, the viewers, least expect it.Most of the beauty of this film lies in its authentic location shooting, and, despite its quasi-documentary feel, I'm glad that the cinematographer opted for wide, often sun-drenched, shots, dispensing with handheld camerawork which, in my opinion, is overused in many of the films of today. These effects, plus the very natural acting of all the players, makes for a film which is anything but manufactured entertainment. So seemingly real is everything that one would think it possible, for example, to step right into the screen and join in on the shenanigans of the children. Absolutely essential viewing.",The Florida Project

212,mherrin-43253,Humanity behind Fantasy and Poverty,7,25 April 2018,"The Florida Project: Directed by Sean Baker and written by Sean Baker and Chris BergochThe latest film from the director of Tangerine takes us in the Chicken Shack into the budget motels just outside of Wal Disney World in Orlando. They come complete with bright, garish colors and low prices to catch people's attention. It is also a place where those who have fallen on hard luck find a place to live. We meet Moonee and her mom Halley living their life while trying to survive the best ways Halley knows how. From the outside these kids are allowed to run wild and cause trouble everywhere they go. You would immediately think of negligent parents and wild kids. You wouldn't be far off from the point. Halley can't seem to get her life together. She wants to party and doesn't think of anything spewing venomous profanity and scamming people to keep on living. This movie is not one with a traditional plot to speak of. It takes you through these people's day to day lives mainly the children and the motel's manager played by a very understated Willem Dafoe. It feels real. It feels like a documentary even with a movie star like Willem Dafoe in it. It does feel long though. The meandering pace to it can make it feel longer than it might actually be. This film is truly about the lengths that some people will go to spare children from the harsh realities of poverty. Desperation times brings out desperate measures as the saying goes. Halley takes a turn to crime and it brings about the inevitable downfall. It is a sweet movie. It is a sad movie. The ending ,even though you know it's coming because this path was always the destination, still hit me. You know everyone means well for this child especially Bobby the manager. He cares deeply about these kids and he does what he can to keep them out of trouble. These were real people living just outside of the fantasy world created by Disney. This is a similar story to what Sean Baker did with Tangerine. With that said, it's a sad movie. It can be incredibly bleak at times. It can drag at moments. I think it is a movie that people should see at least once. I give this film a B.",The Florida Project

It is a sublime character and behavioural study with fantastically credible acting. It juxtaposes kids and adults building and destroying love and friendship among and across generations. It is enables adults to touch base with their childhood. It focuses on poor broken down families rebuilt in mix & match fashion by force of circumstances making do as best they can. They constantly come up against unsympathetic strict community moral straitjackets. It uncovers how living day to day on the fringe of capitalist 'progressive' America takes its toll. Everyday small events drop into place to play out the story in a realistic 'just so' style. The end is both heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A fallen tree which defiantly continues to grow and a helicopter which annoyingly repeatedly takes off only make sense at the end.

Another thing that kind of got to me was the mother's behavior that was so out of control it almost seemed incompatible with being able to function in society. And almost worse than that was the hotel manager's tolerance of it. It was unrealistic the way he would just turn a blind eye to her raging against him when he had just given her a break on the rent, etc. That just didn't make sense to me.",The Florida Project
218,regexfan,Reality Meets Fantasy,7,31 October 2020,"I would have to say I loved Tangerine a lot more than The Florida Project. Both have the same vibe. They're not for everyone. If you're looking for a plot, or a conflict to be solved, Sean Baker movies might not be for you. The Florida Project doesn't rely on plot. There's no actual story to tell. It's a portrayal of a world often overlooked. A world that is bleak and grim, always looked down upon, sidelined, as if it doesn't exist. It's a stark contrast to the backdrop of the movie where it takes place; the sunshine state of Florida, and the colorful magical world of Disney.One reviewer here on IMDb said it's hard for them to sympathize with any of the characters despite the director trying very hard to make them feel so. I don't think that's what the director or this movie sets out to do at all. It's not trying to make the viewers sympathize with any of the characters. If you sympathize with the characters, great. If you despise the characters, great. If you don't feel anything for the characters, great. What you feel about the characters is entirely up to you.The movie is like an acted out documentary. A fictitious documentary. It doesn't take sides or try to shove a ""message"" in your face. It wants you to see this world that some of us rarely think about. It's not what most people of Florida would talk about when asked about their state. It's not what tourists from around the globe would think of when they think of visiting Florida. But it is there, it's part of what Florida is. The scene with the Brazilian tourist symbolized this. The Brazilian tourist seemed to be surprised and upset that the motel she arrived in looked nothing like what she pictured in her Disney fantasies. It's funny because the building doesn't look rundown or ghetto, but it just doesn't match her expectation of the Florida she thinks she's visiting. This might as well be called ""The America Project"". It's what America is on the surface, versus what America really is.I think this is the reason realism is very important in Sean Baker movies. He wants to portray these overlooked worlds as realistic as possible, as close to reality as possible. I think it's very courageous and I applaud him for doing it. A very fine film making here. And that ending, I couldn't think of a better ending than that. Again, remember, the ending is not about the characters or what's going to happen to the characters. The movie is never about that.",The Florida Project

Its a decent film that goes on way too long even after its made all its relevant points. There isn't a lot of story here, and that's fine written on paper. Plenty of great movies are not story driven. But typically if your film is less driven by story and more driven by themes and realism than it shouldn't be over 90 minutes. This was almost two hours which is excessive. The acting by the mom is great, and the little girl is pretty good too for the most part (especially the last scene) and Willem Dafoe, while not having all that much to do, still manages to shine. There are also other good supporting actors too. At the end of the day it just doesn't feel like it was worth my two hours. Nothing about the story, themes, or production really blew me away. And with the exception of a couple scenes there is nothing stand out about this film.",The Florida Project
220,gatheringsnow,A Tale of Two Worlds,9,5 May 2020,"Honestly, I did not expect much going into this film. To me it seemed like just another run of the mill film about people living in the dredges of society and trying to live day by day, however when the film began I was surprised to see a rather bright and happy looking backdrop to an otherwise seedy looking motel in Florida where kids still laugh and play like kids do just about anywhere, with the only differences being the added threats more common to lower income families, like curious strangers passing through with unknown and possibly malicious intentions, drug addiction, violence, and desperation. Unlike other movies that strive to be as bleak as possible given the setting, The Florida Project manages to set itself apart by portraying all of these things from a child's perspective as opposed to an adults. When these things are a day to day occurrence as opposed to something kids are rarely exposed to, they will simply regard such life as normal because they don't know any other world exists out there beyond the confines of their narrow perception. As a result, instead of crying and screaming about it, they still find ways to enjoy life and find happiness in situations other more privileged kids might find soul shattering or devastating to their psyche.This film was not directed by Harmony Korine but the seeming lack of plot and focus on characters going through the dredges of every day life felt very reminiscent to me of films like Gummo and Spring Breakers, especially the setting in regards to the latter. Instead Sean Baker, a filmmaker I'm not too familiar with helmed this project and I am genuinely surprised at how much it affected me emotionally, as growing up my life was similar to the main girl in this film Moonee (Brooklyn Prince), being raised by a single mom and being put into foster care are all experiences I've been through. Was my childhood all doom and gloom, not even close, were there times I wished I could trade my life for some other kids? You bet, but in a way such experiences shape who we are, and I feel I wouldn't be the person I am today because of it. For as depressing as this film can get at times, it also manages to be incredibly beautiful, with stellar cinematography, and outstanding performances from the already mentioned main girl and her close friends Scooty, Dicky, and Jancey, a new friend who met Moonee in unexpected circumstances as anyone who's seen the film will know. Also to be commended is Willem Dafoe in another great performance as Bobby, the gruff but caring manager of the motel Moonee and her mom Halley live in, and Halley herself, played by Bria Vinaite, whom I've never seen before live most of the actors and actresses in this film but she managed to create a very real and alternately repulsive and endearing character who may represent a future version of her daughter, the contrast in both of their worldviews is definitely worth noting.Ultimately an experience I would not want to go through twice because it hits too close to home in some of the more dramatic scenes but nevertheless The Florida Project was one ride I have to say I enjoyed thoroughly.",The Florida Project

222,vinylvanilla,"An Overrated, Empty Movie about Bad Parenting",5,7 January 2018,"The trailer and summary of this movie are absurdly misleading. They may make you think this is a beautiful movie about childhood and upbringing, just like Little Miss Sunshine, but it's definitely not like that.Here, we have Halley, a terrible, irresponsible single mother who raises her 7-year-old daughter in the worst possible way in a motel in Florida. This woman says bad words in front of her daughter, feeds her with junk food all the time, doesn't teach anything useful or good. Besides, she prostitutes herself while her daughter takes a bath in the same room. There are no redeeming qualities about Halley. The movie fails to raise empathy for her and for her obnoxious daughter, since it fails to accurately and efficiently develop its characters. I understand this movie tried to show child abuse from a different perspective, but it ended up being empty and shallow. All we see is hyperactive children being obnoxious to everybody and running errands , while their mothers and parents are absent and irresponsible. No background of any character whatsoever. No psychological profile. Only a mother who throws fits when things don't go her way and her daughter who behaves the same way. When you're recording a movie about child abuse and negligence, you have to make sure you'll either make the audience feel some kind of empathy for the child or for the mother. In here, we don't have any. The movie focused too much action on WHAT the characters do, and not WHY the characters do it. Willem Dafoe was basically wasted in this movie. Such a marvelous, talented actor should never be hired just to have a supporting role as a motel manager while the rest of the cast with their mediocre performances have much more screen time. I honestly don't see anything special about Brooklynn Price's performance. She behaved like a kid, nothing groundbreaking about that. And Bria Vinaite as Halley only threw fits and gave the middle finger to people - I won't judge too harshly her performance though, because the main flaw her is the screen script, not her performance - she had to work with what she was given. Cinematography is fine, and so is photography. Beautiful color palette that makes us remind of the Disney World parks. But that just it. What could be a dark yet beautiful movie about child abuse and upbringing became an empty portrait of an irresponsible mother and her obnoxious child. We'll never care about them because the movie didn't care to give us some of their background.

However, halfway through the movie I realized there was really no plot, just kids running around Kissimmee Florida doing kids stuff, while the dead beat mother gets railed in a motel room for some money to help pay the rent. The movie had HUGE potential for some deeply moving moments, but it was just all superficial- You can't really care about these characters b/c you don't know why they came to stay at the motel, where's the father. Also, hearing f*** ever other word got nerve-racking after a while. I know there are bad parents but this movie that the opportunity be inspring and heartwarming, to turn dead beat mom in to a better person- what would have been awesome is if the couple that had accidentally booked a stay at the motel had fostered a relationship with mom Halley and Mooney, and had made Halley do a 180 and made her a character you can sympathize with.

228,breheneyjames,"Beautiful, effervescent and touching...One of the year's best.",10,19 December 2017,"'The Florida Project' is co-written and directed by Sean Baker and stars child actress Brooklyn Prince as Moonee, a wide-eyed and adventurous 6 year old girl who lives in a budget motel outside Disney World in Orlando, Florida with her mother Halley (Bria Vinaite). These motels are supposed to be temporary residences for tourists but the motel manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe) makes an exception for people like Halley and Moonee because otherwise they would have nowhere else to go. The movie takes place over a summer period as we follow Moonee and her friends on their magical adventures of childhood whilst their parents deal with difficult times. Baker manages to achieve once again what others fail at- Telling a story about people dealing with hardship in this case poverty without it feeling exploitative or overdone. In fact most of the time the audience doesn't even feel like they are watching someone else's version of events, you just feel like a fly on the wall experiencing the children's childhood wonder and the parents struggles. This is helped all the more by the authentic and raw performances across the board. Brookyln Prince is a major discovery here as her portrayal of Moonee and her chemistry with the rest of the cast is off the charts. Bria Vinaite is also impressive especially considering this is her acting debut and that she was discovered on Instagram by Baker. Dafoe has said in interviews that he lived in one of the motels for a week and shadowed a real-life motel manager to ensure that he picked up on the nuances of the people who actually do it. It is very telling in the film as his performance is wonderful and one of the best of his illustrious career. He is the heart and soul of the film as the kind, considerate and caring Bobby.Another thing I really appreciated is the cinematography and the use of vibrant color in the movie which brilliantly reflects the innocence and optimism of Moonee and her friends. It also offers a nice poignant juxtaposition between the characters harsh circumstances and the fact that they live on the doorstep of every child's dream place, Disney World. Initially I did have one reservation about 'The Florida Project' and that concerned the ending. When I first saw it I thought it felt out of place and a bit of a cop out. However, when I thought about it for a little while, just after the movie, in the context of what happens beforehand I came to the conclusion that it makes perfect sense. So to wrap up, 'The Florida Project' is a beautiful, poignant and triumphant portrait of childhood and of the best films of the year.",The Florida Project

Most scenes is of the pranks and 100 metre adventures the kids engage in and the little misunderstandings between the adults and their way of coping up with the life.
Director Sean baker has become my new favourite director. I believe a good director is someone who could get the best performances. The kids have played their part so well and it seems like Sean baker just took a camera and followed into their secret lives and conversations.
In the end the authority try to seize the child and relocate her. The happy badass punk kid moonie we've seen throughout the film breaks our heart when all her rainbow happiness breaks down and she is brought to bare reality by the situation. She runs away from the authority and goes to her best friends room and says ""this may be the last time I'm might see you"" and cries. Her cry is something no one is ever prepared for as a child. Most of us who've had a traumatic moment in our childhood can instantly relate to her. And those who haven't had any will also be left in tears, because that's how well the actor has played the part and that's how well Sean baker has directed the film.

232,roccomannott,Good film but the kids were annoying AF,7,19 June 2020,"I love indie films, (Napoleon Dynamite,Clerks)
I was excited to see a film through the eyes of a child in a drama/comedy.
It has some good writing (for the most part) it was visually outstanding but the biggest problem with this film is..........the extremely annoying kids. They have the most cringe-inducing lines I've ever saw on film.I was shaking head and just looking away from how bad the kids acting were.
It's a shame on the writer that he wrote garbage and truly stupid dialogue for the ""main characters"". Overall,it's a good film but don't expect the kids to be the stars of this, there not and will never be good actors",The Florida Project

234,petkanasw,A sleeper gem of character study,10,11 May 2020,"From the description you might thinks this is some kind of uplifting film about getting by in hard times. It's not. It's a character study of a class of people who have pretty much given up and don't even realize it. To be fair, society has no use for them either, and they live week to week in a budget motel in Florida with no prospects for the future. It's bleak but fascinating as their lives slog along, a successful mom working in a diner, a guy who thinks things will be better in New Orleans, and the central figure, a petit-crime type and occasional hooker and her adorable, pre-criminal kid. You get the impression that the mom's childhood was much like her kid's and the cycle will repeat.Don't expect plot - there isn't any. It's a series of vignettes that drive from point to point along their hopeless lives. It's captivating and you want to look away, but it's hard not to watch. Part of my reaction comes from the fact that this is such a true story. Early on, I was a social welfare examiner in New York and had to deal with people like these characters and this film could be a documentary. Many of my clients would say they've had it with us and move to Florida to start a new and successful life and they usually returned within a year to resume the same life as before. They were at once, maddening and heartbreaking in real life and the director and actors in this film capture that so well. You'll find yourself with a mixture of anger and empathy.",The Florida Project

Just the same old same old repeated throughout the movie. The adult characters were about as interesting as watching paint dry, as said kids run riot, set a building on fire and seemed to spend their entire, aimless lives without any meaningful parental control or direction. I paid £1 to rent this from the public library and it's going back tomorrow. The DVD contains ""Making Of..."" footage and other extras, but I'm really not interested.

236,dswhitcomb,Reminded me why I hate Florida,5,8 April 2018,"Based on the trailers and reviews for TFP I was surprised and excited when I saw this movie pop up for free on Amazon Prime. I guess that should have been my first clue that this movie wasn't what I thought it was. A stream of conciseness film mostly from the viewpoint of low camera angles as we follow miscreant children through a typical day living outside the borders of ""the happiest place in earth"". The juxtaposition was not missed on this reviewer. The children spend their days finding ways to fill their summer days while their single moms found ways to pay for the weekly rent and their seedy roadside motels. A lot of brightly colored buildings house these lost families and does little to brighten up their lot in life. There isn't a formula plot here. It took me a bit to realize that but what I did enjoy is the dialogue these children came up with to feed their minds. Reminded me of my childhood when we would go outside and play all day, finding things to do whether it was safe or not. The distractions are not an accident here. A lot of ambient noise via a helicopter, yelling, chatter, et al. Those moments contrast with the several quiet moments in the film where we see the slow moments of a life with little to do and no money to do it. We are left with an outside looking in viewpoint with all the characters. I feel that was intentional as a comment of what we pass by on our way to our perfect family vacation package set up by our travel agents. These children never get to see the Magic Kingdom, only it's roadside trash. The children are real and I enjoyed their adventures. My favorite is when they are happy with just having a sleepover in their claustrophobic motel rooms claiming, ""this is going to be the best sleepover ever"". 
TFP is not for everyone and I can understand all the negative reviews. It doesn't adhere to major market formulas. That is what I was surprised by most of all. I have a feeling this is one of those quiet films that sits with you a while after you see it.",The Florida Project
237,jpsimmons-72015,Missed the Mark... completely,5,20 May 2020,"My problem with this film is there is no character progression and barely any story development. Every character stayed the exact same from start to finish. Willem Dafoe is a nice guy that never gets the balls to do anything, but I actually don't mind this for his role as much. The kids stay annoying and one dimensional throughout the entire film, and the mom is just a bipolar b*tch the entire movie, we don't find out anything about her past to explain why she is this way or to make us sympathetic toward her.My second issue is the story kinda goes nowhere. This is one of those films where you feel like you were robbed of your time at the end. There are quite a few moments where you feel like the story is going somewhere intriguing but it just doesn't. Then when we finally get to the final act we are just left with a vague, lazy ending that leaves the fate of the main characters up to interpretation.People that overhype this movie definitely have their head up their a$$ or are just followers that get their opinions from other reviewers. This movie is not as deep as people act like it is. 6/10 AT BEST if I'm being generous.",The Florida Project

On one hand its an original experience when you cant tell if you are watching a documentary or a scripted film. The behaviors and ""lines"" are so trashy and often with no substance that it definitely feels like things that people in that culture and poverty would say and do....On the other hand in its attempt to be as gritty and real as possible it lost camerawork and focus on characters expressions and feelings that would have helped to tug on the heart strings. Like any decent human being I felt pity for the children and mixed feelings about the parents doing their best but still remaining trashy, but there was so much room to expound on these feelings and moments. Instead they feel like hidden camera catching what really happened. This wasn't sad in a romanticized way, it was sad in an icky real way.Lastly, my personal bias was that I couldn't relate to almost any of the main characters so at best this was (for me) a window into incredibly bad choices and living in them...a place I am too far removed from.",The Florida Project

240,esthercross,A hard cake to swallow but the icing is pretty,8,30 November 2017,"For me I didn't immediately click with the story but the quality which caused this barrier early on ultimately became of one the films main assets. This film is unique in its presentation of the events and whilst I tried to catch hold of a thread of narrative I soon realised the film is less of an actual story and more of an immersive dip into a very particular world. Once you become familiar with the films tone it is much easier to appreciate the piece as an observant piece of art. The film follows a community living within a low-cost motel struggling to keep a head above water in a world where the basic needs are met in a haphazard way. More importantly, the film captures the ingenuity from both the children and the adults to create good times and how they relish the freedom within a rule-less micro-society in which they live. The story loosely follows a young mother called Halley (Bria Vinaite) trying to keep up with her weekly rent as her charmingly anarchic daughter Moonee (Brooklyn Prince) turns the run down town into a playground and chance for exploration. A lot of the films energy comes from the exceptional performance by Prince who manages to capture so many qualities of childhood so perfectly that I found her performance to be almost nostalgic. Her performance was not just child-like it also expressed an inner maturity that comes from a challenging upbringing where no hardship is hidden. Halley at one point resorts to taking bikini shots in order to sell herself online and involves Moonee in fun of the photography process. Interestingly when moments like this occur the film doesn't tonally condemn her actions. What is presented is an interesting documentary-style of conveying the extreme and unhealthy parenting methods from mother Halley but without inferring any judgement either way. The film seems to shine a sympathetic spotlight however on all the characters through Willem Defoe's Character 'Bobby' who runs the Motel. Bobby is conflicted through his duty to collect rent and maintain order but is almost a vehicle for the film to express a strong empathy towards the characters who act out against the system but are unable to change their status. I think it is a fascinating element of the film that whilst everything feels uncontrived and raw the action is surrounded by garish colour and quirky backdrops. A lot of the shots in the film where taken from down low and often you where able to take a child's perspective in the scene. The choices made with lurid building colour's and clothes effectively show the world through a child's eye, viewing everything as an opportunity for imagination and adventure whilst remaining oblivious to the hardship of the real world. The detail in this film is breath-taking there are so many small touches made with props or script which make the events feel so real to watch. If this film was a picture you could zoom in for miles and still find details that make up this richly constructed world.",The Florida Project

242,silverturquoise,A pure and honest film with some amazing performances,9,15 November 2017,"Ironically, I saw this film because my first choice sold out at the theater. I had seen the trailer but wasn't excited to see the film because it focused on poverty, something I'd prefer not to think about. But I'm really glad I saw this beautifully honest film. The film is set at a motel near Orlando, but there are many motels like this one all across America (including a couple very close to where I live).The film tells the story of Mooney, a six-year-old girl living with Hailey, her single unemployed mother, in a motel that rents week to week to families that cannot afford an apartment of their own. The story is told from Mooney's point of view to the point where you feel like you are a child again. No other film has made me recall the summers of my own childhood quite like this one. Despite the many harsh struggles depicted in this film, it captures the freedom and joy of childhood in a touching way. The most surprising aspect of this film is the three powerhouse acting performances. Two come from complete newcomers to acting, Brooklynn and Bria, as daughter Mooney and mother Hailey. And the third is from Willem Dafoe as Bobby, the motel manager who is also a part-time mediator, guardian angel, enforcer, and comedian. These three performances are just so pure, honest, and amazing - they really carry the film and its message.Hailey is one of three mothers in the film, and Bria brilliantly conveys Hailey's character flaws and chaotic emotions. The other moms are the moms of Mooney's close friends Scooty and Jancey. The various experiences of the three mother characters compare and contrast the sacrifices and mistakes of single mothers faced with poverty. It will be interesting to see what the future brings for Brooklynn and Bria, given this great debut.",The Florida Project

250,carkol2005,A really really hit or really really miss.,6,13 April 2019,"Man, what a mixed bag of a movie. I usually need to spoil things of the plot to expose the goodness or badness of it but not this time: basically you got a slice of life of people struggling to survive. That's not inherently a good or bad plot, you just have to work with it in order to make a fine, nuanced piece of work. But because of its nature most reviewers say that the movie is 'empty', which I agree, but not for the same reasons: I think is empty of interesting characters.The problem, even when could seem not such a major thing, does extend itself to other aspects of the movie. By 'not interesting' I mean one note, stale, wooden. This affects the plot hugely because they behave the EXACT way always, doesn't matter what happens. If the situation is unbearable, if something bad is going around, the characters don't react to the situation: the kid is a spoiled brat, the mother is one of the worst mothers I've ever seen, and that's it. They don't move from there. God, you would think that being so poor, so aimless in life, they would have to face problems and shout to each other at least sometimes. But no, when they are together their personality evaporates, there is no conflict, nothing. She doesn't have a moment of doubt, any remorse, absolutely nothing! I mean, there are a lot of trashy mothers in the world, I'm sure. But, unless you are a psychotic child abuser or a braindead heroin junkie, I think you would have some guilt, some internal struggle of what you're doing to your child.
The same goes to the mother's friend. They call themselves a bad word and that's it! Come on! Even the whitest trash ever had a conversation with some depth with her friend once! Nobody is so one note, so empty! ESPECIALLY a mother!! Hello? Besides, do they expect me to believe that such a brainless, unstable person was able to raise a kid , with NO help whatsoever? Even Dafoe, with his excellent performance btw, is one dimensional. He takes care of the building, and that's it! He doesn't evolve, he doesn't show feelings AT ALL. The only moment that does is in the ending, but the movie chickens out before he starts showing and he doesn't have a closure as a character, nor helps the plot in any way. Disappointing.And that's when the movie really miss. But, for what is worth, when the movie hits, hits. The directing is interesting, the camerawork is well done and helps the sequences to unfold, the setting is subtly established through several scenes which is interesting (like the helicopter or the guys who missed Disneyland) and some moments of the movie are as well subtly charged with subtext- which I won't spoil, you will spot it. I found myself enjoying these elements of the movie. The acting I thought was phenomenal too, I genuinely wanted to kill every character for being so obnoxious, I mean, I ate it up completely and didn't feel like they were acting!Unfortunately, now that I think about the plot, there were some few misses too. Even for a slice of life plot, the second act in some point felt like a little monotonous, repetitive, like if the movie struggled to flow and was afraid to move on to the next plot point. Moreover, I'm not sure if the ending works at all. It seems a little too open to me. I've already talked about Dafoe, but the last sequence ends a little too abrupt. I might be wrong in that one, maybe it's not bad but I think it could have been better.Overall a decent 6.2/10",The Florida Project

It scared me to see children allowed to run wild, do what they want, and go unsupervised. Then that I became aware that this is the toll that poverty takes on children and parents breeding an antisocialism in life. I don't think the picture takes sides, but just shows, and we see that in spite of the environment, there can be love for mother and child. Set against the fantasy world these people live in their struggles are more pronounced, The director manages to get incredible performances out of the children, and we see goodness in the motel manager who understands where these people are coming from.

Not that this scene is monumental in moving the plot, but that instance of perception by the child is indicative of her wisdom, well beyond her years.The Florida Project follows the intertwining lives of Moonee, her unbalanced mother, Halley, played by Bria Vinaite, and Willem Dafoe's character, Bobby Hicks, the manager of an extended-living motel. Shot in 35mm film, director, Sean Baker, puts strong emphasis on the human condition of these ultimately deprived individuals. Moonee and her pals find entertainment in petty trouble making, spitting on cars, tricking passerby into buying them ice cream, to serious a more serious offense in arson. The unfortunate circumstance stems from her mother involving her in the multiple means of solicitation to keep up with rent, put food on the table, and enjoy life's simple pleasures.Bobby Hicks, though constantly frustrated with the behavior of both Moonee and Halley, takes on a father-like role, a situation he is reluctant to be in, but serves as redemption, as it is briefly alluded to that his relationship is strained with his own son. His passion is evident in many instances trying to protect the girls. Overall, the acting is superb on all fronts, creating a very real look into this hole of despair outside of the ""happiest place on earth."" Brooklynn Prince's portrayal of Moonee highlights the juxtaposition of skewed sense of innocence and alternative maturity that emanates from her upbringing and surroundings.

265,chestern-80136,Visually gorgeous but grating in character.,5,12 February 2018,"Of all of the Awards Season hopefuls going into the Oscars, this one seems to be getting snubbed the hardest. At least, that's what I'd heard going in to this particular film. The Florida Project has received only one Oscar nod (for Willem Defoe's supporting role). Much to my surprise, however, I agree with it's singular nomination, however I would have liked to see it get a nod for it's cinematography, also.As an antisocial person, I feel this film unintentionally captures my general outlook on the world, so in a way, I can derive my own meaning from it. The parts I enjoy greatly feature almost no people. The cinematography is astoundingly gorgeous, and the locations, however bleak they may be, are beautiful in their desolation. The lighting looked very natural and as a result, many of the scenes felt rather intimate, almost mirroring real life. This effect would have been accomplished perfectly, if it weren't for the main issue I had with the film: the performances.The characters, which many have claimed to be one of the defining features of the picture, almost ruined the film for me entirely. With a cast weighing heavily with children, however, The Florida Project was fighting an uphill battle to win my favour. I don't know why I seem to despise both children, and child actors, but regardless, the only performance I didn't mind in recent memory was Dafne Keen's Laura, featured within Logan. Still, having heard the rave reviews before going in, I was actually hopeful. Those whom I was with at the time seemed incredibly pleased with the performances, commenting on how good they were multiple times throughout the film. I was less than impressed. Right from the first scene, I found them grating. Not only are the performances (in my opinion!!) lacking, the characters themselves are infuriating. The children are written to be obnoxiously loud, and terribly rude. I completely understand why this is, but regardless, it doesn't make it any less painful for a viewer such as myself.Bria Vinaite is giving her first performance in a film. She was actually an instagram model, with no prior experience. Again, I completely understand why this casting decision was made, and I actually agree with it for the most part. Still, I felt her lack of experience was hard to ignore. Caleb Landry Jones (whom, might I add, has had a wonderful year in cinema: This, Three Billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri, Get Out, and American Made) is barely in the film long enough to notice. I can remember two scenes, in which he does barely anything. The one performance which I actually enjoyed was Willem Defoe (which is rather odd to me as I can still only picture him as the Green Goblin). He plays Bobby, who is the one likeable character within the film. Naturally, he is the one character who is almost entirely pointless.I understand he's a sort of morale compass, and he seems to legitimately care for these demon-spawn children, but ultimately none of his scenes equate to anything of importance. That's a theme that runs through the film: pointlessness. Early in the film, you can tell where the plot will go. Still, it takes it's time, meandering through scene after scene, rarely impacting the next. When the emotional climax finally came, I was so detached from the characters, I felt nothing but lacklustre contentedness that the characters would be better off than when they started.Straight after watching the film, I think I would have given it a 6/10. It was visually stunning despite showing very little of interest. Having had time to reflect, however, I feel I am generous in giving it a 5/10. All I took from it was the visuals, and a single serviceable character with a great performance behind it. I completely understand why many people enjoy this film, and I'm glad that it's found it's audience. Unfortunately, I am not a part of it.",The Florida Project
266,beattygallery-12793,A hollowed out America - The Future Today,10,2 January 2018,"Quite an extraordinary movie in the now. A hollowed out contemporary America which refuses to acknowledge (actually shuts its eye) those on the fringes and systemic failure to provide strong social programs & safety nets. Its not prophetic; it is.The garish artificial food outlets, bad food, poor mans food, closed medical centres, abandoned derelict candy-coloured houses, half-way motels full of people who've fallen through the cracks or never had the opportunity of good education, good health or a solid roof over their heads let alone a job which pays a liveable wage.Its particularly poignant today as the rich get richer bursting with wealth and the poor become more desperate, scrambling around trying to survive and so few care.The juxtaposition of the cheap bleached motels against the nearby golf course & Disneyland? (fantasyland) over which helicopters came & went as the feral children gave them the middle finger was spot on. Disneylands always been an American mirage and this movie brings people right back to earth with a deliberate thud.Congratulations to Sean Baker, all the actors and those prepared to present an American truth.",The Florida Project
267,graphicstyle7,Amazingly accurate slice of life,10,12 February 2018,"I've lived in Florida most of my life, both totally broke and with funds. This film captures perfectly the atmosphere of the Florida they don't advertise. That's the Florida you see when you go outside of the big parks and new developments. The fringe areas where people end up when their lives become unmanageable for whatever reason. The warm climate and (on the surface) easygoing vibe of Florida make it a magnet for those down on their luck. Usually, these people are invisible, but this film tells their side.I really don't understand the bad reviews for this. This is a ""slice of life"" movie, the kind you don't see often. It's not about shiny cars and explosions, it's about real people. Apparently, just like Disney, some of the more shallow members of our society have little empathy for those who can't afford life in these United States.Heartbreaking, poignant, and very meaningful cinema of a type I don't often see. Watch it.",The Florida Project
268,kiwikwi,The Kids Are Not Gonna Be Alright,10,29 December 2017,"""The Florida Project"" is a social realist drama in the disguise of a lighthearted comedy. It certainly starts out on a high note, with the soundtrack lyrics telling us to ""Celebrate good times, come on!"", as we the audience tags along with a group of kids being the adorable little monsters that kids their age can be.The ""Florida Project"", of course, was a code name for what would eventually become the Walt Disney World Resort, and ""Celebration"" is not just a Kool & the Gang song, but also the name of the Disney-developed community outside the resort. The movie, though, takes places in the real world, just outside Disney's walled garden.It is a testament to the talent of the filmmakers that the movie manages to affect a joyous tone throughout, even as it depict the stark socioeconomic reality of making a living, one day at a time, at the bottom rungs of the social ladder.The kids are having (quite literally) the time of their life, while the movie leaves no doubt about what the future has in store for them. Scooty's mother is working a minimum-wage job, yet tasked with acting as the provider for both Scooty and Moonee. Jancey is living with her grandmother, because her mother is gone (to alcohol, drugs or worse, the movie doesn't say). Moonee's mother Halley earns a living through street peddling, stripping, theft. Later in the film, Moonee sits quietly in the bathtub while her mom prostitutes herself in the next room.The kids are left to their own devices without a smidgen of adult supervision. The resulting mischief ranges in severity from spitting on cars to burning down a building. But throughout this, the movie maintains a comedic slant, and (at least in the cinema where I watched it), the audience was roaring with laughter. It was not until Halley beats Scooty's mom black and blue, and police and social workers show up to drag the screaming Moonee from her mother, that the audience finally went quiet, as the reality of the situation could no longer be denied.The heartbreaking scene continues for several agonizing minutes before the movie finally lets up and dons its comedic disguise again. Out of nowhere, Kool & the Gang soars once again on the soundtrack, as the kids run for their life - all the way into the Disney World Resort, where they will, presumably, live happily ever after. In this final moment, the movie grants us a respite and allows us to forget that Disney World is not the real world.",The Florida Project

270,jsph_calabrese,Moonee should join the Disney Princess line,8,13 July 2018,"Writer and director Sean Baker (Tangerine) thrives telling stories about marginalized places in society, and he always opts for empathy over judgement calls in exploring the lives of his broken characters. While Willem Dafoe is great in this movie, and his presence is needed as a grounded and warm figure, Baker's employment of non-actors for most other roles is both impressive (they're convincing) and adds an extremely powerful element of realism.This honest look into severe poverty and homelessness may have been too hard to stomach if it wasn't viewed through the curious, humorous, and life-affirming perspective of Moonee, who is as much a Disney Princess as Snow White, Cinderella, or Little Mermaid. The duality of Orlando is thought-provoking and the central thesis here could very well be that ""the most magical place on earth"" is inside a child's mind, not a theme park.",The Florida Project

But if you approach it with willingness to experience the lifestyle of people very different to your own, and perhaps just try to understand it, then go ahead and give it a watch!Florida Project runs almost like a documentary but without the knowledge of people portrayed that they are being recorded, as if they made their decisions without the good or bad influence of the camera/crew/recording itself. It's hard to explain, but this movie feels more realistic and honest than any 'reality show' can ever dream to be, with a veil of empathy covering it so thinly, you have to watch really close to see it. That ultimately is what in my opinion gives Florida Project credibility, raw intensity and makes it a worthwhile watch.",The Florida Project

Also telling this mature story from the prospective of the kids is just perfect.The way the events are being showed by the prespective of the kids is a pretty good decision because the events in this movie are very mature and adult orintied and the kids don't really release that.And the last great thing(along a list of others that I wont you to see the movie and understand),is the characters.Everyone has clear goals and it's field to the grim with personality.Words can describe how much I enjoyed this movie,even the kinda weak third act(that is a problem all the A24 movies have for a reason).I can recomend this movie to pretty much everyone who want to watch a very good movie with great direction",The Florida Project

275,raphaellecat,a study on poverty in America,9,19 September 2018,"This incredible journey through the lens of a small child, let's us explore the untouched curiosity and untamed wonderment of innocence as a facade behind more serious themes. Director Sean baker directs a vivid and warm story with an undeniably alive world that often does not get portrayed and is left unseen. This is a poignant look at childhood in a demographic that is much more the real America than the one we are used to seeing in most glorified films. The depiction of poverty here is brisk and distinct, we are clearly shown a side of society that runs rampant in Greater Orlando, just outside the imagined utopia Disneyland. The weight of this, however, is beautifully lifted by the freedom and joy of Brooklyn Prince's Moonee, who expertly conveys the purity of a child wanting to play and just have fun. From this perspective, we are taken through her life as she and her little rascal friends get up to no-good and light up the screen as the foreground for this movie. The beautiful balance Sean Baker manages to create here is between what we see in the foreground (the children's innocence) and the background (surrounding poverty), always directing our eyesight but leaving us with thought provoking images and themes. This particular balance is embodied and physicalised through William Defoe's character, Bobby, who always seems to know what's going on but can only be a bystander to the world he inhabits. William Defoe further cements himself as one of the greatest character actors in the industry and gives Bobby heart and compassion. There needs to be more stories depicting parts of America for it's truest colours, without the need to drown in dramatic subject matter. As shown with The Florida Project, there can be a balance to represent some of these despairing real life tales.",The Florida Project

277,gcastles-35417,Outstanding performances from actors new and old,8,14 April 2018,"The Florida Project lifts the lid on a story few of us know- the would be homeless people trying to make ends meet whilst occupying cheap motels. The motel manager (Bobby, played by Willem Dafoe) tolerates intolerable behaviour, knowing these people have nowhere else to go. The families go about their lives, working low paying jobs if they are lucky; whilst the kids do what they can to alleviate the boredom.First time performers Bria Vinaite (Halley) and Brooklynn Prince (Moonee) are exceptional as the mother/daughter team struggling to survive. Halley is still a child herself, overwhelmed by the responsiblities of single parenthood and falling into the traps that young women do when they are desperate. Six year old Moonee creates havoc with the other children as they run amok in the surrounding area. Together, they show us a bond of tenderness, friendship, and loyalty to one another as their world begins to crumble.I felt like Brooklynn Prince and the other children must have been improvising their dialogue, since it is so natural and free flowing. However a few scenes indicate this child is an absolutely extraordinary actor. The final scenes are heart wrenching and raw, while early in the film she uses language you'd expect the adults around her to use. Either she has come straight from a poor neighbourhood to star in a film, or she is talented enough to respond to coaching. This is a performance that has to be witnessed to be believed.In terms of narrative, there is little. The film is made up of small vignettes, day to day experiences which could easily be so very boring; but they fit together seamlessly and create a story woth investing in by allowing the depth of Dafoe's and Vinaite's characters to be revealed. This is one of Dafoe's best performances, as it relies on him mostly saying variations of ""stop doing that"" to numerous people. His face and voice are so unique it is hard to forget who he is, but this performance had me watching Bobby the hotel manager rather than watching Dafoe playing Bobby the hotel manager.Visually, the film is a maelstrom of bright colours and pastels tempered by the occasional sub-tropical downpour. Emotionally, it is a film which should both distress and move you. Ultimately, this is a story about people struggling to survive in one of the world's most wealthy countries, a country which provides so little support to its poor residents they have no chance of being able to rent an apartment and adequately feed and care for their children.

279,nadiatownshend,The American Dream from the Peripheries,7,10 April 2018,"This is a wonderful little story of how kids see the world but also the harsh realities of poverty in America. 
As per the director, Sean Baker's previous, Tangerine, this also take a documentary style approach and all of the character display a reallness like no other. This in some ways is totally unique but in other ways it can make for somewhat wasted minutes on dialogue that doesn't necessarily move the story along in any way. Despite that - I think that is what Baker is going for here - a snapshot of a week or so in the life of families who are on the peripheral, people whose stories may not necessarily be told in regular Hollywood movies. Acting - The actors really do a great job in drawing together the sense of frustrations, community, their reliance on one another for comfort and support and their desperate situations. The fact that this is some of these people, incl. the kids first film roles is pretty amazing and they seem totally natural in front of the camera. 
In some ways the kids are not necessarily acting but perhaps just being themselves (aside from the swearing, one hopes). It also shows how kidIt also displays the hopelesness of the cycle of poverty perhaps. As these kids have grown up in this situation, this is all they know and their life literally revolves around this small patch of tarmac in the few connected motels. Seasoned actor William ** portrays a character with sensitivity that we are not accustomed to in his infamously menacing previous roles. He really displays the emotions of a man who cares about these families and looks out for the kids but also a man who is stuck in between his professional role as manager and his morals and care for the people at the motel. Ultimately he is as empathetic character as the others but one can't help but think they would be stuck without him and perhaps he isn't as appreciated as he should be by the residents. The cinematography was wonderful - a great mix of bright and sickly colours which really drove home the idea of the falseness of Disneyland and ultimately the American Dream. It was a stark contrast to the reality which these kids and their parents found themselves in. SPOILER *****The Ending - Ok there has been a lot of controversy surrounding the ending due to the cinematography implemented. I saw it both ways. The end was building up to a climax and was really bringing a lot of emotions out of me upon watching it but once it reached that final Disney scene, with the running and chasing down the street to finally arrive at the magic kingdom, it felt a little rushed and due to change in format of cameras and such it felt a somewhat cheap ending to an otherwise cinematically spotless movie. 
I totally get what the director was going for but I just didn't like the way it was done. 
Despite this I feel it was definitely an appropriate ending - just deserved a little more from a cinematography perspective given the rest of the film. I also thought that her mother's comments to the social services characters were really important because she was right in many ways. She really did care for her daughter and was doing what she could to make her kids life happy within the frame that she was capable of doing. She didn't really know how to be a good mother however she was trying and she loved her kid. Overall I believe this film should and must be seen - it is brilliant, different, bold and electrifying in its cinematography and the performances therein - and the message is brave and brilliant. We can make of it what we will and it inspires much debate and thought. That's what makes this film deserving of a watch. After all that is what true cinema is all about - taking risks on important stories which would otherwise not be told.",The Florida Project
280,rugg-1,a look into the horror behind the Disney facade,8,14 February 2018,"It is always interesting and sometimes amusing to read the reviews on imdb. No, this is not a film designed primarily for ""entertainment."" Though the setting is 100% American (and in some respects the very worst America has to offer), the pacing is more European. Sean Baker captures the colorful and tawdry carnival that typifies Disney-World-Florida and shows how the surface is a mere illusion of joy and happiness, with decay and degradation and poverty just inches below. At the same time, living parallel with the crumbling stucco facades and the relentlessly fake ""Happiest Place on Earth,"" are scenes of tranquil natural beauty, a rainbow, kids who take joy in each other and share their single cadged ice cream cone more or less equally. There are flashes of human kindness amid all the destructive and bad behavior, moments in which the tough facade of a character like Halley cracks, and we see her grief at the loss of her only friendship. Otherwise the only reaction she can summon when crossed is anger. Baker accomplishes the film's revelations not with a clear story-line, but with a camera that follows the daily lives of the children who revel in all the trash (without any sense that it is trash) and the adults who struggle to survive in a world where they have little purpose. One of the more revealing sequences was the one in which the children enter the ""haunted houses"" (abandoned condos) and start destroying everything they find there, even as they fantasize about the houses being hundreds of years old, ancient palace ruins. Which they then proceed to set on fire. The houses are haunted, by the ghosts of the people who lost them in the recession and the failed dreams of the people who hoped to grow rich in building them. They were also cheaply constructed, like nearly everything in this supposed ""paradise"" project. It is after the setting of this fire that Halley's only friend, the mother of Moonee's best friend, cuts off both Halley and Moonee in order to protect herself and her child. And it is after this fire that Halley's life, already precarious, takes yet another spiral downward into prostitution (which she had earlier refused to engage in while a dancer), battery, and larceny. Ultimately this leads to the loss of her child to Child Protective Services, which in one way the viewer has to applaud... but Moonee's despair at losing her (yes, loving) mother and her friends and (yes) home forbids any sense of a good resolution. So Baker inserts a concluding fantasy escape into the world of fantasy that has been lurking at the corner of the film the entire time: Disney World. I thought the film was longer than it needed to be, and I barely got any sense of the humor that some viewers seemed to experience. But it was an intelligent, beautifully filmed, critically keen, amazingly acted film.",The Florida Project
281,la_follette,Orlando Magic,9,12 February 2018,"This is a rare Hollywood movie that explores the lives of those on skid row. But it's rarer still in that it finds joy and humor in their circumstances. Most everyone knows the general plot so I'll skip it but the scene is a welfare motel in Orlando managed by the highly patient and compassionate Bobby, played by Willem Dafoe.Bobby keeps the motel functioning despite the dysfunction of its residents. There's drug dealing, late payments, fights and various violations of motel policy. Somehow, in between putting out daily fires, he has time to touch up the exterior with some fresh paint.The resident who gives Bobby more trouble than most is Halley, a tattooed tramp who has little going for her aside from an adorable kid named Moonee. And so we follow Moonee around during her summer as she spies on people, scams free ice cream and helps her mom sell perfume illegally at other (nicer) motels. Halley in short uses Moonee to make money.This is really Moonee's film, and a fascinating look at how kids even at the bottom find ways to create fun and overcome their grinding poverty. The movie could have made the easy mistake of portraying Halley as a victim but it doesn't fall for it. Halley is narcissistic, violent, dishonest and vulgar -- a poster child for tubal ligation. She smokes dope instead of watching over Moonee and films a violent fight outside the motel with her phone, screaming out ""Worrrld Starrrr."" Moonee is right there, watching it all.We don't really care about Halley, but Moonee is another story. Her salvation becomes the center of the film. Some might call this exploitative of children, but the sad fact is that there are kids out there who experience this, and have ""moms"" like Halley.

But after enduring one hour of screeching, unsupervised children, dripping obscenities as casually as they dripped ill-gotten ice cream, unsupervised by adults who were as misbehaved and irresponsible as they were, I mercifully exited the theater.This film neither amused me, nor held my attention. I kept thinking of the times I was on a flight in which the cabin had a child or two who were constantly crying, or kicking the back of my seat, only this viewing experience was worse, because I was expecting better.In the row to my right was a morbidly obese gentleman with a backpack on the seat next to him filled with chips and other snacks that he dipped into regularly, taking time between bites to laugh uncontrollable at the obscenity laden dialogue, as other members of the audience got up to leave in twos and threes.This was worse than going to a restaurant and selecting something from the menu that I was sure would give me indigestion.I go to films, not primarily to be entertained, but for the impact of drama that consists of conflicts and their eventual resolutions, that also reflect and reveal truths about myself, and the world in which I live.Maybe I left too soon to experience any resolution of conflict, but this so-called ""drama"" meandered aimlessly for a full 60 minutes, while I wished that I could look out the window at the passing clouds on that imaginary flight at 35,000 feet, and order a double Jack Daniels.I started the evening in a good mood, on a full stomach, with high hopes, and left hungry, but relieved to be out in the fresh night air.I did briefly enjoy the fantasy created and alluded to by the lush, saturated colors with references to the Magic Kingdom, but other than that, I could not find anything to like about this very painful experience.I may be in the minority, and perhaps this was too rarefied a creative effort for me to fully appreciate, but life is too short, and my instincts told me that I made the right decision to exit early.",The Florida Project

It is good without question, but what would have made it truly ""great""?The kids are, of course, ""cute"", but just can't justify quite that much screen time - they don't advance the story further at that level of coverage. I would reduce the long closeups by about 25-35%. I believe that was time that would have been better spent on building Willem Dafoe's character - his family context, his role in the outcome of the film. Alternatively, perhaps a more in depth character treatment of one of the children as opposed to ""the children"" as a group entity. As the ""Manager"", Dafoe was very good as always, but I would like to have seen him play a slightly more defining role in the story. The ending was intriguing but ultimately unsatisfying - it seemed abrupt and thin. The story builds to a climax that simply can't end well, but the audience is left hanging.This film did a lot with $2,000,000 and seems to have been highly profitable. Sean Baker did what was no doubt a difficult and consuming job as Producer, Director, Screenwriter, and sole Editor, and all the awards and profits the film gathered do him justice.

The narrative creeps up on you until you're totally immersed in the lives of Halley and Moonee and their struggles to survive. But because of the excess and repetition at the beginning of the film - yes, we see the kids get up to endlessm ischief but that was hammered into our heads for what seemed like half an hour - it takes a while to get involved.

The performances are real. Sean Baker's methods of filmmaking are wonderful, and this film excellently reflects that. I have seen quite a lot of negative user reviews on this one. Fair enough, some people find it too slow, boring, didn't like the ending whatever. Some reviews, however, disgusted me. People slating the film because they despise the child characters. I feel those people lack humanity and empathy for others. Having worked with children in somewhat similar situations for years, albeit in England rather than sunny Florida, I just cannot accept the sheer nastiness and distaste people show towards the ""underprivileged"". These are people I speak to, I take care of their children. Your sheer lack of understanding towards them makes you part of the problem. The film is a heartbreaking truth, and shows all sides, the good and bad, of these people. I do not understand how people can jump to hate everyone who has flaws.

The dialogue between the children and their actions are very realistic. Some of it might be a bit over the top (children being a little too bratty), but most of it is fairly accurate. The scene toward the end with the child crying is amazing; I wonder if they told that kid that her dog died or something to get that reaction from her. This movie shows how people's lives can just spiral downward bit by bit. Acting by all is great. If you want an arc in a movie or some major uplifting feel-good movie, then this is not for you.

I love independent, and even low-budget independent film (which this is), but even Willem Defoe - as amazing as he is (and seems to never age) - is not enough to make this film watchable. Plotless and claustrophobic, the film is an endless series of too-long camera pans from one end of the hotel to the other while obnoxiously-behaved children run around pointlessly. The lead girl child presents a mildly interesting character but one gets the sense that she was allowed to ad-lib through most of the film and that perhaps there is no script at all. Editing is extremely poor. This film seems to exist solely to advise you - if you did not know - that when people are too poor to rent an apartment, they live in motels; and it does so in a way that is neither subtle nor clever. If it is meant to be about kids rising above their surroundings to form friendships, it falls very short. If it is meant to be an expose on the hardships of the poor, it fails again.

If you have ever been lucky enough to visit that part of the world (Disney World) you will have a sense of nostalgia rush over you. From the moment you see the vibrant colours, the crazy knockoff trinket stores, the freshly paved parking lots you are transported to a more simple time. A time of leisure, pleasure and innocents. With the good always comes the bad and this film doesn't stray away from that. It is a simple story with believable acting and conflict.

I was surprised that A-list actor Willem Dafoe would be in such a film, and he did fantastic as always. Everyone in this film is 100% believable, to the point this could have been a documentary and not a movie. It's also tough to find young kids that age who don't appear to be faking or over dramatizing it. A+ on the casting. Bravo for the actors. They all have great careers ahead of them.
There's not much empathy for the annoying lowlife mother character played by Bria Vinaite, but she played the part convincingly well. (Once again, NO spoilers) There's a part where the main character little girl played by Brooklynn Prince is filmed up close while her and the mother are eating in a hotel restaurant. It almost appears like candid audition footage. By far my favorite scene from this film. The supporting actors were all perfectly cast and played their parts brilliantly too.
The cinematography is great, the scenery and landscape are captured well, lots of colors and visuals, very pleasing to the eye.

However, I also cannot understand how some people found it funny. Seeing these kids raised by foul mouthed parents who just let them run wild left me feeling really disturbed, because I'm all too aware this IS realistic. Seeing kids which more than likely would become maladjusted themselves due to learning a ton of bad habits and no respect for anyone is not my idea of a good time.The big problem however is the end of the movie which suddenly goes from this almost documentary style realism to suddenly this cheerful music, implying something positive happens at the end - except it doesn't. The movie just ends at this point, with no resolution and with a scene that felt completely out of place with the tone of the rest of the movie.So while I give the movie credit for focusing on a very tough subject matter, I was left wondering what the actual point was?

313,adrianf2001,Eerily Realistic...,6,9 March 2021,"The saddening realism in The Florida Project is to say very sincere nonetheless.
The harsh realities of children growing up poor with nothing but hearts on their sleeves and the destructive nature of shallow parents makes it a tough watch during certain scenes.
Since children are a reflection of their parents, a few scenes that display the children's behavior may come off cringe-worthy but it's justified based off their upbringings.
Moonee's mother, Halley, is a self-destructive person that could be said to be very shallow, ignorant and overall a poorly written character which is pretty annoying whenever she takes the screen.
Willem Dafoe's character, Bobby, acts as a guardian that keeps the importance of the children's best interest near and dear to his heart. Willem Dafoe's portrayal as Bobby is a breathe of fresh air compared to the other Adult characters presented in the film with the assist of how his character is written of course.
Not much could be said about cinematography and dialogue, only that dialogue is as realistically hasty as it can get when toxicity overcomes between the Adult leads.
The ending was devastating in the sense that it tears you apart watching Moonee suffer loss when she's about to be stripped away from her mother from CPS. Brooklyn Prince's (Moonee) last performance as a confused and troubled kid about to be sent away from the world she's lived in and found comfort in, is outstanding and you can't help but share that pain with Moonee.
This is really surprising coming from a child role as not many children could display such heavy tough emotions, the genuine tears and sadness makes the movie all more convincing that this world can be cruel to those so young and not understanding yet.
When Moonee pours her sadness to her best-friend, Jancey, before she's sent away, Jancey then grabs Moonee's hand and the two run off to DisneyWorld.
In what seems like an awful medication commercial with a happy montage of the two girls running off together, certainly pulls you away from the previous scene that drops such a heavy feeling on to you within a second.
A24 movies are known to be experimental as their directors are given the free range to experiment on their directing with challenging plot lines and movie concepts. Putting this into the equation as to why the movie abruptly ends in a unexpected change of emotions makes it understanding.

Could someone tell these indie filmmakers even the slightest bit of a plot would be nice sometime?This might be a best picture nominee, oh, man. The plot, well, there is no plot. This film is about a little girl (6 or 7?) living with her white trash foul mouthed mother (and learning to grow up just like mom!) in a motel near Disneyworld. The kids play. The mother tricks.... for an hour and 51 minutes. That's it. It's not a slice of life at this length and pacing, it's a basement freezer full of carcasses -- and I wasn't digging it, probably because I'm forced to encounter these types every time a new bus pulls into LA from Arkansas. Of course, they come to take her little girl away (thankfully. I was actually praying it would come much sooner. I considered calling Orlando Child Services myself halfway through the film), otherwise it was going to end with the wise-mouth kid getting hit by an tour bus of people in Mickey Mouse ears (my preferred ending).And the big FINAL SHOTS. Wow. Talk about the ultimate cheap, easy, and student film ending. I bet director Sean Baker is so proud of his shaky eight seconds of ""guerilla filmmaking"" shot within the walls of Disney world. Big deal. I hate to break it him, but a half a million parent a day take the same footage, and most of it probably looks better iPhone. This was was definitely a student film gone on too long. If they had trimmed 140 minutes it almost might have been bearable.I just want to know what these reviewers who gush about balancing the ""golden visions of childhood"" (6-year olds telling old ladies to f-off) with ""poignant reality of the underprivileged"" (mom stealing Disney passes while she gives.... service) are taking?

Part of the extreme naturalism is the bizarre sets: gaily painted slums, buildings in the shape of an orange, an ice cream scoop, or a pirate's head; ersatz Disney that could only end at the real Disney World, which of course, isn't real at all. The behavior and language of the children imitates that of their parents, while the self destructiveness and chaotic emotions of the adults shows that they're not grown up at all. How can anyone grow up in such an unnurturing world? Only Willem Dafoe is in control of himself and he, unfortunately, is subject to the motel owner's dictates. And yet, all is not bleak. The fact that a film like this exists, the fact that children can discover a source of delight just about anywhere, and the fact that the maternal instinct can thrive in the most imperfect of women, all give me hope.",The Florida Project

319,aarnold-89747,Pointless with no substance.,1,4 July 2021,"I kept waiting for some sort of story to develop, but this movie has zero story to it. No plot what so ever. That's not hyperbole. I'm not saying that because the story was weak or poorly written. I mean there is literally no story or plot. It's just watch these misbehaving kids misbehave because they have terrible parents who are happy being the dregs of society. There's no plot, structure, character development, character redemption, or resolution. Every aspect of film making looks like it was intentionally ignored so the creator could present some sort of artistic view, but comes off like he's also the sort of person that would set your car on fire for no reason and call it art.I understand this is supposed to be a social commentary movie, but it fails in that regard, too. There's no statement being made, or any plights being exposed. Nothing ever happens to develop any empathy towards the characters. By the end of the movie, I literally didn't care what happened to any of them. There are no bonds being formed. The closest this movie comes to a climax is nothing more than a confusing blunder.The mother is the worst kind of person. Nothing is her fault, she makes no attempt at improving her life or her daughters even though there is no apparent reason she can't get a job, she just would rather live a life of scamming, steeling, and prostituting. They try to pass her off as a caring mother, but that just doesn't work either. She comes off as the type of person who would enjoy all the fun parts of having a kid, but ignores everything else. That's not a caring parent, it's a selfish parent.The acting could very well be pretty good, but it's hard to tell. It doesn't appear they were given much to work with. Just a script that said, ""Be terrible people."" The cinematography is awful. Oversaturated colors to the point that it's an eyesore. The overuse of unnecessary shaky cam becomes nauseating combined with out of focus and rapid moving shots makes it hard to watch.If you're the type of person that would enjoy going over to someone's house that you don't like, and watching 2 hours of poorly shot home videos of nothing but their kids misbehaving, then this move is for you.",The Florida Project
320,my_movies_land,One of the best films of 2017,9,11 March 2018,"Rating: 8,5/10
The film is really amazing, everything that happens and how it happens is incredibly realistic, each character is well characterized and manages to be present, ie none of the characters is useless or superfluous, all of them give something.
The film is a drama seen from the eyes of a child and the screenplay is very accurate, all the children's dialogues are perfectly credible. In addition to the script, the interpretations are very natural and sincere.
In my opinion the film was too underrated by the Academy, in addition to the nomination for William Defoe (deserved), I think both the screenplay and the photography would have earned the nomination; photography that, besides being spectacular, perfectly reflects the mood of the film.

321,hutchnotes,Best Film of 2017,10,11 January 2018,"NOTESThis is the best movie released in 2017, and I give it an A+. This statement is not one I make lightly and is a conclusion I have reached only after hours of scrutiny and the viewing of numerous films, and I am absolutely appalled it has not been more recognized by the foreign press and the Golden Globes. I hope that the Academy wakes up to what they're missing. Films like this need to be recognized because it is within a limited budget and this type of guerilla-style filmmaking that true artistic freedom is bred. Sean Baker has created a masterpiece in this film, and I hope that all those involved will continue to have doors opened to them.REVIEW""The Florida Project"" is the best film I've seen this year. Sean Baker creates an uncanny feature length peek into childhood in all its innocence, deviousness, naivete, and soul-crushing reality. As I said before, I am mortified that the foreign press have neglected to nominate and recognize this film and its many winning elements. The performances given in this film rival the most refined performances from the most well-trained actors, and the film as a package delivers much more of a punch to the hearts and the guts of its audience than any other film released this year.""The Florida Project"" most likely gets its name from Disney World, which during its construction was referred to as the Florida Project. It takes place in the seedy underbelly of Orlando where Halley (played by an absolutely committed Bria Vinaite) is a young single mother trying to raise her young daughter Moonee (played by Brooklynn Prince who brings a similarly career-making and mind-blowing introductory role as Quvenzhane Wallis did in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") the best she can. Due to unexplained circumstances, Halley and Moonee are living in a rent-by-the-hour/day/week/month hotel appropriately named the Magic Castle run by Bobby (Willem Dafoe). During their stay, they experience life as you would imagine (or fear) life to be in the Magic Castle. In the shadow of Disney World we are given a realistic view into what tourism does to a community.The story is told focused on Moonee, a precocious six year-old who leads her minigroup into all sorts of shenanigans. The children run through parking lots, cross busy streets, and con people for ice cream money. They don't get into any real danger or trouble until they do, which basically summarizes childhood, doesn't it? Moonee is living life as most adults only wish they could - one day at a time. She lives in an environment where she is exposed daily to violence, crime, prostitution, profanity, and everything else from which parents wish to protect their children. Halley is a young unemployed woman who struggles to pay Bobby rent, feed Moonee, and stay out of trouble herself. Above all she is a mother, and despite numerous incidents of what society deems to be neglect in legal terms, it is understood that she is doing her best in her given circumstances.The film floats along with ease and playfulness until something creeps into the frame that seems like it had been looming in the periphery the entire time, we just didn't want to accept that it was there. And when it does manifest itself, it slices and cuts deep until it hurts. There were times I found myself nearly looking away - not because of excessive violence or anything like that, but because I could not bear to be exposed to the pain of the situation. My heart hurt after watching this film, yet at the same time I felt a sense of freedom and longed for my childhood.Dafoe's Bobby is a hesitantly protective landlord who clearly has a soft spot for Halley and Moonee. He is no-nonsense, but isn't really cut out for throwing people into the street when they can't make the rent. Dafoe executes this role with incredible precision and I agree with critics who say it is one of the best performances of his career. However, the real standout here is Bria Vinaite as Halley. Her character carries the film, and within her we see the cruelty of the outside world seep into the innocence Moonee embodies. Within Halley, we see the hypocrisy of government agencies who think they can do a better job at caring for a child than a mother can. Her character brings to light the conflict between adulthood with responsibility and the hanging on to adolescence with a carefree attitude that many adults miss and desperately wish to retrieve. We see in Halley the immense gap in socioeconomic status between Disney World and all its capitalistic Wall Street-like titanesque worship of the bottom line, and the young single mom who didn't win in the hereditary lottery and is just trying to make it in this world. Through the perspective of this mother-daughter relationship, Sean Baker gives an unflinching look into the parts of our society many don't want to see or acknowledge. He subtly hints at the hypocrisy that is Disney - with its commercialism and manufactured childhood it tries to cram down our throats - and juxtaposes it with the true innocence of childhood. Multiple shots portray Moonee sweating and out of breath, which is authentic, instead of the pristine synthetic view of children Disney tends to generate.The film in and of itself - how it was made on a shoestring budget, the title, the commentary on American consumerism - is not a direct critique of Disney, but it does open a lot of conversations and deftly adds to the discourse of what is happening in this country. How are these massive business conglomerates changing the very fabric of our communities, and is it for the better? Baker does allow his characters to benefit from Disney in various subtle ways, but also hints that it is actually at the root of much of their strife. Above all it is a subtle, provocative film that simultaneously warms the heart and reaches deep to expose what's been swept under the rug. I highly recommend this film.See hutchnotes.com for more reviews.",The Florida Project

325,FilmRaider,A Colorful View of a Bleak Reality.,8,25 June 2020,"If you've never heard of this movie, i'm not surprised. It would be a challenge to market a movie like this from a big budget studio. but that doesn't make it a bad film. Luckily, A24 releases indies films that would otherwise struggle in the business.The film is about a mischievious young girl named Moonee, and her mother as they struggle to get by while living at a motel near DisneyWorld. The film features great performances from all of it's actors, the child ones especially. They all give it a very organic feel, seeming not just like characters but real people. This is also helped by how the film used very little well known actors.A major turnoff for most people though would probably be the lack of a central plot. The film is mostly segments of the different characters milling around over one summer. While I felt it worked in this case to help build characters up and develop them, others might feel bored by it. Sort of like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.The film is beautifully shot. Showing bright colors and landscapes, while also showing how harsh it can be at the same time. The whole plot is all seen through the eyes of child, and how she creates her own adventures, oblivious to the grim, poverty-stricken reality that she lives in. One of the few films i've seen to shed a realistic light on these issues.I also enjoyed how the film used DisneyWorld in it's setting. Having the fireworks go off and people watching from outside the park. It almost made it seem like a dream, an far away place, where maybe the world feels a little bit brighter. The ending was beautiful. Just when you think you know how it's going to end, it switches. Maybe Moonee was taken away, or maybe she really did run off to a happier place. Maybe we know the answer, and maybe we just don't want to believe it.",The Florida Project

But on the whole it was very compelling as an examination of the lives of the characters, especially Moonie and her mother, both very well acted.I found the way Willem Dafoe's character Bobby was written particularly compelling. Bobby was in effect the sort of Greek chorus eyes of the viewer while also involved in the film's developments. He also stood in for us, the viewers, in terms of trying to be involved while aware of the limitations of what is possible. That in itself makes the film very worthwhile, and I genuinely loved it.",The Florida Project

330,Vandergloss,Unmitigated crap disguised as 'artsy-fartsy' social commentary.,1,3 April 2018,"I saw a (promising) preview at the theater several months ago, and then noted that Defoe was nominated for an Oscar, so figured this could be worth a look.OMG, was I wrong--what a horrible waste of time. The story was non-existent--just a collection of scenes strung together depicting the do-nothing, complain about everything, mooch all you can woman and her completely unlikable daughter.Normally, one can't really blame children behaving badly when they have no responsible adult supervision, but honestly, I was hoping this kid and her friend would 'discover' alligators before the final frame.I get that this was a social commentary, I get that there are a lot of folks much worse off than I am, but these characters and this movie didn't evoke my empathy. By the end, I resented having invested the time, expecting SOME kind of resolution, SOME kind of acknowledgment that the characters recognized they had nothing to offer society and begin an attempt at doing so--if not for the population at large, at least themselves or their child. Nope. This movie didn't have an ending--it just stopped with a completely 'stuck on' scene, although I WAS relieved when the credits finally rolled. Evidently there was a message in the scene, but I had to Google it to 'get it'--a real stretch, nothing anyone would ever pick up on. Frankly, it just depressed me, and then p*ssed me off. IF that was the goal, Sean Baker did succeed, though the only action I'll take is to avoid this director and write this review.The only redeeming point about having seen this is that I can say I saw it, and speak from authority for having done so.AVOID--save your money, if not two hours of your life.",The Florida Project

It also had character development and enough storyline to keep me engaged.

338,clark-ingleton,The final 15-20 minutes bring it from a 3.5 to a 5.5...,5,17 January 2018,"The Florida Project stars Brooklynn Prince, Bria Vinaite and Willem Dafoe, and is directed by Sean Baker.It tells the story of young 7-8 year old Moonee, played by Brooklyn Prince and her small group of young friends growing up at The Magic Castle budget/welfare motel. To them it's all about adventure, playfulness, causing light hearted mischief and just having a ball, without a care in the world. But the reality is that they're growing up in poverty with parents (most notably a truly compelling Bria Vinaite, playing Halley, the mother of Moonee), who are questionable in their abilities/circumstances to raise kids. There's petty crime, brawls, drugs/partying and endless colourful and not so colourful characters surrounding these kids and their parents. Also looking over it all is motel manager Bobby, played by Willem Dafoe, who on the outside is a gruff, on-with-the-job type, however under the surface lies true compassion and sympathy.So on paper, this all sounds well and good, a gritty slice of life type drama told through a very unique perspective: the kids seeing it all as one giant playground. But I'm going to jump straight to the point here and say this movie drove me fucking nuts. The main problem I came away with was simple: I could not sympathise with barely a single character. In the opening scene the kids are seen spitting continuously on someone's car from above a balcony and when the owner gets cross and requests they clean it up, these 7 year old kids swear and cuss and behave completely erratically. First impressions are hard to erase, let's put it that way. From there, they intentionally turn off all power in the whole motel, mooch money for ice cream off random people, even burn down a fucking building (not intentional, but still). All this behaviour is fairly inconsequential to the point that I couldn't sympathise with the kids, nor really the parents, who were almost in different ways, equally irritating. I found it difficult to follow which kid had which parents, and what their relationship with Moonee and Halley were.Willem Dafoe's Bobby is the closest this movie gets to a sympathetic character, but even he has a scene where a creepy looking old man approaches the group of kids, to which Bobby intercepts and intervenes, kind of ushering him away, and the man clearly has mental difficulties (or maybe pretending to have mental difficulties if he really is exploitative and predatory). Bobby takes this man to get a drink from a vending machine. After the man has opened the drink Bobby proceeds to smash it out of his hand and verbally and physically abuse him, taking his wallet and throwing it everywhere, swearing and yelling at him to get the fuck out of here etc etc. Bobby had me, but this whole scene felt like one big contradictionIt's entirely possible to have a great film where all characters are unsympathetic and despicable (The Hateful Eight and The Wolf of Wall Street are recent examples that come to mind). But it's important to have the characters DO things in relation to one another, and/or have things HAPPEN to them for dramatic purposes to make you CARE about what might then ensue in relation to themselves and others. In this movie, nothing... really... happens(?) The kids just run around fucking shit up and the parents, authorities, surrounding communities and motel manager Bobby just try and manage that, and manage it poorly and unsympathetically. I keep using the word sympathetic/unsympathetic, but I think with a ""window into a different world, slice of life"" movie like this, it's important to be able to latch on and be emotionally involved. Then came the final 15 minutes, which I won't actually spoil, but what ensues in terms of the kids' future and guardianship is really heartbreaking, and there's a moment where Moonee breaks down, which was all really crushing to watch, and I think the final shot of the film is quite brilliant. All performances across the board were phenomenal too, just about all of which were first time actors, minus Dafoe. In terms of the setting, circumstances and world of the film, it's ridiculously authentic. Bria Vinaite is quite a revelation in this. Let's talk about Sean Baker for a second, because he is a really interesting filmmaker. I haven't seen Tangerine, his film directly before this, but what I did see of his, which I didn't know he directed until after I saw The Florida Project, and which I started off hating and by the end had won me over through and through, was Starlet, about a young pornstar who befriends a very very elderly woman. Two major contrasts, and that film had various professional porn actors in it too. A gritty indie festival drama with pornstars in it. What Baker seems to do is tell stories with some of the most diverse ranges of ages, genders, races, people in general, far more daringly so than I think any other filmmaker out there. And it's certainly not gimmicky or agenda-pushing, he just wants to tell stories about characters which might be vastly different from you or I, or stories with majorly contrasting characters within them, and I think all this is something to be celebrated, and I am super keen to see what he does next, now that he's gained some impressive cred.But overall The Florida Project just wasn't my cup of tea, ultimately I found it irritating and unsympathetic, but where the conclusion held significant weight that might have ended up winning me over completely, had the rest of the film not been so damn difficult, even painful to sit through.",The Florida Project

I pretty much ran out of options since I had seen most everything else. A character driven movies must have good characters and performances to overcome what I consider to be a handicap. The Florida Project delivers on both fronts.You can't help but feel for the adorable Moonie. I don't know if it's just raw talent or great directing, but it boggles the mind how authentic the performance of Brooklynn Prince. Of course, Wilem Dafoe shows his usual caliber chops. One of only a few truly likable adult characters in the film.The cinematography was very well done without being obvious or self-conscious.Aside from the lack of any real story arc, the only weakness that I could see is the restrained reality of Moonie's every day life. Although present in the movie, her reality would likely be much more violent and abusive. Whereas in the film, we feel sorry for her impending fate; in real life I think it would be for the best.Overall, I found it entertaining and unpretentious.

343,riversideriverside,Unvarnished Look At Moral Degeneracy,10,20 May 2018,"No matter what the writers and the director intended, The Florida Project amounts to this: It is an unvarnished look at moral degeneracy. The film has all the elements of a sociologically unexamined struggle during hard times in contrast with the natural exuberance of children within the environment of a false Disneyland under the sway of a particularly malignant mother figure. The pain of this false Disneyland is made even more excruciating for its proximity to the ""real"" Disneyland. While the ""real"" Disneyland upon close examination exists in fear of the Disneyland that includes the film's Magic Castle and Futureland and Halley.TFP's brilliance spares us from the Disneylandish sociology that relieves adults of responsibility for their actions and attitudes. Halley loves her daughter? Really? No, not really. Halley, who has more power over Moonee than the economy does, uses Moonee as a sacrificial attack upon a world that she, Halley, has largely made for herself. TFP's entirety resonates from this fact.Save for the humanity of Bobby who may just as well have been sitting in the audience with the rest of us wondering what the hell lies ahead for Moonee in her mother-created Futureland.",The Florida Project

346,spencerjelmore,William Dafoe Show,6,6 July 2018,"The Florida Project is one of those movies that you just can't seem to look away from. Overall, I am not unhappy that I watched it (although I was initially), but it is not one I will be watching many times over. In an interview Sean Baker talks about the empathy we feel for the mother and I'm sorry to say that I felt none for her because the filmmaker didn't let me. If they had allowed me to meet people in Halley's life that knew her before she ended up like this, it would have humanized her. I felt nothing for the mother (Halley) other than disapproval. Moonee was hard to like throughout the film and the only reason I felt anything for her is purely the fact that she is a child in a situation that you would never want a child to be in. I don't think Baker did a good job directing her performance except for the last sequence.The character I latched onto the most was William Dafoe's character because he was written with such a complexity and played in such a raw way that I was enamored throughout. The only reason this film came up at the Oscars was because of him clearly. I have heard it compared to Barry Jenkins' Moonlight and my instant reaction is to push back on that. Moonlight was able to craft the coming of age tale in a creative and fresh way. Moonlight immersed you in real scenarios of pain and struggle as one of the characters. Meanwhile, The Florida Project made me feel often as a fly on the wall in the scenes I was more of an observer than embodying the character which made me just want to call the police and end the movie. The most interesting concept the film touches on is kids growing up so close to ""the happiest place on earth,"" but never going there and living in quite the opposite. It did a good job of plunging you into the area of the highway most people just pass right by. I love that the ending doesn't wrap up in a nice little bow and I like some of the scenes that explore childhood shenanigans. I don't hate that this film exists, I think it is important that filmmakers explore this style of cinema veritas, but they can't forget that there still needs to be an affective screenplay (something that I heard Baker often deviates from). In my opinion this movie was close to being something great, but instead is just good. Adding some complexity rather than stubbornness to main characters would have helped.",The Florida Project

357,stmccloud-10287,Summer Vacation Blues,7,9 May 2018,"A different take on ""What I did for summer vacation"" for sure. Little Moonee makes her journey through what must adults would consider a squalid hellhole, but through the rose tinted glasses of a child it seems adventurous and beautiful. Living in a bed bug ridden hotel managed by Willem Dafoe, Moonee and her mother, Halley, played by newcomer Bria Vinaite, struggle to make ends meet. Halley is consistently making poor choices, and catching bad breaks, but maintains her own childlike mentality throughout the film. Clearly, a similarity is defined by not only the mother-daughter relationship between Halley and Mooney, but the fact that Halley never matured into an adult and lives her life to solely provide Moonee with a whimsical childhood. The physical presence of Disneyland plays a role in the film, providing the innocence of childhood and the illusion of happiness. Director Sean Baker has a flair for showing the gritty reality of what Americans growing up in poverty are dealing with everyday. However, he also provides a certain charm and happiness to his characters. If you're looking for a happy go lucky story with complete conflict resolutions and story archs, you're in the wrong place. But, if you're ready to watch a real story, with real consequences, then sit back and watch it unfold. I would rate the film higher, but like some I did not enjoy the ending.

She sees rainbows, fireworks and purple-tinted fun while the rest of us see crushing poverty. Moonee, the lead is played brilliantly by Brooklyn Prince as an uninhibited wild child. The film sets up Moonee as intensely self aware, driven by instinct. But when she confronts the impossible, her mom being discovered for prostitution, police and social workers showing up at her ""home"" motel room 323 to put her in foster care, she breaks down as any child would. This movie is like Iggy Azalea, the realist. When Hailey, for example, throws up in response to being found out for prostitution, it's totally grounded in the narrative. When many other films have a character barf on screen it often reads as a cheap and stupid narrative trick.Visually this film creates a parallel hyper reality that the kids inhabit. The vibrant colors, the seeming never-ending adventures, this is not the real world, but is an example of magical realism or expressionism, where character's minds cover over harsh truths and present the world to the viewer through their perspective. In the climax (spoiler) it's only another child who knows what to do to stop Moonee's panicked tears. Together they break into Disney World. A place that is as unreal as the children's magical realism. They run to the center of the park in the hope that the outside world will fall away. We know and the filmmaker Sean Baker knows that's impossible. When I see Moonee crying at the end, with her hands in her mouth I think of a frightened baby. That's where I've seen that gesture before. It's a deeply moving moment. Willem Defoe is particularly strong as Bobby in the scenes where he does every job necessary with deep humanity, including spotting a predator pedofile while painting the motel in the Orlando palate.Many viewers will recognize Orlando, Disney, and the poverty depicted, and yet still be shocked by the harsh juxtaposition. If anyone is wondering about the look, the film was mostly shot analog Kodak film with Panavision cameras, I believe. It just looks like film to me. But then there are also scenes shot on an IPhone 6. The production details show a range of digital and film cameras. Finally, there is a thematic tie between this film and Truffaut's The 400 Blows, another great film about A parallel world of childhood, petty crimes.",The Florida Project
369,JoeMovieWatcher,THE SHAMEFUL PROJECT,2,9 August 2018,"First of all, don't expect a feel-good movie here. Far from it. I don't know if you can actually write a ""SPOILER"" for this putrid movie. It's rotten already.If you really want to spend a depressing night listening to a foul-mouthed shrew spewing F-bombs and worse in front of rude, unsupervised elementary school kids, here's your movie. If not, don't say you weren't warned. Yeah, I'm gonna judge this piece of garbage. HOW COULD YOU, SEAN BAKER...?
How can anyone expose little children to the kind of foul language and adult behavior that the kids in this movie were exposed to? Some of these reviews sicken me, actually PRAISING the filmmaker for a movie with a kid put in the bathroom while her Mom turns tricks in their hotel room.He should not be proud of this, and anyone who thinks this is okay should maybe rethink their own morals here. The ratings led us to choose this on Netflix. It was a big mistake to trust ratings.Don't look for any plot here beyond a series of bad decisions by an awful mother (""Halley"") that end up exposing her feral child (""Moonee"") to perverts and creeps, and all too predictably, after a long overdue period of her own misbehavior, lead to her kid heading into the foster care system. There is no redemption or growth here. I consider these filmmakers CREEPS and CHILD ABUSERS for making this movie. I feel sorry for any kid whose parent would let their child be involved in such an obscenity-laced production as this. They have allowed their own child to be robbed of their innocence long before their time. They are as irresponsible as the mother portrayed in this movie....or worse, since she was a made-up character and they really did this.Willem Dafoe plays a likeable, decent, humane and admirable motel manager who does his best to protect the pathetic, immature, foul-mouthed Halley from the consequences of her own lunatic actions and appalling parenting. Dafoe and the other semi-decent supporting actors are the only bright spots in this movie and the only reason I'm giving this two stars. ONE FINAL WARNING: As some of the more honest reviewers will admit, this film has an abrupt and unsatisfying ending. Moonee breaks free of Child Protective Services officers and desperately heads for DisneyWorld's Magic Castle with her little friend, Jancey. They simply run in through an unguarded exit, as if that's gonna happen.....and then, as they near the Magic Castle, the movie mercifully just stops.",The Florida Project

The Florida Project is one of those. There's little to no plot, and feels like they just got a bunch of actors together in a run down motel and started shooting without a script. I guess it's meant to be some kind of metaphor about Disney World and the disparity between the 'happiest place on earth' and the trailer park-like world that surrounds it? As if Disney is to blame for the fact that most of the middle of Florida is a dump? The story revolves around a bunch of sad directionless kids with little to no parental guidance, and the only thing stopping them from becoming victims of creepy sexual predators is a kind-hearted slumlord (DeFoe) who has far more patience for some of his degenerate tenants than they deserve. There are some good performances with the kids, and the DeFoe is his usual great self, but there's not much else going on in this film worth watching.",The Florida Project
375,ClassicPlain91,Give it a chance.,8,16 November 2018,"If you, for whatever reason, are on the fence about seeing this movie- give it a chance. The cast is amazing, though most of them are unknown. Willem DaFoe gives an amazing performance as the motel manager. It feels like someone you could actually know, not a fabricated movie character. The child actor who plays the main character, Moonee, is absolutely unbelievable. I could see this girl having a bright future in film. Halfway through the movie, you forget that there is even a script involved. These are the kids down the street from your apartment. These are the kids you see screaming and riding bikes down the sidewalk. It draws you right in to this world of theirs. This movie does a wonderful job of making you actually care about these characters, even though you may not understand or agree with some ( or most ) of the behavior throughout.
One thing I really enjoyed about watching this was the way that the story unfolds. The whole story is told through the eyes of 8 year old Moonee. You learn things when Moonee learns things. If she doesn't see something happen, it happens off screen. When something, or someone, appears that she isn't familiar with- you are just as confused as she is. It is a great and subtle way to feel connected to these characters that you may feel you cannot identify with.
Ultimately, it is a story about people. People you may not know, may never know; but exist.
Wonderful movie, would recommend.",The Florida Project

386,lopsilceci,Kind of depressing,7,10 January 2018,"Just saw this movie yesterday and I'm still trying to make up my mind about it..
It reminded me a lot of Ken Loach's ""I, Daniel Blake"", which is also about poor people; a young single mother who ends up trying to prostitute herself to provide for her kids: a friendly, caring older man who helps them out, etc, But, while the adult characters in Loach's film have redeeming qualities and are easy to empathise with, the opposite is true with the parents in ""The Florida Project"".Bobby seems to be the only character with enough maturity and sense of responsibility to look after someone or something and the time and dedication he puts into the management of the motel is admirable. He also seems to be the only adult keeping an eye on the kids while they're outside wandering about, which is like most of the day.I found Haley, Monee's mother to be the most dislikable character of all. She is a terrible person and the worst possible role model for a young girl. The only redeeming quality I can think of is that she does seem to love her daughter (in her own selfish, messed up way) but even though the ending is heart-breaking while you're watching it, once the movie was over, it got me thinking that Moonee was probably better off being taken away from her and living with a more stable family.*The acting was excellent from everyone and a lot of the children's dialogues and interactions seemed so natural they must have been improvised. The cinematography was also mostly great, except for that one last scene which is so weird and unexpected and shot in a completely different way from the rest of the movie, that it ends up being too distracting to hit you emotionally. That cut from Moonee´s crying face to Jancey grabbing her hand in fast-mo to kids running into Disney with shaky, handheld camera and surprised on-lookers breaking the fourth wall just changes the tone completely.In general, I thought it was okay, but not good or great. It guess Sean Baker just isn't for me. The ending left me very unsatisfied.*Also, wtf is up with Haley going to ""apologize"" to Scooty's mum, then asking her for money and beating her up like that when she (rightfully) told her to f- off.

Actually there is really nothing to complain about, that feel is simply produced by the decay surrounding the lovable protagonist, which is deliberately sugar-coated as only a child's mind could manage it. SPOILER (?): The very final sequence, which I kinda felt to happen few seconds before, is a very well-fitting example regarding the masterful level of Baker's self- awareness in the use of parody as a cinematic striking weapon.P.S. hands up who could ever imagine Willem Dafoe as one of the best Disney's character ever written, in a non-Disney movie.",The Florida Project

394,scarboroughjames-20012,A Fantasy Not Wasted on the Young,8,2 April 2018,"What's wrong with a little Disney fantasy if it lets a 6-year-old girl for a moment escape her ironically named slum motel, The Magic Castle? That's the question answered in the last minute of Sean Baker's magical The Florida Project.It's the story of Moonee (Brooklynn Kimberly Prince), 6 years old. She lives with her mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite), in a squalid room at The Magic Castle. Motels like this line the short distance from their place to Disney World. Bobby Hicks (Willem Dafoe) runs the place.Baker nails the set up. At first you think it's a story of childhood, of spontaneity and fun: of ignoring the bleakness of life around her. Moonee is precociously sharp. She's a street kid who adores her mother and her friends and anyone else who treats her nice. In an interview with Variety, Baker says he based the story on The Little Rascals, comedy shorts from the 20s and 30s. He reminds us that, as funny as the kids were, they lived poor lives.That's how we see Moonee's life, an impoverished though pastel-colored playground. Each day blends into the other. Halley manages to get by. Moonee retrieves food from a neighbor who works in a diner. Halley, with Moonee's help, sells perfume to tourists. Somehow, they make their weekly rent. This goes on for most of the film: focusing on details, Halley scrambles to provide. Focusing on the big picture, Moonee scrambles to have fun.The big picture encroaches much too soon on Moonee. She and her friends set an abandoned place on fire. Bobby chases off a perv who approached the kids as they played outside. Halley can't make rent and tries to borrow it from her diner friend. When the diner friend won't help, Halley beats the crap out of her. When Child Services appear, we learn how Halley made her money. We don't see that coming.Prince's Moonee and Vinaite's Halley are gems. Just like Tatum O'Neal in Paper Moon, Prince makes her character gritty and insightful beyond her years. Her ability to sidestep the world at large is formidable. We relish the chance to share her adventure-filled, consequence-less world. I still can't get over her reaction to her mother being taken to jail. Wow. When we imagine her life in 10 years, we don't have to look far. Wistful like a Dust Bowl Goldie Hawn, Vinaite's Halley shows us what's in store for her daughter, barring a miracle. Dafoe's quiet, conflicted Bobby doesn't just ace the been-there, done-that character of a roach motel manager, he's got a face that Dorothea Lange would have loved. We can praise the story for its documentary-style footage, for its Little Rascals brand of humor. Really, though, it's a compelling, brilliantly-enacted story of how Disney's Magic Castle is more real than pretend, just as The Magic Castle is more nightmare than real. The fantasy that is Disney serves as a balm so kids - and everyone else - can deal with what's outside the park's gates, namely - life.",The Florida Project

398,griffinstenzel-47638,Pure Magic 🌈,10,19 November 2020,"Illuminated by bright blocks of sunlit color under the warm glow of urban sunsets and rainbows, The Florida Project is a lullaby of unbound bliss, but behind that fairytale haze, beneath the corners of splendor, is a haunting portrait of poverty and critique of capitalism.Gloriously shot on 35mm film, the luminous pastel tones and graininess of the stock suits the shabby, sun - soaked neighborhood. The washed - out bubble gum colors of the motels and bizarre buildings contrast beautifully with the puffy clouds that linger in the blue summer sky. An ice cream shaped parlor, a waffle house in the shape of a giant orange, and a gift shop with a large wizard dominating its shop front are all highlights of the Orlando wonders. The purple motel appears as a fairytale backdrop, like a brightly colored bee hive of strange and compassionate characters, it's a magical world of wonder and mischief.Scraps of Disney are constantly present in The Florida Project, like how Halley and Moonee constantly wander past a street sign for ""Seven Dwarfs Lane"" yet never walk down it, and when to celebrate a birthday, they bathe in the elaborate fireworks of the Magic Kingdom, as if they were exploding just for their celebration. These subtle references remind us of just how close they are to the magic of the parks, yet are never close enough to experience it. And how the vacationers at Disney World are blissfully unaware that people are on the brisk of completely collapsing as they spend their money on toys, food, and balloons. They live in the shadow of Disney, and any time we notice the contrast, it's like a cold slap in the face.And I know others dislike the ending, but I think it's just as perfect as the rest of the movie. As Moonee and her friend race towards Cinderella's castle, bursting with dreams, we are aware that something tragic is taking place at the same time. While other families pace around the park, free of worry, Moonee has to escape to a kingdom in order to get away from the heartache that she faces. It's a dreamy gut punch, wondrously capturing her youthful, blissful ignorance.Sean Baker weaves The Florida Project with a child's sense of discovery, it's an ode to kids' imagination and its power that can transform a chaotic corner of Orlando into a vibrant cinematic playground. There's so much hope in the innocent optimism and imagination of the characters: a spitting contest is treated with the triumph of the Olympics, visiting an abandoned home has the tension of exploring a haunted house, and looking at cows in a field becomes an adventurous safari.For all the flights of fancy and moments of pure joy, this movie confronts things you don't want to see, it plunges you into the heart of a side of America many of us would rather ignore. The Florida Project forces us to look at it, to notice, and to care. And once you finish it you feel reborn and opened to a new way of looking at the world and the people in it.

412,leminhkien-191,Not for easy viewers,10,22 September 2018,"The fact that this movie only got one Oscar nomination is such a shame. And to all haters of this movie, you can imagine me screaming at you like Halley at the end of the movie. 
Since when did cinema have to entertain you? I was never the point of filmmaking and this movie certainly isn't for easy viewers. The 7.6 rating is surely unfair because many people just voted this title 1/10 without watching the whole film, and according to other reviews they just hate the characters. 
Halley, of course, is a troublesome character but her life is real, that's how 11% of the women in this country is living. Brats kids like Scotty, Jancey, or Moonee are annoying but that's the point of the film. Do you want your kids to be like that? If you don't then that's the reason why you should see this film. Brilliant acting of Bria Vinaite and Brooklynn Prince (and Dafoe, too). The fact that you will hate the characters so much just proved my point that the cast is wonderful.",The Florida Project
413,cam-pupshis,Uncomfortably Great,9,13 May 2018,"I really wanted to write this film off as poorly done because of how uncomfortable I felt throughout major parts of the film. For anyone who isn't ready to be presented the worst of mankind and seeing children endure it, I would recommend that you still watch this film, even if it is just in appreciation for the amazing cinematography, career-best performance from Dafoe, or the flawless child acting and improvisation. The biggest gripe I hold is the ending. At the end, Moonee, one of the main children in the film, is being taken away from her mother by child protective services, ending a horrifically surreal string of events involving theft and prostitution. Moonee runs to her friend's motel room, which is in a neighboring motel, and is saying goodbye. This compilation of shots includes some of the most emotion in the film; I had trouble holding back a couple of tears during the scene. Then, the cinematography and mode completely change to the complete antithesis of the entire film, and the children run into Disney World, which has been a lingering theme throughout the film. I can not really explain the jarring affect of this change and would encourage anyone to view it themselves to see what I mean. Because of that tragic flaw, this film is leaves much to be desired and I can not rate it to the full potential. I've seen better from A24.

I worked a sort of Willem Dafoe role where I was the only person on the property at nights. I ran audit, checked people in, ran de facto security, made breakfast, etc. I had a few families livnig in and out of the place too, and the summers are especially hard when the children don't have school. The scenes of them running through the lobby playing hide n seek are ridiculously accurate.The most poignant line for me comes at the end of movie, and it almost feels like a throwaway. There's a guest doing their laundry outside while CPS comes to take Moonee and Dafoe tells her he'll have it fixed soon and she has like a ""Okay?"" sort of response. That small interaction perfectly captures that property manager position. You have to see these people day in and day out scraping by and the little you can do to help like fix the laundry means naught. You're only able to offer minor conveniences to people who are struggling with finding a home to live in, and the little you can do in the face of their plight seems silly and it wears on you. Meanwhile having to juggle wanting to help these people out but you're beholden to the people who own the place and run it as a business.I kind of rambled, I just adore this movie. I read the summary and went in thinking that I might be able to relate since I've worked a motel in the area its set in but it ended up perfectly capturing that experience for me.

However, I have to comment after all the talk of 'mischievous' and 'boisterous' children. No, for most of the film they are brats - rude, antisocial, undisciplined, mostly bothering tourists, residents, and other children. Halley certainly makes sacrifices for her child, but she is clearly far along the road to unfit mother, if not already at her destination. No wonder the kids are as awful as they are with her example. Just genuinely shocking.
This brings me onto my final compliment to the film, the actors (adult and child) are excellent, to make characters believable that are so unpleasant. The obvious exception is Willem Dafoe's character, that is portrayed as well if not better than the other, but is also likeable and relateable, a truly good guy in a broken setting.",The Florida Project

In 2013, I, my wife and my stepdaughter went to Orlando in vacation, was a ""dream comes true"" trip, we all are born in a poor family in Brazil, and can do that was really a dream come true. Everything in USA was amazing and we come back Brazil thinking ""there is no poverty in USA, everything works, the things are cheap!"".The poor people in Brazil live in not well done houses, in favela, near polluted rivers or very crowded neighborhoods. This movie show us where the poor people live in Orlando, conventily in cheap hotels (conventily to the ones that earn money from tourism). Just to you know the difference between the countries, in Brazil is impossible a poor family live in a cheap hotel, no way, this is very expensive.Many user reviews here, especially the lower ratings, takes the point of view of the mother, saying that ""she not a good mother"", ""why she dont work?"" and many other things. They say the movie protect this kind of people and becouse of this they are very disappointed.I say that all these people don't understand the movie, let´s take only the point of view of Moonee, she have a super mom for her. She can play all day with her friends, walk way in many places, eat icecream for free, and do stupid things, and if anyone go to your mother to complain about her, her super mom will make they go away. Moonee really love this.You can say that this is wrong, I don't agree to that kind of comportament, but the movie is showing to us one point of view, you don´t need to agree with it, but you need to see it.Just think about Moonee life, she love it, everything is good, everything is a party.

Starting with the absolutely amazing acting of the main character Moonee (performed by Brooklynn Prince) and the other roles performed by Willem Dafoe, Bria Vinaite, Valeria Cotto and Christopher Rivera.
The movie follows the life of a young girl and her mother who live together in The Magic Castle. A motel in Florida, next to Disneyworld.
This movie is so special and unique because it shows you another side of what most people think is the most magical place on earth. A side a lot of people don't even realize it exists. And yes, this movie is painful and sad and heartbreaking.. but that is because it's real. It shows you a little fraction of the life that some people live.
I think that the best thing about this movie is that it's from the perspective of kids. It makes it more confronting. Because no kid should have to live like that. But it also shows you how innocent, happy, curious, funny and imaginative children are.
This movie shows you that reality is not always as beautiful as it seems and that at the same time even ugly things can be beautiful.This movie is totally worth all of your time and money!

When I saw this movie promoted on talk shows, I thought it sounded interesting, so I went to IMDB to see what other people thought of it. Similar to now, everyone is giving the movie 7-10s, and at the time, there were no reviews talking about the ending. I can't say that there aren't any reviews talking about the ending now, because - to be honest - I didn't read any more reviews after watching the movie.So here it is. My problem with the ending: it felt lower budget than the rest of the movie, and it was disconnected in tone. The whole movie was shot in this raw, almost documentary-like style, and it had this playful, but dark tone (in my opinion). However, in the last scene, the shooting switched to a handheld camera, which was stabilized in post and it looked terrible (again, in my opinion). Otherwise, the tone changed from sad in the scene before, to happy-ish at the end.SPOILERS FOR THIS NEXT SENTENCEThe people I watched the movie with hypothesized that the last scene is a fantasy. However, even if it is, I don't think it was done well, because the rest of the movie was grounded in reality.

445,dhirashima,Harsh and poignant .Had potential but lacked better character development..,7,12 January 2018,"I am an avid cinema/ film lover of independent , foreign and domestic films(Truffaut, Fellini, Kubrick ,Kurosawa, Hitchcock, etc...). I am also a movie fan ( Lucas, JJ Abrms, Spielberg, PIxar, etc... ) of all kinds. I feel the need to make distinction of the two to give some people context of my impression of this film."" The Florida Project "" caters to film lovers and probably not the casual movie fan. 3 films came to mind in comparison of the subject matter of this film 1) "" Central Station ""(1998) by Walter Salles 2) ""The 400 Blows"" (1959) by Francois Truffaut and 3)"" The Bicycle Thief "" (1949) by Vittorio De Sica. These 3 films are fantastic movies of seeing the world from a child's point of view. They are powerless and are exposed to harsh realities the world as is the case of Moonee in the Florida Project. I truly appreciated the style of the film and Sean Baker trying to paint an honest portrayal or view of a world less seen in film lately. Poverty story lines of late have been well told in films like "" Moonlight"", "" Slumdog Millionaire "" , "" Grand Torino"" and "" Precious"" and all of them are hard to watch at times.  The Florida Project has potential based on the setting and the subject matter. It centers on a white single mother raising her daughter in a low budget motel that is near a Disney World commercial strip where travellers stay at times to go to afford a family trip to Disney World. This is a poetic plot lineto me to show both sides of the world that we live in and creates context and setting for the film. The movie is about Mooonee's mother struggles to hold down jobs and she basically lives on welfare and any means where she can earn $$$ to support herself and her young daughter. It does get bleak and uncomfortable at times. It is honestly portrayed. Giving us a poignant story because it does show a side of life many of us never see. Living day- to- day and week to week in motels is truly frightening. For most of us this is heartbreaking in itself. Once again powerful stuff. Watching children playing together in a setting like this is very unconventional. The portrayal of all the characters is so brutally honest. It does feel like documentary at times of a harsh world. Not for everyone for sure. However where the movie starts to fail for me as it slowly unfolds slowly is by the lack of a better written script fundamentally. It doesn't shed light of a how the characters found themselves in this predicament nor does it really give the viewer a real desire to care for them. I say this unfortunately because I wanted know more. I don't necessarily need a light glossy type writing to make me like them which would downplay their situation I think. But by giving the viewer a sense of why Halley (the mother) is so hardened, vulgar, crass and with her own sense of indignation would have helped me want to me to empathize her situation. Especially since though I am not a parent but I am human and worry for the impact it has on Moonee. This is why I referred to "" Central Station ' and "" the 400 Blows "" and the other films originally. I find this type of story albeit at times uncomfortable or unsettling but extremely compelling. The saving grace for me that kept me interested in the film was William Dafoe's character as Bobby, the hotel manager and Moonee. Bobby gave the viewer a reason to want to believe there is still good in a world of utter sadness. He too is powerless as manager and not owner and therefore has limitations on his influence.. He offers a patriarchal type role but he is limited to help Halley regain any control of her life. It is sad to watch because we are so accustomed to seeing the opposite.That is a redeeming quality of the film too. I certainly did not anticipate a rosy ending for Halley/ Moonee's plight I guess I wanted to see semblance of hope. the film was uneven for me and intentionally so I think. To be bleak contrasted by the bright setting of Florida. Sort of in a Vegas kinda way. It reminded me of "" Midnight Cowboy "" and Dustin Hoffman / Ratso Rizzo fascination with Florida. This was another strength of Sean Baker's vision of this film . I just think this could have been a more rewarding and powerful film by simply giving the viewer more context or bio of each (character ( Halley / Moonee and even Bobby) reached their destination in life. I like an open ending or interpretation of a film to allow the viewer to make their own conclusions but not having understanding of one's past makes it hard. In the end the message does get lost I think for me and others. That being said If it is Sean Baker's intention to do so and not offer insight how to fix this but for us to see it and reflect on the way our society is becoming then I think he did just that. Watch and derive your own conclusions is the only suggestion I can make. Just be prepared to be not being told a singular viewpoint with resolutions.",The Florida Project

I was, however, very disappointed and felt that this was an empty movie with no plot and no narrative arc whatsoever. Which also makes it very difficult to rank and review. There is simply no story here, but a collection of scenes edited together. There are no character development and no soul in any of them, with willem dafoe being somewhat of standout from this. His character is the only one you can relate just a little bit to, while also being overrated as far as performances go. This is not as strong as some would have you believe, it's very downplayed and very ""boring"", for a lack of a better word. Boring would be a good description though, for the entire movie, but it's so empty that it's not even boring to be honest. It is without a doubt the biggest disappointment in a long time, and i would caution anyone to see this, if they like a good story with emphasis on narrative arc's.The setting is as boring as the rest of the movie, with no connection to disney world at all, even though it's hinted at throughout.

451,blbl9093,A Floridian's take on The Florida Project.,9,14 May 2018,"This is my first Sean Baker film and I was impressed with the realism that he projects. I live in the Orlando area and easily recognize a lot of the buildings. So many before me posted a synopsis of the movie, so I won't bore you with that - just a few thoughts from an area local. If you have Amazon Prime you can watch this for free and I highly recommend that you set aside a couple of hours to do that.
We watched it this weekend and were blown away by the genuine authenticity of the area surrounding Disney World that most ""tourists"" will never see. There is a lot of poverty in and around Disney and Orlando and a lot of people who live in these older motels that were once the main tourist hotels before Disney started isolating their guests by building Disney only hotels on property. What's so sad is that because they are hotels, the families that live there are technically considered homeless. Even worse, I have actually known families here just like this. While watching, I was wondering if they would address the problem of pedophilia and I'm glad that they didn't omit this from the movie, because it is a growing problem. In case you don't know, there are A LOT of pedophiles in Florida (not sorry tourism industry).
I really liked the way that Mr. Baker addressed the irony of the fact that Moonee and her mom were in such a struggle for sheer survival that, although they lived in the shadow of Disney World, they couldn't afford to go and enjoy it as so many can. Yet, Moonee didn't seem to mind - she never really seemed to ""feel"" poor.
It was cool to see all of the authenticity in this movie, from the Tastee Freeze building to the tourist helicopters. And the story itself was so well written and acted that you almost forget that it is just a movie.
And the ending? We're still analyzing the symbolism in the ending. Enjoy!",The Florida Project

464,Splashmeadow,An interesting look at an underrepresented group.,9,12 September 2019,"I watched this film earlier and decided to write this after reading quite a few negative reviews on here.This film takes an honest look at what it's like to be from one marginalised part of society, those not quite homeless but nearly so, living in motels; however, it is shown through the eyes of a child (Moonee). This means although we see all the pain around her it's masked though bright colours and the joys of her imagination. Some reviews on here complain that Moonee is 'bratty', which she is, but that's a truthful representation, it would be silly if she was an angel child considering her rough upbringing and immediate family circle. As depressing as it is, life is a cycle and people normally end up like their parents. In her mum (Halley), we see what Moonee's future could hold. I personally didn't struggle to like her or any of the characters, there was a lot of love especially between Moonee and her mum, contrasting the harshness of the rest of Halley's life. I think this love made me like Halley more as it definitely felt that, although she wasn't a great mum or even really a good person, as her life deteriorated she did what she did for the right reasons.Also people have called this film 'pointless' which I really don't feel like it is as it brings forward the lives of people not often represented in cinema, which is always important.",The Florida Project

OK, back to the professional reviews, the review rating in at one out of ten, mentioned a high volume of walk outs, once the audience figured out what kind of movie this was going to be.

The acting and directing in ""The Florida Project"" are wonderful, but I wouldn't call it a good movie.The movie has no plot. The movie consists of scene after scene of obnoxious kids running around doing bad things, a young woman named Halley trying to earn money by engaging in various shady activities, and a motel manager named Bobby doing his job.The movie does a good job depicting the lifestyle of the characters in their environment, but that's all it does. A movie needs a goal that the characters are trying to achieve. There needs to be some conflict or problem or mystery to be solved. There needs to be a story that holds our interest and makes us want to know what happens next and how the story will end. This movie has no story.Something happens at the end of the movie that really belongs at the beginning because it creates a problem for the characters to solve. It creates a goal that the characters can strive to achieve. That would have been an interesting movie.The other thing that bothers me about the writing is the lack of backstory for the characters. At one point, Halley says something in passing that reveals a little bit of information about her life before the events depicted in the movie, and that's all the backstory we are given for her. How did Halley and Moonee end up living at the motel? Who is Moonee's father, and what happened to him? What made Halley and Bobby the people that they are?

As for an objective view the movie works for me on all levels the cinematography is amazing it's use of vibrant colors is stunning, the acting is superb from everyone in the cast especially Willam Dafoe, Brooklyn Prince, and Bria Vinaite. Of course I have to bring up the infamous ending that almost every critic hated and yes I have to admit it's not very good but I do see what Sean Baker was going for, I feel the purpose of the ending was to illustrate that when Moonees carefree life was getting to tough that she needed to find solace in a carefree place like Disney World, so I don't feel the ending was out of left field like most people I just feel it was poorly executed but despite that I feel confident in saying this film is amazing and an instant classic.",The Florida Project

483,gps-09882,The Essence of a Parent,8,1 March 2018,"A mother and daughter living on the decrepit outskirts of Disney World, try to survive and thrive in a world that is entirely against them. They rely on selling pre-sold items on a street-corner, and survive off of government assistance. The story mostly revolves around the central location of a small light purple hotel called the ""Magic Castle, wherein the two find their home due to assistance from the manager. Despite their reduced standards of living, young Moonee spends her days playing away her troubles with her friends Jancey and Scooty, blissfully unaware of the hardships that her mother has to bear. The film is great, top to bottom. Let's just get that out of the way. The performances are brilliant, the acting is top notch. Notables are actress Brooklyn Prince, who emphatically plays a young daughter, blissfully enjoying her Summer unaware of the incredible squalor of her life. Willem Dafoe plays a concerned motel manager in a role that might finally earn him the Oscar recognition he has lost deserved. The cinematography is a huge step up from Sean Baker's last film ""Tangerine"", which while being a huge achievement (all filmed on the iPhone 5), seemed more of a gimmick than anything else. Where ""Tangerine"" for me, failed at providing an adequate script, this film flew leaps and bounds above its predecessor at being compelling and scripturally sound. The key though in this entire film of course, is the immaculate and daring performance from Bria Vinaite, who demolishes every single second of this film. Where this film succeeds is any scene this actress was in. Her performance had to be amongst the greatest I've seen in a really long time. It's utterly mind-numbing how she has been overlooked for best supporting actress at the Oscar's. I guess Hollywood is content giving platitude to female performances to only a comfortable extent? I am not even one of the crowd shouting for a political stance in our films, but the hypocrisy is rigid. Regardless, her performance is breath-taking, and by the very last frame that she consumes, I was on the edge of my seat. Sean Baker has directly a fantastic film. Every frame composed by cinematographer Alexis Zabe captures one's imagination, and every scene felt deliberate and essential to our protagonist Moonee. We are removed from certain aspects of the story by Baker, and included in others. The harsher parts of the story are unveiled before our eyes, but at times are given reprieve in the lens of a little girl's oblivious world. The film succeeded in allowing us to understand how a child living in such a horrible environment could even survive, and enjoy herself. By the end of this film, I felt myself broken by the weight and consequences of the plot, and where they had driven our little protagonist, who brings everything to a head when she sobs uncontrollably. ...And then the end occurred. Now I get the risk being taken, and I completely understand the fantastical aspect to what happened. I just think it was completely out of character, and wildly removed me from my immersion. As an audience member, it is hard to remove ourselves from a truly great experience. However, this film dives head first into the abyss, which ultimately felt cowardly. Here, we had a film grounded in its message, and near-perfect in its execution. The ending though shies away from that, and cowers into the confines of the land of magic. I understand the message, and I realize that a simple cut-to-black before the ending scene would feel weird. I just cannot fathom how a film so bold could stop so short of finishing off its ending. I am assured I will receive hate for this opinion, but I am prepared to die on this mountain. Other elements of fault I noticed was an unfinished characterization for Dafoe's character. We see little hints of who he is, but the film failed to fulfill any sort of character arc for him. He never seems to really get the full treatment it seemed his character deserved, and I was hoping for at least a short scene where we are given a glimpse into his perspective as he reaches a finality. Regardless though, I highly recommend this film. It truly takes a plunge into the focus of what it means to be a parent, what it means to be a child, and what it means to live in their world. I hope that in the future, A24 continues to allow projects like these to occur, as it seems they are the primary challengers of the modern blockbuster idolatry in the world of film. Hopefully, we see smaller pieces like these making bold and innovate leaps. While we may not be able to follow all of them, my hope is, we can at least join in on the ride.

Yes, the movie moves a bit slow and there is no action (so to speak of), but the underlying message is both beautiful and tragic at the same time. To see the innocence of these children who live this on a daily basis is eye opening. This is their ""normal"" and are fine with it, however, to the outsider looking in, it is a very sad situation. While it does not scream ""social causes/awareness"", it is very much there in the undertones of this movie. The acting by such a young cast was incredible. To show how the 3 main ""families"" handle the same circumstances in a different manner was done so well, it makes you think at a deeper level on each of their characters. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the film as much as I did and it made me so much more aware of different life is from my own for so many people. Regardless of why they are where they are, everyone struggles and does the best they can or at least believe they are. Having the entire move take place at a motel right next to the ""magic kingdom"" was perfect! I love the sensibility of the motel manager. He did his job, but also showed his compassion. I will be watching this movie again so that I can look deeper into the story and the possible ""take away"". I would recommend watching this movie if you want to be made more aware of some peoples and kids ""reality"". Do not expect to walk away feeling good or angry or frustrated.

492,louistimti,L.I.F.E,9,3 March 2018,"It was a very great movie, very artistic and teaching though it may not be very entertaining for the non artistic types. it was also very real and i was amazed by the acting of the main kid. she acted very clever for her age. Couldn't help but see how her mother's unruly behavior corrupted her child but who is to be blamed huh? probably life at the bottom led her to depression given she was a bright lady nevertheless. my eyes watered at the crying scene at the end of the movie. also I'm always happy to see Caleb Landry Jones in movies. I generally admire seeing the art in how those at the bottom adapt to the difficulties especially the mental ones. My top scene was the one where the main kid was at her favorite tree and when she said ""This is my favorite tree because it fell yet kept growing"". Overall a standing ovation for the director and oh i almost forgot the mom whose acting i was very impressed with, couldn't help but believe she has some experience with such moments. To conclude, this movie made me a better person so it was definitely worth it, thank you.",The Florida Project
493,tavisricksecker,What.,1,4 March 2018,"I wanted to like this film, I really did. Even when my wife wanted to turn it off 1/3 of the way through, and again 2/3 of the way through, I insisted on finishing because I was sure that some redeeming quality would make itself apparent. Nope. Total waste of two hours, definitely would not recommend. I am seriously baffled by all the high reviews, I must conclude that these people were too busy inhaling their own flatulence to notice that this movie actually sucked.",The Florida Project

Great acting....by everyone. Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors and he's the ""glue"" that holds everybody together. Great movie. Highly recommend.",The Florida Project

Not much notably cinematography also I understand why the last scene is important but I feel like the execution was a bit off. Overall it was ok",The Florida Project
497,chrispaiva-34452,Awful movie..,1,16 April 2018,"Others have said this is a view of poverty in America. I disagree. This movie is a view of a horrible person with no values or pride. It's not some deep ""artsy"" movie, it's just a bad movie. It's difficult to watch as she so called ""raises"" her daughter living out of a hotel swindling strangers and turning tricks. I kept hoping it was going to take a turn.. that she would grow up and take care of her daughter properly. I am saddened that the young child actors were subjected to such a vile atmosphere during filming. I wish I hadn't watch this movie. If you also find it dark, disturbing and difficult to watch.. stop watching. Don't be waiting for the sunshine..",The Florida Project

The director's hand is so light yet so distinct, this could only come from Sean Baker yet there's no flash, no showing off. I truly loved and was moved by and learned from this film. It will make you a more compassionate person. I cannot BELIEVE it didn't get nominated for Best Picture. It was my favorite film of 2017. The screenplay is magnificent.",The Florida Project
501,fungrl,A train wreck in the making but you cant take your eyes off and you can't look away!,8,28 July 2018,"At first I as a lower class single mother, not fully understanding what I was watching I was appalled and judgemental, like someone needs to take this child. Then after the majority of the movie I started to care for the mother and love Bobby. 
When the climax happened I cried and fell in love with this movie! I watched it two days later aging and this time with no judgement. What a great story! I hope others give it a chance.
I think the magic in this film is when you see this little girl be a little girl!",The Florida Project

Why I never got round to watching it I'm not sure, but I can honestly say I wish I had seen this film earlier.The writing is brilliant. Sean Baker beautifully involves realism with imagination. You fall in love with the characters easily and what an amazing job they did too. The acting in this is truly raw and emotional.Brooklynn Prince has an outstanding role in this. She plays both an adorable yet a hard shell character. As for Bria Vinaite, her debut feature role was utterly eye catching. I felt so attached to her while watching her portray a single mother accepting the life she has.This film shows both emotion and happiness and I would very much watch this again.",The Florida Project

510,tamlando,NOT THE FLORIDA YOU REALIZE,9,24 February 2019,"The movie is EXTREMELY realistic of poverty life in Florida
when Disney sucks the life and pay out of you.
THIS is subtle way for a film maker to illustrate JUST how
BAD it is working at or living near the Mouse.
It is actually WORSE than this film depicts.
The film SHOULD have gotten the Oscar for its presentation
which is on target EXCEPT for one small exaggerated detail:
The very last scene where the 2 girls run away from Futureland inn
(now Paradise Inn) - it shows then running all the way down US 192 and into
the Magic Kingdom theme park of Walt Disney World.
THIS is one part that couldnt POSSIBLE be accurate
for the motel they ran from is OVER 14 MILES from WDW.",The Florida Project
