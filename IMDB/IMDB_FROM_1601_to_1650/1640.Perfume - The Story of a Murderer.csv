0,MartinHafer,Lovely music and style can't cover up the stench of this film,3,13 January 2009,"While I truly disliked this film, I can't give it a score of 1 simply because the music was so lovely and so much of the production was well done--such as the narration and cinematography (when, at least, it isn't focused on close ups of vomiting and filth). In other words, while I found the story itself utterly repellent, the people who made this film obviously were talented and crafted an amazing tale out of an incredibly nihilistic and sick premise. And, because there were so many revolting aspects to the film, I certainly could not recommend it.This film has already been reviewed by a bazillion people, so reprising the story isn't necessary--for that, read some of the other reviews. Instead, I want to talk about what I hated about this tale. I have a bit of a bias and I should point this out before I continue. I don't like films about serial killers or murder, so the fact that I disliked this film so much isn't a huge surprise. What was a surprise to me is that one of my co-workers actually thought I'd like this film and suggested I watch it. If I'd known what it was about, I am sure I wouldn't have even bothered. Much of this is because a long time ago, I made my living attempting to do therapy with murderers and rapists. It was all probably just a waste of time and since then I just don't want to hear about this sort of crap--I've seen and heard enough and don't find it interesting--just repellent. For me, life is just too short to immerse myself in evil. Been there, done that.The bottom line is that PERFUME is a very dehumanizing a movie. People are murdered for our entertainment. While the killings are not super-graphic, there is a gentle fairy tale quality about this that seems to excuse or at least trivialize this horror. Had anyone watched this movie who has lost family members to murder, I wonder just how ""entertaining"" this all would have been?! Tons of nudity (none of which is sexy--much of which seems sick and sad), scenes of people vomiting (in closeup), extreme violence, abuse of corpses--this movie seems to have it all. Frankly, had I LIKED this film, I would have worried. Instead, it was a chore to finish and I won't recommend it to anyone.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
1,Leofwine_draca,Overrated,5,11 February 2013,"A novel adaptation given epic film treatment, PERFUME is the story of one man's obsession which leads to murder and depravity. Set in 18th century France, featuring top-notch production values and an overwhelming sense of time and place (the buildings, costumes and background are all tremendous), as well as an original and intriguing story, this should be an easy film to like.And it is, not least because it features an excellent actor in the leading role: step forward Ben Whishaw, nowadays a bigger name thanks to his starring roles in the likes of THE HOUR and SKYFALL but then just breaking out as a new actor. Whishaw is fantastic, really adding depth and feeling to his character, making him a complex being, somebody who captivates and repulses the viewer in equal measure. Whishaw adds an incredible amount of watchability to this film.He needs to, because unfortunately PERFUME is far from perfect. It starts off fine, but after an hour it starts to drag. Then it really starts to drag. Although it's a film about a murderer, there are no thrills or suspense; the deaths are bypassed over, the director embodies his protagonist's mentality and sees them as secondary to his aims. The last half of the film is fairly dull, enlivened only by Alan Rickman in a supporting role, and don't get me started on the ridiculous ending. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's goodIf anything, this made me want to rewatch the old black-and-white Boris Karloff film, CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, which has a similar premise (man driven to become a serial killer for the greater good) but is about a hundred times better.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
2,SnoopyStyle,Dark grungy beauty,8,29 September 2014,"The movie opens with Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) being sentenced to a gruesome punishment during the 18th century cheered on lustily by the crowd. He was born in the putrid 1738 Paris fish market, found in the pile of fish guts, and his mother sent to the gallows. He's put in the overcrowded orphanage where the other kids immediately try to kill him. He unnerves the other kids with his strange superior ability to smell. He is sold to the tannery at the age of 13. When he grows older, he is entranced by the smells of the city and the smell of the Plum Girl. He accidentally kills her leaving him with a desire to preserve the intoxicating scent of the girl. While delivering leather, he impresses perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) who is now too old and out of touch. So much so that Baldini purchases the young man. Grenouille is obsessed with a way to replicate. Baldini tells him of the mysterious art of enfleurage found in Grasse. While walking on a country road, he is overtaken by the smell of Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood). Her father is Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman).This would be a great movie for smell-o-vision. The style is doing the next best thing. It is grungy, dark and ugly. The ugliness pushes the senses of the audience. Ben Whishaw is wonderfully creepy. He does a scary stone-faced intensity. His character is isolated. He's obsessed. This is the essence of the movie. It's about his obsession and his amoral pursuit of it. He brings no judgment to his life other than to satisfying the obsession. I would say the movie has a sexual sense if not for the fact that it is done in such a gruesome manner. This is a movie unlike most others. This movie is deliciously horrible.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
3,Hitchcoc,Like Nothing You've Ever Seen,9,1 December 2009,"I chanced upon this film when I saw it listed in a catalog. I had read the book a couple of years ago and realized from the description this was the source of the movie. It is a great story, almost Twainlike in its cynicism, especially the idiocy of the masses. I remember the final scenes of A Connecticut Yankee (the book, not the movie). Anyway, we have a protagonist who murders young women, and, yet, we can't take our eyes off him. It is, of course, voyeuristic, and at times you don't want to watch. Fortunately, there is little gore and the scenes are mostly respectful. As he makes his way through life with his olfactory sense dominating his life and his attempts to make the perfect perfume, we almost pull for him. Part of that is that the world is so full of pain anyway and death and disease are the order of the day. The French hierarchy is nearly as cruel as he, so why is he such a big deal? I'm always intrigued how incensed everyone gets over a person who mistreats other, especially women and children, but will allow them to die in squalor without lifting a finger. This was the worst of times, and this murderer actually brought a moment of happiness through his killing. Did I just say that? I guess there is an element of truth.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
4,Horst_In_Translation,Scent of a woman,4,13 September 2016,"""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is a co-production between Germany, Spain, France and the United States and despite German director Tom Tykwer, this is an English-language production. This has to do mostly with the cast. Lead actor is Ben Whishaw, today famous for being the new Q, and major supporting characters are played by Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman. Tykwer is also one of the three writers who adapted the Süskind novel. The others would be late German producing legend Bernd Eichinger and Oscar nominee Andrew Birkin. This movie has its 10th anniversary this year and it runs for a massive 150 minutes almost, even if this already includes 10 minutes of credits.The story is a mix of fantasy, mystery and crime with a touch of romance as this is the story of a young man willing to do everything he has to in order to find the perfect fragrance and perfume. This sounds pretty stupid and childish initially, but given the absurd premise I guess they still turned this into a period piece that is a bearable watch overall. But it does get pretentious on several occasions and I just could not take the film as seriously as it wants to be taken. One example would be the great memorable scene with everybody cuddling and making love in public when they smell this perfect perfume. And this is just one of several scenes where it is all too bizarre and unrealistic for my taste. You can maybe partially blame the writer of the original novel, but I am not sure to which extent really because, as I am not a great reader, I have never taken a look at Süskind's work. Admittedly, this film also did not get me curious about it.As a whole, I still have the opinion that Tykwer is fairly overrated and there is no real reason from what I have seen so far that he is among Germany's most known filmmakers abroad and in the United States and that he is working with the likes of Tom Hanks. Many lesser known directors are more talented in my opinion and the fact that this film here is a contender for Tykwer's most famous really does not shed positive light on his body of work. It sure is an opulent film, but it is also one that lacks credible depth and a truly creative mind, even if all kinds of awards bodies want you to think otherwise. I also feel that Tykwer is not an actors' director as Whishaw was pretty underwhelming and Rickman and Hoffman were fairly generic and forgettable too compared to what else they have done in their long careers. I don't recommend the watch. Herfurth is downright stunning again, but that's it. Thumbs down.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
5,claudio_carvalho,Scent of Women,7,10 September 2012,"In the Eighteenth Century, in France, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is born in the dirtiness of a fish market in Orleans and abandoned by his mother. He is raised in an orphanage and develops an extraordinary sense of smell. He is sold by the responsible for the orphanage to a tanner and he becomes an apprentice.One day, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) goes to Paris for a delivery and he learns new odors. He is attracted by the scent of a red haired teenager and follows her. When the girl startles with Grenouille sniffing her, he unintentionally kills her by suffocation after covering her mouth for a long time.When Grenouille delivers a skin to Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) that owns a decadent perfume shop, he convinces the Italian to hire him to create new aromas for him. In return, he asks Baldini to teach him the names of the substances and how to preserve the scents. Baldini explains that the perfumes are the combination of twelve fragrances, but there is an unknown thirteenth scent that was found in an Egyptian tomb that caused rapture in those that had smelled it.Grenouille is frustrated when he finds that Baldini is not able to teach him how to preserve the scent of everything, and he moves to Grasse expecting to create the perfect perfume. He also discovers that his body is odorless. When he sees the gorgeous Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), who is the daughter of the noble Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman), he believes that she is special. He develops a method using fat to preserve the scent and begins his killing spree of young women. The population is afraid of the notorious murderer and Antoine believes that his daughter might be his next victim. Will Grenouille find his aimed perfection?""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is a very weird movie, with an original story of a man seeking out the perfect perfume and becoming a serial-killer in his quest. My daughter read the novel and watched the movie later and she liked a lot this film. Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to read the novel before to fully understand the conclusion, when Grenouille is devoured by the crowd. Last, fortunately movie theaters and televisions do not have odors yet. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Perfume - A História de um Assassino"" (""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"")",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
6,kosmasp,Great adaptation,8,6 May 2007,"I don't know if Kubrick really said, that the Novel, on which the movie is based, was not screen-able, because it was based on the smell sense of humans! But Tom Tykwer shows us here, that there is more there than the smell! I haven't read the novel, so I don't know how accurate the depictions are, but it seems like Tom T. is not afraid to pull punches. That's not to say, that this overly violent in the explicit sense. But one would argue that the real horror, always plays in ones mind. Seems like you will be able to judge if you're backing this theory or if you're against it. And although we never really get the man behind all this madness, it's a great work of art (the movie that is ... if you want you can call something else also a ""work of art"" ... You'll get it, after watching the movie, if you don't already know the novel!)",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
7,gavin6942,A Decent Story... Not So Much About Murder as Title Implies,7,19 May 2010,"Just a quick review for this one: I had previously really enjoyed Tom Tykwer's ""Lola Rennt"" so I was quite surprised to see that this was his work -- it represents a far more mature film, and much less of the fringe element that ""Lola"" seemed to embrace. And that such folks as Ridley Scott, Tim Burton, Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman and Stanley Kubrick were considered for director? Tykwer really lucked out on this one.While the whole film is great, and Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman can really do no wrong, special credit must be given to whoever is responsible for the baby at the film's beginning. If it's real, the acting they were able to get is amazing. If not real (as I suspect), they did an amazing likeness! Best work ever.Beyond that, I will save any comments for a second viewing.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
8,lee_eisenberg,Who scent you?,7,14 October 2007,"For years, many people have associated the French with certain smells, whether the stereotype of the people not bathing, or Pepe Le Pew. But now there comes something different. Something that I could have never imagined. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" tells the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw). He was born to a meat cutter in the putrid environs of a market in 18th century Paris. When his mother tried to abandon him, she was executed and he was sent to work in a tannery. During his employment there, he developed a unique sense of smell. So, he went to work for has-been perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman, whom I at first didn't recognize due to his makeup). But in the process, he found that the only way to capture the perfect scent was through...murder. So, he began killing women and rubbing animal fat on them to capture their scent. And in the city of Grasse, things were doomed to get really ugly...This was certainly an interesting movie, if not the best. Director Tom Tykwer (""Run Lola Run"") makes us understand that Jean-Baptiste is turning very weird, but still allows us to admire him somewhat. As it is, some of the other characters aren't much better. When Jean-Baptiste starts murdering women in Grasse but nobody knows the culprit, the town's head honcho (Alan Rickman) proposes a curfew and people start blaming the gypsies.But anyway, the movie's worth seeing. You may never think about perfume the same again after seeing it.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
9,jboothmillard,Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,5,7 February 2016,"I don't know why, but the title sounded to me like something based on a true story, it is fact based on a novel, thought to be ""unfilmable"" for a film adaptation, but it happened and this is the result, directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, The International, Cloud Atlas). Basically Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Skyfall's Ben Whishaw) was abandoned in a French fish market at birth, he was raised in an orphanage and grew up a strange detached boy, he has a superhuman sense of smell and revels in new odours. Grenouille as a young man works a delivery boy, he becomes focused on a redheaded Plum Girl (Karoline Herfurth), he follows her and repeatedly tries to sniff her, Grenouille startles her with his behaviour, he covers her mouth to stop her crying out, unintentionally suffocating her, realising she is dead he strips her naked and smells her all over, but is distraught as her scent fades. Grenouille is haunted with the desire the recreate the girl's aroma, he one day makes a delivery to the perfume shop of Italian owner Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), who is amazed with his ability to identify and create fragrances, Grenouille revitalises the perfumer's career with new formulas, and all he wants is for Baldini to teach him how preserve scents. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may theoretically contain a thirteenth scent, but Grenouille is saddened when he learns Baldini's distillation method will not capture all object scents, Baldini informs him of another method to be found in Grasse, he will provide him the papers he requires in exchange for 100 new perfume formulas. Grenouille decides to exile himself from society, he discovers on his journey he has no body odour, and is therefore worthless, he decides that creating the perfect perfume will prove his worth. Arriving in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of beautiful redheaded Laura Richis (Peter Pan's Rachel Hurd-Wood), daughter of the wealthy Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman), he decides she will be his ""thirteenth scent"", the linchpin for his perfume. Grenouille finds a job working for Madame Arnulfi (Corinna Harfouch), and he learns the method of enfleurage, using odourless animal fats to capture fragrances, his first attempt using hot enfleurage on a lavender picking girl fails, his second attempt using cold enfleurage on a prostitute he hires works, after he murders her. Grenouille embarks on a killing spree, targeting young beautiful women, murdering them with a hard blow to the back of the head, and capturing their scents using his perfected method, the naked bodies of the women are dumped around the city and panic spreads. Grenouille has successfully captured the scents of twelve women, he plans his attack on Laura, it is announced that a man has confessed to the murders, but Richis is unconvinced, knowing the killer is not after sex but something more specific about the women, so he and his daughter flee the city. Grenouille is able to track Laura's scent to a roadside inn, sneaks into her room during the night and murders her, successfully capturing her scent, he finishes preparing his perfume, and moments soldiers capture him, he is sentenced for murder to execution. The day of the execution, Grenouille applies the perfume on himself, the executioner and the crowd in attendance are consumed and speechless by the power and beauty of the fragrance, they declare Grenouille innocent, and suddenly break out into a mass orgy, Richis is still convinced by his guilt, only up close does he get consumed himself. Walking out of Grasse unharmed, Grenouille has the power with the perfume to rule the world, but he can never love or be loved like a normal person, disheartened by his aimless quest he returns to the fish market where he was born, pouring the remaining perfume over his head, the people around him consumed by the fragrance believe him to be an angel and, like cannibals, devour him, in the morning all that remains are his clothes, and the final drop of perfume falls from the empty bottle. Narrated by John Hurt, also starring The World Is Not Enough's David Calder as Bishop of Grasse, Sian Thomas as Madame Gaillard, Jessica Schwarz as Natalie, Kill List's Michael Smiley as Porter and Simon Chandler as Mayor of Grasse. Whishaw gives a suitably chilly turn as the young man with the smelling ability of a shark who turns into an obsessive murderer to find the perfect smell, Hoffman and Rickman do well in their supporting roles as well, I can see why this story set in the 18th century had a big question mark over it, it has both gloomy and vibrant visuals and interesting music throughout, I admit it is very up and down with pace at times, but it has overall sense of strangeness, I found the last twenty minutes in particular highly weird, that is probably the point, an alright period psychological crime thriller. Worth watching!",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Well, It Certainly Is Original And, Despite The Ending, I Found It Fascinating",9,26 July 2007,"Wow, this is really a bizarre story with an ending that probably will turn off 98 percent of viewers who stick with this two hours, 147-minute film. I'm not sure what to make of it, other than totally understanding if people are left unsatisfied after watching this movie. As I said, I'm not sure how to interpret it as I just finished it minutes ago. It leaves you almost stunned.Rather than judging that finale and having to use spoilers, let me just comment on the first two hours of the film, which I found utterly fascinating. If I wasn't such an admirer of photography, art and special-effects, I doubt I would have found the movie so appealing because the story is ""not for everyone."" However, thanks to stunning French city and countryside scenery, 18th century period and beautiful women it enhanced the story to me. Yet, regardless of the visual treats, the story was so unusual it still would have held my attention. There are enough reviews here so that to go into the story in detail isn't needed except to say this is an ""original."" I'm not familiar with any other story about a man who has such an extraordinary sense of smell that he can perform olfactory miracles and then, because of it, uses it to turn into a mass murderer. This is weird, really weird, but captivating to say the least.Ben Wishaw, who plays the lead character ""Jean-Baptist Grenouille, has a face that is perfect for this role. His emaciated body, which survived a brutal childhood existence from the moment he was born also makes his character all the more credible. The looks of shock and awe on this man's face throughout the picture also add to his believability. He was mesmerizing with his haunting expressions. Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman provide ""name"" actors the film but it's Wishaw's movie, all the way.I can only recommend this movie to those who share similar interests in cinematography and who like a ""different"" story but there are so many things in here - especially the ending - that could offend so many people, I would be hesitant to recommend this to the general viewer.I'm going to go look for the book at our local library.

12,Quinoa1984,"fantastic production design, usually spellbinding editing...but the results are frustratingly uneven",6,22 August 2007,"I'll say it off the bat- I haven't read the book of Perfume by Patrick Suskind. But I have heard that the film is, ironic considering most directors' claims that it was unfilmable, quite faithful to the source. I don't doubt it, as it has a literary quality all about it. From the John Hurt narration (and even when it's not necessary or adding only bits to the psychology of the characters, it's good to have Hurt doing it), to the fast-paced storytelling, to the detail likely expressed in the locations and settings, it feels novelistic even when it's at it's worst (which is, regrettably, the last twenty minutes, as Truffaut said is the most important section of a picture). The initial story itself, the first half of it, does spell some entertainment to come. An orphan grows up into a slave, but has somehow had since birth the incredible gift of smell, to smell everything (yes, even in smelly old France), and is tempted more than ever after accidentally killing a woman one night and smelling her from head to toe. The idea of catching smell, scents of people, drives him bonkers as he later learns of perfume from a master (Dustin Hoffman, one of the bright spots acting-wise) that there have to be a set number of ingredients- and that special something to put it over the top.And over the top it does become! But not before Tom (Run Lola Run) Twyker, cinematographer Frank Griebe (also Run Lola Run), production designer Uli Hanisch, and (surprisingly, considering his past work was with Paul W Anderson) editor Alexander Berner create the look of the film as something worth watching for. In fact, for the latter, it sometimes is really absorbing the way the images move forward, at a clip that is a little reminiscent of Thelma Schoonmaker (and, perhaps through that, Scorsese to a very small point). If looking squarely on the technical grounds, Perfume is one of the best produced out of Europe in 2006. Yet however much Twyker and his crew- save for the music which is a befuddling mix of Popol Vuh and orchestrations for a Disney channel movie- go to lengths to make this feel real and gritty and dark, it's hard to obscure how there is, in a way, a silliness to the conceit of the character. On the one hand it is compelling to see him in his early stages, his first victim, his 'training' (in quotes as he doesn't need it exactly, just a little guidance).On the other hand, and a little more ironic considering the draw of the suspense and horror of the murders, when he starts killing it's not quite as compelling. I know there's a level of disbelief to be had, and this goes without saying that every time Jean Grenouille leaves someone (orphan caretaker, slave owner, Hoffman's character) that person dies. And even up until the last twenty minutes I could take that level of disbelief, and it's still a good movie. But when it comes to the climax- and Grenouille's ""demise"" (from a point of view may depend on how much you take it as Christian allegory, or devil-allegory, who knows)- it falls apart for me. It may not for some, as it's own pretentiousness might be part of the appeal- frankly there's a touch of the Passion of the Christ in the mix there as far as slow-motion melodrama goes- and some might hate it to no end. It's a flawed conclusion, though mostly cause of what has been set up before, while sometimes in the ridiculous (so many murdered, none seen in the act, eh why not), feels and comes off realistic in that gritty 18th century set-up that can only come out of the poor and rich sections of French life. By the time we get the messianic image towards the end, I felt like turning off the movie- and luckily it ended.So Perfume ends up being neither a debacle nor a full-blown artistic success. I was glad to see it, and it's fairly well acted (watch Alan Rickman as he speaks in a very low, sinister tone to Grenouille as he is dunked in the barrel of water), even to a point by the hollow-eyed Ben Whishaw. But it just, well...does not smell quite right at the end.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

What seemed to me to be woefully lacking throughout was any kind of Passion either positive or negative.

Nor is there any satisfactory explanation - one that will stand scrutiny under a strong light - of how this guy can kill at will and conceal the bodies despite a full-scale alert. If it comes to that (and unless I missed something major) how the hell did a guy leave a cell in rags and turn up for his public execution not only unescorted by armed guards but in an immaculate blue suit and in a coach yet.

14,lastliberal,An original concept in horror,9,22 March 2008,"You knew that this film was going to be different from the very beginning. When the sentence was read and the crowd reaction, it was obviously something so unspeakable that it would keep you on the very edge of your seat.Then comes the description of Paris: ""In the period of which we speak, there reigned in the cities a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women. Naturally, the stench was foulest in Paris, for Paris was the largest city in Europe. And nowhere in Paris was that stench more profoundly repugnant than in the city's fish-market. It was here then, on the most putrid spot in the whole kingdom, that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born on the 17th of July, 1738. It was his mothers fifth birth, she delivered them all here under her fish-stand, and all had been stillbirths or semi-stillbirths. And by evening the whole mess had been shoveled away with the fish-guts into the river. It would be much the same today, but then... Jean-Baptiste chose differently."" To see the conditions under which Jean-Baptiste was born was profoundly repugnant - entrails, rats, filth, maggots - you could smell the stench through the screen, and you could only wonder what horror awaits from someone born into these conditions.What follow is not some story in the tradition of Saw or Hostel, but a horror tale told amid beauty.A man (Ben Whishaw) in relentless pursuit of a legend told to him by master perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman).A dream that brought him to the door of the exquisite beauty Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood), who, among the 12 virgins that perished in quest, seemed to be the culmination of a dream. And, despite the efforts of her father (Alan Rickman in a magnificent performance), was to provide the ultimate rebirth of the legend.But, like all, he realized that nothing can top that first love (Karoline Herfurth) that was now denied to him and was discontent.

The movie does not really have one clear main plot line, in terms of having a beginning, middle and ending that all fit in with each other. It makes the movie a bit frustrating and overlong to watch at times, since it just isn't clear were the movie is trying to head to. It doesn't make ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" the most easy movie to watch, although it definitely more accessible than the marketing and whole hype surrounding the movie suggest it is. Though I don't think I want to watch this movie again any time soon.It's a well directed movie and Tom Tykwer does a good job at keeping the story as 'down to Earth' as possible, with the exception of 2 or 3 sequences, that were too significant and complicated to bring it to the screen in a simple way. Nevertheless, it in essence is a pretty unusual and inaccessible story, that is made perfectly understandable and accessible, due to the movie its directing. Seems like Tom Tykwer has a great future ahead of him.Can't say that I was always too happy about Ben Whishaw as the main lead of the movie. No, I don't think Ben Whishaw will grow into become a great well known actor. The supporting cast is significantly better with actors such as Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman, with John Hurt as the movie its narrator.All in all an unique viewing experience, that isn't among the best movies of the year but nevertheless is a real recommendable one.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,One of the most unusual films I've seen,8,23 October 2009,"It's a wonderful thing to see a film this original and courageous be made today, employing technological advances that help the cinematic language. I have not read the novel, though I would like to. This does an impeccable job of putting images to scent, and captures that sense as well as the medium possibly could, and it's better than one would think. The brutal time period and cruel environment are perfectly realized, as well. And the way it captures the grace and soft beauty of women is spot-on. This is *not* for everyone. A large chunk of people are going to find this disgusting and perhaps even perverted. I'm not going to try to talk you into it, if you look at this and deem it repulsive. You're not in the intended audience. The choice was made to make this as it should be, and not risk losing the essence of it. This has amazing editing and camera-work. The story is gripping and develops well throughout. Whishaw(who is now on my list of people in the business to keep an eye on as of this, and Tykwer has moved further up on it) delivers an exceptional performance, with minimal spoken lines. Every acting performance is marvelous, and most are flawless. The dialog is realistic and well-delivered. John Hurt's narration is beyond reproach, and adds a lot. The production values leave absolutely nothing to be desired. There is a nice and fitting amount of humor in this, and it's never forced. This builds tension well, and is, when it tries to be, rather exciting and intense. Violence is subtle. There is disturbing content in this, how much will depend on the individual's tastes. The sexuality and nudity are neither crude nor excessive, and it is all entirely justifiable. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine that it would interest them. 8/10",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
17,gradyharp,A Visual Masterwork,8,3 August 2007,"PERFUME - THE STORY OF A MURDERER may not succeed on every level. Based on the novel DAS PERFUM by Patrick Süskind and prepared for the screen by Andrew Birkin, Bernd Eichinger, and director Tom Tykwer, this is a story more about the senses than about people. The main character is not the sort of man with whom we can identify, but the progress of this crazed youth into the olfactory madness of serial killing for the sake of creating perfumes does provide an opportunity to study life in the 18th century in a way seldom available for viewers. It is clumsy in spots, protracted in length, and a bit tedious in the telling, but visually this is a movie that is a feast (?) for the eyes.Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born in poverty and while he is thought to be stillborn, he survives and is found to have an extraordinary sense of smell. His youth is spent in work houses and slavery until one famous Italian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), living in Paris, discovers Grenouille's gifts and takes him on as an apprentice. The lad learns the technique of vaporizing and boiling essences but when he asks Baldini how to capture the smell of 'anything at all' (particularly the scent of women), Baldini sends him off to study the technique of 'enfleurage', a manner of embedding flowers in fat until their essences are absorbed yield a pure form in the distillation of the melted fat. Grenouille begins to capture women to coat them in fat to obtain their scent and in doing so he begins his cycle of murders of the victims. When he encounters the lass Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) who would steal his attention, her father Richis (Alan Rickman) finally puts and ending to the macabre tale of Perfume.In many ways, though the cast performs well, the star of the production is the cinematography by Frank Griebe and the accompanying musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and (yes) Tom Tykwer. At 147 minutes the movie is too long for the story, but the setting and moods created are well worth watching. Grady Harp",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
18,The_Void,Completely bizarre serial killer flick!,8,30 January 2008,"Well, no matter what you think of this film; you have to take your hat off for its originality. Serial killer flicks are ten a penny, and while is yet another serial killer flick at heart; the killer and his reasons for killing set it apart from the majority of other films of this type. If I had to associate some of the senses with films, the obvious ones would be sight and sound. This film focuses on the sense of smell, which in itself makes the film somewhat unique. Obviously, the film isn't able to make the audience smell what the characters smell; although it does a good job of getting around this. The story is based on a novel by Patrick Süskind and focuses on a young man named Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. This young man was unfortunate enough to be born into a fish market in eighteenth century Paris. He suffers an unenviable upbringing, although he is gifted with a superior sense of smell. He eventually finds his way into a perfumer's shop where he wins himself a job, and soon vows to make the finest perfume the world has ever seen...The film is directed by Tom Tykwer, who previously impressed audiences with his hit film 'Run Lola Run'. The director clearly has an eye for offbeat and unique films, and this film shares that in common with his earlier opus. Tykwer gives the film its own unorthodox style too with slick cinematography that gives it a real sense of beauty. Lead actor Ben Whishaw does not have a great deal of charisma, although his role does not require it and he is always believable as the strange young perfumer. He's given excellent support too, by the likes of Alan Rickman, Dustin Hoffman and John Hurt as the narrator. The murder side of the story does take centre stage, particularly around the start of the final third; although the focus is always kept on the lead star and the idea of his heightened sense of smell and the murders often feel unimportant; which is fitting considering their part in the bigger picture of the plot line. The murder scenes themselves are not dwelt on either, which benefits the film. It all boils down to one of the most bizarre endings I've ever seen, and it's one which will definitely divide opinions. Personally, I found it fitting and memorable. Overall, I can't say that this film is without problems; but it's certainly one of the more interesting films of the last few years and does come recommended.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
19,mm-39,I hated this film. Perfume smells like a fart.,6,29 July 2007,"My wife wanted to rent this film. A guy makes perfume off dead girls and because of the smell can memorize people and get away with murder. After watching this film, and the guy eventually dies the viewer feels riped off emotional. The film is so silly and stupid I wish they did something more with it. Too much a art form and not a movie. Maybe they could have used a UFO in it I don't know. 6 out of 10. The film is watchable enough, but why waste one's time. I should have worked out instead. Film was kind sick and slimy. Perfume smells More like a fart! Leaves a bad smell in the air.

20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Perfume,7,13 January 2007,"Perfume is a queer movie. In fact, I'm tempted to say it almost falls into the same fantasy like genre as Mirrormask or Pan's Labyrinth, except that it's darker, has more black humour, and takes itself at times very seriously. Based on a novel by Patrick Suskind, Perfume at first looks like those biographical type movies where you trace the development of a perfumer, and if you've seen the trailers, it joins the gore movies with its totally warped plot development.Director Tom Tykwer has piled on plenty of visual repulsiveness in this movie, in order to highlight the importance of scent. If there is one movie to be used as a platform for those next generation cinemas like the incorporation of smell-o-rama gimmicks, then Perfume will be the perfect candidate. You have both ends of the smell spectrum covered, from the foulest stench on the streets, to the beautiful scent of a woman.And it is this unique, pretty scent that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) wants to capture. Born in a uniquely different manner (you have to see to believe) and brought up in the worst possible manner in early France, the man grows to be a perfumer wannabe blessed with a gift of superior scent, and you know that given the many close up shots of his nose. However, his IQ is a bit suspect, as he goes around with that heavy brooding look, and is obsessed with the singular goal of preserving wonderful smells, from women, for all eternity.There's almost an entire hour dealing with his development as a perfumer, learning from one of the best in the business - Italian Giuseppe Baldini (played by Dustin Hoffman), as both mentor and protégé develop a symbiotic relationship - the junior wishing to learn the craft, while the senior lacking in inspiration, seeks new ideas and concoctions from his latest pupil. Although Hoffman turns on his charismatic charm, much of this area turned out to drag the narrative flow.Things picked up though, with the Jack The Ripper-ish moments, as Jean-Baptiste hones his instincts to gather his perfect tools for the trade - that of 12 vials of scents, from beautiful women. His ultimate prize catch is Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), whom you'd think he had develop romantic feelings for. But this is a man, as mentioned, with questionable IQ and incredible career obsession, so what happens really, just boggles the minds, just as it did the villagers. The final act treads on the fantastical and the implausible, but that's what makes this movie queer. Of course I'm not complaining with what's on screen, but felt that the resolution for the character was somewhat akin to a Chinese martial arts character Du Gu Qiu Bai (Literally translated as ""Lonely, Seeking Defeat"") - what do you do when you've achieved your goals and attained what you wanted to attain, becoming untouchable in the process?It's my first movie watching Ben Whishaw in action, and I thought this guy could express himself without the need of speaking too much. Rachel Hurd-Wood definitely looked like she's older than 18, and her chemistry with Ålan Rickman, who plays her father, actually resembled one of her movies last year - American Haunting. It doesn't help that both movies are period movies though.Rated R21, there are gratuitous nudity and scenes with adequate gore. I thought the scenes with Jean-Baptiste as a newborn was excellent, and I suspect that a fake baby was used to film it - a scene which will definitely make you go ""eewww"" instead of ""aawww"". Final verdict - I'll say this one totes the middle ground.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

22,christopher-underwood,best to see the film and then get into the book,7,19 October 2007,"I think I would have enjoyed this a bit more if I had not read the book. The film is well constructed, looks marvellous and tells an unusual story with skill, condensing a rather long and complex tale of the supposed origins of perfumery and murder into a fairly tight and absorbing piece of work. The book however was such a deep and fascinating excursion into the mind of a crazed genius that, so absorbed with the whole concept of creating the ultimate perfume we pay little attention to the killings. The film on the other hand plays up the murders and finds itself at something of a loss through the visual medium to quite convey the density of odours conjured up by the written word. So, I reckon its probably (unusually) best to see the film and then get into the book.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
23,JamesHitchcock,"Dull, Dour and Repellent",5,18 April 2011,"Political imperialism may have had its day, but linguistic imperialism continues to thrive with surprisingly little adverse comment. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is, officially, a German film, made by a German director and a German producer and based on a novel by a German writer. It is set in France and was largely filmed in Spain. And, of course, made in English with all the leading roles taken by British or American actors.The action takes place in pre-revolutionary 18th century France. The main character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, is the illegitimate son of a Parisian fishwife who, soon after his birth, is executed for attempting to murder him. Grenouille, who grows up in an orphanage, later discovers that he has a highly developed sense of smell and as a result becomes an apprentice to Giuseppe Baldini, a famous perfumer, learning the secrets of perfume manufacture. Grenouille's ultra-sensitive nose enables him to create new perfumes, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of creating the perfect fragrance. He leaves Baldini and travels to Grasse in Provence, then as now a centre of the perfume-manufacturing industry. He discovers that it is possible to capture the scents of different human beings, the only problem being that it is necessary to kill the person first. Grenouille, however, has no intention of allowing moral scruples to stand between him and his ambition, and sets about murdering young women in order to harvest their odours, as it is these that are the essential ingredients of his perfect fragrance.This is the second film directed by Tom Tykwer which I have seen. The first was ""Lola Rennt"", which I found clever and ingenious but somewhat lacking in heart. The same could be said, to an even greater degree, of ""Perfume"". No expense has been spared in recreating 18th century Europe. Tykwer's vision is not of the prettified, upper-class 18th century of British ""heritage cinema"" productions like ""The Duchess"". Rather, it is a vision, particularly in the Parisian scenes, of lower-class 18th century life with all its filth and squalor. (We are made to realise just why perfume-making was so important an industry during this period). Tykwer described the film as having ""a distinctly dark aesthetic"", with a dark, gloomy palette reflecting the dark deeds which make up its plot.Yet this is a film even more lacking in heart than ""Lola Rennt"". The main reason is that Ben Whishaw in the main role is pale and uninteresting. We never get any sense of what makes Grenouille tick, of the passions which drive him to murder thirteen innocent women- indeed, he seems devoid of any passion at all. The film critic of The New York Times said that Whishaw ""does not quite manage to make Grenouille either a victim worthy of pity or a fascinating monster"" and described the character as ""dull, dour and repellent"". Despite the care taken with recreating 18th century life and some good performances in minor roles from the likes of Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman, that would be my verdict on the film as a whole. Matters are not improved by the implausible ending, which converts what has hitherto been a reasonably realistic film into a quasi-supernatural piece of fantasy. 5/10",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

25,theowinthrop,The search for the perfect perfume - for perfect ion of an ephemeral effect,10,27 June 2008,"The novel PERFUME came out about twenty years ago, and was one of those international sensations blending a mystery with the feel and texture of an historical novel, and adding either theological tones (THE NAME OF THE ROSE) or philosophy (PERFUME). Despite some differences with the novel the screenplay here does a fine job keeping the story of olfactory triumph and it's empty results to the front, holding the audiences' attention to the interesting conclusion.Basically the story is the odd career of the 18th Century Serial Killer Jean Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw). Grenouille is born in the lowest level of 18th Century Society - his mother (who has had four children before) is a fish dealer. Too poor to have proper treatment with a midwife or doctor, she gives birth beneath her fish table, cutting the umbilical cord with the same knife as used on her fish heads. Her probable intention is to dump the child in the garbage of the food market, but the appearance of the mother and a customer's noting a sound lead to the child's discovery. The mother is hanged, and the young Jean Baptiste sent to an orphanage. From the start the society of the 18th Century is disheartening. It is not the world of the philosophes but the French equivalent of WIlliam Hogarth's ""Gin Lane"". Drunkeness, whores, thieves, violent death, filth, is everywhere (to the point that the viewer can nearly smell everything). Everybody who gets the early Jean Baptiste are not likable people. The woman running the orphanage is greedy and quick to whip the kids (they sense something wrong with Jean Baptiste, and try to smother him - smart kids!). She sells him as an apprentice at age 15, but she is murdered by street thieves for her money. The tanner who apprentices Jean Baptiste is brutal looking. Jean Baptiste, by just smelling him, realizes he must do everything this man wants. As a result he survives the five year life average other apprentices of the man have - and eventually is sold to Bandini (Dustin Hoffman, in a nice supporting role) a perfumer. Shortly afterward the tanner is knocked down in a road when drunk, hits his head on a heavy stone, and drowns. Bandini eventually dies when his ancient home collapses, after Jean Baptiste leaves him.Since his birth beneath the fish table in the market, Jean Baptiste has had an exceptional nose which he trains to identify all items by their odors. But this includes people (we tend to forget that people being of a family of mammals have body odors). Taken to Paris on a business trip by the Tanner, Jean Baptiste wanders off fascinated by an odor. He gets to a perfume shop and smells the world's loveliest artificial odors. But he notices the women are the customers and concentrates on them after awhile. He takes a walk, following a young woman selling fruit (apricots), and even is able to trace her by her scent to go to her hovel. He really does not know what precisely he is to do with her, but when they are interrupted he grabs her against the shadow of a wall, watching a man walking away with a prostitute. Jean Baptiste ends up finding he accidentally killed her. He then takes the time to smell her body to understand the scent of virginal innocence that he had found so enticing.Later Jean Baptiste delivers some skins from the tannery to Bandini to be made to smell good with his scents. Jean Baptiste demonstrates his remarkable sense of smell and how it can enrich Bandini. So he purchases Jean Baptiste from the tanner, and soon is teaching him how to capture scent. Eventually Jean Baptiste goes to Southern France, and starts a career of killing women while capturing their body scent. After about seven murders he sets off a panic, and the town he is in tries to find him (going crazy in the process). Since nobody can understand the reason for the murders (none of the victims were ravaged) they can't figure out what he wants (although one townsman - Alan Rickman, in a good performance - suspects it is something shared by all these women). Rickman is worried, and with reason - his daughter (Rachel Hurd-Wood) may be targeted. Rickman should be worried - his daughter has been targeted.In the end the story completes in an execution that goes awry (and that everyone tries to forget), and Jean Baptiste seemingly victorious. Yes and no. He has escaped his last real peril by use of his discovery, but in doing this he has suddenly gotten a revelation that while he has control over the human race he has nothing. Having never been loved, in an age of great cruelty, he is incapable of love. He keeps thinking of his first victim, and what he probably should have offered to her...but he's too confused to notice it. So his triumph is worthless. In the end he welcomes...well the end.What is the scent of a love? PERFUME suggests that it is too costly to gain that secret unless you have an appreciation of love first.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
26,Robert_duder,"Hands down the most peculiar, way out there, artsy, critical darling film I have ever...BUT it was entertaining for once!!",7,5 August 2007,"I have seen my share of the bizarre film industry from Kubrick films, to little gems that boggle the mind with their way out their plots and strange little additions that critics seem to rave about and main stream audiences sit there and go...'what the hell is this?' Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is exactly that kind of film. I have never read the book, I have never even heard of the book but the fact that the master of strange odd film making himself Stanley Kubrick claimed the book was 'unfilmable' is pretty impressive that German director Tom Tykwer took it on full force and made it just as completely bizarre as you can imagine and yet this might be the first and most strangest film of it's kind that I think was entertaining and actually fun to watch. I had also never heard of the lead character Jean-Baptiste Grenouille so this was all entirely new to me but I can't explain to you enough the extreme nature of this film because it has scenes that are so vivid and just STRANGE and yet the story flows and makes sense and even with the absolutely incredibly bizarre twist at the end it still made me glad I watched it and that's really saying something.Young English actor Ben Whishaw plays Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, an Oliver Twist type character blessed with a super human ability to smell things but beaten and overlooked by society to the point where he is desperate for love in the only sense he knows...smell. He begins to murder women in a twisted attempt to capture their smell forever. Whishaw does a terrific job playing this cold blooded murderer that you actually feel empathy for because of his life and where he has come from. He is not a good person in any sense of the word but you can't help but pity him and he does a terrific job of capturing that. He commands the screen and easily holds his own. Dustin Hoffman, in a delectable role as a washed up famous perfumer, is the closest thing that Grenouille ever has to a family or a father who tries to teach him what he knows about perfume and Grenouille makes him rich. Hoffman is amazing as always and it's only very sad that his role doesn't last longer because he is terrific and worth seeing the film for. John Hurt is great as the narrator to the story with his burly and firm voice reminding us of a grandfather relaying a story. The rest of the cast are mostly supporting characters and none of them particularly stand out but they still do a terrific job.This film is truly a character study about Grenouille and his life and where it leads him right up to the rather supernatural and unexplainable ending. This film has several scenes which are almost gratuitous and yet artsy and well performed but something I have never seen in a film before. The first is the absolutely terrifying and disturbing birth scene of Grenouille with his mother played by Birgit Minichmayr, working in a fish market. She literally has contractions, falls to the slimy floor of the fish market, has her baby, cuts her own cord and kicks the baby underneath the table and stands up to continue selling. And every moment in shown in brutal vividness. The other scene that must be seen to be believed is an enormous group orgy of just thousands of extras on the screen in a town square where Grenouille is to be executed but hypnotizes them all. The entire city drops to the ground, begins to strip and have sex with each other, men and women. It's almost beautiful were it not so incredibly disturbing. You can't accuse Tom Tykwer of holding back because he lays it all out there. The best thing to say about Perfume is that it's like incredibly strange fairy tale for adults...that's exactly what it is but it is actually entertaining while being very artsy and achieves what it sets out to do. If you like something off the wall but still entertaining definitely check out Perfume: The Story of A Murderer. 7/10",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
27,ElMaruecan82,A sensational masterpiece ... darkly breathtaking and exquisitely perverse ...,9,23 November 2011,"""The Perfume"" is a sensational film in the most subtle and 'intimate' meaning of the word. It plunges us in a universe of sensations absolutely unique: the world of scents, perfumes, flavors, essences, all these sensations that belong to the most underrated of our five senses. I never thought a movie would succeed to describe a perfume with such accurate words and evocative images, well, Tom Tykwer's confident direction and the thought-provoking script powerfully recreated cinematically unknown perceptions with such exactitude that after watching ""The Perfume: the Story of a Murderer"" we can't help but feel like experiencing our own capability to discover our olfactory environment.But if the film is a class on its own through its tremendous capability to challenge our feelings, this could have been handled as well by a short story or even a documentary about perfumery. The other strength of Tykwer's underrated masterpiece is the story, the story of a murderer, but not anyone, this one has both a face and a name you couldn't forget. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,played by Ben Whishaw in a performance that demands a lot of patience and attention to realize how fitting it is for a character with this caliber of originality. Grenouille is original, in quite a dark way, starting by the first minutes of his life, when her mother gave him birth by casually letting him slide from her womb while she's working at a fish stall, condemning him to a horrific death, like she did for the five previous births. But something in Grenouille literally heartened him, something from the smells and putrid stink of Paris eighteenth century invaded his little nose, and after many agonizing breaths, invaded his lungs provoking a loud and shrill baby cries.This scene resonates like the legs braces' miracle in ""Forrest Gump"" when young Forrest developed his incredible fastness. Baby Grenouille started crying and screaming, betraying her mother who was immediately condemned to death for having abandoned her born child. Ironically, all the persons Grenouille would leave in his life immediately die, this recurrent theme takes us by surprise but halfway through the film, it gets so redundant we understand it's more of a running gag. The film is not a comedy, per se, but there's a sort of detachment and subtly dark humor proper to the picaresque genre, it might remind of ""Forrest Gump"", ""Little Big Man"" and ""Barry Lyndon"". But Grenouille's incredible gift makes him such a bizarre but fascinating character that it confirms what is said about film-making, the first ten minutes are crucial, and in the case of ""The Perfume"", they immediately absorb us.Like in the classic picaresque films, there's the initiation process that will allow the gift of the hero to be developed. The movie includes a superb sequence that involves Grenouille as the apprentice of Master Baldini, a declining Italian perfumer, set in Paris. This part works very well thanks to Dustin Hoffman's delightful performance, introducing some sweetness and smiling in a rather obscure film, not to mention the whole pedagogic value. After all, why shouldn't a film be an opportunity to learn about something as new as perfumery, especially when it's obviously leading somewhere? The sequence enriches Grenouille's personality, a man capable of detecting every kind of odors, to create perfumes with the right dosage, but desperately seeking the secret of capturing an essence, a ferocious desire born the day he smelt that beautiful red-haired girl and couldn't 'keep' her smell after having accidentally killed her.The pivotal part occurs when Baldini, relates the Egyptian legend of the thirteen essences that creates the most Heavenly perfume ever, a sort of olfactory Holy Grail. Grenouille, so alienated by his desire to capture odors, whether it's from roses, metals and even cats, found the true meaning of his life, a quest for perfection. As viewers, we're thrilled by this discover but whatever we expect, the first crime committed by Grenouille is so abominable, so absolutely inexcusable that you could only feel like applauding the story for exceeding the limits of perversity with such an exquisite way. Grenouille, as part of his initiation, started working in Grasse, capital of the perfume production only to become the most redoubtable serial killer, killing young girls until finding the right recipe to capture their essence. And the tragedy of Grasses is that it finally worked.Like so many great movies, the content is of an extraordinary richness as it transforms itself on a crime investigation where the paranoia of a whole population and the superstition-driven witch hunt would lead to a series of captivating situations and a cat-and-mouse game between Antoine Richis, Alan Rickman, as the father of a beautiful red-haired girl, Grenouille's final prey to achieve the miraculous recipe. Rickman escapes but that's only underestimating Grenouille's superior sense. At that point, we might regret that the movie begun with the ending, but such a gutsy story couldn't stop without a perverse but unforgettable apotheosis. The storytelling and narration was so powerful that we'd believe in Grenouille's gift, and in his success to create the perfect Perfume, whose unexpected effects are the perfect pay-off pay-off for one of the best movies of the last decade. Too pretentious, said the haters? Give me a break. If one thing, the movie perfectly delivers what we expect from it, it's dark, subtle, funny, sensational, and damn entertaining.And sorry if I end the review on an angrier note, but seriously, where are the Oscars? Where are the nominations? Direction, art-direction, screenplay, cinematography  on the year where ""The Departed"" won the Best Picture Oscar, this is a total disgrace and insult for creativity. I sincerely hope that in the years to come, ""The Perfume"" will get more and more supporters, for it's one of the most creative, sensational, unforgettable movies of the last year, and I knew the name of the director wasn't unfamiliar, Tom Tykwer is the director who made ""Run, Lola Run"".",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Not only are his films all superbly made, they are all different, as well. And they are all very cinematic, meaning they use the special abilities of film as a medium to their utmost.In the case of the troubling, sexist Perfume, the photography, and accompanying lights and editing, are astonishing. This alone will attract serious movie fans. The effects are not quite real and are not false (there are a few moments of truly dreamlike shifts in light) but they are ""real"" in a hyper manner that is like an intense children's book. If you didn't care about the plot, you would still have to be mesmerized, at least for the first hour, by the virtuosity of the filming.But I am avoiding the sensational plot itself because it has issues. For one, it's actually quite simple, and gets stretched to over two hours at everyone's peril. For another, the idea is unsettling in a unredemptive way. The main character (I'm not sure he's the protagonist, officially) is not a bad guy with a heart of gold, or a murderer with a deep tortured soul. No, as a fable, the movie avoids real psychology. Characters, including the main one, an orphan who turns his gift of smell into a macabre perfuming adventure, are made two-dimensional. On purpose. But that isn't enough to keep you really interested.I'm not saying you're likely to turn it off halfway. The basic set up is so outrageous you certainly want to know how it ends. But there are scenes, including the epic orgy which puts Bosch to shame, that will make you utterly impatient. Unbelievable, but true, and a shame. A lighter touch, with some complexity here and there, and faster editing, might have made a masterpiece. The ingredients, like the parts of the potion concocted as we watch, are all there, and sometimes beautifully.One last aspect that bothered me and might not bother others--it's a very ""male gaze"" film. There is such a parade of beautiful naked dead female characters, treated without the slightest sense of identity or respect, it's a model of what is sexist and demeaning. And, again, without a shred of redemption (including the bizarre final two minutes). The tone takes an idealistic search for self, and for the ultimate scent, and creates a conflict with the demented murderous mind of the lead character. It's part voyeurism, part Jack the Ripper, and part Playboy. Not a great combination on any level.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

32,Thanos_Alfie,Waste of time...,5,12 March 2018,"""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is a crime fantasy movie in which we watch the story of a boy who was born with a talent, his talent is an unnerving sense of smell. This talent of his is going to be the most important obtain of his in his whole life. His main goal is to capture and save all of the smells that are around him or exist in the world. From all the smells around him, he is beckoned to the scent of woman's soul so, at this point his goal as well as his whole life changes. And his work takes a very different - dark turn while he is trying to make the ultimate scent.I have to admit that when I read about this movie and saw the trailer I expected more from it when I watched it. The only thing that I liked from this movie was the interpretations of Dustin Hoffman who played as Giuseppe Baldini and Alan Rickman who played Richis. The leading actor of this movie Ben Whishaw who played as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille made an average interpretation. Also the average direction which was made by Tom Tykwer didn't save this movie.Finally, I have to say that ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is an average movie but it can be seen by everyone. It's not something extraordinary, it has a simple plot with some good interpretations which were made by its cast and an average written script.

33,eddie_baggins,A dark but visually memorable trip into the mind of a madman,5,12 June 2019,"Adapting Patrick Suskind's famous and controversial 1985 novel Perfume: The Story of a Murderer was never going to be an easy task, but its a task Cloud Atlas director Tom Tykwer gave a good go at back in 2006.Somewhat a sleeper hit upon initial release, one that saw Tykwer's high budget film make its mark in the worldwide box-office, Perfume wasn't exactly fawned over by critics despite its strong production values and handsomely crafted period detail but in the year's since, this dark and morbid tale has become somewhat of an underground heavy-hitter.Talked about in film circles, thanks largely to it's needing to be seen to be believed final act and it's unwavering examination of Ben Whishaw's gifted but sadistic Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, whose on a quest to find the world's perfect scent, of which he will find using his extraordinary sense of smell, Perfume is in many ways memorable but that doesn't make it anymore tolerant to bare.The problem with Tykwer's film and its faithful adapting of Suskind's novel is that this is a two and a half hour film that is entirely bereft of any light, sunshine or levity with Tykwer's grey, gloomy and depressive take on the material making for viewing that is both tough and grungy.Grenouille is a hard central figure to put up with, barely muttering more than a few words together at a time, its not that Whishaw is bad, its just that Grenouille isn't someone you want to be spending as much time with as he goes about an increasingly depraved quest to unlock a world changing scent that unfortunately can only be discovered by the murdering of young females.This doesn't exactly make for an easy going viewing experience and while you initially are waiting for a slither of goodness or light to appear from within the unfortunate Grenouille, you begin to realize that this isn't something that will be forthcoming.It's as dark of a story as it sounds on paper and while some may praise Tykwer for sticking to his guns and delivering an uncompromising and very un-Hollywood treatment, there will be other's like me who find Perfume eye-capturing in a production sense but resent the story within it and it's not hard to see why many critics were less than enamored with Perfume upon its initial cinematic run.Final Say -A bizarre and nefarious little tale that features one of the modern era's most eye-popping finales, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a film that's hard to enjoy despite its fine craftsmanship, due to the very nature of it's depressive and sinister central concept.2 1/2 town square's out of 5",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
34,filipemanuelneto,"Interesting and challenging, but with some flaws.",5,14 May 2016,"This film portrays the life of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a French perfumer whose genius turns into madness. Directed by Tom Tykwer, who also collaborated on the screenplay alongside Andrew Birkin and Bernd Eichinger, it has Ben Whishaw in the main role and features also interpretations of Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman.What's the boundary between genius and madness? It's hard to define it, and this movie makes me meditate about that. It's a positively challenging film, which is difficult to be indifferent. Or you like it, or you hate it. Based on Patrick Süskind's novel, the film knew how to be faithful to it without become predictable for those who haven't read it. The script is good but it's too warm and, despite the suspense, isn't able to create real tension moments before reaching the end, which is explosive and shocking to most impressionable audiences. Perhaps it's because of this that so many professional film critics have been so hard on this film. Okay, it has several flaws, the soundtrack doesn't stand out particularly, the costumes are ordinary despite fulfilling it's role, most of the cast was reasonable but didn't shine... but on the other hand these flaws are compensated by good photograph, the visually attractive scenarios, the correct narrator's diction and, above all, the superb interpretation of Ben Whishaw, who managed to give his character an extraordinary dichotomy of personalities and feelings, which reminded me ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"".For all this, and despite being far from perfection, this film is quite acceptable and has some quality moments.

35,Tweetienator,Great One,8,9 March 2021,"Tom Twyker's movie is an adaption of the book Perfume by Patrick Süskind (read the book, it's a very good one) and mostly Twyker's work translates the story of the book well into the cosmos of moving pictures: what you get is a story about a very special serial killer with a very special talent and his very peculiar story set in 18th century France. The production is pretty impressive, the acting well done. Perfume: The Story of a Murderer: a good one for every connoisseur of the unusual, unique, fantastic and absurd, but maybe too unique for a mainstream audience (I got to conclude after reading some of the negative reviews, who review the movie like it would be a ""serious"" historical drama or crime movie and don't understand that the story of Perfume is rather in the tradition of Phantom of the Opera, Frankenstein, Dracula and the like, that's at least my opinion).

37,Vartiainen,"Bizarre, yet intriguing",6,7 February 2017,"Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) was born under a fish market table in 18th century France. Hardly a illustrious beginning for one's life, but Grenouille happened to be blessed with a certain extraordinary talent. That of his sense of smell. And when one has nothing else but a singular talent, one should utilize it to one's best ability. Which in this case leads Grenouille down a dark path in his pursuit for the most beautiful fragrance and ways to preserve it.Perfume is a lopsided movie. Its cinematography and visuals are certainly worthy of recognition. It's a beautiful film in every way, even though the early scenes are perhaps even over the top grimy in their depiction of Grenouille's humble beginnings. The acting is also for the most part very good, with Alan Rickman of course completely stealing every scene he's in. Whishaw as the leading man is a bit of a nonentity, but then that's the character. He's an empty person. He is nothing but his sense of smell. That's the character.Unfortunately the storytelling is pretty weak. I haven't read the book, but I've heard quite a bit about it and it seems like they skipped over certain parts, which would have made the story feel more cohesive. Or to be more accurate, they didn't even skip per se. Rather they rushed over them. For example, there's this scene where Grenouille finds a cave curiously lacking in scent. A quiet place for him. In the book this is apparently an important moment for him and quite a lot of time is spent in there. In the movie he crawls into the cave and in the next scene he crawls out. Nothing happened. But hey, the cave was in the book so it should be in the movie as well. Right?The ending is also one that's going to divide opinions. I found it to be extremely over the top and hilarious, but apparently it has been quite moving to some people. To each their own, I suppose, but proceed with caution.All in all it's a movie that I could see myself recommending. It is certainly a very unique story and the technical aspects all work. Not my cup of tea really, but I can tip my hat to its merits.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
38,freemantle_uk,"A strange, surreal and compelling film",8,11 June 2011,"Based on a critically acclaimed novel, Perfume is a very strange, surreal and compelling film from the director of Run Lola Run.In the 18th century Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is a young man who has a unique and strong sense of smell but has no smell himself. Growing up in an orphan Grenouille has a poor social skills before being made a tanner apprentice. But Grenouille wants to work as a perfumer and convinces an Italian shop owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) to teach him the tricks of the trade and capture scents. Genouille goes to the town of Grasse to continue his studies in the trade but soon Genouille becomes more obsessed and starts to murder attractive women in the town to create the perfect scent.Perfume is a very interesting film with a lot of strengths, great acting, period detail, the music and cinematography. Originally it was reported that Stanley Kubrick wanted to direct and was one of two choices the author Patrick Suskind thought could do the book justice. There is certainly a strong Kubrickian feel to the film and it seems like a very dark version of Barry Lyndon. The narration by John Hurt is very similar to Barry Lyndon and unlike most third person narrations, it actually added to the film. The camera moves are very much like a Kubrick like and there is also a little hint of Terry Gilliam influencing the film. Tom Tykwer certainly shows skill and he was even able to make scenes like when Grenouille makes a perfume compelling.Ben Whishaw is a very talented young actor, turning his character from a young man who wants to see and smell world he wanted to explore to someone who is creepy, a young man with no social skills which results in him becoming a serial killer. He is an unlikable character but Tykwer is able to make you interested in the character. Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman both offer experience to the film, Hoffman being a reluctant mentor but slowly warms to young man and gives his character a slight Italian accent. Rickman has a very rare role for him, he plays a good guy. He is the only man who speaks reason because the town needed to catch the killer and has the intelligence to see what's going on. You could feel his pain of the whole situation.The problem with the film is the final 15 minutes when it turned really surreal and just lost the plot. It was this part that weakens the film, preventing it from being a totally great film. There is also a little theme that every master Grenouille is killed when he leaves them: maybe play up the fact the guy is cursed.Overall Perfume is a fine film, a strong art-house film mixing drama, history and horror.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
39,Polaris_DiB,Character Portrait vs. Dark Comedy,6,24 September 2007,"""Perfume: Story of a Murderer"" is two things: a character portrait of an unusual man with an unusual gift who develops an unusual obsession... and a dark, dry comedy the type of which won't create external signs of laughter, but which can be well appreciated by those with that type of sense of humor. By comedy, I don't mean the classic definition by which the character wins in the end, nor do I mean the genre that's supposed to inspire giggles. It's a caricature of costume dramas with a very delicate approach to absurdities, creating a mix of something like The Marquis de Sade meeting Monty Python, but not nearly as obvious as either.However, I'm not entirely sure it worked out to good effect. The first two acts of this movie were a lot of fun--one could say even brilliant. Then the third act literally just erupts into orgy. It's not that it doesn't fit; it was even a lot of fun. However, it kind of let down the attention to detail and sensual nature of the previous parts of the movie, especially turning the lead character into a cartoon of himself.--PolarisDiB",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It is trapped out in the Emperor's New Clothes of Art,Literacy and Superb Technique,all prostituted to make a silk purse out of a degenerate 18th century murderer who richly deserved his extremely unpleasant end. Mr Hoffman and Mr Rickman give mannered performances as if in a slightly askew BBC Jane Auusten play.

41,Chris_Docker,Perfume - the story that got murdered on film,5,2 November 2006,"Adapted from a 1985 modern classic, Perfume tells the story (or fable) of a child born in a revolting stench of 18th century Paris fishmarkets and who grows up to have such an uncannily developed sense of smell that he can compound perfumes to control people's behaviour. Long before pheromone and aromatherapy psychology were commonplace, our protagonist Jean-Baptiste Grenouille takes them to new levels, most of them evil. We follow him from his lower than lowly beginnings, into an orphanage, a tannery and then to an apprenticeship with master perfumier, Giuseppe Baldini - who is played most engagingly by Dustin Hoffman. To the illiterate and gifted Jean-Baptiste, the world of smells is the language of the world, and he wants to find and catalogue every smell and then learn how to save and reproduce it.Bent on such a holy quest, such minor details as good and evil, life and death are, well, minor details. Having learnt everything he can from Master Baldini, he proceeds to the hallowed city of Grasse - a sort of perfumiers' Mecca - to discover more, treating himself to a period of meditation on the way, communing in the hills with his destiny and calling. Inspired by the smell of beautiful women - though not in a sexual way - he wants to capture it, to distil that essence of essences that is the soul of all beings. A local prostitute is less than impressed with his 'enflourage' method - which consists of coating her with animal fat and then scraping it off - and the diligent Jean-Baptiste elects for a more robust method of scientific enquiry faster than you can say scratch and sniff.Considered for a long time to be one of those 'unfilmable' novels, Perfume could have been approached in a number of ways. The subtlety of French cinema, for instance, encouraging the viewer to grasp at that which is often only hinted, struck me as one possible way of getting us to conjure up a story based on sensations that are olfactory rather than visual. But there are many ways of dealing with the unseen and unseeable, as the romps of Harry Potter have demonstrated. With a background that has included remarkably off the wall films such as Run Lola Run and Heaven, one might have expected a whacky, artistic approach from German director Tom Tykwer, but for this large scale movie he seems to have shifted more to the sensational style of those Hollywood movies you love to hate. It is as if someone had warned him that, with a budget this size, it is safest to play film-making by numbers, especially those written in Euros on the completion bond. The result is a colourful, noisy, but very overdone production that makes the story look more like Dickens than Süskind. Urchins boasting cockney accents in gay Paris seemed particularly out of place, and a long and intrusive voice-over by John Hurt, however eminently done, reinforces the message that top actors and expensive sets alone were insufficient to tell the story.Dustin Hoffman, barely recognisable as the powdered Baldini, is most impressive, and there are some nice moments when Laura, a noblewoman with a particularly nice smell it seems, brightens things up. Tykwer, whose direction has been rather pedestrian though most of it, rescues the film in the last few scenes with some crowd shots that are reminiscent of the work of photographer Spencer Tunick (the chap who does mass public displays of nudity) - only with added eroticism and choreography. While visually impressive, even these scenes fail to convey the believability inherent in the original novel. Even the slightest display of pubic regions has amusingly been edited out - in the same way that naked dead bodies earlier in the film always died (thoughtfully) in such poses as to keep similarly offending areas out of view. If aimed at an adults, Perfume, the Story of a Murderer is in danger of being patronising; yet the themes will be seen as too 'adult' for younger viewers. Not surprisingly, it is due for release in the UK on Boxing Day, when many audiences may be feeling too full of festive sustenance for anything more demanding.

45,3xHCCH,Visualizing the Sense of Smell,8,19 December 2008,"The movie is set in 18th century France. It opens with the shadowed face of a man with the spotlight specifically on his nose. As the movie continued, this was the story of a special man named Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, who had a very acute and well-developed olfactory sense. The movie follows Grenouille from his miserable birth in a Paris marketplace, childhood in an orphanage, teenage years in a tannery, then back to cacophonous Paris and finally to the quiet perfume town Grasse.In Paris, he was attracted by the scent of a pretty redheaded girl selling plums, but this encounter had an unfortunate end. So this sparked in him an obsession on how to capture and preserve the essential scent of women. It depicts his discovery that he has no scent of his own, his insatiable grisly quest for the perfect scent that propels him into a series of murders of young beautiful women; and the incredible irresistible power this scent has on people. You won't believe your eyes in the scenes showing what happened to the crowd who caught under the spell of this enchanting scent.The story borders on grotesque, and the whole movie really teeters on that edge. The realistic nature of the set design, cinematography and editing set this above the formulaic massacre movie. There are only two recognizable actors, Dustin Hoffman as the Italian perfumer who taught our protagonist his trade, and Alan Rickman, who played the father of thirteenth and final girl he was stalking. But they, along the rest of the generally unknown cast, especially Ben Whishaw, as the flawed main character, really get into the very fiber of the strange story and they deliver the goods.I commend the director Tom Tykwer for his vision. In ""Perfume,"" Tykwer had the seemingly impossible challenge of interpreting a world of smells and odors onto the silver screen. With his effective use of rich imagery and color, what is fragrant was clearly distinguished from the putrid. (The only other film of Tykwer I had seen before was the amazing ""Run Lola Run."" I believe he has an upcoming more mainstream action film entitled ""The International"" starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts.) Granted this movie is not for everyone. You would need a strong stomach to make it though the film. Yet the journey of this film will draw you in to join Grenouille in his quest. The ending may be less than what you would expect given the build-up. The fate of Grenouille at the end of the movie was the one big question mark for me. I would really like how that scene was written in the book. I felt something got lost in the translation of the word to images.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Maybe it is an extended version of the French Court sequence from the Mel Brooks comedy HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART 1....... Let me tell you all, breathlessly awaiting PERFUME... this film is so ludicrous, so patently silly, even in the casting, tone and berserk storyline, that I hope you all see it for free. Do not spend a dollar on seeing PERFUME. It even has Dustin Hoffam in one sequence prancing about, mugging like Oswald The Rabbit from an 1934 Bo Peep cartoon, (or Harpo Marx in DUCK SOUP)smiling and bugging his eyes in between falling in and out of his ""erhhhaahhhaa Fronch occent"" and his NY honk. Remember the fall down funny excuse for Al Pacino bellowing and spluttering his New York accent through REVOLUTION or LOOKING FOR RICHARD....?... well Hoffman does one better here, all pantaloons powder and pantomime goofiness. Basically PERFUME is a serial killer flick in velvet and lace and I do not care one jot how over fluffy it is over produced, it is a stupid and cruel movie, graphic in it's degrading of beautiful women and lame in it's casting and er, execution, pretending to be high art. Even the lead character speaks in a terrible cockney accent... and he, the twerp is supposed to be French! ... like Hoffman. Lush, like MARIE ANTOINETTE and horrible like any dumb serial killer pic. It even pretends to be the story of how Paris became 'the city of love'... perfume essence dribbled into the mud that sexually excites the 'earth' and the dopes prancing about Paris at the time. Personally I thought it the Monty Python version of a vaguely interesting book. In fact PERFUME is the 2006 equivalent of THE DANCING CAVALIER which is the terrible and hilarious Lina Lamont talkie so perfectly lampooned in SINGIN IN THE RAIN.

48,aharmas,Perfume as a metaphor,8,7 January 2007,"This is a gorgeous and frustrating film, a project that like the book, takes you back to an era that doesn't exist anymore, a world where the senses were still attuned to nature and made direct connections to our emotions. There is something primeval about the main character's drive in the film, as he pursues a quest to create the perfect combination of scents. The film successfully answers all the questions. Yet, there is something missing from the ultimate product, and that is why should we even care about this misfit? The film is very analytical and is carried well by the protagonist. We follow him from his hellish birth to the climatic conclusion. We get hints about his motivation, but his approach is clinical and tends to leave most people cold. He is almost like a machine. Only at the end, we get to establish a small connection to him, as it is revealed that he is after all a human being with needs like ours.The book in which the film is based is a masterpiece, and as one reads it, it becomes clear that it would be a very difficult piece to adapt.

Even the best dog would feel frustrated next to this monster. The creep spends his time sniffing around and loving all smells. However, the one he likes better is female smell (surprise surprise). In the best serial killer tradition, the creep decides to capture and preserve young girls' smells, because theirs are the best. Obviously, the only way to harvest their smell is to kill them first.But our creep is unable to understand the consequences of his actions, so he continues happily to slain girls. Eventually, the police manage to get him, but at this stage we have a big surprise, which I found so outrageous and idiotic I will not even bother to mention.It was quite a long time since I saw a movie that I so thoroughly hated. Most bad movies are bad in an ordinary way: silly script, mediocre acting, boring or non-existent plot. These are all common feature in a large number of films.On the other hand, Perfume is preposterous and malevolent, to the utmost degree. I just cannot imagine what sort of sick imagination produced the novel upon which this dreadful movie is based. Obviously, I avoided the book and watched the movie one evening on TV.

50,rbverhoef,"Flawed, but highly recommended",7,9 January 2007,"'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer' is a faithful book adaptation which is both a good and a bad thing. For people who have read the book, written by Patrick Süskind, and liked it this is a film they are quite likely to like as well. They think of a passage from the book and how it could look, and director Tom Tykwer and his crew have made it look probably close to their imagination. The visuals, especially in the second half of the film truly are extraordinary. But film is another medium than books and in my opinion some minor changes would have helped the film.One important thing is its pacing. If you know nothing about the story there is a good chance you will find the middle part quite dull and the final act going too fast. Let's start at the beginning. We meet Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, being born on the fish market in Paris in the 18th century. The boy, who has no scent of his own, has a sense of smell that could lead him anywhere in the dark. To collect different scents becomes an obsession until, after I have skipped quite a bit from the story, as an adolescent (played by Ben Whishaw) he smells a woman in the way he has never smelled it. For the first time he sees, or actually smells, beauty. Sort of by accident he kills the woman and then tries to capture the scent, in which he fails to do so. This changes a couple of things.First of all he decides he wants to be a perfumer and he chooses Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) as his teacher. He wants to be this so he can learn how to keep the essence of a scent. All this leads him to Grasse, the perfume capital of the world where he learns a technique which he is about to try on different women. Since Jean-Baptiste has no feeling whatsoever, killing the woman first seems most easy. He needs thirteen samples to create his masterpiece and we learn quite early in the film that Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) will be his final victim. She is the daughter of the powerful Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman).How the story unfolds is for you to see, but to say it is interesting is an understatement. The ending feels oddly out of tone with the rest of the film, although it was done how it probably should have been. If Tykwer had chosen another approach he would have made a lot of readers upset. The screenplay part here might not please some, but read the novel to understand Tykwer's choices.The feeling of watching some problems with translating things from text to images was always there. Especially the voice over, done superbly by John Hurt, emphasized this thought. I was often amazed, impressed by the visuals, the Whishaw-performance and most of all by Tykwer's brave attempt to make a film out of a book that was considered unfilmable. On the other hand I was never impressed by the film itself. Almost, most of all in the end, but I never really got there. Still, 'Perfume' is a unique film which deserves praise on a lot of levels.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

This film was one that I had seen recommended in a few Facebook film groups, usually with the context being 'This is a weird movie, has anyone else seen it?' I like weird movies, probably more so than the average bear, and if any movie gets recommended multiple times, I'll usually go out of my way to see what the film is about. When I read the summary, and saw the supporting cast, I thought to myself, ""Yep, that sure sounds weird. I'll watch that."" A two-and-a-half hour, slightly-kinky period piece about a serial killer co-starring Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman? Yeah, I'm down. Freaking sign me up.
My biggest qualms with this film were the ending and the length, and if I'm being honest, I didn't even feel the length until the ending started to get all schmaltzy on me. But despite the fact that this film sort of fumbled the ending, I still sort of liked it. The direction is pretty refined, the acting is commendable, the production design is great, and the story is bizarre and compelling. Sometimes you just need a film to show you something new, and ""Perfume"", while it isn't completely flawless, is undeniably unique.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
52,pachara87,"Perfume is a strange but beguiling film that, like an intoxicating scent, stirs the imagination.",9,20 February 2019,"Perfume is a remarkable film in many ways, not least in that it brings the bizarre world of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) from the page to the screen. It's an audacious story, starting as the biography of a gifted but deranged man, which morphs into a metaphysical fantasy. Herein lies the film's biggest problem, because not even a filmmaker of Tom Tykwer's outstanding talents can wrangle this work to a satisfactory conclusion.The first two acts are beautifully produced visually and technically, and even if we can't warm to Jean-Baptiste, we can enjoy the gritty atmos of mid 18th century Paris as we swing from the stinking fish market to the perfumeries. Much is made of this dichotomy, the lad with nothing but a sense of smell so acute that he can detect every ingredient of a perfume and the perfect proportions of the mix - who was born in Europe's smelliest spot. Symbolism is rife, as the disturbed Jean-Baptiste loses reason in his quest for the essence of virgins - the notion of bottling beauty also strikes a contemporary chord, but none of this gels into anything truly meaningful.While this can haunt the pages of a novel, it's harder work for the film, but Tykwer does quite well. Ben Whishaw is a suitably ethereal actor (reminds me of Lothaire Bluteau's intensely internal performance in Jesus of Montreal) but Dustin Hoffman seems uncertain of how large to play the fading perfume maestro. That's probably because he had read the script and therefore knew where it ended up; in a strange and surreal final act which asks the audience to abandon the biography and take up with inaccessible metaphysics, combined with thriller elements as the killer pursues the virgin, under the terrified eyes of her father. The rot sets in as soon as Jean-Baptiste leaves Paris for Grasse. Filmmaking care is abandoned, and while it all looks lovely, none of it is credible or real. Too many details are overlooked (practicality is still important, even if the themes are ethereal).Rachel Hurd-Wood is the best thing in the film, closely followed by Alan Rickman as her dad, but neither can save the film from its inherent flaw. The power of perfume (indeed all smell) is well understood by us all, but we are asked to abandon reason for no good reason as the plot spirals into a forced fantasy.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
53,Galina_movie_fan,"""Whatever his insane scheme is...""",10,6 August 2007,"""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" (2006) is directed by Tom Tykwer (Lola rennt (1998), Der Krieger und die Kaiserin (2000), and Heaven (2002)) and based on the bestselling novel by Patrick Susskind which is one of the most amazing debuts in the world literature. The novel was written in 1985 and has been translated into 45 languages, so far selling more than 15 million copies worldwide, making it the most successful novel of post-war German literature. Having been known as un-filmable, the novel presented the ultimate challenge for any director who would decide to adapt it the screen. How is it possible to transfer to the screen the myriads of odors that practically crawl and jump from every sentence of each page to envelop and to overwhelm the readers?...""Perfume"" tells the story of Jean-Baptist Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) a young man, who was born in Paris fish market in 1738 and was not supposed to live at all just like his four siblings that had been killed by their mother minutes after they were born but who survived and brought to the world with him double curse of not having any smell of his own and to be able to recognize, memorize, and later to capture every odor existed (or was that a blessing?). He grew up to become obsessed by the idea of creating the perfect perfume, the one that would capture the fragrance of love, devotion, and desire. To create the perfume like that, he would need the ingredients that could only be obtained by capturing essence of the unique scent, an indelible part of the young, beautiful, and innocent women that effortlessly evoke love, admiration, tenderness, and desire in everyone who'd approach them. Not even a human being but rather a creature for whom there is no word to describe, the monster with the divine sense of smell, the depository of myriads of odors, the evil genius obsessed by the perfection and beauty that he never was able to approach and to possess, Jean-Baptist Grenouille would stop to nothing to reach his terrifying and fascinating goal.I believe Tom Tykwer made an astounding film which is perfect with the exception of a short scene few minutes before the film was over. Tykwer decided to make his anti-hero sympathetic - just for a couple of minutes and it was a wrong decision that goes against the character's logic, against everything we've learned about Jean-Baptist Grenouille. Other than that, I found the movie outstanding in all departments. It is the true Ode to Olfaction where the sense of smell was presented by the incredible, fantastic images combined with the music written by director himself and adding marvelously to the strange, dark, disturbing, and sensual world of mystery, murders, beauty, and obsession. The film director recreated the 18th century France beautifully by shooting the Paris scenes in Barcelona, Spain, and the ones that take place in Grasse, the capital of French perfumers, in Figueres, Spain, the city of Salvador Dali. Just like the novel, the film presents rather pessimistic and un-flattering outlook at the mankind and in this regard, the final two scenes are absolutely brilliant in their morbid irony.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The story end is disappointing too because I imagined a real rush but there were too many slow paced scenes. Solid performance of Dustin Hofmann and great job from Ben Whishaw. But as I said the story lacks from several flaws and cannot develop a dynamic countdown. It's definitely not a thriller as mentioned on the presentation of this site but follows much more a little bloodless horror show with similar motivations as in the Hannibal parts. My wife and me were nearly bored and so the vote is not more than 4/10.

And I should say that the film is really a winner. It is dark, gory, in places almost vomit-inducing, shocking, unbearably cruel, but then, very very good. What is really marvelous in this film is the main part, of Jean Batiste, this merciless, psychotic, sociopath who does everything only to achieve his aim. And he does it, too. All his killings, committed in cold blood, leave a heavy heart and lasting impression. And what is really nice, is the fact that the man hardly ever speaks all throughout the film. Then, there are absolutely brilliant parts played by always excellent Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman, who deliver their lines impeccably. Tom Tykwer did his job well  you do not want to get to Paris of that time under no circumstance whatsoever. You almost smell the tang, the stench, the reek of this dirty, filthy, vile city. Maybe, it was Tom's idea to make us feel no sympathy to Jean Batiste, maybe, in the book he awakes more positive feelings, but here he only arises aversion.

58,Howlin Wolf,Successful - by a nose.,7,20 January 2008,"The world that Tykwer has represented is vividly dark and gloomy. ""Perfume... "" adopted the kind of tone that ""Hannibal Rising"" should have been searching for but failed to discover. Both fictional characters are prodigies in their field and uncannily perceptive (although Lecter is more articulate) but their misfortune in life gives rise to a homicidal streak. In ""Perfume... "" we're allowed to develop more sympathy for the monstrous individual - especially in long sequences where Tykwer has to do nothing more than linger on Wishaw's brooding countenance to get the required emotional effect. It's a control that seems all the more composed and masterful in comparison to the ridiculous denouement...... an ending that is absolutely abominable, of that there can be no mistake. Only the fact that I thought the rest of the film was so great compensates for it slightly. I understand clearly the underlying significance of what unfolds, and it might have been an interesting conceit when laid out in writing, but it's horribly unsubtle and laughable when expressed directly in a visual sense. Now I don't have the skills of Mr Tykwer, so I can't imagine how it would be possible to deliver a more fitting cinematic treatment, but I can only say that choosing the embarrassingly obvious and literal route became an emphatic misfire.What a shame, because up until the last quarter of an hour or so, this was a terrifically evocative piece of film-making.

That is something you have to see for your self! But his journey will be our journey! We will follow him and we will sympathize with him! Even when the main character is a psycho killer! Most of his motives will be explained! For a guy who is born at a fish stand and never had any proper education he is very intelligent! When he finds out that he has this special ability (being able to smell very well)! He doesn't waste time in using it to his advantage! After having smelled this girl he is determined to find and preserve the perfect scent! And you will find out why! ""Perfume"" is not a fast paced thriller! It takes a while for the thriller element to really kick in! And when it does you will experience one of the craziest twists ever made in a movie! For me it was very hard to accept! But in the context of the movie I understood it! This twist does seem to come out of nowhere! But isn't that the reason why we are watching movies like this! To be surprised and entertained at the same time! What would be the point of watching a thriller if you could predict the ending!

60,oneguyrambling,The freakiest film you probably won't see this year!,7,20 April 2012,"I talk a lot about films, and in recent weeks I have spoken most about only two topics: how much I hated Real Steel and how bizarre this film is.Jean Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) was born into an 18th century French society that was decidedly pungent – and his birthing scene is equally graphic. After being literally left for dead in the mud he is instantly orphaned and shovelled off to a dingy and – yes smelly – orphanage, where his cries and hunger inspire the other orphans to try to kill him.This early sequence is as brilliant as it is gross and depressing. And it is quite gross and depressing.But Jean-Baptiste survives of course, and grows up to adulthood an able bodied, albeit nearly mute and emotionless, young man. A young man with nostrils with no equal, stuck in a role where he could not take advantage of his scent skills.So Jean-Baptiste became a renaissance Rain Man of sorts, an obsolete olfactory aficionado. A man with no prejudice against any odour regardless of how unpleasant it might seem, but also oblivious of the niceties and morals of modern society.That is until a chance meeting with a perfumer named Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a mid-tier artiste frustrated by his inability to distance himself from the more sought after perfumers of the land. Baldini initially ignores Jean-Baptiste's claims regarding his abilities, but this swiftly changes once Baldini recognises the innate genius of the awkward creepy young man, and more tellingly the commercial prospects that having a man on staff with his skills.In the short while the pair operate as master and apprentice Baldini passes on his limited knowledge regarding the techniques of scent manufacturing, with which Jean-Baptiste promptly utilises to create some of the most aesthetically pleasing perfumes possible.But Jean-Baptiste is far from satisfied with his incredible advances in both skills and social standing, he openly yearns to make his mark on the globe through the creation of the 'ultimate' scent. To do this he decides he must head away from the city I can't go too much further without over-disclosing, however this film starts gross and heads to creepy, before ending in an orgy of olfactory over-indulgence that must be seen to be disbelieved.For lengthy sections of the film Jean-Baptiste is the lone figure on screen as he continues his bizarre quest, and as he is practically mute and almost robotic in his actions this makes for some tough going. Peripheral characters waft in and out of the story as they enter Jean-Baptitse's orbit, some only for a few moments.As Jean-Baptiste Ben Whishaw has a particularly thankless role which he performs admirably, he commands attention his dull expressionless eyes, simultaneously unnerving and yet somehow demanding sympathy, even as he carries out acts that are especially heinous to you and I but merely necessary to him.Perfume: The story of a murderer is not a film that I will revisit again and again, except in my mind. I also can't describe the two scenes that scream out to be told. I can only say that it is for the most part a straightforward telling of a quite remarkable and impossible tale, which loses it more than a little in the final few moments. And it is those few moments that you will be describing to incredulous others for years Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. I can't recommend that you see Perfume. But I can guarantee that you won't unsee it if you do.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
61,Maciste_Brother,Overiped and overdone to the point of comedy,1,15 January 2008,"Wanna see a movie which has massive close-up of nostrils? The main character juggling perfume bottles like Tom Cruise juggles vodka bottles in COCKTAIL?Dustin Hoffman overacting? A massive orgy that takes place in an open square during the light of day? Pure love causing spontaneous cannibalism? Well, PERFUME is the movie for you.Even with all its grotesque imagery and ideas, I giggled nonstop while watching this overdone film. It's so bent on putting off people with a series of grim images and story-line that it created the opposite effect. It ended up looking like a Disney ride through misery. The idea is hopelessly silly: a guy with a super olfactory sense receptor is driven to murder because he wants to bottle women's scent because no one likes him. The director actually shows us, just in case we missed the point, massive close ups of Grenouille's nostrils or him walking around sniffing things. Because of the unusual plot, this story desperately needed subtlety and instead it got something from the Paul (subtle as a sledgehammer) Verhoeven school of film-making. It hits you on the head, repeatedly, that Grenouille is like the 6 million dollar man with a bionic nose. It doesn't help that the story follows this sad character from his birth to his eventual death, subsequently empathizing with this serial killer of sorts as it painfully shows us, in grand details, why he's such a tormented soul.The direction was all wrong. Because the story was, hmm, unusual, the director thought that it needed some narration to tell us stupid viewers what was going on. The narration, by John Hurt, was grating, sounding like a kindergarten teacher reading a gross Brothers Grimm story to his pupils.""The children sensed there was something about him..."" the narration went on slavishly over every little detail about Grenouille's life. I laughed out loud anytime I heard these groaners.If hearing the pedantic voice of John Hurt wasn't bad enough, the film also stars Dustin Hoffman, in full makeup and overacting mode. Honestly, the film never had a chance with these two annoying elements but the infantile direction and the exceptionally misogynistic tone of this non-story are what really sank this thing into miasma of rotten films.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
62,sarastro7,...but will Americans understand it?,10,5 January 2007,"This is an art movie with an ending that will puzzle many. As of this writing (January 5), this movie has not yet been seen by many Americans. It has however, based largely on its European release, garnered a user rating of 7.4 already; a quite good rating. It was undoubtedly the right decision to have it open in Europe first. Assuming that Americans probably won't be able to appreciate it as much as us Old Worlders, the user rating will probably go down once a few thousand Americans have rated it here. But let me try to prevent that from happening by explaining what the movie is about.The ending is really what makes the movie (or breaks it, for those who don't see the beauty of it). It becomes clear then that what Grenouille was trying to do was create a physical distillate of love. Not sex. Not beauty. Love. And he did it. He created the perfect feeling of love, both emotional and physical; a love encompassing perfect eroticism (not just emotionless sex). And in the end, he did what lovers do: he joined with other people. Yes, they absorbed him entirely, meaning that he became part of them, just as a person in love wishes to become part of his or her lover. But HE represented the very *concept* of love, and his physical absorption by the common people represents their ultimate adoption and understanding of that concept.Of course, this is an art movie and everything in it is symbolical. It amounts to a description of what love is and how it works. The movie is saying that love is something real which *can* be defined and understood, and the ultimate consequence of such understanding is that people join with each other (emotionally and sexually). Even if they are strangers. Because everybody is capable of feeling love, and one day maybe everybody will.It's a beautiful movie. When I left the theater I hadn't pieced everything together yet, and thought I'd rate it an 8 out of 10. But having slept on it, I realized it was a perfect movie. Hence, I must give it a 10 out of 10.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It cannot be made into a film. It would stink."" Well, get this ya pessimistic douchebags, this adaptation was fantastic.The story follows Jean Frenchman(?) from a wee infant to a gangly young man. From the moment he was born lil Jean was blessed with the superhuman ability to smell at extreme levels. And when I say extreme I mean it damn it! Through an unfortunate accident early in his young adulthood, Jean has dedicated himself to being able to preserve any and all smells. When I say dedication, I'm not talking about the average type of dedication where you take a day off or something like that. This is full blown and utter obsession. Dedication to extremes, and when I say extremes I mean it damn it. All is not right with young Jean and even though he seems to be slightly aware of his obsession, he also realizes he's special and that he must do and accomplish what he has set out for himself and believes in....with his case of obsession, he really doesn't have a choice.Perfume: The Story of a Murderer was a fantastic film. With a intriguing and constantly developing story, the flick just flys by, even at 2 and a half hours. The performances in the film were also done very well, from Dustin Hoffman to Alan Rickman to our scent obsessed lead actor there really are not any bad act jobs in the flick. But above all else, this movie is visually stunning, from huge rolling landscapes to a woman's pale cleavage. From a squished fish on the ground of a fish market to a woman's pale cleavage. :) If you're not being pulled along by the story, the visuals will.

64,jaredmobarak,The sweet smell of innocencePerfume: The Story of a Murderer,8,9 January 2007,"Director Tom Tykwer has created a visually lush, unique piece of cinema again. From the highly original Lola rennt, to the visualization of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski's Heaven (the first part to a planned trilogy, the second of which has been made by another director), Tykwer's talents continue to make beautiful films built around emotion and characters. Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is adapted from the novel of same name and, while I have not read the book, I can guess that the film version is pretty spot-on. With its narration and long silent pauses to help the audience experience the amazing gift our lead has, this story is read on screen through its imagery. As the camera pans lovingly over each object of Jean- Baptiste Grenouille's affection, one can almost smell the beauty as all other senses help to create a manifestation of the one we can't use. If ever a movie needed Smell-O-Vision, it would be this.We are introduced to a young man whose very life was a gift from God. He was born on bad terms and literally steals his breath from the air, causing the beginning to his involuntary vacuum of life around him. It seems that everyone who touches or educates him finds an end to life once his work is done. Jean-Baptiste, with a sense of smell as acute as any could be, in fact has no smell of his own. His ability turns him into a leech of sorts, desperately needing to bottle the smells of others so as to never lose their essence, their soul. All those around him can't appreciate the unique odor they emit like he does. Only he can understand and see into another's soul, thus beginning his quest, and duty, to find a way to preserve that beauty.Expect big things in the future from virtual newcomer Ben Whishaw. The way he envelops the character of Grenouille is total. He goes through the entire film uttering very few words, yet his expressions tell the story so well that you could understand it with all sound turned off. In each scene of him approaching his first love, a plum girl on the streets, (the radiant Karoline Herfurth), Whishaw is completely entranced by her odor. He approaches her with eyes closed and allows his nose to follow each contour of her body from a distance. The transfixion is powerful to watch as he discovers the most beautiful creature he has ever beheld; the consequences of his immursion, on the other hand, are devastating. Whishaw never plays the role with any malice or insanity. Grenouille is a simple man who has never been told the difference between right and wrong. He is a victim of circumstance as well as an otherworldly ability, which comes with an overwhelming sense of superiority and purpose, whether true or misguided. His is a tragic character, which never sees the error in his ways, and Whishaw never loses sight of that one attribute, letting viewers pity him at the same time as they revile what he is doing.Perfume is a sprawling tale spanning the years of Grenouille's life and on his journey to learn the craft of perfuming, he meets many interesting and integral people. Dustin Hoffman plays Master Baldini, the man who first lets Jean-Baptiste in on the secrets of scent, nicely and with a sense of integrity. An actor who has the tendency of going too big in some roles, Hoffman reins himself in and plays the part to perfection. He is a famous perfumer whose days of fame are long behind him. Seeing the gift his protégé has reinvigorates his love for the craft and by teaching the boy, he revisits his past glory. Also effective in the film are Alan Rickman and Rachel Hurd-Wood. Rickman plays his character with intelligence and compassion. While all those around him see an easy way out for capturing a serial killer, only he refuses to be duped. As for Hurd-Wood, she is everything needed to make Jean-Baptiste's mission believable. This young girl has an angelic beauty that would catch anyone's eye, but it is her innocence that truly captures the meaning of the film.Tykwer gives us a tale of finding beauty in the world and wanting to never let it go. There is a power to innocence that will cause adults to smile at the mistakes made by children along the path of their childhood. Humanity can be stopped in its tracks by it, uniting everyone into a sense of love for that which has not yet been tainted by the world. It does not matter how Grenouille was able to achieve the creation of his masterpiece of perfume, it only matters what that process resulted in. It's odor brought the Garden of Eden back to earth for a fleeting moment. It allowed all in its' path to have a clean slate and love each other, if only for a moment. Innocence washed all their sins away and it could not have happened without the determination of this young perfumer. With dark subject matter, the film truly succeeds with its underlying meanings. There are many allusions to religion throughout the fantasy and stories of a savior/messiah figure that can be taken many ways. Whether one finishes upon liking Perfume or not, it at least makes you ask questions and never manipulates you on the way. It also contains one of the best montage sequences I have ever experienced. As the murders are committed and spliced together with the meetings of the court on what to do, there is a gorgeous, operatic score driving us through. The passage culminates into one of religion's greatest feats, coincidence looked upon as divine intervention. Whether Grenouille went along with God's acceptance or not, he truly does succeed on his mission.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

His pursuits provide the perfect insight into the perfume business to which he is driven. After being sucked into an apparently good story for the first hour, PERFUME takes a sour turn when our ""hero"" begins killing about 18 beautiful young virgins, each with unique beauty, in order to add their scent to create his perfect perfume.The girl/victims are treated in this film with even less regard than, for example, by Jason in the Friday the 13th series. Herein it's a nuisance that the girl/victims want to pursue lives of their own and not have their lives ended so this freak/hero can use their smell.Eventually captured and sentenced to death, our ""hero"" escapes by unleashing his human-stench-perfume from the gallows to the crowd, wherein the executioner (first) and the mob of 1000 citizens literally fall to their knees and worship the stench-perfume-hero. All this is served up with mock religious reverence worthy of the Song of Bernadette.Wanting to provide a happier ending still, our hero returns to his place of birth and unleashes his stench-perfume on the fish mongers; who immediately love him so much they literally eat him alive. Munch, munch! Till only the skeleton remains. Isn't that sweet! Ebert is quoted on the box with one word: ""Genuis."" So much for Ebert's values.

If that sounds dumb, wait until you see the whole thing. The movie features supporting performances by Dustin Hoffman (miscast and knowing it) and Alan Rickman (who is actually pretty good, better than this movie deserves).Perfume combines the stupidity of slasher flicks and the pretentious pomposity of worst costume dramas; the result is a parade of moments which could belong to a Monty Python's sketch. My favourites are: the supposedly dramatic montage of Grenouille's killing spree, in which he keeps appearing out of nowhere and stabbing women, including one who is milking a cow; a moment where he uses X-Men powers to smell a girl miles away, with the camera sweeping over mountains and valleys; the discovery of a corpse and a reaction shot of the victim's perplexed Pekingese dog; Hoffman yelling as he pulls an obviously fake cat out of a cauldron.

It's a wild ride of a movie ""Perfume""; a very ambitious one that almost gets it completely right.First of all, its subtitle, 'The story of a Murderer', is a risky and unattractive phrase for any project; and in ""Perfume"" is an honest declaration of what the film is about. However, the story can be interpreted the wrong way; and the subtitle is there to clarify it. ""Perfume"" hasn't got problems with sex; it's not the story of a rapist, but the tale of a man who killed many women to pursue an ambition.I couldn't even be able to tell you if this man had a killer instinct or if he enjoyed killing these women. I couldn't even tell you if this man was mentally ill or if he just was decisive; if he got to what he did with time or if he was determined to do it. The film puts all this questions and hints answers, but it's up to the viewer in the end to choose what he prefers.I'll tell you what I can tell youThe name of the man: Jean Baptiste Grenouille. I'll also tell you what I chose to think, and it's really simplified: that ""Perfume"" shows that a man's gift can also be his perdition. Of course, this extends to different branches, because the film can really be discussed. It is a tale because it's based on a novel by Patrick Suskind; and its adaptation can be discussed for starters.There's a narrator (John Hurt) who tells the story, and that's the film's most notable mistake. His voice is too pompous, and at the same time it sounds like a man who's telling a children story. For some reason, the movie doesn't start flowing until the narrator stops talking for a long time; and that's a long way into the movie already.When this happens, everything takes a different shape in ""Perfume"", even the story; it's a good change when we've sadly lost one of the film's best things: Dustin Hoffman, who plays an Italian perfumer with an accent similar to the one Stallone dominated so much for Rocky. Anyway, this is another thing to be discussed. Not the story of course, but everything else.It happened to me that when the movie began, I didn't like anything. Not the look of the film, because I found it too neat; not the score, because I found it overly dramatic; not Ben Whishaw's performance, because it seemed exaggerated. But when this change takes place, it's like everything fits perfectly. And here's when the story comes in again: because the place where things happen is perfect and the film must look perfect; the things that happen are dramatic so the score must be dramatic; and the way Grenouille does these things is beyond exaggeration, so Whishaw's performance must be exaggerated.What a beautiful way of watching a movie: a paradox; because the movie grows on you but not emotionally or personally, just in the way things are used and placed and why. For some long time, ""Perfume"" is indeed excellent; but after an excellent conclusion, the voice of the narration comes in again and it seems like a joke.""Perfume"" is so honest and detached of emotion, so harsh, that Alan Rickman's painful look in one of many crucial moments hits hard. The hero of the film, Grenouille, is someone we can't feel sorry for, we can't support; someone we can't even understand completely. If this is so stressful, why narrate it in the most relaxed way?Never mind, I've heard that ""Perfume"" is the kind of movie you either hate or love; I'm proud to say I stand in the middle.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

70,oneloveall,Many pockets of cinematic bliss around a myriad of abnormalities,7,25 September 2007,"One of modern fiction's most eccentric killers gets his cinematic incarnation by great experimental filmmaker Tom Tykwer. Perhaps in less apt hands, the exceedingly preposterous plot would have translated worse onto the screen, given it's heavy reliance on sensual output based upon one man's irrationally accurate sense of smell. Through the perceptive frame of this director though, does this most unusual drama get to stretch it's unique scent. Perfume will have it's lulls after an initially captivating setup. Some of the acting does not match up with the director's skewed, period-piece vision (Dustin Hoffman's acting especially seems lazy and out of place here), and the midsection feels a bit stretched out while expecting viewers to suspend major doubts in the progressively foolish murder-mystery. But as a most unusually gripping finale takes shape, one is reminded how unabashedly original these characters and motivations are played out in this impressive production, resulting in a praise-worthy vision of an adaptation.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
71,bopdog,"Deeply satisfying, visually thrilling. Darkish, but exhilarating too!",10,26 December 2006,"This is a bit of a fable, with darkish undertones. If I said this movie was transcendental, a sort of metaphysical morality play with deeply unconscious architypes, it would sound way too planned. All of that is certainly powerfully present, but those themes are masterfully invisible. All we see is an engrossing and thrilling and entertaining movie. The 'lessons', if any, only emerge as a tantalizing aftertaste of an exciting night at the movies.I dislike horror movies, and slasher movies such as 'Seven', 'Copycat', and 'The Cell', etc. I was a little afraid this one would stray into that territory. But I trusted Tom Tykwer's directorial talents, and went anyway. I am glad I did! Yes, there is murder (duh... it's in the title), but the descent into human depravity was fascinating. It did NOT make me feel like a bath afterwards. It's almost like a metaphor for all kinds of human endeavors on this earth.This movie had a lyrical, melodic quality to it--- superficially like Roman Polanski's 'The Ninth Gate', but without the silly attempt to artificially give it meaning. The historical vibe was incredible as well--- Obviously, I wasn't in France in the 1730s-1760s, when the movie takes place. But nonetheless for me, the evocation of that time was superb. I suspect you could watch this without any sound at all, and still be entertained (well, sort of).I enjoyed the feast for the eyes, while my emotions were fully engaged, and my sense of wonder as well as my sense of mystery and that kind of excitement were all lit up. What a great, deeply satisfying movie! And by the end, you are actually thinking about things a bit--- contemplating more than the movie itself.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
72,skepticskeptical,Manson Family fodder,1,20 December 2009,"O Let Us Now Lament, in a 2.5 hour meditation complete with aestheticized images of wriggling maggots, the plight of the poor, misunderstood serial killer! If only we were profound enough to see the supreme artistry of his vision and his unique recognition that art must triumph over all--whatever the price in human coin might be! This piece of junk is serious Manson Family fodder. The only vaguely coherent interpretation of the ludicrous Woodstock orgy scene and subsequent peasant love fest is that all of this is intended to reflect an extended hallucinogenic fantasy on the part of a serial killer emotionally and psychologically indistinguishable from Henry Lee Lucas. So, upon apprehension, Grenouille fantasizes, up until the moment his body hangs limp from the end of a rope, that he is The New Messiah! Sound familiar? And check out this killer (pardon the pun!) intertextuality: Grenouille's victims are empirically indistinguishable not only from Charlie's girls at trial (you remember Sadie, Patricia and friends, crosses inscribed in their freshly shorn heads, don't you?) but also those in the Nazi concentration camps who were instructed to remove all of their clothes before entering the showers! Wow: Charlie would totally dig it!!!! If you found this film profound and enlightening, well, all I can say is that you would have fit right in at Spahn ranch.I am a serious perfume aficionado, and the only thing that I learned from this film is that the director has dropped more acid than all of the Manson family combined. Sometimes drugs and art don't mix. PERFUME is a toxic case in point. This film is a disgrace to the people of Grasse and the art of perfume.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
73,rajdoctor,Perfume,8,7 January 2007,"""Perfume  The story of a murderer"" I saw the trailer of the movie a few weeks back. I should admit that I was not that impressed by the trailer. It seemed too dark and the historic setting did not attract me much. But with my resolution to see all the movies during the Christmas vacation  'Perfume' was surely in my list of movies.I went to see the movie at Pathe Tuschiniski.After seeing the movie what can I say? I am thoroughly impressed by the movie. It had an excellent story, script, setting, eye for detail, costumes, make up, editing, cinematography and brilliant acting by Ben Whishaw as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. The director has taken all the pains to make this movie a wonderful experience to watch.The story is set in 17th century, and is about a fifth child - of a fish-seller women who abandons the child in the stinking gutter of fish market thinking this is her 5th still born child. The child survives and is gifted by a magical sense of smell. He is handed over to orphanage and later sold as a slave in a tannery. The child grows up pursuing his keen sense of smell and when he gets an opportunity to visit the nearby town  he impresses the best perfume shop owner  Dustin Hoffman  and begs him to become his master. Eager to learn the art of making perfume and retain fragrance  in this case of virgin girls' bodies - Jean-Bapstiste goes to the town of Grasse in France. Here like a master musician he achieves not only to find the extra 13th note of perfume (that was used by Paraoh in his Pyramid) but also creates 12 notes of perfumes based on that extra 13th note. This he does by killing virgin girls and using animal fat  distilling the body fragrance into perfume oil. The movie reaches its most pivotal stage when he is in search of making the extra 13th note of the already 12 extra (13th) notes. As an audience we do not want the young girl to be murdered  but our heart goes out for Jean  Bapstiste and his passion and internally we hope that he should succeed. I will not reveal here whether he succeeds or not and what happens in the end. One should see the movie to enjoy the making of 13th note. There is surely a twist in the tale and that will if not convince you  will surprise you.I read about the movie later on the internet and came to know that it is one of the most expensive European movie ever made. I felt good reading that  because it was worth the effort.Go and watch this movie  Perfume  the story of a murderer. If you like good cinema  you will enjoy this movie.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
74,Laakbaar,"""He who ruled scent ruled the hearts of men""",9,30 July 2014,"This is the surreal story of a serial murderer, told from his perspective. Not an ordinary man, he has extraordinary olfactory gifts. Born in the slums of Paris, and brutalised by heavy childhood labour, he inevitably finds his way to a parfumier, where he learns how to manufacture scents and soon surpasses the master. Despite his looks and his talent, Jean-Baptiste is inarticulate, simple minded, amoral and nonsexual. There are other strange things about him. People who become close to him tend to die accidentally.Obsessed by odours in general, and obsessed specifically by the overwhelming memory of his first smell of a beautiful woman (whom he accidentally kills), he embarks on the mission of reproducing the experience by creating a powerful, truly legendary and almost heavenly perfume, one that preserves the essence of love and eroticism. He succeeds, but it turns out to be a gruesome task with a terrible price.I've read the book and seen this movie twice now. This is such a good movie, on so many levels. The writing, direction, acting, cinematography, costumes, music and so on are all excellent.The often grimy realism of the setting in 18th century Paris, and then the beauty of Provence, is enormously appealing. The cinematography is beautiful.Ben Wishaw's performance, almost word-free, is electric. He has a very expressive face.The story is fascinating, even when it gets surreal. Spell-binding is the word, I think. It's the kind of film that leaves you wondering about its symbolism and hidden meaning.This is movie making at its best. I find it hard to identify any flaw. I don't understand why this movie gets a score of just 7.5 on IMDb. To each his own.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
75,bregund,Doesn't quite capture the true horror of the book,5,11 January 2015,"This is one expensive-looking movie. While this is a visually stunning film with thousands of extras, elaborate costumes, some terrific acting, set design, and gorgeous photography, it doesn't sufficiently present the basic idea of the book. A telltale sign of insufficient book adaptation is a narrator, explaining things that the film is supposed to show, and here we have John Hurt's scratchy voice to lead us through Grenouille's life. Ben Whishaw isn't ugly enough to play Grenouille, and the film doesn't sufficiently establish his supernatural nostrils or obsession with the scent of virgins. Dustin Hoffman was a terrible choice for Baldini. And they robbed the film of one of the book's most suspenseful moments: when a suspicious Richis pokes around the inn and finds Grenouille, who pretends to be sleeping, and dismisses him as a harmless stable boy. Worse, the film fails to exploit the tactile horror of the final murder, as Grenouille slowly processes her body all through the night.Sometimes books that have really great ideas are impossible to translate into a visual medium and I fear that Perfume is one of those books.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
76,t_atzmueller,"A handsome movie that essentially misses the ""essence absolute""",7,22 February 2016,"I had high hopes for this movie and, yes, tried my best to like it. The main reason: I love Patrick Süskind's novel, have read it numerous times and occasionally still give it a gander on audio-book (if you're familiar with German, I do recommend the version read by Gert Westphal). As can be expected, my expectations were high, yet, knowing about the complexity and topic of the book, also more than a little weary.Let's go right down to brass-tacks: it would have taken a director like Stanley Kubrick or Milos Forman and even those two would have had a tough time to translate the matter unto celluloid. And mind you: I'm in no way saying that Tom Tykwer produced a bad film. The actors are excellent, the costumes spectacular and the viewer feels transported straight to the Paris of Ludwig XVI. But capturing the essence of the novel, that's something the director didn't achieve.The fact that scents and smells play the main role in the world of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille isn't even the main obstacle. Although a master of dialogue – cult-shows like ""Kir Royale"" and ""Monaco Franze"" stand testament to that – in his novel Süskind primarily relies on narration. Since the novel is very episodic, making the transition to film even more problematic, most fans of the book will have their favourite chapters. In my case, my personal favourite also happens to be the part of the movie that I consider most accomplished. Partly due to the set itself, the scenes with Dustin Hoffman are a triumph. As mentioned, most of the cast is excellent but Hoffman has nailed his master-perfumer Baldini right on the spot. Every nuance, every gesture or facial expression, it all captures the Baldini of the novel.More Kudos must go to Ben Whishaw: presenting Grenouille for the first time, Süskind promises us (to paraphrase it) ""one of the great monsters of his era, standing in line with the Napoleons, Robespierre and Saint-Just of his time"". True, Grenouille is a monster and this is indeed the ""story of a murderer"". But expect no blood-thirsty, grimacing serial-killer, who gleefully offs his victim. Fans have long argued over what kind of creature Grenouille is, whether a psychopath with a gift or an autistic savant, who simply lacks all sense of empathy.I can only recommend this movie to fans of period-pieces like ""Amadeus"" or ""Barry Lyndon"" (though technically it doesn't quiet live up to either of those entirely). You might even enjoy it if you only have a fleeting interest in Süskind's book. But if you're one of those readers, who almost know ""The Perfume"" by heart and consider it on of the great novels of its time, you're most likely sit through a viewing with the constant afterthought that something essential is missing. The ""absolute fragrance"", if you so want. Hence, as a movie standing on its own feet, it's a solid 7/10, as an adaptation, I can give it no more than 5/10.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

I have not read the book, so have no idea how it compares, but I understand at least one director deemed the book unmakeable as a film. Apparently he was wrong. As much as I like Dustin Hoffman, I think he seems a bit miscast here, but certainly not to the detriment of the movie.

79,willcundallreview,A movie that smells of slight satisfaction,6,8 May 2015,"Rating-6/10Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a kind of crime and weirdly fantasy movie drama that tells us all about the scent of humans and how sinister it can get. Now it is a good story in my opinion and although Is a bit shaky all the way through here and there, patchy if you will, It does again in my opinion come out OK and a kind of movie where you feel satisfied but quite possibly let down by what it could have been.Now the whole piece is well acted, and yet certain scenes are so utterly random and not really useful for the plot, the actors suffer and our main Character Jean-Baptiste Grenouille portrayed by Ben Whishaw makes the biggest loss from this. Whishaw is good enough though and although looking inexperienced, still believable and almost animal like which I guess is what the original book wanted for him. Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman are among the veteran actors involved and although fine, still used poorly in casting and in direction.Now it is written OK to say it is adapted and the script does bring a little life to the story but in truth the words are not one of the highlights, even though the people behind this I feel wanted it to be. The same has to be said of the directing from Tom Tykwer who also partly writes this, it is pretty alright stuff but the way in which he coordinates this can make it seem too random and quickly the film can turn into ugliness or make an actor seem lost and like he just came for the day.Now one major fine point is the way this movie looks, now of course 18th century Paris was far from nice to be in, I just found the sets remarkable and really beautiful. I think also the way in which the perfumes are brewed and thought up by our main characters makes this fine again, even though we cannot smell, it almost gives us a near chance in a way to be able to. The setting is also fantastic in Spain, and really shows off the fine architecture and landscape too.Now off the way this looks and onto the way it makes you feel. This is the kind of film where I believe people will be mixed, and not in a way where some hate it and some find it kind of OK, but I feel people will love this and find it excellent, yet some just another bad movie. I think the reason behind that is the topsy-turvy nature of the movie that makes it hard to connect with at times yet draws you in at others so I think some will get annoyed. This is also a movie I strongly recommend reading reviews for it to get a good sense if you will like it or not, and I mean the critics will tell you straight. Overall I felt it to be alright and OK as I have said and the reason I gave it the grade I did is because it is not near being average, in fact I found it near to pretty good. The thing I will say though is that I stress that it isn't a movie all will like, some will be won over by the look and feel, and some will hate that and all the dark twisted kind of things that happen here and the film really doesn't connect you well with our main man Jean- Baptiste. All in all though it is definitely worth a little peak, could have been better to see at the cinema but it does just as well on a TV etc, the kind of movie that can be enjoyed but not too much.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The cast is only marred by its inclusion of Dustin Hoffman, who is inappropriately comical and hammy. Had he not been in the cast, I would have given the film a 10. But, even genius has its flaws. The narration by John Hurt works seamlessly with the on-screen action. Beautifully done. Finally, the scene of erotic mass hysteria in the town square is a technical coup.

So take what I say obviously with that grain of salt as a chaser. But I found this movie a big disappointment. Yes, a disappointment. Enured as I've become to viewing disturbing graphic images as entertainment, the annoyance I now feel when confronted with disturbia, such as Perfume, is akin to that annoyance a parent must feel when he or she gets yet another call from the principals office telling them their troublesome tot has again gotten himself into, well, trouble. You get to a point where the horror and shock value of what should be is replaced by the needling tedium of what inevitably always is. Perfume, again all too predictably, rears back and hooves you in the forehead before the opening credits have done unveiling themselves, with scenes of abject destitution on the streets of 18th century Paris, and with only about an hour of actual storytelling to spell you, keeps on kicking until the credits mercifully again appear, a NY to Miami flight later. One has to wonder, and to me this is the Regis question, one has to wonder who is actually sicker? Is it our uncivilized ancestors who (we like to think) lived lives of such brutality, OR we who painstakingly 'reenact' them to detail in the name of modern entertainment. Perfume becomes a movie depicting the Age of Reason as told though Age of Pornography eyes. The inept storyteller as always reveals far more about his own flawed character. As far as whats out there movie-wise, Perfume is the IPhone. Its got the writing, the director, the big name talent, and the incredible set design, you name it. Sadly it also includes the same anti-theism, feminist, anti-death penalty etc. clichéd nonsense found in the B-est of B movies clichés. Includes them in abundance. To be fair, buried beneath the muck and filth of Perfume the movie, is a story that is more than a little intriguing however frustratingly poorly told it most certainly is, but be forewarned.

87,PoisonKeyblade,A Sensational Scent,10,16 January 2007,"The best type of horror movie is one that scares you, makes you think, evokes emotion, and keeps you on the edge of your seat all in one overflowing package. Unlike recent horror films like Black Christmas or Turistas, Perfume is a genuinely original, flawless movie filled with real emotions, fantastic imagery, and an ending that is sure to stay with you for years to come. The premise is wacky and strange, and the main character is very interesting. Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is based on the book by Patrick Suskind, and the movie astonishingly captures every word and description written on paper. Perfume is directed by Tom Tykwer, and stars the great Ben Whishaw, Dustin Hoffman, Alan Rickman, and the voice of John Hurt as the narrator.Perfume tells the tragic tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, who develops an extraordinary sense of smell at birth in eighteenth century France. Grenouille is a misunderstood individual who wants only to capture the beauty of scent and learn to love and be loved. Grenouille soon discovers a perfumer, and works with him for a short time, learning the tricks of the trade and other secrets to the art of making a perfume. Grenouille soon becomes captivated by the beautiful scent of young women, and he paints a path across the countryside, taking women, capturing their scent in a most crude manner, and leaving their corpses dead in the streets. Grenouille needs thirteen scents in all in order to complete his lovely collection, and the thirteenth needs to be the most overpowering scent of all. Once Grenouille has all thirteen scents, he can make the ultimate, the ideal perfume The plot is truly one of the most bizarre, twisted, and disturbing ever devised, but it actually works very well. The film follows Grenouille on his journey, and the viewer really feels for this unfortunate, tragic character whose amazing gift becomes a horrible curse. The director captures every sentence, every word of the book so well that it doesn't feel like anything was cut out. The actors are all perfectly cast, and have great depth and realism. Dustin Hoffman plays a washed-up perfumer who makes a big comeback with Grenouille on his team. Alan Rickman plays the father of a young beauty, and he truly seems to care for her. The length of the film is also strangely a plus here, as it is nicely paced and never once feels boring.Overall, Perfume was a solid entry in a genre brimming with disgusting and flashy ""dead teenager"" films. The imagery is mind-blowing and incredible. The characters are realistic and likable. The directing is perfect in every way imaginable.

88,come2whereimfrom,what a stinker.,5,31 December 2006,"Perfume When they say that a book is un-filmable there is probably a reason. Take the example of 'A Cock and Bull Story' Michael Winterbottom's appalling take on another supposedly un-filmable book 'Tristan Shandy' and now we have perfume. As it is directed by Tom Tykwer who's directorial vision made 'Run Lola Run' so enjoyable I had high expectations and what started well simply ends up as a farcical nonsense. The film looks good enough and has a few flourishes of the director's previous outings but ultimately it's the story that lets him down. I don't mind films that start with the end, unless when you get to the end its completely different from the beginning, if you get what I mean. The main character with the astonishing sense of smell, like some sort of nasal superpower, is almost comical as he sneaks into his victims rooms like the guy off the milk tray advert sniffing the air to make sure he cant be found. It is his overwhelming desire to possess the ultimate smells that drives him to murderous ends but as he is such a skinny little guy who talks like Naboo from the Mighty Boosh you never once believe that he is capable of getting hold of a woman carrying her back to his lab, covering her in lard or whatever, doing the perfume making process and then returning her to wherever all in a night. The best bits are at the beginning where the camera zooms in and out of rats and nostrils and fills the screen with the sharp cuts of the fish market, the camera skills and editing get you all excited for what's to come but sadly it just ends up like a glorified and pompous lynx advert. It would have saved itself slightly if 'love will tears us apart' played as the credits rolled (you'll know what I mean if you see it) but unfortunately for me perfume didn't have the sweet smell of success but the stale odour of a rotting turkey.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
89,AndyVanScoyoc,On The Fence...,5,10 August 2021,"I enjoy art movies as much as the next person. Their fearless embrace of the taboo, the unseemly and the horrific are to be applauded.I'm not sure exactly where this movie fits in. As a dedicated Anglophile, I understand European movies much better than most of my American contemporaries.However, THIS film...I'm still scratching my head. Poor, precious baby is born to a mother who not only didn't want him, she didn't even tie his umbilical cord when she cut it, I guess hoping he'd bleed to death and rot into the rest of the vomitous sludge she worked in.Well, by the time Jean Baptiste is sold to a Tanner, most of the sympathy for him has disappeared. Though it's never mentioned in the film, it's obvious that he's just not...""right."" The filmmaker tries to explain this as he's different because of his sense of smell, which is super human, at the very least.Until he learns he can't capture EVERY single essence on the planet, he's completely devoid of morals or emotion, killing people for their essence (which fails) and even a cat. Almost lost me, there. Kill all the humans you want, I don't care why, but animals are OFF LIMITS...even if you CAN tell it's a stuffed cat plushie, when pulled from the distillery.The end...lazy, out of this world and laughable, I don't care how you try to dress the pig, it's going to do what pigs do...go back and play in the slop.That's what the ending of this film does. In an extra grand sweep of artsy fartsy, ""creativity,"" there's a ridiculous and useless orgy scene.I don't care how good a perfume smells, it's not going to make me rip off my clothes and have group sex with whoever is standing next to me. I'm certainly not going to ask YOUR forgiveness for killing MY kid.Overboard, over the top and just STUPID. The final ending was just as lazy. So...everyone absorbed him? Ate him? What? Oh and the very last drop that drips into the mud...are we supposed to think that's going to grow a garden of Eden and clean up the putrid streets?Gorgeous costumes, stunning scenery and nice music...a beautiful movie until the ending when...a sicko mass murderer is forgiven and worshipped as he slips away into oblivion...Because he smells good.Nope.

90,christian94,Tom Tykwer tackles Suskind's masterpiece,8,16 December 2007,"Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is the troubled but nasally gifted protagonist of Patrick Suskind's internationally-praised novel. Suskind is as gifted with words as Grenouille is with scents. He describes odors and sensations associated with them like no one ever did in the history of literature. He plunges us in the world of scent and masterfully make us follow and understand Grenouille's world.To attempt to put such skilled artistry into another medium is daring and Tykwer went about it the right way, although ultimately, the magic could not be exactly repeated. Tykwer must rely mostly on images to describe smell, yet although the movie is visually stunning and in a relevant way, there is no way the sensations are truly conveyed in a sense as deep as the novel. He also uses actor/narrator extraordinaire, John Hurt, as the narrator which uses some of that poetic imagery and tries to bridge the gap between book and film. It helps, it is a noble attempt, but in the end it simply pales in comparison to the novel's flare and splendor.The book and the movie are both rather lengthy and slow-paced. The words in the book are a delight in themselves and make it enjoyable regardless of the relative narrative iddleness. The movie is thus at a clear disadvantage in that aspect. However, ultimately a remarkable, memorable visually rich scene is created in the end and makes it all worth the wait. This climactic (in every sense of the word) scene is a feast to the eye and imagination and tells the story as well (or perhaps better in some aspects) as the novel ever did. This is the true achievement of the movie and will stay in your mind for a long time to come. The rest is good to very good, yet if you want to really smell like Grenouille, you will need to pick up the novel and delight.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The movie is about how to make perfume but in different ways.My student told me that the story is about a psychopath uses female virginity to create the aroma and tastes of a perfume and after hearing that it gets more interesting. I went to a local DVD shop and get a copy of this movie.When i popped the disc into my DVD player, the first ten minutes are really exciting. We can see many things that can't be truly observed in real life. The dirts,blood and many more. Sure enough this scenes are not recommend for children as they will experience a nightmare.Actually, if the length of the entire show is shorter, that will be great. Because of the movie come with such a length, it makes people want to sleep and it bring me to bed at the last 10 minutes.

92,akash_sebastian,A Fairy tale of a Serial-killer!,7,3 September 2012,"'Perfume' is a brilliant novel adaptation. Fairy tales about serial-killers are rarely seen in cinema. Though the screenplay and editing could have been better, the spectacular cinematography and top-notch acting keep you gripped to your seat from the moment Jean-Baptiste (the lead) is born. The whole movie revolves around this man who has a strong sense of smell. Many of the scenes are so visually prolific that you can almost smell them.By the title itself, we are aware it's the story of a murderer. But during the course of the movie, you keep on hoping that he murders enough number of girls so that he can complete his collection - to make the 'Greatest Smell in the World'. The character's ambivalence confuses you whether to like him or hate him. The story doesn't make you sympathize for Jean-Baptiste nor does it make him look like a ruthless monster. He's just a victim of a passion much greater than any man's control.At first, I didn't understand why a German writer would set his fictional fantasy story in France. But then, it made sense. Where else can you easily imagine a mass crowd orgy scene, and find it acceptable?All in all, the narrative storytelling style and Tykwer's vision & direction keep you mesmerized throughout.

The beauty of the photography, the jaw dropping recreation of 18th Century Paris (city and life in it) the filth, the smells, the rottenness of daily living is depicted with the force of a white hot rod searing one on the forehead.What a production!The story is fascinating, as far as I'm concerned the idea of setting up a film with the sense of smell as its main ingredient is quite new and non commercial and after seeing the film, reading the book shows a very close following of its author intentions.The casting of characters is flawless, I couldn't think of any actor as perfect for the main character as the one chosen. The movie, being basically the story of a boy with the only faculty or knack of an incredible sense of smell, is mainly a movie about sensations (extremely difficult for a movie to give us impressions of smells, either glorious scents of putrid odors) and sensations it gives us, plenty.To me it's a very fulfilling movie, as pure entertainment, as a historical document and at a human level, as a kaleidoscopic fan of human beings, most of them abject people.Vastly superior to most movies I have seen lately.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
94,Rindiana,Catch That Scent,5,18 July 2009,"I guess it's Bernd ""Sledgehammer"" Eichinger's fault that this predictably sumptuous by-the-numbers adaptation marks Tykwer's first mainly unimaginative directorial effort.Of course, the period recreation is splendid and the technical aspects first-class, but besides Whishaw's intense characterization and all the beautiful (and beautifully ugly) sights, the script's too laborious and the surreal touches of Süskind's source material don't translate all too well to the big screen... particularly the mass orgy scene.Hoffman chews the scenery, Rickman is coasting throughout and the dead girls look gorgeous.

95,shadowman123,A lustful experience.,8,22 January 2007,"I have not had the privilege of reading the novel but after watching this I think I shall check it out straight away. Perfume is not your average serial killer movie ! The main character Jean-Baptiste shows that there is method to his madness. Born in absolute squaller in Paris, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille has the Hannibal Lector-esquire style of smell form which he can detect odours from far far away. Whilst taking the journey with him one feels rather curious as to looking at the world from his eyes or nose , but however we being to see that curiosity turns into obsession leading to much darker things in search of his quest to find the perfect fragrance. The excellent thing about perfume is that the director lures you into a world where he captures the emotion of scent and wants you the viewer to feel it and experience it on many levels this finds success because he wants you to feel the aroma that our anti-hero is after. The acting was brilliant and everyone pulled there weight equally however I was a little unsure of Grenouille's cockney accent but because he was poor I was willing to let that go. Dustin Hoffman bounces back in fine form playing Balldini (Jeans perfume mentor). The film manages to capture scent and put it on screen for everyone to experience in a wonderful way. However I did feel that doing this it did drag on in some places for a bit longer than it should of done and a little rushed in some places. Perfume is a film that I would ask people well to treat like a perfume really! Just sit down, relax and let it flow into your mind . You won't forget the experience thats for sure and you also probably won't look at perfume the same way again.PERFUME:STORY OF A MURDERER 8.5 OUT 10FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NIGHT.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
96,CineCritic2517,Good griefs....,1,21 February 2007,"I did read the book, during school, many years ago not long after it was published. I liked it, but certainly not loved it. What made the so-so story a bestseller is the marvellous way Suskind wrote it.So to make it work as a film or play, it has to be told admirably as well.Therefore, can anyone please explain to me why this was just the thing they blatantly forgot to do? I really can't remember hearing such cringe worthy, laughable and clichéd lines of dialog in a profoundly wooden, almost satirical acting-style ever before. And then, of course, there is the seemingly endless narration by the poor and unfortunate Mr. Hurt who must have been staring a lot at his pay-check while getting the childish, embarrassment-inducing narratives onto the audio-tape.And if that wasn't enough to completely ruin any enjoyment to get out of this unconvincing motion-picture, they made it overly long. It really outstayed it's welcome on the screen and none of the fellow moviegoers around me in the theatre did their best to conceal their annoyance with his. People started talking, some of them left and others did both. I really wish I had done the same and just save the evening by conveying my disappointment in some bar over a stiff drink or two.I think this story could have been put to film graciously, maybe in an animated movie where something like scent can be depicted without having to do unimaginative close-ups of a sniffing nose. Something with colours perhaps? or nicely rendered fumes? just a humble thought movie makers.I know Kubrick passed on the opportunity, but if even Tim Burton turns down any involvement in making this movie (he must have had his reasons but he is, in my opinion, the one guy who could swing the right approach) they should have just let it slide altogether.Although adequately shot, a total failure storytelling-wise.3/10",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Smell, like taste, is something that is difficult to translate into film and the only way to do get as real as possible and let the audience create it for themselves. The extravagant colors and shots were more than enough to start you thinking about all of the scents in the world. Ben Whishaw was entrancing to watch as he became a serial killer and of course Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman deliver performances their names promise. The story is edged with a bit of strange.

Almost all of my friends hate Perfume. Some reviews about the movie write that the ending of the movie was ridiculous, the book has the same ending either, after reading the ending, it is impossible not to laugh. And in IMDb, the movie has a lot of haters. Honestly, I shocked with it. If they including my friends laughed while watching that scene, they should check their psychology seriously. To devour! Although Perfume's story seems very unusual, it has not any originality on the surface. A child is born. He is gifted. His smell is unique. Then years pass. This gift turns into possession and he becomes a killer in order to extract the best perfume. You sit down in front of the movie and a narrator starts to tell you a story. His voice and the flowing images are mesmerizing, against that, this is an usual method too, but it bewitches you and you cannot realize that exactly. The opening scene recalls The Illusionist, just a note. You watch the end or the end which seems to be, but you are under spell, you cannot say cliché. Perfume has a lot of scenes which make you smile. You smile because of the cinematic power, magic. How many mesmerizing scenes Perfume has to me? Jean Baptiste makes a perfume for Baldini and he distills it on his handkerchief, then, he shakes it very politely. What he feels, we feel the same, pleasure. May be, this scene means nothing for the people who disappointed with the movie. And later, when the narrator says sad things about him, then your pleasure breaks for a while, you are shocked. Some people who hate this film complain about the crime scenes as I know. No blood. No violence. I hate and don't watch movies like Hostel, Hostel 2 or the sequels of Saws etc. but also I don't like the movies that hide those kind of scenes from audience either, but yes the murder scenes are pure, but because of the beauty that pervades the whole movie thanks to the director, it was welcome to me. This is one of the most stylish movies ever made. Besides all, the scenes which Bapthiste makes perfume are so aesthetic, artistic too. My another favorite scene is the capital punishment scene. The camera angles are dazzling. And How can I forget the scene which Richis goes down on his knees and expresses his lovely feelings.

He is sent to an orphanage where he is discovered to develop an extreme sense of smell. He grows up in the most appalling conditions (the smelliest places), sold as a slave and then begins working for a famed perfumer Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) past his prime and he teaches him the basics to create perfume and at the same time, Grenouille helps Baldini reform his former glory.He then discovers the most powerful scent of all: the one of a red headed young girl. After accidentally killing her, his obsession for the ultimate scent begins, and he ultimately succeeds in unfortunately murdering several young girls to acquire their powerful scent. After creating the world's most powerful scent, he is arrested, and put in front of a crowd of hundreds of angry onlookers to be executed. But there's a twist involving Grenouille's own perfume: what happens next is so unbelievable, so impossible, its still hard to get your head around it. In the end, all Grenouille ever wanted was to simply be loved like any other person. Because he himself had no odor and his sense of smell was so great and being tossed into a orphan life that offered nothing but misery, you just can't help but feel sorry for the poor boy.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
100,jemps918,Truly fantastic...Tom Tykwer and Ben Wishaw are pure genius!,10,2 October 2007,"Absolutely riveting! What a fantastic movie this is! Without having read the book yet, it's understandable why Stanley Kubrick said that the story was unfilmable, but uber-talented German director Tom Tykwer (Lola Runs, Paris, je t'aime) makes an awfully close adaptation. More impressive is successfully mirroring the attempt of the main character's goal, which is to capture something as fleeting as scent.Perfume is about Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, an orphan with a superdeveloped sense of smell, who gets tragically obsessed in his search for the perfume of perfumes by killing the most beautiful women he could find to preserve their scents. British actor Ben Whishaw beat out Leonardo Dicaprio and Orlando Bloom for the role of Grenouille, and showcased his immense talent in Perfume. He practically starves himself and has very little dialogue, yet reeks with all the right emotions. For such a disgusting character, he is able to make the audience empathize with him; he is at once attractive and innocent yet cold and revolting, reminiscent of Christian Bale, actually. I cannot imagine anyone else playing this character as effectively. The choice of actors was perfect: British actress Rachel Hurd-Wood truly was the epitome of beauty and innocence as Laura Richis. Dustin Hoffman provided the right amount of comedy and stellar power to the cast. You could also feel for Alan Rickman as Laura's overprotective father (and rightfully so!).It's a very unusual movie with an equally strange ending but if you're open enough you will understand the author's reasons.

Perfume is a good story about a man with a super sense of smell is aiming to create the perfect perfume by using the dead bodies of beautiful women (maybe because beautiful women have beautiful smell). The film had a very good setting in the 18th century and had absolute terrific acting.I have not read the novel which this film is based on but it seems to have a good adaptation from the novel and that maybe the reason why it's quite long about 2 hours & 15 minutes because to cover up the whole book. Although it was long but it didn't seem to have any useless scenes. The movie is slow but was interesting to see what's going on.Perfume seems like a high budget film and I'm not sure but I think that it did not perform well at box office. Overall it is a kind of film that was best viewed at home not on the cinema and is OK to be watched once. Run Lola Run was much better.,Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It opens with a gut-wrenching stunner and never lets go, as in equal doses, a sensuous and very morbid world of beauty, tragedy and wonder of mythical proportions unravels. It's a sweeping cinematic work by director Tykwer that seduces the eye with overpowering production design and camera work in the vein of Jeunet & Caro, and clear-cut voice-over narration by John Hurt. And although the tone shifts and drops at times, it's the whole wondrously original concept and heart-pounding story thread that truly scores with me. Delights therein are the obvious parallels to the vampire legend, with the protagonists' lust and need for virgin victims, his lurking in the shadows, supernatural ability- and that unreal outsider identity that keeps him just out of reach, and also out of love... And that's just what I miss- that little sympathetic connection with Jean-Baptiste, plus a tighter running time (somebody trim that mammoth climax!) to gel this into a true full-pointer. It's an enigma why this wasn't up for ANY Oscar nominations! And Whishaw is unforgettable, yet needfully one-note in the lead- what a striking appearance!

It was a movie I bought from the bargain bin for $1.97 based on the actors and the historical setting I saw on the cover. So I was quite proud of myself when I finally got through this most interesting film. I learned something about perfumery, a subject I knew or cared about a whit. Of course, it had a serial killer theme to it, but it was never gory, sadistic or even hinted that the victims deserved it. It had a brutal edge, like our ""hero""'s early squalid life in an orphanage or a virtual slave in a brutal tannery. The man is almost a mute, seemingly gentle who has not only the best sense of smell but no body odor of his own. So naturally he ends up as an apprentice for Dustin Hoffman, Baldini the old Italian perfumer where he shows everyone up with his talents.The movie takes a blacker turn when our man child goes on this bizarre quest to create the ultimate perfume that sadly required young women. This happens when he journeys to Grasse to become a master perfumer. But in the movie's credit, it is no more gory than say Mutiny on the Bounty but there is a brutal edge to it for sure. The ending is simply bizarre as well as some of the scenes that attempt to show his superior sense of smell. It is an interesting, one of a kind movie that even if you didn't like it, you would be impressed & remember this film. Also, being set in mid 18th Century, they did a great job of historical recreation. It is definitely worth watching.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The story is magical and enthralling and moves forward in every scene, but the movie is also carried by the visuals both beautiful and ugly, and the wonderful acting.

107,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,An ode to the power of human senses.,8,7 September 2019,"""The soul of being is their scent"".""Perfume"" is a film adaptation of a novel written by Patrick Süskind and it is set in 18th century Paris, where the living conditions were horrible especially for the lower classes. The protagonist, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, is born in the Parisian slums and grows up discovering that he has a very special charisma as he is able to sense every single smell and aroma in the world. His extremely strong olfaction will lead him to the upper-class circles, and he meets a downfallen perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini, played impeccably by Dustin Hoffman who offers him a job where he can satisfy his passion. Jean-Baptiste is struggling to overcome the temporal character of smell, as he says ""to capture scent"" and keep it forever. Soon he will learn that the stronger aroma comes from human beings themselves and he will begin killing young women in order to absorb and preserve their scent.It is a rather peculiar idea for a story, but the director, Tom Tykwer (""Run Lola, Run"", ""Cloud Atlas"") succeeds in captivating the audience with his beautiful cinematography and in adapting the novel's mood and character. The actors are impeccable, with Ben Whishaw giving one of his best performances ever on-screen while there are some iconic thespians in the film's cast like D. Hoffman and A. Rickman. The production values are sky-high and the result is one of the most interesting flicks by Tykwer, a movie that is truly food for thought. The final twenty minutes gave me goosebumps while the last scene is destined to make the audience contemplate on the ""Perfume's"" major themes and questions.We need more movies like ""Perfume"", entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time, respectful adaptations of stimulating, gripping novels that will make the audience lay back and think after watching. Personally, I haven't read the book but after watching this, it was added to my, ever-growing, to-read list even though I am now familiar with the story and the plot.

109,nturner,Well-Constructed by a Renaissance Man,9,8 November 2008,"When I think of the plot synopsis of this film, it is a wonder that I even rented it. It is the story of a boy born into abject poverty in 18th Century Paris, raised in a brutal orphanage, then sold to a even more brutal tanner to work in a place where the healthiest workers only survive for about five years. The special thing about this boy is that he has an incredible sense of smell that guides him through all of his activities.One day while delivering goods he senses the aroma of a beautiful woman and is overcome by its effect. He follows the woman and accidentally murders her. Afterwards, he inhales every scent of her body and decides he must capture her astounding aura in some permanent way.Through a stroke of luck, he becomes an apprentice for a famous Paris perfumer where he learns of the twelve essential elements of a perfect scent. He also learns of a legend that there is an elusive thirteenth element that will raise the scent to the ultimate.He travels to a rural area in France famous for the creation of scents and proceeds to murder beautiful women in order to distill the thirteen elements needed for his supreme scent.Considering the plot line, this is surely a story that most people would shun - except, perhaps, horny little adolescent boys with minds filled with violence and the desire to see the bodies of beautiful women. I can assure you, however, that this is a mesmerizing film that captures you from the very beginning and holds you entranced for two and a half hours.Director Tom Tykwer has combined all the elements necessary to raise this film far above the level of a standard horror flick to that of a more than excellent motion picture. I hadn't realized it, but I have already seen a number of Tykwer's films and have enjoyed them all. They are all different but have a special - almost indefinable - touch that make them so, so watchable. Among Tykwer's other films are Winter Sleepers, The Princess and the Warrior, Heaven, and Run, Lola, Run. I recommend them all.In the special feature on the DVD, Tykwer talks of his search for an actor to play the main character - not an easy job. His choice of Ben Whishaw is perfection - he certainly has those mysterious thirteen elements. Whishaw gives us an amoral man committing unspeakable acts with whom we sympathize throughout the film. He convincingly shows us the two extremes of the human psyche - angelic innocence and conscienceless evil.Tykwer states that he had no other thoughts for actors to play the other major male characters other than Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman, and they, indeed, are perfect in their parts. At times, the film is somewhat of a dark comedy and Hoffman surely adds to that effect in his characterization of the famous Paris perfumer. Rickman is the intelligent father of the ultimate beauty - the thirteenth element - doing everything he can to protect his daughter from the monster in their midst.The extraordinarily beautiful Rachel Hurd-Wood plays the daughter and is, without a doubt, that elusive thirteenth element.Tom Tykwer is surely a Renaissance man in that he not only directed the film but helped to write it and composed the haunting musical score.

110,Hussain-AL-Naseer,All Praises to Ben Wishaw,7,14 April 2020,"The film got average reviews from the critiques at the time of its release for which I would say it is one of the underrated movies of 2006 which should not only be praised for its direction but for the sheer performances by its cast.
The film is indeed a psychological thriller showcases the France of about 3 centuries ago sets and designs are just aligned with the film premise and undoubtedly the star of the show is Ben Whishaw who played the character of Jean-Baptiste with so much of conviction and that also with almost no dialogues, you will see him in almost every frame of the movie, his journey will keep you intact and as it progresses you will start sympathizing with the character which might be started as a Psychopath",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
111,elcopy,Tykwer captures the essence,9,16 September 2007,"Tom Tykwer has to be the most talented, bravest director of our time. I say the bravest because he did a movie practically impossible to do (Stanley Kubrik believed doing this movie was impossible). You read the book and you can only understand a little how hard it is to bring a story like Perfume to film. Not only the book is hard to translate, but also the subject. This movie is about a serial killer, and everyone knows how hard it is to get into the mind of a serial killer, if that's even possible. This movie does the best it can to get us inside the mind and motives of a predator, better than any other film ever made. Filmmakers thinking of doing a movie that could make you understand characters like Manson, Dahmer, BTK, Gacy, Bundy, even guys like Hitler, will have to study this movie. Tykwer, not only takes the challenge, but succeeds. The medium is completely different, but he manages to deliver the same sensation. The same horror, passion, and awe condensed in the time of a feature-length film. The plot is lineal and easy to pick up, something American Audiences would appreciate. Too bad they'll stay away because of the subject matter, but for those who dare, they'll find a hidden jewel of a film.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
112,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,An extremely sensual experience,9,29 November 2013,"What an absolutely sensational film, although not quite a 10/10 experience.There's something of a minor pervert in me, I guess, and an imaginary ability to lay conquest over all women/mankind through some kind of sensual power, that no doubt heavily draws me to this film. But the bottom line is, it's a very unusual concept and an absolute visual delight.Right from the offset we're subjected to all the grime and disgusting aspects of how poverty in a city like Paris several hundred years ago might really have been. We're not spared an inch of detail and the intense sense of desperate plight, right the way up into the higher echelons of life, is portrayed in all its sewer-rendering realistic detail.At no point is there an association between the desolate beginnings of the film and the ultimate angelic status achieved by its end, just that it leads us down a grimy path which gradually gets less rocky and more interesting as it leads us on.I loved this film, although I do have a few weeny criticisms. The story in itself is completely imaginary, with no real facts behind the ancient process of enfleurage and the ability to capture the very essence of a female scent through such treatment, although I accept it could be possible. Dustin Hoffman didn't perform as well as he can, either, but that's only a minor observation, not a detriment to the film at all.I loved it.

114,scarletminded,Relatively faithful to the book...surprised they made a movie of it at all,10,11 March 2009,"I read the book a long time before the movie was made but I was excited to see someone tackled it. Making a movie based on capturing scent - something that can't be visualized very well -- isn't as easy as, let's say, making a movie of an artist painting. Yet a perfumer does a similar art. Even with cooking, the average people can get a recipe and get the essence a meal, but scent can be very hard to re-create.I felt this movie was well acted and as true to the book as it could be. It has a running time of over two hours and none of the minutes are wasted. Historically, it was very true. It has a very beautiful look, despite a lot of the film takes place in Paris slums.As for the plot line, I love it. It isn't the typical murder story. A guy, blessed with the ability to know all scents, has no scent of his own. He gets whiff of a young girl selling fruit and is taken aback by it. Of course, trying to get full account of her scent, he accidentally kills her, but then realizes he needs her in order to make the world's most seductive perfume, love itself. I was happy they included an orgy scene in this film, anything less would have ruined the point of this film. Even when the main character makes a perfume that is distilled love from the virgins he murdered and people will bow down to him, it still doesn't make him love anyone. He still feels unloved. I love all the metaphors in the movie. The book is great also, one should read it before seeing this movie, as it furthers the experience. Yet the movie does stand alone as a good movie, full of the distilled essence of the book.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

I understand the book was exceedingly well-written but if the film adaptation is faithful, the novel must have been fundamentally ridiculous too. Even if by the wildest imaginative stretch, you believe the premise of ""Perfume"", that the essence of murdered young women distilled into a perfume has aphrodisiacal and mind-controlling properties, what does it mean? What is the underlying theme of this story? Does it have anything to say about life, love, death? I think not.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
119,robinski34,The Sweet Smell of Success,8,14 June 2013,"There's a whiff of quixotic alchemy about Tom Tykwer's 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer' that is personified in an excellent central performance by Ben Wishaw, and it's a theme that runs through this innovative and captivating story from the novel by Patrick Süskind, as we are introduced to a wonderfully drawn cast of characters, but it is the protagonist's deranged genius that holds the film together, bringing the viewer, quite literally, an original sense of perspective.Arrayed around our anti-hero is a series of excellent turns from the likes of Dustin Hoffman as the mentoring perfumier; Alan Rickman as a concerned father; and David Calder as the Bishop of Grasse. Apart from Hoffman's role, and the comforting tones of John Hurt as the narrator, most of the supporting parts are brief, little more than vignettes in most cases, but they are always full of character and opportunity for expression which is seized by the players, and the accomplished script conveys so much through its looks and touches and expressions that the viewer forgets that the focus of the piece is a sense that is not available for them to experience.Despite the eroticism evident in many scenes, and the presence of a bevy of beautiful young women who fall victim to the protagonist's ministrations, the film never lapses into salaciousness, anchored in the Grenouille's profound belief that he serves a higher purpose, portrayed with such depth by the stand-out Wishaw. Such are Grenouille's powers of seduction, that those portraying his victims are, by and large, given more to do than simply cowering and screaming, and Rachel Hurd-Wood in particular is both intriguing and enchanting as Laura.At every turn 'Perfume...' is surprising and rewarding, the perfect antidote to the usual dumb-and-dumber multiplex fodder, and it should be affirming to everyone's love of cinema that gems like this are still possible in the face of rampant commercialism. It should not be forgotten that the film has a '15' certificate, and BBFC Insight tells us that the film 'Contains sexualised nudity and disturbing image.' but as long as this is remembered, 'Perfume' is a must-see.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
120,Kashmirgrey,"Perfume is captivating with it's imagscents, but impossible to drown in.",7,18 January 2007,"I saw this film expecting a horror film. If it is meant to be one, then the genre will need a new sub-category and I don't know exactly what that might be...For me, it was an adult Faerie Tale. Beautifully filmed and very erotic with its images and ability to enable its audience to smell with their eyes.I have not read the book. Personally, I do not think it fair to judge a film against it's written counterpart, that is, if a novel does exist prior to the creation of the film. The author (or those representing them) separated ties when they got their check. But that is only my opinion.Undoubtedly, there is a lot of symbolism in this film, but I enjoyed the simplicity of the story: Boy is born unwanted. Boy has unusual gift. Knowing nothing but a life as an outcast, boy becomes obsessed with the dark potential of his gift, and perverts his gift to connect with society and be a somebody. The obsession destroys him in the end. Of course, there is more to it, but I felt that obsession was the main theme of the film.My only criticisms are that there was very little character development, thus they had no depth and this made it difficult to have much empathy. Even the main character, Baptiste, was lacking. I believe it was intended that he come across as a pitiful victim of the evils of society, but also darkly sinister, leaving the audience with a confused sympathetic appreciation for him. If so, unfortunately, it was difficult for me to feel much of anything for the character, or for any of his victims, or their parents for that matter. Even Dustin Hoffman's short-lived character was a cardboard cut-out (which was disappointing.) Really, I felt as though I was watching a film on a tight budget that became hurried to finish.The originality of this film definitely is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the mainstream films which are being sloppy-joed out to us as of late. It's not an Oscar winner, but it is entertaining. If nothing else, it has the largest orgy scene ever filmed.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Add to that the unbelievably mature and gripping performance of Ben Whishaw. Although it follows the life of the French perfumer and murderer,Jean- Baptiste Grenouille, the movie is unrealistic, more or less like one of the brothers Grimm folktales. This allegorical underpinning gives the movie a deeper dimension. Grenouille's olfactory superpower and his obsession with scents represent his dire need for love.

Sometimes there are days when I see 6-7 films. When I give a film the coveted 10 of 10 I immediately expect strong disagreement from others. I often wonder what the average viewer needs from a film to give it that rating? This film, which I viewed via home theater system, in a dark and quiet uninterrupted environment, pulled me in right from the start. I was immediately immersed into the world that Tom Tykwer had created and it was amazing. I could practically smell the stench of the city and the story was IMO a masterpiece. It was also a wonderful visual experience, The feeling of emotion that the film inspires is truly worthy of the highest rating, any slight indiscretions the film may have had fall to the wayside. To me, film is not always just to entertain (while of course it is a requirement) but to really achieve greatness it needs to deliver that raw emotion & feeling that words cannot convey and this film did it.

Please.In addition to the story's combined oddity, sexuality, humor, horror, and suspense, it treats all the visual and sound FX with the subtlety you would expect in a film about a very fine sense of anything (in this case, smell). Even sports fans will find themselves wishing they had access to the precision filming used in this film.To write much more would both not do the film justice and potentially take away some of the wonderful surprises this film provides from beginning to end.

124,pefrss,Lavender in the air,10,8 January 2007,"I still need to read the book. If the book is as enjoyable as the movie , I am in for a treat. I have always been a fan of period films and 18th century France came very convincingly to life in this film. And what a challenge! We are used being dazzled by colors, motion, sound , light and shadow and of course being seduced by actors. All what is missing in a movie is taste, touch and smell. I believe that the smell of another person is one of the greatest sexual attractions, that we humans are not so different from animals that way.Suskind's novel tries to sweep us into the world of smell. And the movie does an incredible job. The birth of the hero of the story , Grenouille, in a Paris fish market is so graphic, that I thought a could smell the fish and the filth of the surroundings. There were other moments in the movie, when I wondered if ""smell"" movie has arrived, or if one of the other moviegoers had opened a perfume bottle. I had been to Grasse, I saw and smelled the endless lavender and flower fields in reality and I relived these moments in that movie. A fairy tale, the movie is beautiful and dreamy and dangerous, even murderous. Though the murders are somehow beautiful. The purpose of the murders is beautiful in essence. Like Mozart was consumed by music since his early childhood, Grenouille is born with an extraordinary sense of smell and a gift to create the most seducing perfumes. His desire to create the ultimate essence of life and love drives him to kill others and in the end himself. But before that he has a chance to test his perfume on a huge crowd and for those of you, who need their daily porn fix, you will get it in this movie.What an enchanting movie. So different from everything else offered today. Definitely European. Not a trace of Hollywood. Long, but worthwhile. I am pretty sure, it should be seen on big screen. I have a big collection of DVDs I bought because I liked the movie on big screen and it never made the same impression on me at home.

125,MRavenwood,"Sleepy, Creepy, Dull, and Unsatisfying",3,22 March 2008,"The notion of fragrance being combined with mystery and romance intrigued me, but I was quickly disappointed with this film. It begins with a heavy-handed conveyance of the message that the main character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, is strangely gifted when it comes to scent. The opening monologue has already told as much, so it is purely a waste of cinematic energy demonstrating this repeatedly in images for the first 15 minutes of the film. Jean-Baptist's obsession with capturing fragrance is like an infatuation, or a conquest; there is no end to it. Once the scent he is looking for is obtained, it becomes a piece in a larger, but fantastically pointless appetite that I frankly didn't develop an interest in at any point. The actual plot of the story finally gets going somewhere in the second act, (but I fell asleep, so I can't be 100% sure). The point is supposed to be that he is working on his masterpiece fragrance. But there's no art to his craft, merely a process that is shown repeatedly that the audience cannot enjoy. The short-comings of the film, mostly have to do with the story and it's tedious repetitive motif. I thought Dustin Hoffman a poor casting choice and did not find his performance convincing. Alan Richman brought to the table everything his thinly conceived character was ever going to provide plot-wise. His skills are used mostly in the resolution to the film, which is is downright silly and abandons a quasi horror-sci-fi vibe and flops right over into surreal fantasy. The movie does not serve to teach or entertain the audience. If you like dark films with ambiguous morality and no sympathetic characters, then this film might work for you. I require a more relatable plot line, and thus found nothing redeeming in the film. It is sort of a Grimm's Fairytale meets Jack the Ripper with a pinch of ""Like Water for Chocolate"".",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
126,ianwagnerwatches,Better Than I Expected,6,21 September 2021,"This is the type of movie that will be made or broken by the ending. It's a real room splitter.Perfume is a film set in 18th century France, if I remember correctly, and in it, nobody speaks French. In fact, everybody speaks english, and most of them have english accents. Pretty typical for Hollywood's portrayal of a European period piece: Just give them all English accents"". It's a bit lazy, and quite annoying, but probably won't ruin the film for the average viewer.What will possibly ruin the film for the average viewer is the concept itself: truly a fantasy, it follows the story of a man with a superhuman sense of smell who makes it his life's mission to capture the scent of a woman, indeffinitely.*Now, here come the spoilers*
The culmination of this man's work is the production of the perfect perfume, which basically makes him God to anyone who smells it. And, in the end, he uses this power to escape his execution and enrapture two two hundred or so onlookers. By enrapture, I mean pervade their minds with insatiable mating instincts, and... well... alright, they have a big ol' orgy in the town square. Right there. Just like that. Eeeeeeerebody's f***in' in the streets, like it's the end of the world.Now, for my partner, who decided we should watch this movie together, the orgy ending almost ruined it for her. But for me? Ohhhhh, baby. Made the whole film worth it. Up until that point, I found the film to be very strange and painfully regular at the same time. But, I mean, to have it all lead up to a massive orgy in the second act climax? I simply have to applaud the balls. I never would have expected something like that from a Dreamworks picture, and I was smiling from ear to ear, like the contrarian little sh*t that I am, knowing that people would be walking out of the theatre at this point.In summation, this is a relatively standard Hollywood period piece in terms of the pacing, the cinematography, and the general feel of it, but with a weird twist that Dreamworks doesn't often attempt. It's very much worth watching, although you probably won't walk away with any knew thoughts or feelings other than ""I can't believe they had an orgy at the end. That's crazy.""",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
127,rch427,"Gruesome, interesting, contrived, preposterous",4,21 March 2010,"""Perfume"" begins in as gruesome a manner as one might fear, mixing the mess of birth, fish heads and guts, dead rats and so on. It proceeds through various storytelling tropes -- many of which you will have read and seen dozens of times before (the heartless orphanage mistress, the bestial boss, the sacrificial virgin, et al) -- until it finally settles down into an interesting story. We don't like Grenouille, but we're intrigued by him, and by the premise of a man with a preternaturally powerful nose, no natural smell of his own, and some naive notions about women. But once we take the bait, the film breaks loose from its moorings and careens downhill into absurdity.Let the spoilers commence! But first, it must be said that Dustin Hoffman is simply embarrassing. He casually switches between New York and Pizza-talian accents, while displaying all of the subtle mental processes of a none-too-bright community theater actor. His performance isn't phoned-in, it's sent by carrier pigeon.Back to Grenouille. We are to believe that he is a sort of wild-child, with no understanding of the world. And yet, he has survived the squalid underbelly of Paris. So how can we believe that he's stupid enough to kill girl after girl, bury their hair and the wrappings he covers them in, but then just dump their naked bodies in obvious places all over town? It seems that every time a villager of Grasse turns around, there's another naked, dead girl behind them. And still, the girls of Grasse, god love 'em, wander into darkened passageways without a worry.We're expected to believe that Grenouille manages to extract a sort of ""essence of woman"" by covering her in animal fat for a few hours, scraping that off, mixing the fat with alcohol and then distilling it into ""essential oil"". If you believe that is even remotely possible, you have no concept of simple organic chemistry. Animal fat has its own distinctive smell which is far more pungent than whatever scent might linger on a woman's skin and hair, and the other surfaces that it touches (such as the wooden table in a stable, in one scene) would likewise contaminate the mixture with overpowering smells. Net result: ""essence of woman"" would smell like lard and manure far more than like woman, much less appealing-smelling woman.Then there's the matter of Laura's father, who seems to take every precaution against his daughter being added to the victims. Well, every precaution except the obvious ones: admonishing her to not open the windows of her bedroom, posting armed guards outside of her door, and perhaps keeping the key to her room in a safer place than exposed on his bedside table (I understand that a cord around the neck was the usual historical practice). When M. Richis discovers his daughter's death and is torturing her killer, Alan Rickman doesn't seem to be seething with hatred, but rather annoyed and oddly bored.But by far the most egregious lapse in sense is the film's denouement. The notion that Grenouille releasing his super-scent of essence of woman would reduce a crowd of a thousand men and women gathered in a square to blithering orgiasts isn't just preposterous, it wrenches the film out of being a murder mystery and into the realm of pure fantasy. This is a film that spends the first 95% of its capital in building up this murder mystery and then throws it away when it basically says ""well, it was done with magic"". There's no other logical explanation. Even if men within sniffing-range were seduced by the scent of women, how does one explain it having the same effect on *women*?! It would've been more believable if the men in Grenouille's proximity had treated him as their...er, ""cabin boy"", but utterly idiotic to claim that the smell would make women and men as far as the eye could see, instantly horny, and yet not make them jump all over the source of all of this remarkable scent. Indeed, the film then turns around and does just that, when Grenouille returns to Paris. They can't have it both ways.It's a shame that a film otherwise well-crafted had to blow it like this, but of course, the plot is the fault of the source material. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if it veered between murder mystery and fantasy as well, but if it did, perhaps it worked better in that medium. As a film, it just became absurd and ultimately, I have to say it smelled.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

An individual deprived and devoid of love and all human feeling yet in the case of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille the only existence and feeling he knows is his astonishing sense of smell. Based on Patrick Suskind's novel ""Das Parfum"", ""Perfume: Story of a Murderer"" tells the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw, a revelation) an orphan born into poverty and the lowest filth who was almost left to die underneath the fish stand immediately after his mother gave birth to him. From the time he was born to his adulthood, Grenouille has the gift of smell. One night, he smells from a mile away a beautiful young woman (Karoline Herfurth) selling plums in the streets of Paris. He becomes obsessed with her scent and her beauty, but accidentally kills her. He now becomes obsessed with learning how to preserve scent forever. He is soon taken in as an apprentice for once famous perfumist Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) and learns the art of making perfume. Grenouille is pure talent but his need to capture scent is far greater. He goes on a journey to learn the meaning of scent and to create the greatest perfume of all. On his journey, he sees and it is captivated by Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood, who is absolutely a vision of loveliness), the daughter of Merchant Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman). Grenouille goes on a killing spree targeting beautiful, innocent, young virgins and collecting their scent but his main goal is Laura Richis. Directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) ""Perfume: Story of a Murderer"" is tale of loneliness and longing, but in the case of Jean Baptise-Grenouille he will fight against it in a terrible way. Unable to feel or understand love because he has never known it he only understands scent. Beauty is something he has never had and he will go to every lengths to obtain it. Ben Whishaw is amazing as Jean Baptiste Grenouille. His expression is gaunt and close to pitiful. He plays a young man who has known ugliness, darkness, and bitterness. When he sees the girl played by Karoline Herfurth he was unable to communicate his feelings for her. To him words and speech are useless to describe the beauty of what he can only smell. Her beauty and innocence was what he smelled and to him it was arousing. The tragedy of Jean Baptiste Grenouille was his inability to love. Had he been adopted by Baldini as a baby Jean would have been a different person. The photography of the film is absolutely sumptuous and sensual. Of course there is also the gentle beauty of then seventeen year old actress Rachel Hurd-Wood (Peter Pan and American Haunting) who is the epitome of all that is Grenouille's inexpressible desires. She is everything that he had never seen or had. A sad, beautiful, but also disturbing tale of longing for beauty and for love.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

That was no easy job, considering the challenge of creating a story taking place ,way back in 18th century , as compared to those techno savvy plot lines mostly based in the current period, with a sleek urban back drop , to shoot the killings, invariably happening, either in the parking lots, or the lonely platforms, after a few minutes chase , with little stretch provided for imagination of the viewer. Ben Whishaw , as Jean Baptist Grenouille, the murderer, and the central character of this awesome movie , is simply terrific, with his firm conviction , and weird, chilling, psychotic devotion, to create the most extra ordinary perfume in the whole world, out of the very virgin, beautiful bodies of young girls ! The way he embarks upon his mission , starting with the first girl floating nude in that huge jar of glass, which should otherwise contain flower petals, is spine-chilling . And then starts the frenzy ,of pretty girls being violently snatched from every possible nook and corner of the town Gasse , reaching frantically towards it's climax , Baptist chasing feverishly towards his ultimate prey, the most beautiful of them all, that innocent Laura , vehemently protected by her powerful father, but alas ! Now the film takes a very unexpected turn, by every body falling at the murderer's feet, calling him an angel, just by the aroma, cleverly used by him to hypnotize them, with that tiny little miraculous glass bottle, which contains his precious perfume . the scene of crowds indulging into sexual orgies, including even the Bishop , is superbly filmed , and is very unique for it's theme. The realization of his incapability to have responded to the plum girl, bringing back the memories of his first encounter , he following her,enchanted by her body perfume, and the sexual union which never took place, brings a tear in the eye of this most merciless killer of his time, and he decides to pour the contents of the bottle over his head . the last scene, when the filthy, poor, fish market crowds of that place where he was born, as an illegitimate , disowned , unwanted child, perishing after the crowds have vanished him, to take away that extra ordinary perfume, making him angelic, is very disturbing. this serial killer was no ordinary human being . The casting is really perfect, specially karoline as the plum girl , Hoffman as Baldini , and Rachel as Laura. Whishaw has captured the intensity, the cold blooded killer psychosis of Baptist, with a style of his own, under the capable direction of Tykwer. the film is good on all the other fronts, like music, settings etc. perhaps the only minus point may be in the story line would be , the murderer killing a prostitute too, when he is actually crazy after virgins, and the stretch of imagination a viewer is subjected to, especially when he follows his ultimate prey Laura, beyond hills and mountains , far, far away, the father and daughter galloping on horses, and he catching up with them bare foot , that too, the very night they take shelter in a fortress type villa . the scene when he waves and throws his handkerchief, soaked in perfume, to drive them crazy, is also some what loud, and could have been handled differently, perhaps ? yet, the movie is quite different than the other so-called blood curdling movies, with some exceptions like The silence of the lambs, or others, and a must see for all those lovers of this genre . I must study the type of perfume that i may use, next time around !",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
135,machngunjoe,A lot of hype for a dismal piece.,6,17 August 2007,"I thought the movie was a crowning achievement in cinematography and costume design. Everybody in the film was extremely beautiful and it depicted 18th century France very well, with all the grit, nastiness, and eloquent beauty rapped in one film. But if you have read the book most likely you'll be disappointed. The movie, for me, failed to grasp the true essence of the novel. I saw the film first then read the book out of curiosity and for that I like the film, because the book is a classic. So my advise to you is...watch it for a twisted different story that is far beyond what the usual Hollywood meat and potatoes has to offer, but don't expect a 7 course French cuisine meal.Stanley Kubrick once said that this film was unfilmable, mainly because of the complex story development it would have as a movie. SO if you watch the film first, that'll be good, nut if you read the novel then watch the film...well prepare to be greatly disappointed. Its not the film-makers fault though...its simply too complex to film.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
136,graestella,Charles Manson meets Spiderman,1,10 July 2011,"I would have given this zero except for the scenery. This was very,very bad. Let's start with the genre. If Clockwork Orange is accused of not knowing what genre it is, then this film didn't have a clue. Parts seemed black comedy, other parts pretended to be historical,then half way through the 'hero' seemed to get super powers, so that made it an Anciene Regime X Men picture. After a while I realised it was a horror film. As the naked body count of dead women piled up it could have been nothing else. Also the unexplained fantasy elements piled up too. Our sicko hero has the olefactory equivalent of Daredevil's hearing; like a ninja he can enter buildings unseen, abduct people, silently kill them, process the corpse and then bring the body back all without detection. The ending with the mass orgy seemed like a Hayes Code version of Ken Russell. Loads of bodies but no genitalia. At the same time prurient and yet coy. Similar were the murders. Lots of paraphiliac post mortem stripping but each corpse was artfully arranged so no naughty bits were on display. He was supposed to have smashed their skulls with a club, this too left no wounds or blood. By sanitising the violence and the nudity do we not risk making a serial killer into an artist? Real crime scenes I suspect are nothing like this. I sincerely hope Ian Brady doesn't get to see this film, as I'm sure he would love it. I'm also baffled how it got a 15 certificate. Sadism on this scale surely rates an 18. And it was sadism, if the women killed were all dehumanised targets who stood no chance, and 9 of whom didn't even have any dialogue.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

And at the last, all men & women perform an open-sex with the perfume's power!! It was really very very funny! They finally judged a Psycho as an ANGLE! These thinkings have made me confused.

The voice over is quoting from the book and bringing the skills of the writer into the film, and still still something was missing.The spark of a masterpiece.

139,khemass,Exceptionally Good,9,19 May 2008,"I haven't read the book, but I can imagine how difficult it is to make this story, to make the audience imagine ""smells"", and to make them understand the complexity of Jean-Babtiste character. Anyway, I must say that the director succeeds in doing so. (I mean who can do it better? You can think of any better idea how to convey such things?)I couldn't take my eyes from this film all the way through. I was so impressed,very impressed. I could imagine so many smells by looking all those images wonderfully presented. I sympathized with loneliness in Jean-Babtiste's heart, yet scared of what he is capable of doing and what he is obsessed of. This movie is such a magnificent work of art in every way. It's something I want to buy and keep just to re-watch those images.The only thing a bit disappointing is the ending. Maybe it's because it suddenly steps to something surreal and symbolized all of a sudden. I know some of the people who couldn't take the ending at all and say this is crazy. For me, I was shocked at first but then I started to understand a bit more what the story wants to say to us.This is another excellent film. Don't miss it.

The acting is out of this world and the cast is riddled with A list actors, who couldn't be more understated if they tried.

141,javi-y-se-acabo,"You Cannot Smell It, But You Will Feel It",9,13 June 2017,"This movie, surely, isn't for everyone, but if you like it you will probably find a gem in this movie.It tells us the story of Jean Baptiste Grenouille, a boy who is born with an overdeveloped sense of smell and he wants to find the way to make all this different scents he smells to remain. The story is so great, told in an awesome way, and for me it was very original, something that you don't get to see that much these days. Because it's a story about perfumes, scents and smells, the movie had the difficult task to transmit that to us without having the possibility of the smells in a movie theater or in your house, but the director (Tom Tykwer) was able to recreate this world of smells in a very unique way. Although there were some parts that did not make much sense (why does he suddenly decides to live in the mountains? This is not really well explained) but they don't affect that much to the story development.Ben Wishaw shines here as Grenouille providing a performance with not many lines of dialogue but that transmits a lot with his movements and face gestures. He has that bit of innocence but also you see the madness he ends up with. Also Alan Rickman, who does not appear until the middle of the movie or so, provides a very powerful performance as the main antagonist, Richi the father of Laura, one of the possible future victims of Grenouille. The one I felt was a bit overdone was Dustin Hoffman who wasn't at the height of a perfume maker of Paris.The visuals in this movie were very stunning, with many powerful scenes (like the Final Perfume Scene, when Grenouille meets Laura or many more) that capture this aggressive, dark and gritty world but without needing violence or explosions , like in modern blockbusters, just keeping the tension and taking you to the world of scents in a wonderful way. And for that, the director had the help of himself, Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek to create a magnificent score that almost provides this ""smell"" that you cannot introduce in a movie with very beautiful and also very creepy melodies.I recommend you to watch this movie and after that you will see if you liked it or not but for me was a wonderful experience and I surely recommend it to everyone.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
142,Rifat_Rock_Don,The most beautiful film I have ever seen 😍,10,8 May 2020,"Of course, (mercifully) we cannot smell what the Perfumer smells. In compensation we have hy per-real imagery, using stunning macro shots that are extreme close-ups in startling detail - the tiny hairs on a nose, the explosive s plash of a single drop of essence falling into a pool. But more than the classic beauty was also the revolting beauty - maggots in a rat, the filth of the fishmonger, bad teeth, dirty hands - all in amazing, sometimes squeamish detail. This film could not have been made in Hollywood - it has a unmistakeably European flavor and is unflinching in the details of early 18th century France. The story of single-minded obsession and remorseless killing in the name of love by a nearly mute actor is mes merising. And Dustin Hoffman's merry turn as a foppish Italian perfumer provides welcome comic relief!",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
143,shattenjager777,"Good for about an hour, but loses its life.",5,29 July 2007,"For about the first hour, ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is a truly excellent film. Tom Tykwer shows a mastery of color use that few directors possess, the off-kilter story builds some nice suspense, the acting is solid, and, perhaps most importantly, there is a nice sense of humor about its own ridiculousness. Unfortunately, just after the death of Giuseppe Baldini, just about everything good about the film goes out the window.Tykwer quickly establishes his color palate for the film, painting it entirely in a muted, blue-heavy tone until Jean-Baptiste Grennouille first discovers a scent that excites him (an apple tree), and that object gets a vibrant, heavily-saturated color (including, as it is an apple tree, splashes of green that are rare in the film). He follows this pattern throughout the film, reaching its height when Jean-Baptiste first finds a perfume shop and it is loaded with golds, greens, yellows, and whites, all vibrant. He also has an excellent, John Carpenter-like grasp of composition, always able to use off-center composition to prepare for action in a particular place on screen. However, these are really the only visual interests of the film.The early part of the film builds an excellent amount of suspense as we await the murderous rampage we know is coming from Grenouille, but the problems are that it takes too long to get to the serial murder we already know is coming (from the title and the advertising) and those murders simply take too long to be terribly effective. Meanwhile, one of the most interesting aspects of the early film is its sense of self-aware humor. Every character who ""cares for"" (using the term very loosely) Jean-Baptiste dies as soon as he leaves, perhaps commenting on the roles of minor characters in film and perhaps simply giving us some comic relief, but welcome either way. Tykwer also seems to be having some fun with the ridiculousness of the idea of such a powerful sense of smell, as Jean-Baptiste sniffs to represent everything and quickly becomes something of a self-caricature. However, at the same point just after Baldini's death, that sense of humor disappears and never returns.Another mid-point problem for the film is that its second-biggest character, Dustin Hoffman's Baldini, is replaced by Alan Rickman's Richis. As usual when not playing a villain, Rickman is stiff, wooden, uncomfortable, and very unbelievable in his performance, as contrasted to Hoffman's usual excellent (if rather limited by his character in this case) portrayal. Since no role in the film requires much, only Rickman stands out as weak, but the size of his role thus becomes a major issue. Throughout, Ben Whishaw plays a very easy role well enough, but he also has little to do.Finally, the film ends terribly, almost reminiscent of The Who's opera ""Quadrophenia."" In both cases, we are following unsavory characters around, both excited and repulsed by their activities and knowing that they haven't exactly enjoyed the journey either, but in both cases, the creator apparently couldn't come up with a decent ending. Pete Townshend decided that instead of continuing the social commentary of the rest of the album, his hero would simply announce that all he wanted was love. ""Perfume"" has exactly the same problem, and the story ends just as ridiculously and unsatisfactorily. However, Townshend at least had a great song to end the album (""Love, Reign O'er Me""). Tykwer has no such tricks, leaving us wishing the film had ended at about an hour and fifteen minutes.Overall, it's a solid film for almost half of its running time, but then it loses its steam and becomes essentially an exercise in futility the rest of the way. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is unfortunately a major disappointment.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

This movie is crap. Pure crap. It bounced from theme after theme, it never gave characters time to develop, it thrust the premise of scent via visuals ad naseum, and the story broke apart at the seams several times before the end. Talk about forced. The whole thing was over-thunk. I watched the Extra clips on the DVD and one could tell half the people trying to talk about their experiences didn't believe a word of what they were trying to say. I found the actors far more interesting when they were just talking than they were trying to affect characters. I am a forgiving person, but this film was pure and simple a case of overthinking, way too much intellect, and way too much money thrown at an idea that was just completely forced. One of the worse cases of good money creating a very bad film. Trust me, this is bad film making. Period. Trust me, it is BAD film making.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

146,rtrnt,"Portrait of a killer, one that see-saws between anti-hero and sympathetic",8,7 October 2020,"Producer Bernd Eichinger labored long to persuade Patrick Suskind to agree to have his novel adapted to film. Tom Twyker's adaptation of the story of 18th century murderer Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, who had a vastly superior sense of smell, one which led him to kill in the first place, is a long but fascinating example of film narrative that occasionally shifts perspectives. While the film boasts a menacing, brooding performance from Ben Whishaw as the vicious killer, we are never quite sure the film is portraying his evil as a warning or has sympathy for what ails him or possibly wants to have it both ways. Alan Rickman is quite good as a member of the French aristocracy who correctly senses the danger to his family. Dustin Hoffman is unfortunately wasted in a brief, smallish role. The narration often proceeds, describing his perception of the world, especially during his backstory.The film is at its best when it portrays how easily the masses are blind-sided by his undeniable gift at producing spell-binding fragrances. There is an orgy scene that is both horrifying and hysterical in capturing the impact of smell on an entire city square. It is also offers a glimpse into how a city in France was at a loss on to how to protect itself against a serial killer whose murders became more frequent and daring with experience.Those who are seeking a conventional, cookie-cutter story about justice toward a murderer will not find it here. But nor does this necessarily fall into the category of tragedy because as mentioned earlier, the film vacillates between sympathetic portrayal and anti-hero in dealing with its protagonist. Nevertheless, this very well-made film will remain compelling until the very end, even if you are left with more questions than answers.

That ""something different"" is the treatment of the serial killer; from the opening 15 minutes, where the society that produced him is so vividly depicted that I could barely watch, to his ""apotheosis"" at the end that defies the routine Hollywood treatment. The ""something special"" is Ben Wishaw's stunning performance. Often non-verbal, his appearance changing from handsome to grotesque and back again in the space of seconds, he dominates the character, the screen and, in the end, the audience. Has a psychopath ever been more ably portrayed by any actor? The movie is as beautiful as the subject is gruesome. The direction is as flawless as the story is horrifying.

149,hoversj,You don't have to have read the book.,9,9 November 2006,"The story in a nutshell: A young man from an unwanted and unloved upbringing, pursues his obsession with making the perfect scent. It happens that the ingredient he want most to preserve is the scent (equated with the soul) of a beautiful young woman - who, unfortunately, dies in the process.This murderous tendency would lead you to assume that you won't like Grenouille, but it's kind of surprising that you don't hate him as much as you would think. The movie manages to make the character just understandable enough to make you sad that he couldn't figure out another way to get what he wanted, and regret the dead girls, he is also engaging enough to keep watching.(While it is arguably possible that the scent could be taken without the girl dying, it is not possible for THIS MAN to do it - he is simply not socialized enough to know what to say or do to make someone ""work with him"". The time period is also a drawback - getting a modern girl to undress and let you cover her in lard TODAY would probably just involve a newspaper ad and $50.) Grenouille really came across as very nearly a ""wild child"" - someone who knows enough language to communicate basic needs, but doesn't really understand how to ""speak"" to people. He almost lives in an entirely different world from most people, since his primary sensory input is smell - rather than sight or hearing, like the main run of humanity.The imagery the director used to conjure up the audience's smell-memories was very nice. Everything you saw, you could almost smell. I saw a preview of this last night, with the benefit of a Q&A with the very funny and charming director afterward, and he mentioned how he didn't want to go so far as to actually incorporate scents, a la William Castle and Ed Wood - not only because it is a silly idea, but also because the theatre would reek after every show.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
150,druss44121-1,"Touching, Brutal, Wonderful, Dark",8,29 November 2006,"This is the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a man born with an amazing sense of smell who becomes obsessed with creating perfume, working to create the world's finest. Of course there are some dark turns, and a few dead girls later a completely unpredictable and surreal conclusion hits that pretty much will leave everyone talking.To put it bluntly, I didn't expect to like this at all (even though I loved Run Lola Run), but surprise surprise I really did. In fact, the more I think about it the more I really want to see it again. This is a hard film to advertise so if you think the trailer's are iffy, don't write it off just yet. As Tykwer said himself, this is really a big experimental film.However, it's refreshing to see. This is an experiment that has gone well. The narrative really doesn't fit into a basic mold, with a big story and character shift coming half-way through that is fairly jarring (somewhat like in A.I.) However, despite minor pacing issues and a few moments that are a bit more confusing than they need to be, this is a strangely wonderful film. It somewhat reminded me of some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's work, such as City of Lost Children, both in visual scheme and level of weirdness (weird, but never weird for weirds sake.) There's an odd humanity about the whole thing, as it never becomes sappy or sentimental yet still has a heart beyond the darkness.I really think this is a film where the less you know, the better. I knew hardly anything beyond the basic premise, and I was a better man for it. It is more accessible to a wide audience than some might first think, and if you're at all interested in period films, European cinema at all, or anything that is different or unique, by all means take the plunge.I have sadly not read the novel this is based on (I don't believe in reading, too much fact not enough truth), but I can see how the book was probably very hard to adapt. The music in the film is also exceptional, really setting up the mood. The way Tykwer portrays the sense of smell through visuals and sounds is also exquisitely done, the music aiding these sequences greatly as well.Overall: 8/10, though with another viewing possibly a 9/10.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

My admiration for Ben Wishaw's acting skills, led to my first viewing.During that first viewing I, like many others, was equally grossed out or enchanted by the imagery.The acting was superb, the story compelling and the music haunting. The overall feel, and yes, even the evocation of smell, was mesmerising.It was once the film had finished that the magic started; it played on my mind and still does, hence why I have revisited it several times since.Snippets come into my mind every so often, the bowl of yellow plums, the falling building on the Pont du Change, the flower filled vats, the waft of scent from a carriage as it whooshes by, the look in Grenouille's eye; his silent obsession on full display.This film is an experience and a unique one at that.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Full of gorgeous cinematography painted with the richest of hues; beautiful and haunting music (recorded by Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic no less!) and boasting clutch of excellent and charismatic performances, especially in the strange and magnetic presence of relative newcomer Ben Whishaw in the starring role.This is a Grimm fairy-tale of sorts, a dark Gothic fantasy with pungent overtones; a film to wallow in and drink up as sheer experience. In the cold light of day it is easy to pick holes in the faintly absurd and rather episodic story, and the whole enterprise overreaches itself just a little at the end with scenes of spiritual ecstasy that veer dangerously close to parody. But such analysis does no favours to the film or the viewer. Perfume is a deeply sensual experience and a remarkable achievement at bringing a famously ""unfilmable"" novel so richly to life.

154,mkquinn91,Amazing and unique,9,8 June 2020,"Especially if he had an oversized nose to match his smelling superpower, Grenouille could be an amazing Batman villain.What a beautiful, insane film. Gorgeous imagery mixed with filth and horror, woven together with masterful cinematography, editing, and an evocative score. It has the added benefit of combining two of my favorite film genres: murder thriller and period piece.There have been great films focused on destructive and or perverse obsessions, but it's so interesting to have a man obsessed with scent, something that doesn't readily work in a visual medium. Ben Whishaw gives an admirable performance of obsession, but it is the filmmaking that so effectively conveys the idea of scent and need that really sells the unique premise.The film starts intensely, with a baby's birth into fish guts, and only gets crazier. It still maintains aesthetic beauty, even as the subject matter becomes increasingly odd and violent. I was often reminded of the TV show Hannibal's knack for making murder and cannibalism visually striking and sometimes appetizing.The only downside is that the ending is even farther out there than a man killing to steal scents. While shocking and engrossing, I was totally baffled and felt a little betrayed, as though my thriller had suddenly turned into a fantasy movie. After I have some time to digest it, I may end up liking it more and maybe bump this up to a perfect five stars.P.S. This movie reminded me that I miss Alan Rickman more than some deceased family members.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
155,pogostiks,sensuality and emotion,8,14 November 2006,"I was totally captivated by this film, especially by the cinematographyand the main actor. There is a sensuality of colour and emotion (with all of the incredible close-ups of fish, fruit, flowers, material, everything in fact) that the entire feel of the film is a homage to the senses. The main actor (Ben Whishaw)is so wonderfully subtle, with the camera catching just a glint of burning passion in his pupils, glowing out of the shadows in which he lurks, that he is at times truly scary. There is a marvelous sense of time and place. At the very beginning of the film, you can almost smell the fish, the sweat, the dirt. The washed-out colours give everything an ethereal air, increasing the strangeness of the personage and the story. The attention to detail makes you smell the flowers, almost taste the fruit, and practically feel the material of the clothes, the hair of the victims, the cold and damp of the prison cell. This is one of the most sensual films I have ever seen, and the editing which is fantastically complex enriches the impact of each scene. A terrific film! If it doesn't win an Oscar for the cinematography, there is no justice in this world. I also think that this could never have worked without the amazingly expressive talent of Ben Whishaw. He has very few lines to say, but you are never in doubt for a second of what he is thinking and feeling. It is an acting tour de force and he is totally believable from start to finish. It is truly an amazing performance. I cannot recommend this film more highly.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
156,Weredegu,What about the silence of the lambs?,10,4 February 2007,"Following here is a short comment from someone who hasn't read the book (yes, there are such people). I haven't even heard of the book, to be perfectly honest with you, before I first saw a trailer of the movie informing me about it. So I can be something like a laboratory rat for people who did read the book... Well, watching the film was a cathartic experience for me, hence it did work indeed! The common complaint that it couldn't possibly let odors be felt and thus couldn't but fall short of providing the viewer with the same sensations as the novel is not justified, and for the very simple reason that a novel can't make you feel odors, either. Whatever art form you choose, you have to find some answer to the challenge of such limitations. The film-makers had the option of using a lot of narration, which very likely would have been dreadful. Instead, they went for the option that film-makers should always attach priority to. They attempted to deliver to you the essence of the story by vivid imagery and magnificent cinematography. They succeeded - I know because I sensed it from my own reactions. That's what made this a good film. The cathartic experience came with the one scene towards the end, about which there's hardly a spoiler-proof way to write. Let me say this much: it was such a wise comment on the psychology of the masses, I loved it! OK, one more comment. Ben Whishaw either had very good direction here or he showed nothing less than real genius in his role. The way he put his character's personality into his whole movement, walking so that you could see him for what he was... Someone of a low social standing with severe traumas in his past that nobody in that age would have given a flying thought about (given his social standing and the commonness of such traumas) - a distorted and yet natural phenomenon.I have just one critical question about the story, but it's an open one, and in my interpretation it comes straight from the author. Answer it as you please. What about the silence of the lambs?",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
157,SomaQuest,Underappreciated In Every Way,8,3 October 2018,"I came across this film by happenstance and I am so elated that I did. A unique period piece with all the trappings of one of the greatest serial killer films made. Acting was excellent, including all extras and secondary roles. Cinematography was dark and foreboding, as it typically is in this style of film, but the cinematographer brilliantly used pops of color where needed to enunciate aspects of a scene.The story was truly original and well written; told in part with voice-over narration it leads you deeper and deeper into the genius of the sociopathic lead character.

The idea is very different and unexpected. The film manages to convey the bad smell of an earlier epoch. If smell could be visible this film makes smells visible, from dirty bodies to fields of lavender. Don't see this film is you have a cold. Murder has never been shown as such a gentle passing as in this film, and the title role is played by a totally unknown actor who brings no baggage and conveys no emotion. The superb Alan Wickman is believable and unrecognizable in the role of one of the victim's father. As a redhead, I'm scared. The film misses questions...why is the murderer scared with orange? Why does he return to Paris? It should be in contention for an Oscar in set decoration and make-up. I want to see the actor in any other role. The girls are true English beauties.

160,morphion2,"Unique And Inventive, If A Little Unclear",8,28 January 2007,"I saw an advanced screening of ""Perfume"" at a local revamped theatre with Christmas vouchers. When I told my parents of my plans before leaving they, having read the book, gave me a look which read ""Good Luck"". Around three minutes in, I concluded that I probably needed it. My main mistake in retrospect was, I think, that I chose to interpret the deliberate stark contrast between the film's title (Perfume) and subtitle (The Story Of A Murderer) as tacky. In truth, it's more or less the entire film in a nutshell: a promise of beauty facilitating hideous dark action, and this realization could have saved me some bewilderment and, I won't lie, horror. It also could have brought my appreciation of the film forth a lot sooner.Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is a gutter birth in 1600's Paris and he is raised by a rather indifferent orphanage until he is turned over to a brutal tannery owner. He is also one of the most extraordinarily gifted ""personages of his time"", narrator John Hurt informs us. His gift is unique, and is more or less the fuel for the existential fire that burns, almost without much thought as to whether the audience quite understands, throughout the film: he has an unfathomably strong and accurate sense of smell. To give you an idea, this guy can smell underwater, through glass and over twenty or so miles. He can also instinctivey recreate any perfume he smells, even in trace amounts.This gift of his draws him to work in the perfume shop of Has-Been perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), but when he catches a whiff of a beautiful red haired girl selling plums on the streets, the film's true nature, and his defining obsession begins  he wants to learn to preserve the scent of beauty.I won't go into any more detail, suffice it to say what I'm sure you all know anyway, which is that this obsession of John-Baptiste's leads him singularly and irrevocably down a path of darkness and murder. It's a path on which the light that began it - the dream, if you will - soon becomes obscured to the audience until what we see is no more a 'gifted personage', nor a 'murderer', but a madman.And here ""Perfume"" joins the ranks of the all time great filmic portrayals of mad people  it declines to relate to them, it refuses to excuse them, but it offers something of an explanation, presents something in the way of their mindset so that we are put off just enough to wonder if there might ever have been hope for the lost cause we're watching. In this case, it's the amazing representation of smell  tracking shots across landscapes and through intimate spaces, a swelling and yearning string-based sound track and rather remarkable acting from Whishaw. These things all, for most part, manage to give the impression of a man who, although sociopathic, hasn't set out to cause harm, only to find cathartic relief. The film's grandiose treatment of the least film-friendly of the five senses creates a sort of awe in the audience that leaves us actually able to conceive of just what Scent means to John-Baptiste even if we're still not sure what it all really means in the grander sense.That's where the picture is a bit of a let-down and, incidentally, a lot like another of this year's ambitious art house attempts, ""Babel"". It's clear there's supposed to be an epic relevance to the whole thing, it's just not clear what it is. There are, as mentioned, fierce existential themes (highlighted by a scene in which Jean-Baptiste realizes he has no scent of his own and perceives it as an invalidation of his earthly existence). There's also surplus evidence to suggest we're seeing a study of dark human desire, necessity and obsessive nature. And, perhaps most confounding, unmistakable religious overtones (I doubt many will forget the 'execution' scene as long as they live) that may have, in a film less certain of itself, sought to excuse the actions of its protagonist. It does not seek to do this at all, however, and by the end most will be wondering what exactly was being sought all this time.Remember once again, as those of us who haven't read the book must, that it is indeed an adaptation and it becomes probable that ""Perfume"" seeks to do nothing more than interestingly, inventively and (I imagine) faithfully bring Patrick Süskind's novel to the screen, do disturbing justice to its dark central character and put us inside his perception of the world. Say what you will, you probably won't see a film this unique again anytime soon. What on Earth Süskind was thinking, or what he was trying to say is, I think, quite another matter.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

162,okami_ito,Smells like boredom,1,11 September 2006,"What can you say about a movie where 90% of the story is told by a narrator? Yes, not only the introduction, not only the epilogue; the whole movie you get everything told. From the feelings of it's protagonists to their psychological development. It's almost like a perverse kind of children's book. In some scenes Wishaw shows his feelings by acting but you get them told anyway ( and of course why he feels that way!). I know I'm repeating myself, but so does the narrator. The result is unbelievable boredom.Another problem is Tykwers ""style"" which is basically that of an ambitious film student. In every scene he tries something different to impress, but always fails. With his pompous efforts and sets he manages to make ""The Perfume"" look like a never ending commercial from the early 90's. This movie is such a mess, that the question if it is a good adaptation is pointless. But if it's of any interest: the scriptwriters have painstakingly included everything from the novel, it just doesn't make any sense anymore, because in Tykwers heavy hands it turns out to be just another serial-killer-movie. Only this time with costumes. If you frequently go to the movies, avoid this one. It doesn't deliver.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
163,TMokko,"Good film, but nothing brilliant",6,3 September 2007,"I have heard so much hype about Perfume that when I saw it I was expecting to be blown away by the brilliance of this movie... Guess what... I wasn't. (SPOILER WARNING!) Perfume's idea is very unique and the first hour of the film is interesting. The birth of the Grenouille and whole premise of the film brings in mind style in literature which is called magical realism (mainly style of Latin-American writer Gabriel García Márquez). This film is not a logicaly constructed thriller which represents a psychological portrait of a serial killer (like Henry) - if you are expecting that you will be disappointed like I was. Execution scene which ends up in a mass orgy is just totally goofy. It's a nice idea to invent a scent which would stimulate both sexes - but regrettably impossible. Perfume made of dead female's sweat and slag can't arouse sexual drive of women (and probably not even men). I'm not going to waste my time explaining why (because if you don't already know you can find out by yourself from a basic biology book). Other thing in this film was that the main character wasn't sympathetic in any way. Well written story can make audience like even killers and I think that realizing the good and the bad in a character makes film experience more fulfilling. Grenouille was just strange and lucky fool with special talent.Well anyway. I am not saying this film isn't good, but when you watch it you should be in a mood for a magical realism... at least...",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
164,marlyly,"Brilliantly Made, Even If The Story Isn't Exactly What You'd Call Ordinary",8,4 October 2008,"My first reaction upon finishing this film was 'What the hell, who on earth comes up with these things'. After all, this film has to be one of the most bizarre things I have ever witnessed in my life. The life story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a poor, awkward, quite and very strange orphan with a highly sensitive sense of smell, who becomes obsessed with the smell of a young lady he accidentally killed and spends the rest of his short life trying to re-create it, by killing various other beautiful women to try and capture their smell in a perfume. Told you it was weird, didn't I? I'd never read the book this film was based on so wasn't sure what to expect, but regardless I had no problem following the story or knowing what was going on. I loved the feel of this film, set in the past in France it felt so authentic you could almost believe that filming had really taken place in such an environment - the costumes and sets were incredibly genuine. The acting as well cannot be faulted - Ben Wishaw does an astounding job portraying Jean-Baptiste (but then again Wishaw has always been excellent in anything I've seen him in) - you do not for a moment doubt that Jean-Baptiste is a real person, never for a second think he is simply an actor playing the part - and considering the role I doubt that was a very easy job. Alan Rickman too does a fantastic job as Richis, in fact, there is not a single performance I can fault.I'm not sure why this film has had so many poor reviews - possibly because the actual plot is so strange and dark, but I personally thought it was brilliant, and will be buying the DVD as soon as I have the money.

166,drnrg31,Beauty & Murder= the right combination,9,16 April 2007,"Firt of all...Hollywood eat your heart out. America could never or would never make this movie. It goes against all their beliefs for a block buster. 1. The murderer is never ultimately punished for his crimes. Americans would never have that, because they get off on being the punisher's of criminals. Their Bad guy must always die in the end. 2. The hint of Cannibalism. Oh Lawd, we can't have that. 3. The ""orgy"" sequence. Right away dismissed as pornography 4. No explosions, cars or Tom Cruise.Now that we have gotten rid of all the ""Squares"" I can finally write about one of the most entertaining and captivating movies of the year with one of the most original ideas to come about in a long time.The movie ; is of course, an adaptation of the novel by Patrick Suskind(An excellent read) that is brought to life by Tom Tykwer in the best way this novel can be. Since it compels us to use our imaginary skills as much as our visual ones, those who have read the novel will actually appreciate it more. At times it has a beautiful Fairy Tale feel to it with it's perfect imagery of it's time line( the costumes and environment of ""old Europe"" look great) , but at other times that same feeling turns into a Haunting and Grimm atmosphere(the murder sequences especially). The story revolves around Jean-Baptist Grenouille, who was born with no smell of his own, yet he has the olfactory senses 100x better than an animal . This, the movie captures excellently with it's mesmerizing visuals and the part is skillfully played by Ben Wishaw, who at times can seem totally absorbed in all the different scents he experiences, but by the same token seems almost emotionless when committing the grizzly murders of the young woman. Grenouille becomes obsessed with capturing the essence of an Aroma. Particulalry the aroma of LOVE itself. In his quest he comes across the Parfumist, Giuseppi Baldini, who is brilliantly played by Dustin Hoffman and who adds comic relief to the film. Hoffman becomes Grenouille's mentor and shows him the secrets of creating the perfect essence. This segment is one of the most memorable of the film, because it shows the talent that Grenouille actually possesses and how; if he would have chose, could have became one of Europe's top perfumists. As the film progresses, we witness Jean-Baptitst's obsession with scents, slowly turn him into a disturbed, almost maniacal person as he begins to murder woman, in order to fulfill this obsession of capturing the aroma of LOVE.This is pretty much the first half of the movie. The second half contains the the ""Shock"" factor many Americans would most definitely shy away from and must be seen to believe. Now I would hate to spoil the ending, but I will tell you to first read the novel and judge for yourself if this movie succeeds in bringing to life Suskind's imagery of the story. I think It did an almost close to perfect adaption with it's portrayal of characters, scenery, costumes and even tastefully deals with the ""Serial Killer"" factor.A real inspiring film for other directors who might want to give life to novels on the big screen....and a real eye opener for Hollwood on how to make a successful film without going over the top.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
167,smccar77,A wonderful story only partially told,6,7 February 2011,"""Perfume"" is an ambitious tale in regards to film. In essence, the story is about the life of a serial murderer who finds motivation from his superhuman sense of smell and aesthetics. Over the course of two and a half hours, the audience is exposed to how an ultra heightened olfactory sense can lead to horrible crimes. In addition, the film also hints at the possibility of creating a scent which embodies an emotion; specifically, the main character seems to be after the scent of the platonic form of love. While the film is admirable for taking on some interesting philosophical ideas and a unique story, the film also suffers from a lack of ability to visually realize these goals.The merits of this film are found in its production values. As a whole, the set design, costumes, music, and cinematography are excellent. The director and crew clearly lavished time and effort in creating the ambiance of the scenes and overall mood of the film. In addition to this, the film does attempt a truly unique and engrossing story. Exploring an antique tale of superhuman serial murder is bound to attract the interests of a great many people. However, the pieces needed to fully expound this fascinating idea are lacking in the film.The first major problem is that the audience is asked to relate to and empathize with a person who has the unique ability to smell everything. The main character is able to distinguish every scent of the world. Scent detection is a near universal in the human animal, yet, relating to a superhuman ability is not. The audience is exposed to a great many scenes of the main character sniffing, sighing, and rolling his eyes back. The cues are present but one is never really able to understand what these scents mean to the character. As a whole, it is unfulfilling when the audience can only understand the gross abilities of this superhuman.As the film progresses, we are both shown and told that scents translate into emotion. Not only do they translate, the scents are able to cause abnormal and atypical behavior. To be fair, this is a work of fiction and certain amount of leeway should be given. However, it is more than a short stretch to have an audience believe that the harvested scents of murdered women, when mixed properly, become the platonic essence of love. The reliance on this device for a denouement causes the story and film to lose a great deal of credibility. In fact, the final scenes of the movie come off as a very unfulfilling, especially after viewing the two hours of story that set them up.The only other faults worthy of mention are the main character, the acting, and a particular plot device. The main character is a serial murderer. That one feels sympathy for him and even hopes he achieves his goal is odd. The goal of the film seems to be to examine how aesthetics can lead to great horror. The sympathy for the murderer leads an audience to not focus on the films goal but rather on their own moral ambiguities. As to acting, both Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman turn in lackluster performances. These character actors are known for some wonderful works that add nuanced and believable aspects to films. Unfortunately, neither accomplishes such a performance here. Lastly, the lead up to the denouement relies on a boring use of deus ex machina. One would expect a slightly more clever way for a killer to be caught than a dog smelling his victims. The use of this weak device advanced the plot but also acted as one of the single biggest let downs to the audience.Overall this is a fun idea for a story and film. However, this attempt to present the idea visually found itself lacking and generally a bit dull.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It is magic, it is exciting and it is about a man, who is obsessed by something - the kingdom of odors.When i watched the movie, i lived in one of the dirty streets of old Paris and could see Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw plays him driven, cold and with enough warmth at the right moments) as a baby and growing up. I could see how the lack of love and education and the wrong environment could form a human being. I could see and feel his hunger for live. And when i looked into his eyes i saw his insanity - and his loneliness. In the whole movie is so little love and at the same time so much love.And there is something between the lines, between old Paris, the people, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, the murdered women and the moviegoer of today: Isn't each of us looking for the perfect relationship, the perfect song, a perfect picture...the perfect perfume, perfect love?

169,youaresquishy,"Symbols and metaphors abound, but in the end, this stinks",2,30 August 2007,"For some reason, just about every film with good big-budget production values that contains symbolism and metaphors seems to get a lot of good reviews here at IMDb, and I am starting to suspect that at least some of these reviews have been authored by folks that feel that symbolism and metaphor mixed with good big-budget production values automatically make a movie good. I suspect that it somehow makes people feel good about themselves when they understand a metaphor--makes them feel smarter perhaps--and so they give good reviews to the movie that is responsible for those feelings.The film is mostly pretty to look at, which is why I didn't give it a 1. But that's all I can say for it.It's pretty boring. And it's nearly 2.5 hours long. I don't know about you, but the only films I want to spend 2.5 hours seeing are ones that are very interesting and not boring.It's got a couple of those clichéd plot-thickening devices Hollywood continually uses in its big dramas and action films that automatically, at least in my book, disqualify films from being good ones. These parts of the film ought to have most cinephiles groaning.The star of the film Ben Whishaw does not give a particularly good performance, although, to be fair, with a boring character such as this who does not talk much, it's got to be tough.The story is dominated by metaphor and, in the end, makes no sense whatsoever on a literal level. It's fine to use symbolism and metaphors in your films, but, in my view, most good films that involve symbolism also make sense on a literal level and can be enjoyed without thinking at all about any of their symbolic aspects. But if one were to view this film without an understanding of the concept of symbolism, it would be completely ridiculous.Now, the above is not true for novels. The book seems to garner near-universal praise, and I don't doubt it is worthy of that. But, what happens often with stories like these is that all the symbolism that works well in the book is just silly when translated to the screen, and that's exactly what must have happened here.In the end, the film version of that allegorical novel is just silly, and, unless you are the sort that thinks that any movie with good production values and some metaphors is a good one, you will probably not really enjoy this one. I am absolutely shocked that there are so many good reviews of this film here at IMDb.I think it's insane to give a film a good review but to suggest that one need read the book version first, as some have done with regard to this film--if it isn't good unless you have read the book first, in my view, that just means it's not a good film.There are good metaphorical movies and bad metaphorical movies, and this is a bad one.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

And experience it he does.Some say that the book this movie is based on is even better. I don't know, I only just found out there was a book. The movie is a masterpiece on its own.

I wasn't squeamish about the bodies, though I did start wondering about the folks involved with the shooting, but it seemed to me that it was also related to the concept that the genius can break all of the rules and somehow that is excusable. The Producer says that the film is supposed to be amoral, that is without a moral compass. So in the end the overwhelming shared erotic experience somehow excuses the 13 plus girls who had to die to make this divine scent, in other words the film really winks at human sacrifice, implying that when it comes to our sexual desires nothing is more important. (This interpretation is underscored by Alan Rickman's character asking for forgiveness.) I know the whole thing is a fable, yet it certainly does have a moral bearing: The truly gifted person is not understood and is thus excused for treating their fellow human beings execrably, if they can produce something miraculous. I would have accepted the orgy scene if they had gone all the way and ripped each other to shreds or done what ""his people"" do at the end, rip him to shreds and eat him.

Sadly story and characters were shallow and superficial.It's like the screenplay was written by a typically shallow and emotionless psychopath. There is no human interest-value here, no depth, no evolution - just a sick boy running around killing women.So, why would I then care about the sick boy or his victims? Because lack of depth was compensated with dozens of gruesome little details, shocking points. ""...And soon after Jean-Baptiste left the other guy just died."" Oh wow... only thing is that these little diabolic occurrances will start to bore you after a while.

179,r_ende,A good movie!,8,8 October 2006,"Perfume- The Story of a Murderer is a really good movie. The actors are convincing, also Ben Whishaw whom I did not know before. It is the story about a man,Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, who kills women because he wants to gather their smells in order to mixture a perfume. He does not have a bad conscience by killing the women because he is only focused on their smells. When he has killed about a dozen women his mixture is ready but he is capped and should be killed in a very painful way... Although I did not read the book I think that the story is really convincing and that it is a really good movie which is never boring. Especially the end which is very strange makes you thinking about the author's intention.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
180,f. baez,I smell peroxide,6,6 March 2007,"Granted, trying to film a novel based on the sense of smell is a compelling challenge: cinematography, sound and editing must be good enough substitutes, just as words were in Süskind's work. We must praise the filmmaker's courage. Tykwer's effort is generally true to the story, sometimes lavish, sometimes horrid, but fails in its main attempt. It wants to be detached, like the novel, but ends up being too well photographed, too cold. The original capacity to evoke aromas using sight and sound, dwindles into a melodrama with pretty cinematography. Irony is lost. At one moment, the main character smells his victim who is running away in a horseback. The camera asks us to go through the forests in search of her scent. There she is, with her perfectly bright red hair. Suddenly, I smell peroxide. Oh, and it was the essence of innocence, not the essence of beauty, what Granuille was looking for.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
181,murray-morison,Enigmatic brilliance - an unexpected delight,8,1 January 2008,"The setting of this dark parable is the eve of the French Revolution. A child is born, unwanted and unloved. He has one extraordinary ability - the capacity to know the world through the sense of smell. In this, he is like the idiot savants with one skill taken to an extreme. But this youngster is no idiot; just dominated by this one sense beyond all others. The story unfolds as an upside down fairy-tale, dark, humorous, lyrical - exploring what would happen when someone pursues beauty in one form with no knowledge of or sensitivity to goodness. Tom Tykwer has captured what must be a stunning book by using his cinematographic skills to the optimum. In this he is more than aided by the powerful physical presence of the actor Ben Wishaw as the central character. The use of music, sound and muted colour, and the settings chosen (apparently) in Barcelona, conjure up a world that becomes more and more convincing as the film unfolds. The story appears to be heading for an entirely expected ending but even here the suspense never lets up. Alan Rickman as the father desperately trying to protect that which he most loves, is ... well, Alan Rickman, always a delight to watch and always convincing. Look out for Dustin Hoffman, for it is indeed him playing a cameo as a failing creator of perfumes. A film that deals with darkness but in a way that is strangely uplifting.

It was beautifully filmed, the cinematographer, costume-designers, set-designers all captured the background of this film. It was like a Bosch painting.The acting was strong (the British accents were a bit strange, since it was sent in France.) Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman stole each scene they were in and made you believe. Ben Whishaw in certain angles, invoked the memory of Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho."" He was the total focus and was ably controlled. It felt like he was an ""autistic/asberger's"" person in a society that couldn't understand obsessive/compulsive/brain-disorders. His sociopathic behaviors hinted at the future ""Jack the Ripper"" mentalities. The ending seemed ""tacked-on"" however, perhaps it was added due to not wanting to encourage the deranged from following after the character's bent.

183,crooked_spoons,Highs & Lows With Untimately...no payoff.,4,29 December 2009,"What can I say? Where do I begin? Well, for starters, this has got to be one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time. The cinematography is amazing, the score is fitting, and the realistic depiction of the ""dark side of Paris"" is stunning and visually flawless. And that's about it.I went into this movie a virgin, totally naïve of the plot, characters; setting etcI hadn't even seen so much as a trailer or a poster. That being said, I had no preconceived notions of what ""Perfume"" was supposed to be about so I wasn't disappointed or ""let down"" because I was expecting something else. I expected nothing; sadly, this film gave me even less.The main character is as sympathetic as a dead house fly and the personality of a wet blanket. He floats through life with this ""gift"", this *urge* he only on rare occasions is allowed to satiate. He is uneducated and knows very little about life outside the workhouse/orphanage or leather tannery which he's grown up. He seems naïve, he IS naïve, he has a wide-eyed, boyish charm about him. From his birth, he was treated like trash, bio-waste unworthy of affection and only of use if he can fetch a good price. He's beaten and broken and yet, he never argues or complains. Instantly, you want to love him.But thenhe sees a woman—or rather, he *smells* a woman. Then, he kills a woman—though it is by accident, an accident which one feels a deep sadness because you just know he feels horrible about. You're suddenly reminded of Lenny in Of Mice and Men, poor stupid Lenny. He just wanted to pet her. Boy do you feel sorry for himfor about two seconds. And then, he rips open his victims bodice and proceeds to expose her breasts so he can better smell her fully. Because that's his thingscents. She had a scent and he wanted to remember it.And then, he goes to the small Persian village of ""Grasse"". He kills a prostitute to capture her scenthe kills another, and then another, a pair of sisters, and about seven others, then another and it goes on and on and ON, capturing their unique scents by killing them, making a paste of animal fat and cutting their hair, then finally dumping them wherever he pleases. The boy who was once naïve and wide-eyed is now this cunning, serial killing, beast with a god complex who's somehow able to concoct the perfect fragrance to make people love him.It is at this point, after an hour and twenty minutes of slow pacing and uninteresting dialogue the story picks up. The string of dead, pretty young virgins piling up and the ever increasing death tolls rising the ensuing panic had me on the edge of my seat. Then he begins ""the chase""—the pursuit of his ""Holy Grail"" shall we say, prettiest, youngest virgin in the town. A beautiful redhead named Laura, whose scent/essence will complete his ""collection"". And thenhe kills her, in the most anticlimactic way a character has been killed since Llewellyn Moss in No Country For Old Men.By the second kill, you realize, he's not this sympathetic young boy, he's a cold blooded, disgusting monster, with not a single redeeming quality. And yes, that's pretty much it. All that sympathy you had was wasted because in the end, he was a vile, odious creature.The book may have been good, hell, it may have even been great, but what this movie translated into was a horrendously steaming pile, which should have been left on paper. The only sympathetic person in this whole film was Alan Rickmannot his character, just him—because I honestly wondered if times were so rough for him that he'd been reduced to doing such utter garbage. I wonder does he gamble a lot? I could loan you some money Alanall you had to do was ask.A complex serial killer is always a fascinating tale (or so I thought) but honestlyit's really better if we left things up to Dexter.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
184,vghb95a,A Serial Killer's Wet Dream,4,18 August 2007,"The story of Perfume played out like a dark Brothers Grimm fable. The story unfolds as our killer Jean-Baptiste Grenouille's early existence consisting of endless cruelties inflicted to him by others, which in his later years changed him into some sorts of super-killer in the same light as Hannibal Lecter. Grenouille shares the same traits as other serial killers, the lack of sympathy/empathy with the victims, killing and experimenting with victims' dead bodies, and collecting of items from the victims to re-live the experience, in this case, Grenouille collecting the scents from his victims. The character of Grenouille is tall, dark, smart, and handsome. What makes Grenouille really stood out is the fact that he is some sort of serial killer's version of idiot savant. His keen sense of smell was able to lead him to create great perfumes but also lead him to his victims. Grenouille is able to move freely amongst people without fear of being capture to carry out his twisted goal of making a perfect perfume.Although, this movie is photographed beautifully and the production value is better than the other films that came out of Europe in recent years, and the story itself has a moral point of a goal that is archived by ill means is a goal not worth to have, this film also has a big problem of getting the audience to root for the protagonist of this movie, thus a feeling of disconnect from the movie itself. The movie's finality seems to be out of some bad 1960's psychedelic, orgy movie.In the end, Grenouille as a serial killer, get to have all a serial killer ever wanted, power, fame, desire, and most of all, the control to which he can choose his ending, now that's wet dream for a serial killer or what.P.S.

185,vampirock_x,the most twisted and grande journey to humanity!,10,5 May 2007,"First, I never read the novel, thus approached this film from nothingness. Though I was bewildered by sharply different comments from friends around, I reset my mind and gave it a try --- after all, it's Tom Tykwer, whose ""Heaven"" is my all-time favorite.Grenouille, who was born and raised in such chaotic and inhuman time and place but bestowed with a miraculous sense of smell, is one of the most tragic characters I've ever known. From the very beginning of this film, I got myself identified with him and was dragged deeper and deeper into this lost cause. Already offended by Grenouille's undesirable childhood, I found myself no longer so as the murders unfolded, instead, it was more and more bitterness and desperation for a world like that.It's just as tragic for all the dead girls as for him who explore everything by the dominating means of smell but cannot smell his own existence. We depend on sights and sounds, and we have cameras and recorders, by which it's very easy to understand why he went great length to try to capture smell. For him, it's the only way to record his knowledge and memories, especially the most precious ones. As for the loquat girl who triggered his pursuit, she symbolize both the motherhood and love which Grenouille desire but extremely lack.*spoiler*Many people feel good until the ending where he avoided the death penalty and sent all people present into a big love-making party with his ultimate perfume. However, that's when I was completely lifted by the film and felt the ultimate humanity the writer and filmmaker tried to express. Yes, that's love and humanity I felt rather than sex orgy. You can see from the very start when the people shouted to kill Grenouille their own ways that they have nothing left inside except hatred and desperation covered by a dark, damp, clouded world. It was almost worthy to me at the time to pay those girls' lives for people's inner freedom to feel peace and love. And Grenouille, standing above the ground in the center, was almost like a god who crucified his own existence and all his human desires for them. It turned out Grenouille was the only one who could not love and be loved and doomed to be an outcast. And then he disappeared where he was born, after leaving the remaining perfume and his hollow body to the wretched.Once again, Tom showed his talent of intense story-telling and rhythmic shooting in this title. With his own participation, the score, alternate between strings and chants, perfectly illuminated the cruelty and sublime. As for the well-performing cast in all, I personally think Ben Whishaw did a very great job to portray this smell-obsessed young man, who is sensitive and indifferent at the same time. Some say it's not as cruel and raw as the novel, which is just enough to prepare ourselves for the final grander in my opinion.This is the ultimate concern for humanity in disguise of a heart-breaking contrast, metaphor and irony. Highly recommend it to all who are obsessed with the 19th-century-around Europe and ready for a great cinematic experience! As for those who don't like it, they may try a second time with a more open heart and readiness to feel deeper.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
186,bithok,"Too ""clean""",6,2 October 2006,"On the one hand, it's really well played and there are loads of beautiful pictures. On the other hand, I'd tell here the same thing as about ""Gangs of New York"": It is far too clean. They want us to feel the dirt of Grenouille's life but it's as authentic as a stone-washed 501... Too clean: There's a big difference between a nice Clearasil'ed skin covered with brown makeup and an ugly skin. The difference lays in the way the character will watch at his surrounding universe: The ""Authentic"" will have some suffering as well as some resignation, the other, the Hollywood-esquire will just look like a liar. I also hated the special effects, with the huge synthesizer-chords each time something smelly happens. There was also too much political correctness in the sex party scene, at the end: We don't get to see any penis (not that I was looking for, anyway) and the few homosexual intercourses only imply women which is quite a pity, in 2006... Be realistic, and, at least, suggest that it could happen too when a hundred of fellow subitely lose their inhibitions and jump on one another. So, well, we're in the middle of something excellent and overrated. I'll be indulgent and rate it at about 6.3/10.

188,VoiceOfEurope,A quest for purity through the filthiest bowels of hell,7,17 May 2007,"Tom Tykwer did not have to prove anything. He had already established himself as one of the greatest directors and innovative thinkers of 21st century cine-art. His first significant piece, Winter Sleepers had found its way to the heart of many a gourmet film buffs while his second feature film, the rapid-paced, multi-genre Run Lola Run had drawn curious attention to his highly-potent creativity and visual intelligence. And very deservedly so. With Perfume, Story of a Murderer he entered a new realm, that of the adaptation of acclaimed literary works. Formerly a writer-director, Tykwer had to find reasonable compromises between his own impulses and the guidelines of the original piece's author. He totally disposed of the genuine and unusual camera angles, the non-linear story-telling and clip-like editing that had become his trademark and abode the rules of more conventional movie making. His images though seem more sophisticated, more detailed than as in an average costume flick while he gives a sarcastic twist to his characters by trivializing their behavior. His take on 18th century France is very grim, we never have seen so sordid an Orleans and Paris in movie history as we see in Perfume. I very much like the naturalistic rendering of the era, which is closer than ever to what reality once could have been. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is filthy, ugly and has crooked teeth as everybody else in a pest-ridden post-medieval Europe except his virgin victims from whom he extracts the ultimate scent of Paradise. Parfume is both very realistic and very fable-like. This contradiction is very well reconciled and creates a truly unique and long-lasting cinematic experience.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The ""no return"" turning point of the movie happens when Jean-Baptiste Grenouille attracted by a fine smell, follows a young girl and inadvertently kills her.

190,mrmatt14,I'm seriously conflicted here,9,3 January 2007,"I can't remember the last time I was this conflicted about a movie.On the one hand, it was a maddeningly bad film. Everything was wrong with it. It was trite, cliché, tacky, and overzealous.The whole plot can be picked up by the trailer -- an orphan boy (Jean-Baptiste) with no scent of his own but with an unequaled sense of smell grows up to learn the perfumerie trade and seeks to kill women to capture their beautiful scent in the best perfume ever made.Before trying to digest the film, you have to just suspend disbelief and accept the plot (no small feat, to be sure.) Once you get past that, you have to work past a few spectacularly bad performances (*cough*Hoffman*cough*) and just accept that EVERY character is a stereotype. There are no real characters here, anywhere. So once you get past that (still hanging in there?) you have to suspend all thought until the end of the movie, then try to digest the whole thing all at once (please note the 147 minute running time.) Then comes the real kicker. There's just something about the movie that comes through that's hauntingly beautiful. At first I wasn't quite sure what it was. Then the layers started peeling back.***SPOILERS BEGIN*** There's a long-ish and somewhat deliberate monologue about the 12 scents that make up a perfume. Three sets of four scents make up each of three ""notes."" The ""top notes"" are the sharp scents that first catch your attention. The ""heart notes"" come in as the first impression starts to dissipate and carry it for a while. Finally, the ""base notes"" come in as the top notes dissipate entirely and make up the lasting impression. Legend has it that in ancient Egypt, there was a perfume that used a 13th scent that rang through all the others, to create a truly unique and magnificent perfume.When looked at as a whole, the movie follows the same structure. The top notes are an unmistakable romp through an 18th century fish market. The heart notes start to build sympathy for young Jean-Baptiste. And the base notes come in as the story starts to turn dark and truly bizarre.Then, as a post-script, Jean-Baptiste is eaten by a horde of people in the fish market where he was born. An odd 13th scent to leave on, but it's what made the start to movie click. There's just something there that I couldn't quite put my finger on.I wanted to watch it again, to study it, and to understand the movie's structure and motives. Despite being a not-entirely pleasant watch, but it's fascinating.And that's when the final scene made sense. The people in the market didn't understand what was happening, so they had to take it apart, and consume it, even though doing so killed the person with such an amazing gift. To go back and take apart the movie and reduce it to a couple of plot lines and character arcs -- to ""decode"" it's individual scents -- would be to destroy it.So is this a parable about the importance of appreciating beauty for it's own good? Is the ""real"" 13th scent of this movie it's ability to adopt it's own metaphor as it's primary structure? Has the movie transcended it's own plot and all it's faults to create a perfectly crafted impression on the viewer? All of a sudden, is this really such a bad movie after all? And the question that really sticks in my craw -- does all that make this one of the most brilliant films ever made? If I ever get the opportunity to meet Tom Twyker, I'm going to shake his hand, then hug him, then punch him. I think that's the only proper way to react to Perfume. I honestly don't know how else to react.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

193,Systematicer,Splendid,8,24 September 2006,"I was very skeptical when I heard and saw the first things about this novel adaptation. The accusations of it being too lurid or too far off from the original novel didn't come true and the trailers don't really do it justice. But in the end it is the final product that matters and not the things surrounding it. Not even the novel it's based on, because a film always has to stand on its own.Now the film actually is pretty faithful. It leaves out a lot but it doesn't add on anything that would turn it into something else. And the story still makes sense. Granted, the alleged pubescent girls are too old and the main character is too handsome. Even though it's supposed to take place in 18th-century France, it is as if it is taking place in its own world. Now I couldn't tell how close to reality the behavior of the people and the single facts are, but the reality as shown in this film is wild, filthy, nauseous and of low morale. Especially the working-class is gruesome. But it adds effectively to the story and even more to the excitement.The story is told quite poetically with a lot of strings and choirs which gives it a tense and partly even epic atmosphere without being obtrusive. Half the time the main character Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is on screen we see him sniffing, which takes us into a different world where scents are the most important sensations.The fact that it is an European production hardly shows. While almost always visible for me in other European films it doesn't show much here because of its tense atmosphere and great lightning. Overall it is more stylized, which I, most of the time, prefer.I often read people say the omnipresent narration is annoying because it just describes what we can see anyway. And I can understand the criticism. My biggest point of critique would be that the narration maybe seemed a little impersonal because the narrator didn't have a connection to the actual story. It was just a voice telling us a story. But overall I don't agree with it being unnecessary or annoying. The main character himself barely talks and so I'm not sure everything would have been perfectly clear to everybody without the narration. Especially in the beginning of the film the narration is very present. It gives us a sense of how this world is working and what the situation is. It is quasi replacing the internal monologue that is often used as a narration in other films. I guess this is to create more distance to the main character, to mystify the figure. But the narration actually disappears completely after a while into the film, when other characters become more present, only to return for the final minutes. So the narration isn't even that omnipresent and has its justification, I think.All in all the film is made in a way it should be very mass appealing. Sometimes I wished it would have been a little more explicit and gory so it would be more repugnant to people (especially the ending), but in a mass appealing film this is luxury. It was also gruesome and effective enough without it, so I won't complain. I can't say it captured ALL the essence of the original novel but it's more important that the film doesn't feel soulless and since it is well-structured (dramaturgic & story-wise), it works for me very well.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

195,robertrutledge,"Unpredictable, Unsettling, and Delightfully Dark",8,4 October 2021,"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a captivating period-piece horror/thriller epic set in 18th-century France. It revolves around Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (played by Ben Whishaw), a young man with a curiously strong sense of smell which ends up being his downfall. Scents are the only thing he cares about in life. The man develops an unhealthy obsession for ""capturing"" the scents of young women, which he acquires by killing them and covering their bodies and hair in animal fat which he then scrapes off and distills. His goal is to make the perfect perfume made entirely out of the scents of virgins that he has killed.In addition to the exquisite cinematography evoking different scents (both good and bad), what makes this movie shine is its unpredictability. Director Tom Tyker does a fantastic job at throwing curveballs that will keep you on the edge of your seat. He also does a great job at musically contrasting loud scenes with quiet scenes. The occasional third-person narration helps us dive into the psyche of the protagonist and moves the story along.Jean-Baptiste makes for a fascinating ""villain protagonist"" and psychological case study. As an orphan who has never experienced love, he evokes a sense of sympathy in the viewer, despite the murders he commits. He becomes fixated on his sense of smell, so much so that it completely clouds over a moral compass he never had in the first place. He could be judged as being selfish, but he just doesn't know any better.The setting and ""period piece"" elements of the movie are all very believable and realistic. In fact, this film as a whole is rather believable, save for Jean-Baptiste's extraordinary sense of smell. A minor complaint I have is that the characters talk in English as opposed to French. I'm assuming there were practical reasons for this, or maybe the film makers thought more people would watch it if it were in English than in French, but it makes it feel slightly unauthentic. It's kind of like when you watch Star Wars and somehow all the characters speak English.Overall, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a brilliant film. The concept itself is incredibly creative. The film doesn't fit nicely into any one genre. It could be considered a horror movie, but it avoids cliché excessive blood and gore as well as the notorious ""jump scares."" Perhaps it is better described as a thriller. By imagining what it would be like for our sense of smell to be amplified to that of a dog's, we can relate to the protagonist. In fact, smell is a much underappreciated and rarely conveyed element in movies in general, so it's intriguing watching a whole movie based upon such a vital part of day-to-day life and our ancestors' survival instincts.

Director Tom Tykwer not only succeeds but knocks it out of the park! I could almost smell what I was seeing, it was magic! All the actors are magnificent. Ben Whishaw is fantastic as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and should go far. Hoffman and Rickman are excellent too - there is not a single bad, or even average, performance. The music is haunting, the photography sublime and the script stays very close to the book, including the extraordinary final scenes that were as I imagined them and more.I only wish that the film was longer (and it's 140 minutes already, but they fly by). A total masterpiece. I was so excited by it that I watched it 3 times in a weekend, as I was playing it to all my mates! They all loved it, whether they read the book or not.

200,monk_e_fish,Smells a bit off,4,12 January 2007,"Much has been made of the notion that Patrick Suskind's mid-80s cult novel is ""unfilmable"", rather less has been said about whether it was worth filming at all. With leading directors including Ridley Scott having passed on the film, finding it too difficult to adapt the nasally focused novel into the visual medium of film, the job now falls to Run Lola Run director Tom Tykwer. Remarkably, Tykwer does succeed in conveying a strong sense of smell through the screen, simply by taking the novel's rich, varied and sumptuous smells and turning them to their visual equivalents. Although the constant close-ups on hero Jean-Baptiste Grenouille's nose to convey that he smells something is a little akin to an extreme ear close-up to tell us there is a sound we should hear. Aside from this mis-step, Tykwer's solution to the smell problem is excellent, using close-ups, enhanced sound, vivid colour and rapid cutting to get a sense of a great array of scent from the putrid fish market where Grenouille is born to the beautiful lavender fields of the Provencal town where they know everything there is to know about smell. The film is consistently visually arresting and manages one of the finest recreations of the 18th century there have been on screen, both the dirt, grime and disease of the poor, some great images of people with rotting teeth and bodies covered in pox and sores, and the elegance of the wealthy. However, all this is not to say that Perfume is in any way a good, or even particularly effective, picture. For while the backdrop may indeed be a feast for the senses, the plot that is superimposed onto it simply stinks, and herein lies the real flaw with adapting Suskind's novel. There is a ridiculousness that may just about pass on the page but on the screen seems ill judged. More than that, the film simply seems rather undercooked and under thought out, as if Tykwer and his team spent so long on the visuals as to entirely neglect the screenplay. Characters are ill defined and superficial giving strong actors like Alan Rickman little play with in a traditional father who is overprotective of his beautiful daughter role. Dustin Hoffman at least draws some comic charm from his over the hill perfumier (although the scene in which he first smells the perfume Grenouille has made for him and is transported to a beautiful orchard, complete with dusky woman, feels like a perfume ad in the worst possible way), however the young leads are distinctly emotionless, both looking the part until they open their mouth. Newcomer Ben Whishaw makes a creepy Grenouille when he lurks in the shadows but his naive voice quickly grates while Peter Pan's Rachel Hurd Wood as Rickman's daughter is so superficial as to be barely there. There is also a problem with a consistency of tone, Perfume is a film that doesn't quite know what it wants to be, The lack of character development would be less of a problem had Tykwer chosen to build a tense serial killer picture, Run Lola Run showing the director as capable with slick and tense productions, and there are certain scenes that could work like this, Grenouille lurking in a hedge maze or open windows that had been closed, but Tykwer fails to give them the right feel. Instead, the movie, from its subtitle ""The Story of a Murderer"" purports to be perhaps a character study but the character of Grenouille remains inscrutable, and, more significantly, in a way the audience don't really care about, right to the end. Meanwhile, the wry narration from John Hurt (pretty much a given for this kind of role, his voice-over attaching gravitas to Hellboy or a sly wit to Dogville and even given the job of making internet service providers deeply significant) and the manner in which all of Grenouille's employers or associates die as soon as he leaves them, suggest a vein of black comedy that the film does not really mine. In the end, however, the film could be forgiven these faults for a really well staged ending. Unfortunately, what we get is quite the opposite as the picture descends into a very literal orgy of silliness, any pretence at a serious drama undone by its ludicrous premise of a perfume so heavenly it bestows a godlike scent on the wearer making him virtually untouchable. This not only manages to be ridiculously bizarre but not funny, surreal sex but not beautiful, it also serves to complete undo the good work Tykwer has done earlier to establish a very real world of very real smells. Unfilmable? Probably should have remained so.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

202,pushnlacs,The Ending left me with split feelings.,7,4 August 2007,"I have wanted to see this ever since I happened to stumble Cross its trailer months and months ago.After finally seeing it I can say the first two hours or so were very good. The best part being the section with Hoffman. It was very interesting to watch them make perfumes.But when the final murder comes the film kind of falls apart. it had its flaws even before this, like the main character himself. We know that he knows killing is illegal and that he will get in trouble for it. But we don't go deep enough into his mind. We don't know if he finds killing to be wrong but just doesn't care or if he truly doesn't feel its wrong.(Spoilers here after)That can be over looked though, it the last murder as I said that kind of drags the film down. The way it happens is just ill conceived. A father knows the murderer is after is daughter so he takes he to a secluded place to stay and locks her in a room , keeping the key by his bed side.This is the problem, I know the leads sense of smell is great but he smells her miles upon miles away, then simply climbs over the main wall, sneak through a unlocked window right past the owners of the place, up the stairs past their sleeping dog and then smells the key in the fathers room. He then sneaks into the fathers room , gets the key, goes into the girls room, were she wakes to see him standing over her. Yet she doesn't scream, she just waits to be done in.Then there's the ending it self. He gets caught and is going to be executed and some how has managed to keep the perfume he made out of the essence of the women he killed. How did they not find it when he was captured? But anyhow instead of executing him, the all bow down to him and warship him because the smell is so amazing. So amazing in fact it causes the thousands of people in attendance to strip and have a big orgy, allowing the murder to escape.The last victims father even goes up to him with a sword saying ""you can't fool me"" only to then drop to his knees and beg forgiveness.Anyway he then goes back to the place he was born pours the whole bottle of his special perfume onto his head which causes the people around him to eat him, eat him ""out of love"".so anyway lets just say the ending is out there. So out there that it leaves me with split feeling about the film.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
203,Etoile,Passable but not outstanding.,7,9 December 2006,"I was surprised to find so many comments already on this movie; I didn't realize that it had been widely released in Europe before it was available in the U.S. I just saw a special screening as part of a perfume club event, and I was approaching this from the perspective of someone who had not read the book.The movie is pretty good, but that's all I can say about it. I felt no attachment to any of the characters, particularly any of the girls - it had no impact on me when they met their fates. I found Grenouille an utterly distasteful character, and not at all well-played; the actor did not seem to put any heart into the role, I didn't think he made it his own...he was wooden the whole time. Dustin Hoffman, on the other hand, was an excellent choice for his role.""Perfume"" is artistically decent. It was refreshing to see a well-crafted movie that was not a huge Hollywood blockbuster - from an American perspective, the film is somewhat edgy, but it was easy to look at...not a single scene was poorly designed.A word of caution for animal lovers: Avert your eyes during the scene where Grenouille discovers the smells of glass and copper cannot be distilled.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
204,lertad-1,Perfect Metaphor,8,28 September 2019,"It is ironic that I find it hard to put the movie into words, for the feature film should've had the same problem making a visual media about the sense of smell. And yet, 2 hours and 27 minutes later, I find myself sympathetic to a pathological murderer deluded in his quest to find his worth through emotionlessly taking the multiple lives of others to achieve his ultimate quest of creating the ultimate perfume using his extroardinary sense of smell, the only skill he's ever had in his dark, cursed life that was meant to be abandoned since the day he was born.In some ways, this is a work of art, visual eye candy that compensates the lack of smell with abundance of colors - or lack of it when appropriate. In other ways, it is a dark fairy tale in the form of the original Alice in Wonderlands with twisted story and characters that somehow entertain. And in some aspects, it is an allegory of religion and our search for happiness and love.Overall, it is in the end a satisfying movie experience; a film that leaves you a bit changed, planting something that will stick in your mind, reminding how everything is not always what they seem - or smell.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
205,bobgeorge1,heaven scent or a stinker?,6,13 July 2007,"Help me out. Who is the actor playing the Assistant to Dustin Hoffman's Baldini in this film Perfume: The story of a murderer? The official website doesn't hold his name and even the longer IMDb credits show his wife (Dora Romano) and yet we are introduced to Baldini through the efforts of his assistant. I think it is Russ Abbott. Russ Abbot who we all thought had given up acting and humour. Could it really be Russ?So, what's the story? Well, first the story of the story. The film is based on Patrick Süskind's best-selling novel and both Ridley Scott and Tim Burton failed to direct it; just as well as it is already too fruity and redolent in black humour. Set in eighteenth-century Paris the story begins with the plans for the execution of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille ( Ben Whishaw), a borderline autistic blessed with a super-human sense of smell. We then go back to follow his life and the development of his unique talent, Grenouille eventually discovers his calling when he becomes apprentice to master perfumier Baldini (Dustin Hoffman). it's always the fruit. After murdering an apricot seller, Grenouille becomes obsessed with capturing and preserving the scent of women. He leaves Baldini and heads for heaven-scent Grasse where he encounters Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman) and his stunning redheaded daughter (Rachel Hurd-Wood). It is here that Grenouille perfects away of capturing the scent of women and begins collecting the 12 women that will compose his ultimate scent... by paying with their lives. But will Richis be able to prevent his daughter becoming the final victim?Early on the superbly camping-it-up Hoffman (Baldini) tells Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Whishaw) how to make the perfect perfume. ""Each perfume has 3 chords, 12 notes in all. There is a head, a body and a base. The head is the first to be noticed; the body then comes to the fore and the base lingers after the others have gone"". Watching this my first thought was Chocolate but its nowhere as magical as that film. The obvious theme is ""Scent of a Woman"" but it does tell a bit more than that. And with the Hoffman connection and the autism of the Winshaw character one of course thinks of Rainman; but its much less enjoyable than that. There is however a long lasted impression from this film, visually its stunning; so rather odd to have a film about aroma that is so visual. But was it Russ Abbott I saw?",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
206,mcmiller53,Does anyone else see the symbolism of Jesus in this movie?,9,19 February 2014,"What an engrossing and haunting film. A definite must-see. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the cat.I'd just like to stop for a moment and see if I'm alone in, at times, feeling as if this was a symbolic, spiritual analogy to the life of Jesus Christ. 1. Baby Jean/Jesus was never meant to survive, but does, in the dirt and lowest of surroundings. 2. Jean becomes a tradesman (leather works vs carpentry) without tiring. 3. He is perceived as 'different' and scares some - is a loner/misunderstood. 4. Hoffman's character, the current, albeit tired, but known master of perfume, served much as John the Baptist did in Jesus' life by being the well-known forerunner. John the Baptist/Hoffman are awakened to Jean's gift in amazement. 5. There are 12 people who each provide a piece of one 'essence', just as the disciples did. 6. Jean is brought before the head of the church and leaders to be 'crucified' 7. Once the people and executioner see that this is an 'innocent man', a rapture ensues, i.e., the Roman understanding this was indeed the son of God and the world goes mad. 8. Once Jean has accomplished his mission but finds no more reward on this planet, he succumbs to death and his clothes are torn and grabbed, but the drop of perfume at the end is the symbol that Jean/Jesus' presence still exists.

207,ForVirg,You don't have to be artsy or European to like this,9,16 September 2012,"I must first admit I have not read the book. I also must admit I'm not European and I do take offense at the rampant accusation that all Americans will hate this movie. But, and this is important to other Americans, I don't like it for the reasons the Europeans who think all ""Yanks"" will hate it, seem to believe I should like it.As a part-professional/part-amateur student of the biology of brain as it relates to emotional experiences, I found this movie fascinating, and the ending quite interesting.Personally, I think all the esoteric rhetoric on here about the ""deeper meaning"" of everything in this movie is, to put it bluntly, crap. The fact of the matter is that we humans are very much swayed by our sense of smell. Who here doesn't know the experience of a smell sending us, unbidden, back to a childhood memory? What I gleaned from this movie was how powerful our ""normal"" sense of smell, the lack thereof, and the wish to have it, can truly be. To me, the final scenes were brilliant--a commentary on how humanity can be driven by what we believe to be love to extreme acts of brutality and violence. Was the crowd in the end so very different from Jean-Baptiste? I think not.But, again, this is just my personal opinion. I loathe artsy ""deep thought"" and I equally loathe superficial repulsion. Maybe I'm in the minority. But if you enjoy thinking about the reality of human existence and how easily we are all swayed to misdeeds, then maybe you'll enjoy this film the way I did. I will certainly watch it again.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
208,Dave_Violence,Brilliant.,10,8 October 2007,"Mix Ratatouille with Frankenstein, take part of the ending from Stranger in a Strange Land......and you've got a great story worth telling. Of course, the story centers around a sociopathic mad scientist murderer - and that's the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters, no? Sure, but with the right production team and excellent casting, it's a triumph. The characters, especially Alan Rickman's, are played with intelligence - something that one just doesn't see much of these days. Rickman's portrayal of the father turned detective is the smartest character I've seen in years.What's truly impressive is that this is a HORROR movie, a rated-R one at that, about a serial murderer with virtually no gore. The nudity isn't gratuitous, tasteless or unnecessary. Nothing distracts from the story, the characters and the fascinating mood created by the lighting, irony, music and careful placement of John Hurt's narration.

209,notevenwordshere,The Ballad of the Scent of a Woman,10,7 August 2008,"Why did I love this movie? It has to rank as one of the creepiest, disgusting, and perverse movies I've ever seen. And the ending doesn't seem to redeem these qualities at all. So why did I love it?Perfume boasts a very accurate subtitle -- this truly is the story of a murderer, a man named Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (played in a charismatic style by Ben Whishaw) who has ""the best nose in Paris."" This remarkable gift of scent enables him to detect and identify smells from long distances, and it also enables him to name -- in exact measurements -- the ingredients of perfumes. This latter talent earns him an apprenticeship under Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a perfumer who teaches him how to preserve scent. This is all before he adopts the murderous persona to which the film's title alludes, and when he finally does, he is ruthless and without conscience, collecting the scent of virgins in order to create a perfect perfume. The ending is something odd, and perhaps silly, but upon reflection it is actually more frightening than it seems.The credit must go to Tom Tykwer for turning this into a visual feast -- the cinematography is as brilliant and vibrant as Amelie, and as darkly suggestive as a noir film. In fact, Perfume is rightly a fantasy, a dark (almost comic) tragedy told via smell. It even has a narrator (John Hurt). The acting is uniformly strong, and the atmosphere created is engrossing. You may not approve, you may not enjoy, but you will hardly be able to look away.But what is it about? When, after being caught, Grenouille is being tortured and interrogated by Antoine Richis (the always underrated Alan Rickman), he is asked about one particular woman he killed; more particularly, why he killed her. His response: ""I needed her.""In truth, Perfume should be understood as a work of imagination, to tell the story of a man who should not have survived his birth, who has no scent of his own, and who sought love by manipulation of smell. Grenouille might be the devil but for his realization and acceptance finally that the only thing he can't do is make people love him. Beyond that, I can't yet discern what the film was trying to say. But I can tell you this: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is one of the best movies I've ever seen.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

211,MartinK75,Impressive adaptation,9,12 May 2007,"What you think of this film probably largely depends on whether you've read the book beforehand. As a fan of Patrick Suskind's highly original and imaginative novel, the film was a must-see for me and it certainly didn't disappoint; it's a very faithful and beautifully rendered adaptation. Tom Tykwer adapts and directs with such confidence and skill that he instantly dispels the myth that the story was unfilmable. It genuinely made me wonder why it took around 20 years for the book to reach the big screen. The film has predictably been criticised for failing to convey the sense of smell to viewers; it is of course an impossible task but I'm not aware of the book being subject to the same criticism. Tykwer's visceral visuals, like Suskind's highly descriptive prose, come as close as it's possible to to conjuring up all sorts of scents, both pleasant and otherwise, for the viewer. Ben Whishaw is impressive as the antihero Grenouille. He's better looking than Grenouille is described in the novel as well as less robotic. Tykwer also makes a bold move near the film's end to show Grenouille experiencing feelings of tenderness and longing towards the girl who was his first murder victim, something completely absent in the book but which I felt worked well as an attempt to inject some humanity into Grenouille. Grenouille's first murder is also intriguingly shot to make it seem almost accidental unlike the very deliberate act which it was in the book. Making a film of Perfume, Tykwer probably felt he had no choice but to make Grenouille more empathetic as a two and a half hour film about a hideously ugly misanthrope with no redeeming features whatsoever would have been hard for most audiences to take. Tykwer is also good on tension, slotting in some nerve-shredding moments particularly in the scenes set in Grasse. Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman provide predictably excellent support while John Hurt's literate narration helps set the scene for viewers unfamiliar with the book. The film, like the book, is clearly not for everyone but it's definitely as good an adaptation as I could have expected.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It starts with the nativity and ends with the seeming crucification and the descent rather ascent to glory. It is a remarkable and difficult adaptation from a best selling novel.The acting is superb: Dustin Hoffman, Alan Rickman and the entire crew take us where we very much do not want to go.

213,arthurmauk,Disappointment  but what else would you expect?,5,27 May 2007,"I went into the film fully expecting another mediocre book-to-film adaptation, and unfortunately, it met my expectations. Tom Tykwer is one of my favourite directors and I had high hopes that he would be able to transfer Suskind's sensational read into the audio-visual format, but regrettably, it appears that the medium of film is not quite ready yet. Suskind vivified descriptions better than any other author I have ever read. Somehow, he managed to capture the wafts and wisps of every fleeting scent and ten minutes into reading the book, I discovered a heightened sense of smell. That effect seemed to have been lost in translation. Admittedly, filmmakers only have two channels to work through: the sense of sight and the sense of sound, whereas Suskind's magic was weaved through our greatest sense of all: our imaginations. Kubrick and Scorsese both conceded that Das Parfum was ""unfilmable"" and although I admire Tykwer's willingness, he happened to prove the master directors correct. Visually, Tykwer produced an impressive banquet of colours, contrasting between the spectacular and the mundane, the sensual warm palettes and the pale cold ones. But they were still cheap substitutes, and that was not enough. Flashes and glimpses of various objects do not liven our sense of smell. Neither do too many shots of Grenouille's nose with an added sound effect of someone inhaling. There was very little subtlety involved in conjuring up the imagery. The score was divine at times when it was brave enough to crescendo (most notably when Grenouille smells Laura for the second time) but mostly it was just average and too quiet to make an impact.Really, the filmmakers really fell over at the first hurdle: casting. I thought they ought to have looked harder for actors more suited to their roles, and if they couldn't find that perfect someone, abandon the project entirely. Ben Whishaw certainly looks demented enough, but too young and boyish to play our protagonist. For the first half of the book, Grenouille is expected to be an ugly, hunchbacked, yet arrogant subhuman. Whishaw just looked scared. The English accents felt equally out of place in 18th century Paris. Dustin Hoffman was simply ridiculous as Baldini, far too jolly and adding comedy where there was meant to be none. The true Baldini was devilishly resourceful and scheming, something that Hoffman doesn't understand. I was expecting Alan Rickman to balance him off with a little more gravitas, but apparently nobody told him that he was no longer playing Snape. John Hurt's narration was bearable, but personally I am strongly against narrators in films though for something like this I'll concede it may be necessary. There was one surprisingly bright beacon of hope among the cast, and that was Rachel Hurd-Wood as Laura. With how the book described her as the female Messiah, I expected to be disappointed with the film version, but she was simply perfect and more. I'm thankful that they did not decide to cast a twenty-something in the role of Laura and let her pretend to be the paradigm of chastity and virtue. Her innocence spoke volumes and I can see how Suskind could summarise it as incest-inducing in Richis.It was only when Laura appeared on screen that you felt that Grenouille finally had a goal. Before that, he seemed to have been aimlessly wandering around with only a concept of what he was planning to do. But here is where the film contrasts the most with the book  while the book was getting tedious towards the end, the film only now starts to spark up. Unfortunately, it still cannot inspire splendour and magnificence as the book could. There was nothing artistic about Whishaw's Grenouille, you only felt dirty and perverted as the beast gazed upon such a creature of beauty.As with every book-to-film adaptation, time is the most valuable asset and to compensate, parts must be carved out, making it feel like an impoverished imitation. Not only that, some parts were diluted and pasted in hastily in a poor attempt to recover its former glory. Virgin No. 1 was one of the most monumental moments in the book and you could almost taste the warm, syrupy, yellow plum juices dribbling down her hand. Yet minutes before, the film for some reason decided to inject in an unnecessary meeting between the two. The first night down at Baldini's cellar, when Grenouille was a whirlwind of talent whilst in creating Nuit Magique, was decidedly unspectacular. The climax of the film, when Grenouille showcases his ultimate perfume and provokes a mass orgy, was simply too weak. Whishaw looked unconvincing, childish, and downright silly in that blue suit, brandishing a handkerchief(!) as if it was meant to inspire slavish devotion amongst the crowd. If Grenouille could fool the masses into believing that he was an angel, we should be under that same illusion. Instead we get shots of Whishaw pathetically waving his arms and punching the air, Henman-style.A minor grudge I hold against Tykwer is how he mishandled the deaths of all those who played a part in Grenouille's life. Suskind did a great job to amusingly mock all of those fleeting personalities and their respective demises, and I thought if anyone could capture that fully, it would be Tykwer since he has done it before (and well) in Lola Rennt. However, for some reason he just missed the target on this one.If you do want to enjoy the film, it is probably a better idea not to read the book first otherwise you may feel cheated. Trying to recreate paradise in two dimensions was always going to be an impossible task. I must applaud Tykwer for having the guts to take up that gauntlet, but perhaps it was better to leave Suskind's masterpiece alone until the world of film is ready.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The protagonist of the movie came from a ragged childhood raised in the orphanage and was sold as slaves to many masters, but he persevered and kept his life purpose of capturing all the smells in perfumes. On one hand, I admire that he never gave up on his passion of becoming a perfumer even in bad childhood and life circumstances. On the other hand, I despise the murders depicted drastic measures that the protagonist comes up with to preserve sense of .young womanhood.On cinematography, the film is unbelievably well-shot with the backdrop in middle-aged Europe. The multiple lavender field scenes are heartfelt. It's still beyond my belief that the film is about a serial killer. The beginning and the ending are weird and intense.

Having seen Run Lola run before , i was expecting a different movie from the director. To tell you the fact the ending looked scrap , but appreciate the director not to change the original like most films actually do. The movie deals with the passion of smell , capturing smell , preserving smell . if you see a picture of dish your mouth waters and brain remembers the taste , likewise the movie was so well made that sometimes you remember the smell of the things you see in the picture. The scenes where the guy questions why he can't smell glass are truly indication for his passion for the smell.I was expecting a different movie , i got to see a movie which is hard to forget.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
218,poojucu,A different story about a serial killer.,8,10 February 2007,"Having not read the book that this film is based on, I really had no idea what to expect, or how to look at it. So I decided to go into the cinema without any expectations what so ever, and I am very glad that I did.Your first introduced to the central character Jean-Baptiste Grenouille in the early stages of the film. It shows his struggle through childhood, his appreciation for smell, and his very unique ability to smell anything and everything around him. This part of the film is very much controlled by the narrator who weaves the tale together beautifully. Soon after as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille reaches adulthood, and learns to use his ability's, we begin to see a phychotic but also brilliant character developing. At times you don't know whether to admire him for his talent or hate him for what he is, but it's certainly a very enjoyable experience watching him throughout.However what I found most enjoyable about this movie is its screenplay. Despite not being able to smell the perfume that Jean smells, or the scents that he enjoys in the movie, you still really do get a sense of what its like and how he is feeling. Andrew Birkin, and Bernd Eichinger have done a fantastic job with images, sounds and colors. That really do enhance your overall enjoyment of the film.Overall this is a different tale of a serial killer. There are moments of brilliance in this film that you wont see anywhere else, and the atmosphere that it creates is beautiful.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

220,VitalyBe,"An amazing adaptation, even if slow",8,27 December 2006,"This movie does a great justice to the book and was far above my expectations. The story is as complex as the sense it so heavily relies on - the sense of smell, yet, amazingly the directors of the movie were able to convince the smell and the feeling to the viewer.The whole book was captured in these 2 hours, every scene was there (except some really non important parts) and everything looked just like I always imagined it to. In fact, I had a strong sense of deja-vu during the whole movie. I already saw it, I already saw it in my imagination when I read the book. The director wasn't afraid to show violence as it was described in the book, nor he was afraid of nudity. It all there, grotesque, beautiful, enchanting and terrible as the author wrote it. I'm quite convinced now that it was the best movie adaptation I've seen.Yet, not all is perfect with this movie as well. Foremost, the movie isn't for the weak of heart. There is violence and blood, nudity and things you might not to see, yet, it should be accessible to most. Second, the movie is slow. It doesn't rush forward, it convinces true feelings with music and imagery, but that way or another, some parts seem slow.So there you have it. Close to perfection, as far as I am concerned, but not intended for all. If you are into easy, action-packed movies or if you can't stomach some blood on the screen, steer away, or you'll be up for some complex ride. However, anyone who likes a good drama, an intelligent acting and the dark scent of reality should have a great time.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
221,David_Moran,It's an amazing thing that it was actually produced...,8,22 December 2006,"THE PERFUME is the best novel I have ever read. therefore, I was very eager to see this movie and also was really afraid that it would suck. It is very difficult to bring to the screen the sensations of smell, which is the true thing that keeps grenouit, the protagonist, going. it is his obsession. how would one bring such an experience to the screen, to a visual context? the film, a quiet good one, gives lots of shots of grenouit's nose, an image that tries to make us imagine the smells he experiences. besides, the film really deals with a totally different subject matter: that of morality, human existence and free choice. to all those interested, the film, like the book, is pretty pessimistic about the latter.Without spoilers, I really should say that the film is beautifully shot and orchestrated, and is probably director Tykwer's best work and his most important one. but two main problems overshadow the general success: Ben wishaw and Dustin Hoffman. they were wrongly cast. they do a pretty good job, Wishaw being the better of the two, but they totally do not fit in the shoes of their characters. more on that, the writers chose to ignore or throw parts of the story that could really benefit the finished film, even if they had to add 30 more minutes. on top of all, and despite John hurt's beautiful narration, we cannot understand grenouit's real motivations, and director Tykwer does not give us hints to that, both within the story and within his direction of the actor. this is a big miss.However, some scenes are unforgettable and visually beautiful, and also very powerful. Grenouit is a character that bears a lot of pain within himself, and from this pain and passion comes the power to the screen, and also to the film's sound design. The orgy scene in the last part is wonderfully orchestrated, both in vision and sound.If you loved the novel you will probably love this film also.

Sniffing and capturing scent is his raison d'etre. Alan Rickman keeps his wits about him longest and infuses this mad bouquet with his sturdy sanity and wise protectiveness of his lovely daughter. Dustin Hoffman prettily plays a vain and avaricious perfumer, past his glory days, who uses Grenouille for his own monetary ends. But when Grenouille spends most of the film thwacking lovely young women on the head and covering them with animal fat, scraping it off, and simmering it to produce their essences, well, as far as I was concerned, Grenouille could meet his demise with a similar thwack at any time, the sooner the better. Such a miserable and creepy person. This film will delight abnormals everywhere to whom Grenouille can be a touchstone, his fame bringing similar sickos encouragement.

The main character's extraordinary talented smell also is his biggest trap; when he lets his sense of smell overpower his conscience, or any sense of compassion, he is set for a course in which he in the really discovers where that leads to. The culmination of this film is in the last 15 minutes, where he is able to manipulate and seduce a town square full of people by a perfume he has skillfully created from the scents of murdered virgins. This scent is not a scent of love, but a scent of lust, a lust which overpowers the senses of the people in the town square in such a way that they are almost (I say almost) forced to follow their senses and give into a purely sensual experience. As soon as the scent wears off, their eyes to their shameful behaviour are opened and they leave in shame. At the same time the main character discovers the emptiness of this event, and with that also the emptiness of his chasing after a uniquely powerful sensual experience. He now understands that manipulating people can indeed be accomplished by the skilled manipulator, but it will never make people really love you, or will allow you to really love people. Once he discovers this, he is apparently not able to live with this insight, realising he has murdered a girl which who he could have had a meaningful loving relationship.

226,Danherb,Perfume: A unique cinematic experience,8,21 September 2006,"I haven't read Süskind's book, before watching the movie, which was certainly an advantage, because I didn't have any demands or reservations on its realization.The story should be throughout well-known. The main character Grenouille has an perfect sense of smell and tries to conserve the scent of beautiful women in order to create an ultimate perfume, which makes him turn into a murderer.Director Tom Tykwer focused on strong and authentic pictures to describe all the different smells which works brilliantly, may it be the disgustingly foul smelling Parisian fish market or a large field of blooming lavender. It's overwhelming, how Tykwer's picture language lets you experience not only all kinds of smells but also the atmosphere of life in the 18th century.The actors' performances are great as well. Wishaw plays Grenouille with a mix of insanity, mysterious attractiveness and simplicity. The rest of the cast, especially Dustin Hoffman as Grenouille's taskmaster and Alan Rickman as a careful father, who wants to hunt Grenouille down contribute great performances.The story itself keeps some brilliant ideas ready, which are certainly only surprising for those, who haven't read the book. But a problem, which is common for most novel adaptations is, that the story partly seems too densely packed, so that the movie becomes a little dull sometimes. The fact that a narrator is almost constantly present intensifies the fabulous atmosphere on the one hand. But on the other hand the characters' motivations don't become clear enough at certain times. I would have wished, that the movie would have taken more time focusing on the characters' development. But nevertheless the strength of the movie lies in special sequences, for example the ending scene, which I don't want to spoil, is enthralling to such an extent and the picture language perfectly support the movie's main topic of ultimate beauty.The movie is no common novel adaptation, due to the novel's ingenious story and Tykwer's courageous realization, ""Perfume"" is an exciting unique cinematic experience, which I think is more beneficial, if you haven't read the book.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

228,jamesnicolay,Sensual,7,22 July 2007,"Perhaps the most overlooked of all the human senses is the one right under your nose (or rather in it). Dealing with the concept of smell and scents may prove to be difficult to be portrayed or deliberated upon in a movie, where audio and visual spectacles are the ones being noticed. I remember a certain conversation I had with Mr. Maraña when we were talking about the different innovations in the world of cinema (like the IMAX and the possibility of three-dimensional films, where one can feel the actors) he suggested something that got me to thinking--what if the movies would also let the audience experience smelling the movie. Suddenly, my mind was flooded with lots of movies and how they would turn out if the audience were able to smell the story--I'm sure that love stories would definitely be fragrant, and that pornographic films will be more--uhm--sensual, and the horror films can be more disgusting than ever. Even literal fart jokes will definitely be funnier, if not grosser.I digress. Tom Tykwer's Perfume is brilliant in its images--how it was able to transcend olfactory paradise into visual imageries. The story is not as solid, and I'm not really sure about historical accuracy. As the story progresses, it successfully transcends from just a mere artsy film into a modern parable. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born different--he has been blessed by a superb sense of smell, sensitive enough to smell odors from faraway places, strong enough that made him quite queer. He survives through the poverty and filth of Paris, working under the clutch of machines and terrible masters--until one day, he follows a scent, fragrant, of a red-haired woman--it mystifies him to the point of obsession. He follows her literally to her death, which fascinates him because of the sublime beauty before him but also frustrates him because he cannot preserve the scent of the woman and keep it with him forever. Fortunately, he meets a real master: a master perfumer who somewhat has lost his touch in the modern world. When Jean-Baptiste made some suggestions about how the old perfumer could enhance the latest new sensation being sold by his competition, the story goes into a different direction. He starts having his formal education on the world of scents--he learns the names of the various smells that have been with him yet remained nameless; he learns the process of making perfumes.As any story of great talents goes, the infant terrible discovers that he is actually better than his master--he feels lonely and deserted--no one can understand his hunger and desire for scents. He leaves and starts looking for ways to preserve human scent--the most fragrant of all scents--the scent that will make one think of paradise when one smells/experiences it.In doing so, he needs to kill the most beautiful women in the town. And so it goes.The crowd goes after him. He gets his sentence. But how the perfumer Grenouille was able to transform an entire angry crowd into a massive bacchanalian group copulation is something that everyone has to see--bizarre and visually poetic.If only we could smell this climax of the film, it would nothing be stranger than a real paradise.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

230,g-is-for-gluggermuffin,Stones. Wet stones.,7,4 October 2008,"Well... let's see... i thought this was a great movie...very well made an all that, but perhaps slightly ruined by its... interesting (terrible) ending. The story of Jean-Baptiste, (or the creepy nose guy, as i like to call him) is a strange one. He begins his life born in a pile of rotting carrion, accidentally gets his mother killed for it and then nearly gets suffocated by a bunch of no-good selfish kids. By the age of five, the creepy nose guy could still not speak; but alas, he was accompanied by a far greater power; he could tell everything that had happened to an object just by smelling it. He could smell maggots in a dead rat, an apple plummeting towards his head at high speed and so on. As you may have guessed by my comments earlier in this review, i liked this movie, but not it's ending. The story goes that Jean-Baptiste accidentally kills a particularly nice smelling young lady and is so upset that her scent is gone forever, that he decides to continue killing young women in the hope of capturing their scent to keep forever. Sounds weird? It is. In the end the creepy nose guy manages to kill 13 girls and captures all of their smell in a small bottle of perfume. He is then caught for his crimes and somehow manages to hide the perfume as he is in gaol. Then, as he is carried out to be executed, he decides to smell the perfume, and share it with those around him. Even the pleasant sight of boobs was not enough to save the tragic ending of this movie. It collapsed into a pile of unintended corny humour as everybody standing before the creepy nose guy fell to their knees and started removing their clothes, as he dropped a single drop of 13 dead girls perfume onto his hanky and waved it around. But no- it did not stop at this, as... prepare yourself... they all started to have a massive orgy, while Jean-Baptiste just looked on in awe and wonder at the thought that the scent of 13 dead girls was enough to make an entire crowd that had come to watch his head lopped off suddenly bow before him as if he were an angel, and then turn to each other in delight and started to take off their clothes and...well... you get the picture. Although you wonder; what kind of ending is this? You are correct indeed in what you think: this is a terrible ending. But to the viewers horror, the film does not end here. Feeling that his aim in life is complete, the creepy nose guy decides there's not much point in living anymore, and, somehow knowing this would happen, (or maybe he was just hoping for another pretty sight before he killed himself), he poured the entire bottle of perfume over his head in front of some fugly homeless people, including copious amounts of gynotikolobomassaphiles, mumblecrusts and ragamuffins. Perhaps the perfume has a different effect on fugly mumblecrusts, or perhaps it was just too pleasant a scent it drove them insane, but whatever the case, somehow it resulted in the creepy nose guy being doomed to a horrible death of being eaten alive by filthy ragamuffins. Weeks went by, and supposedly no-one noticed all that was left of him sitting in the middle of the street; a few tattered pieces of his clothes, which, if you look carefully are picked up by a small, bearded ragamuffin child. Yes, I did say a bearded child. Perhaps if it hadn't been for this horrible ending, i would've given this movie an 8 or a 9, but the end just ruined a lot for me. If i'd only seen the end without the rest of the movie, i would've either assumed it was supposed to be a comedy. like thank god you're here or something, and given it a 10. But if I'd known it was supposed to be serious, i probably would've given it a 1.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

And this movie has the same fairy tale feeling about it. You don't really know if something like this could actually happen, but the narrative is so strong that you simply desire the existence of parallel universes where something like this could occur. Even though Ben Whishaw is not the biggest name on the screen (Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman play main supporting roles in this movie) he completely takes the stage with his presence and you can only congratulate the casting director for his choice. The second thing that deserves a special mention is the cinematography which is simply stunning. Since this is the movie with the main focus on the sense of smell, the director did the second best thing using beautiful visuals to guide us trough the story. And the story is the last, but not the least part worth mentioning. Coming as an adaptation of a book, it manages to transfer the magic almost completely.

232,sheppard-2,just a mindless illustration to the book,1,25 September 2006,"I read the book a while ago, and i liked it. If you read the book, you won't find anything new or interesting in the film. The film illustrates the book very closely, but there's no interpretation of the book in the film. The voice behind the frame that reads parts of the book is really foolish. It's a clear display of director's inability to make up anything interesting. When they've shown a close-up on the guy's nose, i thought to myself: is this the only way they will show smelling process? Will they show close-ups on the nose all the time? That'd be really dull. But alas, it was true. Tykwer failed to show aromas otherwise than as a nose and an object of smelling. No association of odor with color, with shape or with sound. No imagination. The scene where Dustin Hoffman smells Grenuille's perfume composition looks like a soap ad, which is stupid and disgusting. The orgy in the end of the film is very flaccid and diffident though it ought to be the key point, it's intended to shock. One more thing: the book is stylized like a XIX century novel. It's full of moralizing, Grenuille is always called an evil character, and the value of lives he takes is always emphasized. The film totally lacks this. From the film, Grenuille appears to be a genius that is just so unlucky to have been born a nobody. He succeeded to make those miraculous perfume, so the girls didn't die in vain. The father of the last girl is just a bourgeois, and he protects his daughter as his property, so the killing of this last girl is justified as an act of a kind of Robin Hood. This is all because murder in modern art doesn't have a clear meaning of evil. Tom Tykwer should have taken this in account, but he didn't. In short, the film has nothing to offer. It is extremely boring.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
233,mikomijade,A good movie made after a good book,10,31 October 2006,"Of course it is not a secret to anybody that this movie is based on the Book of Patrick Suskind ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderrer"". My personal opinion to both of the works differs a lot. I read the book and was astonished by some of the in between-lines thoughts of the author (some of them were unbearably unacceptable for me) but my total impression of the book was good. There were moments I felt so weird and unnatural but these moments in the book were the most beautiful ones. I couldn't feel the same at the same moments in the movie: no such strong impression of the first murder for instance. Though I loved other things in the movie: comparing to the book I can say that author made Jan-Batist a real monster but he felt so much love and devotion to that monster that I almost hated the book - in the movie Jan-Batist is the person not really capable of defining what soul, love, trust and other good things are (but he has a sort of rudiment to a human being) and at the end he realizes he is human and all human is close to him. As if he was trying to hide behind his senselessness. Ben Whishaw is very talented actor and his acting sometimes makes Jan-Batist sympathetic to me. I repeat my self - I talk only of my personal impression of both works - you should watch the film to understand it the way you understand life - listening to no one, because there are so much things you can see and hear as if been reading in between lines that it is impossible to give full and strict characteristic to Perfume as the film.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
234,fruitbat319,"insert your own ""stink"" joke here",1,29 January 2008,"A lot of the reviews that I've read on this movie seem to make hypotheses about the American reaction to the film, yet there seemed to be a lack of responses from Americans themselves. The consensus seemed to be that Americans would find the violence and everything too shocking for our tiny Yank brains. That being said, I figured I, though obviously I cannot speak for all Americans, would contribute a review from the colonies.The European hypothesis was, in part, correct. I hated this movie. But not for the reasons given. I did not find the nudity, violence or psychosis portrayed to be horrifying or disturbing or too avant garde for my tiny Yank brain. In fact, I found it quite dull after a while. The central character kills so many people and we get so many shots of their naked corpses that after a while it almost becomes comical. It seemed that the director was going for shock effect and it was really obvious, and that always annoys me in a movie. ""Perfume"" came off to me as an exaggerated ""Silence of the Lambs"" with period costumes and a much less compelling and more contrived storyline.I should make it clear that I have never read the book and therefore I can only comment on the film. I'm sure much of the story was pared down to fit the time slot, so I could be missing out on a lot of interesting material. The movie does not offer much, but spends its time with close-up shots of dead naked beautiful women. While it was too boring to be disturbing, I take issue with the idea that the subjugation of and violence towards women is somehow seen as heroic, brilliant and in the pursuit of art. This is the aspect of the movie I find contrived, archaic and frankly disgusting. Understandably, the main character (along with his nose)is depicted as a psychopathic serial killer, but the end of the movie(which made me burst out laughing at its sheer ridiculousness--it was such a ludicrous cop-out) justifies this behavior in making him out to be a genius bordering on the divine, and this bothers me on a social level. And frankly, even if his murderous tendencies were meant to be cast in an ambiguous light, this movie did a horrible job of it.The characters were completely undeveloped, and not even in the acceptable way of a fairy tale or fable. The main character was a calculating killer, and not even an enjoyable one, his victims were objects, his mentor a caricature. Even the voice-over narrator is inconsistent, disappearing completely at times, only to reappear and explain away a complex scene in a few cursory sentences. Plus Dustin Hoffman does a terrible Italian accent--he sounds like he's from Brooklyn.In all, this movie was a clumsy, insulting, blockbuster attempt at something that was supposed to be subtle and artful, but I don't think eve the most gifted of directors could have salvaged the indulgent and obnoxious storyline.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
235,JSmith125,"OK, explain this to me again?",3,8 July 2007,"Most reviewers don't focus on, if they even mention, the *ideas* a movie is based on or the philosophy it expresses. Maybe film-goers don't care about such things, but I tend to think that the underlying illogic in a story damages the experience it's able to give us. ""Perfume"" is apparently supposed to be some kind of meditation on beauty, obsession, talent, love, etc. But what is it telling us about any of this? The film seems to imply vaguely that its antihero's obsessive quest came to good in the end despite the unfortunate detail that it involved a bunch of cold-blooded murders. Or maybe it's saying that the rediscovery of love also involves tragedy, or something like that. But whatever, how can I feel the truth of this insight if the vehicle for it is a story that makes no sense, even on its own terms? To avoid spoilers, I can't point out everything that's preposterous here, but consider just the key premise: We're supposed to believe that (a) the greatest possible aroma could be achieved by distilling dead bodies (wait, don't those usually smell *bad*?), and (b) the ""essence"" distilled from beautiful young women would somehow be better than anyone else's. (If beautiful women tend to smell better, I'd assume it's because they've put ON perfume, not that they should BECOME perfume.) And then, of course, it's the socially highest-ranking woman whose essence is the best and most vital of all. If you take away these premises -- if you assume, for instance, that the most aromatically useful essence would actually come from male pig farmers in their 30s with lots of back hair -- then this story evaporates faster than you can say ""Chanel."" And if the story's premise isn't true, how can its message be? At least the film pioneered a technique we've never seen before -- the ""macro-zoom"" or sudden, extreme enlargement of things we can't otherwise see, including internal body organs. Wait ... what that's you say? There are already at least three TV detective series based on that very trick? Never mind.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

237,hoobits,Best film of the year so far,10,30 September 2006,"In May I got to see the first US test screening of the film. I had seen the teaser trailer earlier in the year, and that prompted me read the book, which I enjoyed but was not in love with. I loved the premise and the first and last half of the book was phenomenal but I felt the middle dragged in unnecessary ways.So it was that I went in to the movie with a little doubt but a lot of excitement. I love Tom Tykwer's body of work and I was hoping fro a true Tykwer film (Moody, intimate, epic, meditative) and I absolutely got it, and then some!I was swept up in the film! Every move made was breathtaking, exciting, interesting and oozed the essence of what great cinema can be.This is Ben Whishaw's film through and through. The other three ""named"" actors don't get enough screen time to warrant anything grand. Whishaw carries this film nearly silently, and like the Grenouille from the books, speaks only when he finds the need to. Now many people have complained about the differences between the Grenouille in the film and the book, saying how the film version is not grotesque enough. That is so, but I find the Whishaw's version to be just as interesting. he is as much a naive little boy as he is a monster. Grenouille in the film wants to be loved pure and simple. He has never known someone to care and look at him just for him, which is a little different than how he is in the book (he sees love as a way to control people to gain power) but this does not detract from the film's exploration of his inner workings.So my suggestion to anyone planning on seeing the film is to go in with an open mind. It is not the book, word for word, scene by scene, but it does retain the spirit, the essence of the book, and for me is far more rewarding than the book was in the end. But that is more due to my love of Tykwer films. So if you're a fan of his work (Particularly ""Princess and the Warrior"" and ""Heaven"") then see ""Perfume"".",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

(how do the bodies get moved around? how come there's no trace of Grenouille's work detectable on them? how come nobody ever sees the serial killer going about his work even when he's gate-crashing well-populated parties?).The whole mess proceeds to a climax of such mind-boggling stupidity it earned hilarious laughter from most of those in the cinema with me. One wonders how much the extras paid to participate. My father-in-law, aged 87, commented that he thought the crowd scenes were good. Watch the film and you'll probably also come away with that as the only positive sentiment.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
239,OutlanderOmega,"A Beautiful, Vile, Disgusting Film",8,5 April 2015,"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is the epic story of a guy in 1700's France with a supernatural sense of smell and psychopathy. Jean- Baptise Grenouille soon learns of perfume making and murder and sets out cross-country to create a scent via serial killings. And it's amazing visually and emotionally.The protagonist's back-story is nearly unbearable. We go from attempted infanticide to matricide to more attempted infanticide to tortuous physical labor in one of the bleakest city settings in a movie. The direction was reminiscent of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie in its depiction of the same era and similar places. The story began by dropping sadness and brutality on the audience like a dump truck full of bodies and feces. This process continued repeatedly until the credits. This is a good thing.I felt somewhat sympathetic for Grenouille, even through the killings, because he maintained a kind of disturbing innocence. Or perhaps ignorance? That's the thing: the main character doesn't talk much, but with the help of a narrator, it's clear how complex and unique he is. All that complexity comes to a freakish, surreal, but fitting ending. This movie builds and builds and reaches a new plane that is straight-up weird.This movie was visually striking with bright colors and sets from a tannery to a perfumery to the French countryside. It was reasonably well acted and the classical soundtrack was beautiful and fitting. My only issue is this: it was too long. Paying close attention, no unnecessary scenes are to be found, but some individual scenes were elongated. I felt lost at a few times, but wasn't sure why. The long hair can stay on the rocker, but a trim will keep everything in order so it can be flung about on-stage for the wraith-like fans to ejaculate over via groaning noises and self- appointed roles as lead singer on the chorus.If you're looking for diversity in the serial killer genre, it's all here. Even classics like Silence of the Lambs follow the typical tropes, but Perfume: The Story of a Murderer changes everything up with a new setting and era and by making the killer the main character. A new perspective and a fresh story that ended in absurdity made for an interesting watch. 8.5/10",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
240,ilikedolphin,A super special and impressive story happened around perfume,10,17 September 2015,"This film is the most unique, special and imaginative story I've seen so far. It is a story about perfume, and the legendary life of Jean-Baptiste, an olfactory genius.Jean-Baptiste is born in a smelly fish market. He grows up in an orphanage till he is 8 years old and is sold to a tanner to work. It's a dog's life, but Jean-Baptiste survives. He is born with a special skill: he can recognize everything from its smell and he enjoys smelling. I think his nose is even more sensitive than a police dog's.Jean-Baptiste becomes a perfume maker thanks to his specialty. The world is made up of thousands of smells for him. He wants to keep the smells forever, especially the aromas of beautiful girls. He hikes to the south of France and learns how to make perfume for several years. He obsesses over smell. He is a freak. Finally he makes the greatest perfume in the world with 13 girls' bodies and lives.Like the scene in the beginning of the movie, Jean-Baptiste should be put to death. However, the ending of the story is very dramatic! He opens his perfume in the execution ground, and suddenly everyone in attendance admires the smell and Jean-Baptiste. I feel this is a kind of irony of human nature and society.Jean-Baptiste's perfume conquers the world, but it cannot free him. The ending shows him and his perfume being devoured in the place where he was born.I think death is the best solution to get real freedom for Jean-Baptiste. Only perfume and smelling are in his world, no love and no beloved. Jean-Baptiste is a tragic character. It looks like an exaggerated story. In fact, it is an interpretation of love and hate.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

I enjoyed the first half and eagerly anticipated the rest of the movie. I enjoyed its quirkiness, its beautifully convincing sets, its interesting subjects. I wanted to see how the story would unfold as the scent-obsessed man continued down his path of collecting scents and creating perfumes. His accidental killing of one woman and subsequent impulsive murder of a second seemed within the boundaries of good story telling and fit in with his compulsion to collect all scents and create a perfect perfume, and I was not put off by the dark turns.The second half had a completely different tone for me. The obsession with collecting all scents vanished and instead the guy went on a murder spree set to whimsical music, apparently to create a perfume of which all 13 scents in all 4 parts were body odor. Apparently he thought the body odor of attractive young females is their soul and is love and apparently the movie's second half says that he was right.With tires screeching the movie banged a hard right down a dark alley into a stinking rubbish heap. Stalking, murder, absurdity, more absurdity, a massive pointless out-of-place orgy, more absurdity, and the stupidest ending I've ever seen.At first I gave Perfume a 5-star rating, the average of a 10 first half and a 0 second half. But on further reflection, the painfully void and meaningless garbage second half, by not fulfilling any of the promise of the first half, destroyed the first half's meaning too.

It is fantastic. The utter filth of ancient Paris is brought to life very vividly; you can almost taste it. But this is about all that is good.My main problem with it is that it is so L O N G... The tale is a simple one and could be told easily in a normal 100 min timescale. The fact that it takes 140 minutes is a perfect illustration of what's wrong - it takes itself far too seriously! It thinks it is a very profound film, full of deep insights. It is not. It is merely a piece of Gothic-style entertainment and it should not pretend to be great art. It closes in on its subject matter with a feverish intensity that is practically fetishistic. It is massively overblown, with the lines (Alan Rickman's in particular) delivered in such an absurdly grandiose and laboured style as to be laughable.The other principal problem is that the leading actor (Ben Whishaw) cannot act. His lines are appallingly wooden - his opening lines (where he whips up a version of the perfume, Amor and Psyche) are cringe-making! Throughout, he cannot inject any life whatsoever into the part. In fact, we are not invited to care about any of the characters. They are all completely two-dimensional.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
245,randy-377,Redelonce Bordering on the Ridiculous,8,18 August 2007,"It was curious to see only two stars on Netflix. This is not a movie made for American audiences. But it must be appreciated for its originality. In a time when it seems that all the original story ideas are exhausted, this curious tale is an unexpected, twisted story of a man possessed by odor. It could have gone many different ways, but it is in the end, a love story, albeit, a frightening one. Who hasn't in the neurotic throes of love wanted to possess something of the love object. One of the true verifications of love is smell. Thus, our main character, from an early age finds smell is his passion, his obsession, his fetish. As a man without odor himself, he is also without sexuality, which is the true nature of any fetish. Ben Whishaw is a strange looking man. A long neck, a face that seems swollen from sleepless nights, his eyes are strangely like King Kong's: They tell us everything. What they don't tell us is if he is a saint or a sinner. For this movie takes a curious turn and becomes a quasi religious film with a completely gratuitous orgy scene, including the perfunctory church deacon engaged in physical pleasure, (though the noted sadly lacking display of any homosexual affection; it hadn't been invented yet?) the plot falls into that surrealistic harbor of the simply unbelievable. And it ends on a note Tennessee Williams would have have loved. We now know that Sebastian Venerable was wearing perfume. Despite the flaws of the plot, the movie is seriously engaging, beautiful and wonderfully NOT Hollywood.

As with most book adaptations the movie isn't quite the same as the book but it sure kept the essence of it. The cast was carefully chosen, John ""The Storyteller"" Hurt is great as the narrator, the sets are amazing and the camera-work is brilliant! Most scenes are filmed exactly as they are described in the book. The birth of Grenouille; the first encounter with Baldini were Grenouille makes ""Amor & Psyche"", the scenes at Madame Arnulfi's shop,... There are of course some scenes in the movie that are completely different than the way they are described in the book and i don't understand why they did this. Both Grenouilles mother and Madame Gaillard die in completely different ways, the scenes with Jeanne Bussie, father Terrier and Markies de la Taillade-Espinasse are missing and the orgy scene is way too ""soft"" when you compare it with what Süskind wrote down in his novel. The biggest disappointment for me was the end of the movie. Where the filmmakers afraid the movie would get a PG 18 rate for excessive violence? Where are the daggers, the axes and the knives? Where are the close-up shots of cannibalism? Still Tykwer and his crew made an excellent movie and i can imagine how hard it must be to translate this book to the big screen.

Most fans of the book might negatively criticize or simply praise the book mostly (see Roger Ebert review in the Sun Times) seeming hypnotized by the idea of the celebration of their favorite book on screen.

It switches through colors from a cool dim tone to a warm lively ambiance as the main character 'Grenouille' played by 'Ben Whishaw' discovers more scents. This creates a visually impressive loom towards the audience.'Grenouille is a fascinating monster you would love to see hang but then you soon grow to admire him.The most remarkable appeal about 'Perfume' is the clever plot and script writing which shocks the audience with its repugnance and imagination in the end.

Too bad the writing is choppy and the actors are weakly directed. Hoffman and Rickman are conspicuous in their own styles highlighting the vacuity of direction at least as far as the characters are concerned.The very high production values and the lack of depth among the characters creates an emphasis on visual style without depth. The script undermines the movie further. Starting with an unrealistic conceit such as the superhuman sense of smell requires sticking closely to the logic that such an anomaly creates. This narrative had gaps and flaws that made the story ridiculous. With the shallow characterizations and sloppy scripting the effulgence of the technical direction blows up into unintended high camp. A climactic scene that should convey sublime joy comes off as an accidental parody of Ken Russell.If you want to see camp re-defined, by all means go and have a good laugh.

I can only concentrate on the story. The story itself is an atrocity, and that alone ruins everything else. To me the story is the foundation and the pillars.

I won't give away everything that happens but some of it is very well done. There is a lot of sniffing and smelling and this is done really well on screen and aside from putting smells into the cinema it couldn't have been done much better.On the negative side - if you are doing a period piece and it is this long then it had better be damn good - and unfortunately it wasn't. We had 4 walkouts within the first 30mins in our showing. I was starting to feel tired half way through! Whilst the film took a new angle with perfume as one of its main things it wasn't exactly what I would call thoroughly entertaining. Not to say it was boring - I would describe it as good but not great.Most talked about will of course be the ending. I am of the opinion an ending is the most important part of a film and can totally change opinions of a movie - I certainly wasn't wrong in this instance. Up until a certain point a sudden turn in the way things were going was looking good but it soon deteriorated into madness. Minor point  the accents of the main character and Dustin Hoffman were all over the place. Other reviews suggest you read the book, or you should have read the book to get the best possible experience - IMO that's not a good enough reason for a film not to be good on its own.

Well, there's something I'd like to remark - this movie starts with the end: since the beginning you know the main character is a murderer who is going to be executed. I wouldn't have made it like that if I'd made the movie, but it doesn't hurt. After that, we see Grenouille's life since we was born - just as it happens in the book. I specially like the part of Baldini - very good in both the book and the film, I guess that's because the film is *again* very loyal to the book.

It demands so much of the viewer, no flashy action or gore to sustain you. Just a movie showing the insanity of Grenouille unfold before our eyes. It's a strange insanity because unlike other serial killers, your on his side for most of the film. Whether it's his horrible upbringing or just his miserable life, you want this guy to succeed. Grenouille's obsession is the brilliance of this film or it's downfall depending on your perspective. It doesn't deviate from its purpose, there aren't useless subplots to steal the laser beam which is Grenouille obsession, to create the perfect, macabre perfume from the beauty of young ladies!! It had the guts to do this, where many films today wouldn't, to which I must say bravo!!!I can easily see why people would hate this film and I can almost hate it myself.

It stinks...should've been called ""Scent of a Woman""",2,25 January 2008,"Here's the recipe for one of the stinkiest scents of all...Take one abused orphan gifted with a powerful olfactory nerve, add one dozen murdered, pubescent girls, blend, and let rest for two hours.Then, turn the story upside down, and finish with an ending that makes you wonder why you forced yourself to watch for so long.Perfume is a disappointing film about a man so consumed by his sense of smell that he murders to capture the essence of scent. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, abandoned at birth, discovers his sense of smell and is enveloped by the various scents and odors around him. After years of abuse in an orphanage, he is sold to the owner of a tannery. While on a delivery in a crowded marketplace, Grenouille notices a young girl, beautiful to him by scent rather than sight, and in his passion, smothers her.Later, and by chance, Grenouille meets a famous perfumer in Paris and becomes his apprentice. The perfumer profits from his apprentice's work, but reaches his limits of what he can teach. Grenouille departs for Grasse, a city in Provence, where he can learn the art of enfleurage.Using his newly developed skills, Grenouille begins to experiment at capturing the scent that cost him his innocence. He captures and murders young women, seizing their essence to create a master scent that will give him extraordinary powers.However, when Grenouille murders the beautiful daughter of a French nobleman, he is caught and brought to justice. He unveils his master scent renders the executioner and the angry mob hellbent on his destruction powerless in the wake of the captivating smell. Grenouille escapes their wrath, returns to Paris to the fetid place of his birth, and disappears, mobbed by the filthy urchins who were drawn to the last ounces of his master scent.The modern cinematography seems out of place with the 18th century French setting and the dialogue is too contemporary.

260,shekhoosraja,A brilliant visualization,10,9 April 2008,"Making viewers actually 'smell' a movie just by the visuals is probably an impossible task. But in this movie, 'Perfume' we see a brilliant effort to do the same.Based on Patrick Suskind's best selling novel, 'Das Parfum', this movie is a brilliant visualization. It is about a person who has an extraordinary sense of smell and thus focuses on smell, its effects and the sensation that it arouses. Director Tom Tykwer has used visuals and sounds brilliantly to make his viewers get a very realistic feel of this theme. The colour scheme, textures, dresses, locations, lighting, choreography and camera angles are all so well used together that they almost create an illusion of 'smell'. The way the lead character goes around touching and rubbing his nose on to womens' skin, flowers, animals dead and alive, soil, rocks, walls and everything else makes up for powerful visuals along with the technical supports that I have mentioned earlier. The music too, could not have been better, I think. It totally enhances the impact. The characterizations are very good. Also, the screenplay is very intriguing. The story is about a person named Jean Baptise(Ben Winshaw) who has an extraordinary sense of smell. He can recognize any thing just by the smell of it and this becomes his greatest passion. He grows up in poverty, working as a labor in a slaughter house. One day, he incidentally meets a perfumer, who impressed by his talents hires him. The perfumer(Dustin Hoffman) uses him to create several successful perfumes in a very short span of time. Jean in return, asks him to teach him the art of extracting and preserving smell and also of creating a perfect perfume. Once done with the basics, Jean is eager to learn more and thus leaves him. He starts to search for the method to make the perfect perfume. Soon, he discovers that the scent of the female skin is the most captivating of smells. So he decides to use girls' skin and hair to make his perfume. But he soon realizes that girls are not going to just allow him to use their skin and hair.

An 18 century serial killer, I was expecting Hannibal Lector in period dress, what i got was a mixture of a Carry On film and a Lynx ad. The acting was hammy, although to be fair, the film looked lush, I just didn't engage with the main character, apart from the opening sequence when he was growing up.I read somewhere that the main character was supposed to be offensive, he was a pretty boy actor so that ruined it for me, I wanted a repulsive slimy murderer, he wasn't.The killings had a comedic element to them, the killer dragging women into doorways and leaving the bodies all over the shop, the killings were incidental really.All in all, a stinker of a movie...literally.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

263,4everard,"A Sumptous, Fantabulous Feast for the Senses",9,8 May 2007,"Despite some reviews on this film, saying that they ""didn't get the ending"", and hence lowering the rating this film is absolutely delightful for the faintly darker minded.Firstly, the story is so startlingly original that it seems incredible that Suskind thought about it for a story. I mean, who else in the world of serial killers kills for the scent of a human being? And would you believe it? The perfume, which Grenouille happens to be the most powerful and mind-bending perfume ever created.Also the way that it was filmed is just brilliant. The smells convey so well on screen that you can almost smell it very faintly. The scene where Dustin Hoffman's character first smells Jean-Baptiste's perfume and he has a hallucination of scents is just so startling and striking it is almost possible to believe that such scents do exist! The music itself instantly adds more atmosphere to the film , played excellently by The Berlin Philharmonic, giving just that extra touch to the otherwise delicious visual feast which we are presented with.In short, I recommend this film to anyone who wishes to watch a visually fantastic film, with a dark storyline and wonderful characters to entertain them. Truly and utterly wonderful!",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
264,jaxeed,Grotesquely beautiful.,9,10 March 2007,"When I sat down to watch this film, it had gone quite a few years since I've read the book. I didn't expect much as everyone aught to know the book is always better. At least I had not yet experienced a film successfully capturing the feel of a book, when attempting to translate it into an audiovisual format. That was until I saw this film, which has rendered the book with such immense scrutiny I could almost hear the wording even when not spoken. It felt like everything essential was captured, from the sadistic humour that bubbles right under the surface throughout the storyline, to the sense of being drawn towards rooting for the villain.I'm usually against the use of voice-over narration in film, as in my perception this is often used as a substitute for utilizing the storyteller techniques of the film medium. However in this film I feel confident that the means to negotiating text into images was executed so artfully there was no other way to sufficiently set the tone. There is also a strong storyteller presence in the book which further defends its use in this film.How successful the film experience was for those who have no previous knowledge of the book, is another issue where unfortunately this film fails to a certain degree. Even though the film goes to great length in being true to detail, much of what makes us who have read the book nod and smile knowingly also makes others who doesn't know the book scratch their heads. Arguably that is reason to watch the film again while paying more attention, though in my experience most people denounce the film before giving it another chance.While certain parts of the film might be a bit unclear for those who haven't read the book, the film does the complete opposite mistake towards the end. It ends up over explaining what we are witnessing to a degree it is almost a little patronizing, not to mention a bit drawn in regard to storyline progress. Some might hate me for saying this, but I see about 5 minutes towards the climax that could have been snipped out without affecting the credibility of the story, while maintaining the pace of the dramaturgy. Though, that being said, the way the ending is put together is yet again brilliant and suits the book to a tee.Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is a film definitely worth watching, either if you have or have not read the book. Since you have read this far, I'm sure you are curious what sort of experience this film has to offer. The tag line is focusing way too much on the plot, while it's the atmosphere you will remember. I can not think of a better way to describe this film then - grotesquely beautiful.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
265,dave-800,First half much better than second,8,3 March 2007,"The first half of the film is fascinating because we get to meet and explore Jean Baptiste, following his intriguing and extraordinary life story from his very birth, most unusual in itself, to his setting off on his quest to capture the scent of everything. The dark cinematography is beautiful and convincing and Dustin Hoffman gives a remarkable and amusing performance as the perfumer Baldini. In this half of the film we also see what in my view is the most crucial and at the same time most enchanting episode of the film, Baptiste's romantically tragic meeting with the plum girl, played beautifully by the gorgeous Karoline Herfurth.The second half of the film continues on a very different note. The time span has now been reduced to Jean Baptiste's last few months of his life in Grasse. The cinematography is still beautiful and contrasts well with the dim and gloomy setting of Paris of the first half, but I personally prefer the darker setting for atmosphere. The plot is mostly reduced to a manhunt now, or to be exact a girl hunt, after a killing spree which reminisces of the same-sort-of-era famous true story of London's own Jack the Ripper, but capturing none of the thrill, not even through the power of suggestion. The story culminates to the utterly ridiculous ending which has been described by critics as odd, ludicrous, silly, preposterous and delirious, with which I fully agree. It is not in keeping with the previous perspective of the story of Jean Baptiste's talent, which only asks us to stretch the limit of credibility to a reasonable extent. We are now expected to stretch this limit to an impossible extent, while watching a crowd of people ridiculing themselves in a nauseating display. The script writer may have been understandably captured by the story as told in the original novel, but this sort of ending is in my opinion much better left to the imagination, and is therefore much more suited to a good read rather than a full-screen display. I think a less faithful script was called for, which would have produced an ending much more suitable to a remarkable film, that would otherwise have certainly made it one of the best films of the year.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

In my opinion it is well adapted from the book and almost very complete, though it lacks of the part of Tillade-Espeinasse. Some silly things are that the movie takes place at France, so they're meant to speak french, not English; and that the book describes Grenouille as an ugly and creepy guy, and the actor playing Grenouille was good looking. But above all these things,it's OK and the actors do a good job, and I must say again it's very well adapted to screen.

ROFL.. i can't like stop laughing after seeing that. That scene was totally insane.and more over the fantasy elements which is the core of this movie didn't impress me at all. the height of this fantasy element is revealed when the father who cares so much for his daughter calls the murderer his son. still for a 2 hours 25 minutes movie, it was totally engaging. and the guy who has played the murderer has performed well . the background scoring was exceptional.before seeing the scene which i previously mentioned i thought the director hasn't used nudity when it wasn't demanding. still that scene was the height of insanity . it was actually like watching a spoof movie. still u can check this one out. good entertainer in all means. ;)",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

However, when I had the chance to see a press showing of it, I knew I had to see it because Süskind's book was one of the highlights of my school career. I was pleasantly surprised - the movie is well done, beautifully filmed (I especially enjoyed the period details that always felt very down-to-earth and alive), and the main character was never attractive and actually quite creepy (although in my mind, Grenouille will probably always more resemble a Gollum-like creature).Putting scent into images, however, is even more difficult than putting them into words, in my opinion, and this is where the movie lacked. It just did not grip me the way the book had, did not pull me into this world of smells, and after 2 hours I started getting impatient for the story to finally move on and wrap up. All in all I think the movie could have been better, but it was definitely better than I'd feared and is well worth a look.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

I had no idea who was in it, who directed it, and I hadn't read the book.I was so incredibly blown away, it's three hours since I turned off the DVD player and I can't get it out of my mind.I don't even know where to start. The visuals in the film are so stunning, the acting is magnificent, and the characters are so beautifully written. I wanted to hate the character of Jean Baptiste for what he was and what he became, but found I simply could not. In the end I had nothing but sympathy for him.At the same time, while I felt sorry for his victims and the families of his victims, I've never (well, until now) seen a film in which the alienation and longing for connection in the amoral central character is so completely understandable.This film was as close to flawless as anything I have ever seen. I'm really going to have to pay more attention to the movies that Netflix suggests, because this was one of those, I doubt I ever would have seen it except for a random ""oh, what the hell"" thought.The critics really didn't love this film?? Good grief ... did they watch the same movie I saw?? Even the music was beyond belief. I finished the movie, took it out of the DVD player and ran to my closest neighbor so that she could watch it.

Then, I'm going to find a copy of the book and read it, and the soundtrack album so I can keep listening to that music.Right, I know, I'm babbling ... but there are times that something just runs over your soul like a cosmic steamroller, and this is what that was for me.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

For about the first hour the answer was a resounding yes. The early scenes in the fish market and particularly the first murder were expertly handled. Yet there is a fine line between sensuality and stylisation and as the film developed I felt it was slipping more towards the latter than the former. This culminated in the final few scenes which seemed to disintegrate into the ridiculous and eventually the downright comical. This was a particular pity for the last scene which, with its echos of the Orpheus myth should have been spectacular but was merely slightly grotesque and silly.

278,zvelf,Fairy tale about the objectification of women,10,11 January 2007,"Spoiler ALERT!I think the problem some people might have with this movie is that they carry an expectation of realism into it. While Tykwer plays a lot of the material straight-faced, this movie is really a black comic fairy tale. It has all the elements of a fairy tale from the special orphan born in a fish market to death following him everywhere. The climax requires one to go with the fairy tale into the most outrageous (and in my mind most audacious) territory virtually any movie has ever dared. I wasn't incredulous, but awed by Tykwer's daring to do something that would have been vetoed instantly in a Hollywood film. And yet, Perfume, with its meticulous production Design and sumptuous super-saturated photography, looks far better than most $100 million Hollywood movies.Furthermore, the film cleverly takes apart the fantasy of objectifying women. Of course in reality beautiful women, whether young or not, virgin or not, don't necessarily smell any better than anyone else. The reason to make them represent the perfect scent is because of a long societal tradition based on puritanical male fantasies that covet them. Objectification of women is all about reducing them into objects to be used in fantasy. Grenouille does this literally in creating his perfume from them that induces fantasies. The process of objectification involves removing what is human from what is objectified, thus removing the moral complications when they are used as fantasy. The metaphor for this dehumanization in the film is death since Grenouille must kill the women in order to reduce them to the essence of their scent. Only in the climatic moment, he discovers that fantasy isn't enough and he wants the human element. He wants real love over illusion, but it is too late.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The Parfume, in my opinion is a cheap thriller. There is only one ""elevated"" love: towards doing perfumes at the price of killing those lovely girls who really deserve love.

The film so fully engages our senses, especially our sense of smell that you can almost smell the on screen smells in the theater. (In the 60's there was a film experiment with a process called ""Aromarama"" where actual smells were released into the theater...this would have been the perfect film to do that with.) The visuals in the film are stunning and several of the scenes are unforgettable. In addition, the film takes a number of surprising turns keeping us off guard throughout. It's difficult to say too much about the plot without giving too much away, but the evocation of 18th century France is extraordinary. It's a film about a man's obsession to discover who he is and whether it is possible for him to love and be loved. Many people may find aspects of ""Perfume"" puzzling, but it's really quite carefully worked out thematically and gives us substantial insights into deeply lodged human needs and desires. We all want to make a difference in the world and the main character is driven by that need and the need to shape and discipline his talent so he can contribute something.

Scenes of Paris in the 1700's swirl around with the 2007 traffic and I marvel at the talent that transformed the incredibly descriptive pages of the book ""Perfume"" to such vivid pictures on screen. I read the book three times and gave it to many friends over the years. ""Here, read it. It is one of my favorites."" The main character, Ben Whishaw, possesses a gift for displaying both subtle and blatant emotions and the plot progresses with great rhythm, climaxing in a way you would never have thought possible. There are scenes that make you shudder and chuckle. You wonder if Jean-Baptist is an autistic child savant, a savage psychopath or a poor deranged soul in need of nothing but tenderness. The whole film bends your mind and goggles the eye.I always dreamed the book would be filmed and wondered who would dare and when it would happen. Then when I discovered the film was actually a reality I almost couldn't believe it, yet I worried that no artist could do the book justice. It was too rampantly alive and rich with sights and sounds and above all smells. Well, I just saw it and give the film 9 stars. The missing star is for taunting my nose and denying me the odors, stenches, aromas and perfumes.

It may not seem a particularly highbrow criticism to brand a film as 'boring' but I swear, you will wait for something to happen the entire 140 mins. of this film only for the embarrassment that is the 'climax' (no pun intended) to leave you cringing and wondering how this movie could even endanger the segment of success. Grenouille starts off with a very well developed sense of smell. By the time we reach the scene with him chasing after Richis he has somehow transformed this into a Spiderman like non-human ability to detect a scent from miles and miles away  simply adding to the film's already diminishing believability. There was also the ever-present and hugely irritating narration - constantly grinding away at, certainly for me, an already unimpressed and crabby viewer. Why must this movie cater for those who cannot follow a story and need to be baby-trotted through every stodgy scene? Admittedly the narration is probably an indication of the woolly and uninspiring script.I simply do not have the vocabulary to sum up this review with enough pomp that could render it ground-breaking, but what I will say is that for those of you who do decide to check out this quaint and embarrassing film be prepared to be left angry, fully unsatisfied and lamenting the fact that the final scenes have left you with no hair left to pull out!",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

There are, inevitably with a movie of this calibre, things to admire about the technical arts of film-making, photography, acting and so on but on the entertainment front it completely failed for me.

288,Naurya,The critics are wrong - Brilliant!,8,13 September 2006,"With ""The Perfume"" it's like with any blockbuster movie: if the critics praise it, it's horrible - if the critics hate it, it's brilliant.I had the chance to watch a preview of ""The Perfume"" tonight and I was very surprised: this movie is really good! Okay, it can't actually make you smell all the scents and odours, but the images and the music allow you to experience the atmosphere and the emotions Grenouille is feeling when he takes in the scents of his environment. You couldn't have done this much better without the use of real scents at theatres.Although much of the story is told by a narrative voice (mostly quotes from the novel), the movie is still thrilling and exciting all the way. It's a very good adaption of Süskind's novel, sticking to the original plot concerning the major events, leaving away unnecessary subplots (although it's a pity that funny ""lethal gas""-plot was cut out!) and shortening long passages. The result is well-constructed movie that is worth seeing.The actors, especially Whishaw who plays Grenouille, have done a very good job. Like in the novel, Grenouille is an ambivalent character and you never know whether to love him for his genius talent or to hate him for his cruel murders. Whishaw's half-crazy, scary gaze made me shiver. Dustin Hoffman as old and unsuccessful parfumeur Baldini was very convincing... I loved the way he talks to Grenouille arrogantly although he recognizes how much more talent the young man has. Baldini is always good for a laugh.The only thing to criticize is that the movie is not as brutal as the novel. I think they wanted to avoid the FSK 16 rating and so didn't show much violence, which in my opinion would have been necessary if you wanted the movie to have the same shocking impact on the audience as the novel. For example I was really shocked by the end of the novel - in the movie you hardly see what happens.However, it's really a thrilling story visualized excellently - go to the movies and watch ""The Perfume""!

For this Mom is hung and he is placed in an orphanage that makes Fagin's look inviting (his new brethren try to smother the baby). He is some sort of idiot-savant whose talent is being able to identify any odor. Next young Osmond is off to Paris where he catches a whiff of his first lady-love, who he runs down and strangles, and strips her while sniffing the corpse. There are lots more naked corpses (I think 12), the magic number he needs to scrape their odor-essences into a single potion that, when a drop is hoisted aloft on a handkerchief, causes the whole town instantly to disrobe and begin an orgy that makes Woodstock look sedate. The photography, both gross and beautiful, is very good. The music is excellent. The acting and direction are top-notch. But, to quote Luther as he debated Erasmus, the content is dung borne in a silver vessel. What is most disturbing is that the packaging has seduced anyone, other than Charles Manson and his girls, into thinking this movie is either Art or Romantic.

It's beautiful, but at the same time disgusting and terrifying. There's almost too much going on, and yet there's barely any dialogue from the protagonist (does he ever speak??) ... and yet, he still manages to express himself and his thoughts to the viewer fairly clearly, even though a lot of his actions have to be deconstructed by the viewer to figure out why he behaves in such a way...
It's very very artistic (in a good way), but it's a different ""artistic"" than I'm used to. It's not quirky, warm, or ""endearing""... it's in a whole other realm and I don't know if I'll ever see anything else like it (I kind of hope I don't...)
It's an extremely interesting film and I would definitely recommend it, however, years after I initially watched it, I still feel slightly sick and disturbed thinking about this film... It has definitely left an impression. Not the kind of film I'd go back and watch a 2nd time as it still kind of haunts me, but the fact that it has had such an impact on me is testament to the film. 
Go ahead and give it a watch, but don't expect the ""artyness"" of the film to be warm, inviting, or endearing... It's haunting, revealing of human nature and desire, and mind-boggling. At times it all becomes too much, you just have to hang in there and take a while to process the film after viewing before garnering a fixed opinion of it (it's taken me over 7 years and I'm STILL insure of how I feel).
I'm surprised the rating on this isn't higher (even though I've only scored a 7). I assume there are countless people out there who would adore this film. I just think I watched this film when I was too young (around 15), and it has scared and scarred me a little. Now that I'm older I can appreciate it more, but it still leaves a dark and twisted aftertaste which makes me cringe at the thought of watching it again. I realise I probably should watch this film again (with my newfound maturity and outlook on life/the world), but I honestly don't think I can bring myself to do so... I just wish I didn't watch it when I was still young enough to be afraid of the bloody dark. I thought it was a rom-com!!!! 
Overall, I think this film is horribly good and deserves to be watched by everyone. It's too maniacal, thought-provoking, raw, and twisted to be loved by all, but that's also what makes this film stand out. I can see that this film would go straight over some peoples' heads and be labeled as trash. You just have to pay attention and have a ""think outside the box"" mentality... Just watch the film and you'll understand why I'm so conflicted about this bloody film!!!!",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
291,jaespinoza,A Very Good Movie,9,14 November 2006,"When you read a book like ""Perfume"" by Patrick Suskind, you realize that a movie about could be kinda difficult to make, but Tom Tywker makes a very good job in all the fields (direction, adaptation and music score). It was a very difficult task to perform, but he delivers a sensitive work. I was a little skeptic about, specially since i saw ""Heaven"" (a very misleading job that Cate Blanchet was unable to save), but he delivers a very passionate work.Dustin Hoffman delivers an Academy Award worthy performance. And Alan Rickman is also very good. But the surprise is the lead performer: Ben Whishaw. Sensitive, inspired and perfect for the role.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

293,profligate,This movie doesn't know what it wants to be,2,20 June 2009,"This schizophrenic movie sort of gives you three really bad stories in one. It starts out as an historical fable about perfume with perfumers who live in stench, pull water straight out of the Seine and then can discern fine scents at distances and with spatial accuracy that would stump a pack of drug-sniffing canine. Then it morphs into a serial murder mystery. Then it becomes a sort of sci-fi fantasy with the power of scent overcoming human individuality and free-will. It's terrible at all three. If you have a fragile suspension of disbelief this movie has too many non-sequiturs, inconsistencies and inaccuracies to ignore.

296,sneakythief-1,Pretty decent. Until...,7,7 October 2008,"OK look, its pretty good. In fact I'll just say its good. Ben Whishaw is excellently freaky as the talented but disturbed Jean Baptiste, and I've never seen Dustin Hoffman in a role I didn't enjoy. Alan Rickman is, well, Alan Rickman, but there's not really anything wrong with that as far as I'm concerned.All goes well for the most part; I'm a fan of my serial killer flicks, and this is a fairly obscure one which always makes for a bit of intrigue. Put simply, Jean Baptiste is killing women so that he can save their smells and turn them into one great perfume. Once he's finished his perfume and gets caught for his crimes is where this film starts to really lose itself. Like really, really lose itself.This is where the spoilers really start by the way, and if you still want to watch this film and enjoy it, you should probably stop reading now. So they've got Jean Baptiste on the chopping block, and everything looks like its going to be resolved the way we were all expecting... but apparently, once they smell the ""Essence of Dead Girl"" perfume, they consider him innocent. Not only do they deem him innocent, that delightful, delightful aroma apparently also it impossible to leave your clothes on. And resist fornicating with those around you. Go figure.I'm not even going to mention the very last scene because it is so ridiculous.

The combination of an outstanding soundtrack, with beautiful scenography, photography and framing makes it so stimulating, is like you almost can smell the scent, or at least really want to smell and try what the characters are feeling. Full of non predictable scenes and story, which makes the package of the entire movie an totally worth watching.

300,Ce_Aqatl,A philosophical allegory instead of a slasher flick,10,19 September 2006,"Before getting to see the film's centerpiece, Grenouille's execution-turned-apotheosis, I was convinced that I'd been watching a mesmerizingly shocking, exquisite, thought-provoking, but still quite ""genre"" maniac thriller. But this scene gives Perfume quite a new dimension. Call me crazy, but the protagonist is no mere psycho obsessed with smells that would kill to get the perfect aroma. Grenouille is a Christ-like figure in a sense - precisely, an Antichrist. Tykwer has, wittingly or not, ostentated the religious undertones of the novel. If you watch the movie carefully, you would note that events from Grenouille's life resemble the earthly life of Christ in a twisted, parodical way: from his miraculous escape from death in childhood to his calvary, the central character follows Jesus' footsteps. The central scene that made me write this comment is the climax of Grenouille's exploits. Like the true Antichrist, he uses miraculous devices to escape an ignominious death on the cross and fascinates the crowd with his near-magical perfume, becoming a likeness of God in their eyes. This is not to imply that Perfume is a religious allegory or subtle Christian propaganda - in fact, it can be deemed as anticlerical and ultimately as anti-religious. However, it uses a singularly powerful cultural archetype to make Grenouille's triumph and tragedy even more captivating - and succeeds. One can only wonder why so many critics have missed the point.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

If you have a mind and you are able to think, this movie maybe something for you. The characters in the movie are strong, you sympathize with them easily. It is upsetting why the main character is killing the girls, as it is actually unnecessary. The sceneries and costumes look great. I felt like I was there.

302,crabtfn,Bizarre adult fairy tale,1,30 May 2007,The basic plot of this movie is extremely bizarre and far from reality. I guess the author intended it as some kind of obscene adult fairy tale. In the beginning it was hard to decide if the author wanted this to be a comedy or a drama. I wonder what kind of person would fabricate a tale in which the hero is a twisted perverted serial killer. From reading some of the other comments the author was successful in making many of the viewers identify and sympathize with the pervert.I would consider this film as the lowest form of obscenity. I wonder what kind of drugs the author and producer were using when they produced this worthless piece of porn.

Closer to the end, the movie allows the audience to realize that he has no smell(cave scene) The crowd scenes were great with the reactions, and the first time he makes a perfume for Baldini, the perception of Baldini's reaction was wonderful. I'm extremely happy how directors and screenplay writers make it almost identical save for a few parts and make that into a wonderful movie. The actors were great, especially Winshaw and Hoffman.

From start to its ridiculous finish, it kept dragging on. There was no character development, the acting was amateurish at best and the direction was haphazard. You just don't feel for the victims and in a way, for the main character himself. There's no connection as to why he is doing what he is doing. All you know is that he has a very, very acute sense of smell and he wants to ""keep"" the smell of a woman. Thats it. The next 10 hours (it felt like that) of the movie, it was just him killing his victims and finding ways to get the essence of his victims. Don't get me started about its ending. Dumb is all I can think of. Its like they decided since we wasted 2 1/2 hours of a movie-goers life, lets give him an ending thats not really an ending. The only good thing about the movie was its shooting location and camera-work. It really brought you back to 18th century France.

Of course it's fantasy, but it makes one think about how we perceive reality. The camera work and music are spectacular, giving a hint of the world that the subject Grenouille inhabits. Because we are all so accustomed to perceiving the world through our eyes and ears, it's stimulating to try and relate to the subtext of the film. While the film traces the life and obsession of a madman, it does so without a lot of visceral gore and mayhem. The obsession of Grenouille, to capture the ultimate scent, of love, of life, of the soul, is doomed, and so is he. In the end he holds the ultimate power over men and women, however, in his mind it comes to nothing as he comes to learn that he can never be like all the rest.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

312,claudette-flint,The Perfume: how a genius nose can lead you to Heaven and Hell...on earth,9,11 January 2007,"This film was run down before it came out. One critic said the voice off exasperated him. So I went into the cinema expecting the rubbish of the year. I was exasperated but not by the film, but by the people who condemned it, because someone dares to touch their favourite book; because they can't face or admit it is a very good film, because it is the intellectual fashion to run down some kinds of films. Tom Tykwer managed to recreate the dark side of the atmosphere of the XVIIth century (17th) in France; then you understand how it could have produced a ""creature"" like JB Grenouille. I had for him the same compassion and pity I had for Gollum: human beings growing without any love but with great intelligence or power. The voice over felt normal, even necessary as it is a tale after all: the tale of the perfume that will make you control the world through love. The black magic operated by the story is that you can't help being on the side of Evil. Some scenes seem to come out of a Dutch or a Jerome Bosch's painting. The thing I found odd, but this is personal, is the film speaking English with French subtitles whereas the story takes place in France! It is an interpretation of the book and I found it original, quite faithful, as disturbing as the story and definitely worth seeing. I could not have done better ;-)",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Doesn't need extra focus like watching The Prestige (2006). I bet so many people who hated this film were trying to figure out what happened half of it and forgot to enjoy.I've read the book when I was 16 yo and recommended it to my friend and he told me there's a film based on the book that I didn't know exists. I bought the DVD and I'm not disappointed. Pleased even. It's hard to imagine a 16th century Paris but when I saw the film I thought, 'that's how I would've imagine it!'. And when I read the name Jean-Baptiste Grenouille I didn't see any face. I characterized the name. But when I saw Ben Wishaw, it's like, I knew it'd be him.Yes, some scenes aren't similar compared to the book. But it's still good. The pace is slow but necessary.

I confess I didn't believe in the movie before i saw it. I had my prejudices. But I was willing to let myself be won over. It didn't happen.And to those of you, who argue that a movie can't make you smell odors, well ... how come a book can? Because that's the artistry of ""the perfume"". Thats the point.

Dustin Hoffman was great, Alan Rickman, too. But the film in its whole was dull. Ben Whishaw, who starred in it and the director have the responsibility for turning it into a dull and sicky project. So much art went wasted, I think, they had a good intention, but it seems that something went wrong in the ""montage"" and it makes you think everything happened in a rush...

The execution sequences look like a paroxysm in Woodstock and the sequences of the killer's end look like the Dracula slaves wishing their master. Well, except the photography and the atmosphere of how life could be back in XVIII century, this film is a real botched script and content. The film could've taken more advantage of the most interesting moment of the film, at least it could've tried to transmit the sensation of smelling, when both the protagonist and the veteran perfumer meet.

318,mlawrencewyatt,Don't hate me,5,24 September 2006,"I have never had such mixed feelings for a film. The first seven eighths of the movie are tense, shocking, beautiful, horrifying, and sublime. To that point, it is so well done that you think you can smell everything on the screen. Every character has depth, every line has just the right gravity, and every movement takes us deeper into the story.Then comes the ending. If I were to give away the ending, you wouldn't want to see ""Das Parfum""--not because I would have ruined a clever twist, or eliminated a fundamental tension, but because the film ruins itself. The last ten or fifteen minutes flop onto the screen and demolish the mood and meaning that the rest of the film has constructed. I understand that this is also the way then novel ends, but it is nevertheless a poor ending. The work forsakes its entire essence in order to make cheap misanthropic and sacrilegious jabs.Still, most of this movie is a masterpiece. Alan Rickman is one of my all-time favorite actors, and he surprised even me with his performance. The score is largely excellent; it's a little over the top in parts, but still effective.I gave it a five star rating because I'm torn exactly down the middle on this one.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
319,echarlesgoodall,charming and sinister,10,17 June 2012,"The film gets a full 10 for its amazing creativity. There was the mystery component, and though we were in on the events we could not know what would happen next. The atmosphere and historical backdrop was exceptionally well developed and that alone is worth the viewing. Characters were thoroughly revealed throughout the course of the story. After all the surprize twists, the ending really pulls it all together in one great blast of art and wild creativity that is a summary of great writing and film-making. I was reminded of a Fellini film or something of that type from the 1970's, when films were glossier than most are these days.Definitely this film may offend some people, as this is not mainstream cinema and there are ideas and ""mature themes, especially psychological ones, being explored here that many people would prefer not to have to consider.A story of murder it is, and so it has its moments of real deep horror, as an event like that should have. As the producers were apparently not seeking the approval of a mainstream audience, the film-makers were able to bend the art-form a little further than we are accustomed to seeing. Art is not always easy to digest and does not have to be accepted by the masses to be good art. The score, by the way, is excellent.I am reminded of another film, ""Mary Reilly"" with Julia Roberts and John Malcovich. That was also a dark and sinister film with antisocial themes, but as it was carried by two very big Hollywood screen stars, and follows the familiar ""Jekyl & Hyde"" story, it may have been more acceptable to a larger audience compared with this. It also reminds me of ""Chocolat"" because of its whimsy and free-form story-telling that compels a viewer to watch in a kind of curious trance. Although this film makes me think about other film experiences, it's not because it directly references them as much as it is an ingenious and unique film as they are, and so it really stands out.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

So to do another friend a favour, I watched the film with him and really tried to see it without any prejudice. But the pain started already in the very beginning with bad editing and bad sound design during the birth of the main character, where everything was intended to be over realistic and intense but was torn into pieces by ridiculous slapstick effects. Anyway, I ignored that and the next 30 minutes were roughly OK. But then the pain starts again when he main character's real obsession is revealed. Everything is narrated by an off voice. You are not watching a movie but you're listening to a story, told by somebody. No, not the slightest character development, no dialog that shows us a feeling, an insight, a real motif, nothing. But to make it even worse, everything is so predictable, so un-suspenseful, then the near ending is pure slapstick again and the real ending is once more supposed to be meaningful but is only... I don't know, I simply couldn't take this serious anymore. Now, what really annoys me, is the fact that I spent money on this nonsense and the fact, that I will have to wait quite a time before i can read the book without having this bad movie in mind. What a pity, what could have been done with such a strong plot - I don't know the original plot, but even with the plot of the movie version.

We soon find that what we know about ourselves is worthless unless we can find tangible ways to share our purpose with the world. But what happens when our gift is driven by dark obsessions? When we spend our lives morally detached from the world, how do we learn to care, how do we learn to love, how do we differentiate evil from good? Or does evil ever really know that it is evil? Or is evil only based on perspective? All these questions are put into action by Perfume.Jean-Batiste Grenouille wasn't food, fashion, or book lover like us, he had a special obsession, one that was consuming him, a magical sense of smell. There was not any smell that was hidden from him. He could smell dust, water, rock, stone, frog, iron, rotten rat human body and etc. Every day he encountered new smells and added them to the list of known smells without even knowing their source. Eventually, his obsession gained control of him to make him one of the most feared murderers of his time.It is very tough to visualize smells in the movie but for me, it was expressed pretty well. Even you can not smell things, you can imagine how they smell, which is brilliant. It was also very artistic, but it was a different ""artistic"" than I'm used to. It wasn't creepy, warm, or charming, it was a whole different ball game and I don't know if I'll ever see anything else like it or not.

325,zarplex2003,"Magical, Riveting, and... Disturbing?",6,4 October 2007,"It's difficult to determine what to think about this movie when seeing it for the first time. The acting by Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman was as good as their particular roles could've offered. Ben Whishaw was very good. I was actually beginning to wonder whether or not this role left him with any permanent nasal damage from all the sniffing that he had to do. =) The movie was visually very pleasing and very sensual/provocative.However, despite claims that his movie was much like the book without all the violence, it proved to be disturbing just the same. And I'm left in a state of confusion when people make bold remarks that this movie wasn't violent. I am certain that my mother couldn't sit through this movie because of the disturbing imagery and violent acts that take place. However, if you read my other reviews, you'll already know that I'm pretty desensitized, so these things shouldn't bother me.What bothered me most about this movie was how fantastical and sensational they made the main character appear towards the end when I already had feelings of disgust from all the violent acts that he committed in order to make this most aphrodisiacal of perfumes ever invented. I saw him more as the anti-Christ and I wanted him to be gunned down by a S.W.A.T. team armed with air-compressed ArmaLite semi-automatics pumping round after round at him and have his perfume confiscated, and of course they would all have to be wearing gas masks when they did this because otherwise this movie would escalate into another ""My Own Private Idaho"" or ""Brokeback Mountain"" (with way more cowboys) and I really wouldn't want to see that. I know I'm supposed to be captivated by this film, but it's really hard to when I haven't been shown any likable qualities about this character, except for his passion to preserve scent, which could be considered an admirable quality by any artist who is 100% passionate (not to mention professional) about his work.Also, I'd like to comment on the fact that this movie was really long, yet not nearly complex enough to warrant the length.An interesting fact about this movie is that the music, which I thought was very well written, was written by none other than the director, who also directed Run, Lola, Run.If I could give this movie six and a half stars, I would. But since I'm restricted between giving it six and seven stars, I'll have to give it a six.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The locations, acting, 18th century machinery and enfluerage factory in Grasse were all very interesting and appealing. The plum girl (or was it apricots?) that set Grenoille on his cursed quest was enchanting. However, for me, the ending was flat and ridiculous, and only a good excuse for the largest filmed orgy ever.How could the scrapings and distillations of murdered wives and daughters percolated into ""spirits"" be anything but evil? I fully expected a parade of demons or the undead or something to pay divine retribution to Grenouille for his murderous gluttony when he uncorked the small bottle somehow hidden on his person through days or weeks of trial and torture. What I didn't expect was the world's most transcendent, mind-altering perfume d'amor being produced from the wicked acts of an idiot savante.Up through Act 2 of this film, I almost couldn't wait to tell my friends about it. Act 3 pulled the rug out from under me. I give it a 5 for sets and location.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

330,laura-bingham1975,Worth seeing if you haven't read the book,6,2 December 2006,"A passable adaptation of Patrick Suskind's exceptional novel,""Perfume"". The premise of the story is based on the notion that unknown to people, it is scent, not physical beauty, that attracts us to a particular person. It is scent (today, psychologists would say, pheromones) that spellbinds us and makes us warm to and love others. So while this is the story of a socially inept man, his crimes, his passion for the making of perfume and his unfortunate upbringing in the city of Paris, it's also a commentary on people. It posits that we, unlike the main character Grenouille, are unaware of and lack a sense of control for the most important sense that governs our lives.You could make the mistake of watching this movie, believing, that after all, your senses will awaken more strongly to the sight of images on the big screen rather than to words in a book. You are wrong. If you watch ""Perfume"", you will not be transported to the stench of 18th century France, nor will you partake in Grenouille's supernatural olfactory gift. You will not experience his brutal, miserly upbringing, nor will you delight in his colorful journey towards the discovery of perfume making. You will fail to understand his drive to create a unique perfume even at the cost of murdering women, of murdering one virgin after another with no regard for life. In short, you will become like the bygone perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini. Watching this film would be like smelling and falling under the spell of ""Amor and Psyche"" and yet, failing to distinguish its individual components. Finally if you haven't read the book, you may even shun Suskind's evocative masterpiece. That would be a terrible loss.The film is far too prude, perhaps even naive, in its exploration of Grenouille's psyche. While reading the book, I remember feeling a mixture of pity, repulsion, dislike and much later, respect, for a genius that I could not understand and who, though socially amoral, still managed to inspire admiration for his talent and his personal integrity. In the film though, the main character's complexity is cheaply diluted. Grenouille is not portrayed with the same motivations and drive. The film's portrayal was almost comical rather than psychopathic.The off screen narrator is far too annoying. I have not felt like this about a narrator since Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"". With ""Perfume"", every time I tried to lose myself in the sensory journey, here he was, distracting me again, telling me what Grenouille was supposedly thinking at every passing moment. This was very frustrating considering that having read the book, I knew what Grenouille was supposed to be thinking and it was significantly different.One of the climatic scenes sees Grenouille testing his powerful perfume. The effect he has on the mass of people is well done in the film. But the very final scene, in Paris, where the great perfumer makes a life changing decision after so many years of intense searching and self-discipline, that scene was pathetically staged. The remote shot distances us from the carnage and doesn't make the powerful point it should. The book's depiction evokes flesh, blood and orgiastic cannibalism and leads the reader to a suspenseful, horrifying climax so that the reader is called to contrast the senseless behaviour of mere mortals under the effect of powerful scents, with that of a genius who had to live with such powerful scents all his life.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
331,c-i-z-ler,Extraordinarily close to the book,10,5 December 2006,"This movie is fantastic. Why? Well, because it follows the book so closely, and the book is so marvelous. I should say I've seen the French version of this movie, and I think that was a good choice. Normally I wouldn't say so but this movie is about a Frenchman, it takes place in France and the French narrators voice, for instance, is far more compelling. Every major scene from the book is in the movie except one, which is a shame. However, it is an understandable choice.Every scene has the right atmosphere, just enough lighting. The acting is great. And the most important thing, they haven't altered the plot immensely or shied away to much from nudity or violence.In short this is as close to a masterpiece as it can be, making a movie from a book, that could not be made into a movie.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The film is narrated to ensure the audience understands some of the concepts and some parts of the plot were ""dumbed-down"" to make sure the audience got the point.Unfortunately, much of the book had to be skipped in the interest of time  much of Grenouille's childhood is glossed over and the bit after the cave visit is completely omitted.Despite this, the atmospheric sets and brilliant acting (with the exception of a disappointing Mr. Hoffman, who really does not have the stature of a master Parisian perfumer) kept me completely enthralled.As in the original book, there is quite a bit of nudity, which is tastefully done, but I will be interested to see how this is swallowed in America  it will probably get an 18 rating or be cut down, which is a shame, it was given a 12 rating in Germany.In summary, a really great film, but probably best if you have read the book beforehand..",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

I could hardly contain my excitement as Grenouille made Amour and Psyche for Baldini. This scene alone is priceless and my favorite of all. Dustin Hoffman is quite funny as Baldini. I didn't realize it was him until reading the cover. I think Ben Whishaw is perfect in character and in look. He is not that good looking, but does look fairly harmless. All were well acted. The time period and scenery were captured wonderfully. This movie is successful in capturing the ""scent of all things"" with sight.

Truly speaking I wanted to read the book in German but unfortunately I am not so good at it. What I'd like to say first I was impressed by the book, it opened me the world of perfumes and I learned much about it though I can't say I am fond of perfumes and really I have only one bottle of perfume at home now. I read all the words and lines in the book not missing anything. The film reproduced the atmosphere of France at that time.I became absorbed in the atmosphere of it.Certainly I felt pity for killed girls, the murders of girls were terrible. Grenoire had no childhood, had nobody to love and nobody who loved him. I think this circumstance made him cruel. He was mad about smells,scents as a maniac. Nobody could stop him. When he did all he wanted he understood that he had no reason to live any more, no purpose in life and nobody near him. It's awful.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

On the contrary, if you are in the right mood, believe me, ten minutes after the start you will begin to smell everything that Grenouille can smell, even here in the movie theater. There is an abundance of moments in the film that will make you feel frightened, repelled, enraptured and even...in love.

And I am glad to say ""Perfume"" lived up too all I was told.From the start, how the lighting was done in the dark dungeon and the slash editing of Grenouille birth, you are pulled into this world, his world, of smell though visual genius. I couldn't stop being impressed by every new scene that came on.The murdering of the girls was done in a way that shows you that Grenouille wasn't a violent person, but was madly driven to achieve his goal. Yet you find yourself at a cross road asking yourself if you want him to carry on and find what he is looking for, or to stop this madness. Due to fact that the victims where filmed and found in almost a beautiful yet disturbing way , I was asking for the former, I wanted him find that ""moment of paradise"" that Dustin Hoffman alludes too. I was also glad to Alan Rickman in a decent movie again.That being said, I would have like to see the film in French. When I see English actors playing French characters without so much as an attempt at an accent, it just bugs me, however the power of the film was not in the script writing but in the stunning cinematography.The end was a bit ""weird"".

First of all, because it's about smell, something difficult to render in images. I did't like the nose-close-ups, it was so predictable...Although there were nice images and sounds, they didn't always convince me about Grenouille feelings and sensations and made him look like a freak. The idea of the book is that although Jean Baptiste is a kind of a freak, he is ""saved"" by his unnatural gift and so becomes a ""special"" person that kills for the sake of ""art"" and ""smells"". Doesn't make him better but gives the book another ""light"" that the movie didn't seem to have.I liked the images with the baby at the beginning, very shocking seeing so much violence against a new-born and done in a very realistic way. Also I appreciated the sets and the way the Paris atmosphere from those days was recreated.What I found a little ""light"" was the whole atmosphere of the movie, especially the crimes and the violent scenes. I don't say I would have liked it but it would have been better more shocking scenes, like Suskind created them in his book. It's a very unusual story that can't be told in a calm and childish tone.Also, I didn't like the ""narator"" ! Come on ! It seemed as if he would tell us ""Sleeping beauty"". It would have been better a nice, shocking, more realistic FRENH movie. I understand they wanted to make it more commercial and for all types but it just AIN'T a story for all types.

Besides its value as an effective appetite-suppressant, I could find no merit to this movie. It barely had a plot, its denouement was inane, and there was no protagonist. When a movie has no detectable moral-of-the-story, and the only thing keeping one in suspense is when there will ever come a point at which there IS a point, then, if the content is gratuitously disgusting enough, one can recommend it only as a dieting aid or a purgative.And, people of Provence are not implicated herein.

It's not too late for him to take his name off the roster, though, because if no one knows he's supposed to be in this sick flick, it's quite probable they won't know he was ever in it.Perfume: don't even take a whiff--it STINKS!",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
360,liquidphotography,A great movie adaption of a book that didn't seem possible to translate to film.,9,30 January 2007,"The movie did a wonderful job of capturing the descriptives/fine details of this classic. It was ""smell-a-vision"" without having aroma piped in. The use of narration (John Hurt-perfect choice), vivid visuals and a eerie musical score really did the novel justice. Essential to the film's telling of the story was it's casting. I will just mention a few. The lead character (Grenouille) I felt needed to be cast as a average/ good looking actor (Ben Whishaw) rather than a grotesque hideous man in order to blend in with the masses. This way he was more believable to the audience, as ""invisible"". Dustin Hoffman's character (Giuseppe Baldini) was a highlight of the film and my personal favorite. An Oscar worthy performance I may note. And finally, Alan Rickmans' character (Antoine Richis) made you feel every bit of his pain, anguish and concern he had for is naive young daughter played by the beautiful and vivacious Rachel Hurd-Wood. I highly recommend this well done movie.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
361,mike0011,Waste of Time! Just skip it.,3,5 September 2007,"I liked Alan Rickman. Thats all for likes. What I didn't like: 1. The plot and the main idea are so ridiculous, that any human with the smallest scientific background or even common sense would be annoyed by the movie. Smell is simply some molecules that move by diffusion through the air  which is a slow process, especially without the moving air. That killed the rest of the movie for me. 2. In average, human capacity for smell is very limited, even compared to animals. Even though some research has shown that human behavior, thoughts and even physiological processes could be somewhat influenced by pheromones, it's a very long process and does NOT mentally incapacitate people. We just lack the physiological capacity to be possessed by the smells. 3. The whole plot is like a dream of a psychopath. If they film every nutcase' ideas  Gd help us!

I replied no we have to see how this train wreck unwinds. Eventually, it appeared to be ending several times. But no, it seemed the makers either wanted to prolong the suffering or could not figure out how to end it. Scary? No; Lascivious? No. Thought provoking? In my opinion it is perhaps thought provoking if you are a college sophomore trying desperately to fit in with people who have convinced you that they are sophisticated. Romantic? Perhaps it is romantic if your name is Wayne Gacey or Charles Manson.I thought the large groups of naked people were posing for the kind of painting you might see on the ceiling of a cathedral.

363,argus-10,Film as an exciting synaesthetic and intermedial experience,8,27 September 2006,"When Patrick Süskind's novel The Perfume was first published in Germany in 1985, I soon read it, and with great pleasure. The author succeeded in rendering the universe of Grenouille, a human being with an infallible nose. Grenouille's ability to tell what a man has eaten or done hours before by the smell he emits is a source of surprise and amusement for the reader. Sure enough, the novel depends on the faculty of language to name and describe almost everything, odors included.When the screen adaptation was advertised, I asked myself how scent was going to be rendered by this medium. The simplest means is to show things, for example dead fish or young ladies, and then show Grenouille sniffing, so the spectator knows what Grenouille is smelling. The film makes indeed ample use of this means. But there is more to it. Our senses are not as independent of each other as it may seem. Physiologists or our own experience tell us that sense of smell and of taste are intimately connected, and poets have discovered long ago that vowels may evoke colors and that the smell of fancy cakes dipped into tea may raise childhood memories. Simply showing a fruit or a flower can thus evoke its smell, and the film makes use of this means also.Compared to the eye, the nose is a sense organ of short distances. In the film, the camera approaches its objects to such a degree that you can discern e.g. every hair and pore of a human skin. But with Grenouille, the nose bridges also long distances. When he pursues Laura and her father, the camera follows in acceleration the trace of scent the two left from the bifurcation where Grenouille is sniffing around up to their actual position miles ahead.Odors can provoke visions. The film shows us the flowers and maidens Baldini sees when he smells the perfume Grenouille has mixed. Baldini teaches Grenouille that a good perfume is composed of twelve single essences, grouped into three chords of four which become discernible in the course of time. Now this combination of simultaneity and succession is also a characteristic of music (harmony and melody), and in fact, the harmony-centered film music causes feelings of well-being which might stem also from a well-prepared scent.In one scene towards the end of the film, Grenouille's perfume acts like a drug. A whole crowd falls into a love-delirium. People strip off their clothes and embrace each other. The screen fills up with masses of human flesh similar to a Rubens canvas.Apart from these intermedial features, the film offers also a lively illustration of 18th-century France. Highly recommended!",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Tom Tykwer manages to keep a fine balance between art house and blockbuster, and skilfully evokes the beauty and grime of 18th century France. The cinematography by Frank Griebe and the editing by Alexander Berner are outstanding. Newcomer Ben Whishaw really manages to carry the film on his small shoulders and Alan Rickman as his nemesis is excellent as usual.

373,spqqky97,A potentially good plot ruined by an awful script and an ambitious director,3,19 November 2006,"The movie starts with the background of the hero and that was the interesting part of the movie. Soon after the movie attempts to describe the 'scent' of the movie through a flood of images. That's when the story started to be boring and the film started running out of time. The obsession of the character to create the perfect scent starts when he smells the scent of a woman. The plot started to be interesting from the point that the main character had no scent of his own. Well I said that is it now the film can only be better but I was wrong. If someone seeks the answer of 'what a combination of a scent of 12 beautiful women can do', must watch this movie. I must admit that the exaggeration of the movie spoilt any good will of judging the movie with an open mind. The film is listed under thriller genre. I would say that the whole thriller action was spent on the 4 minutes memoir of the killing of 11 women, the reaction of the public, the terror spread in the town, the incapability of the police to solve the mystery, the strategy of the town to catch the killer, the part of the church in the whole story, the pain of a father losing a daughter and the so close incident of losing the second. Really catching the 13th woman at that point would spoil another interesting part of the movie 'how to scent your victim from miles away'. Finally a film with no naked female body is likely to have any success. Since the director was aiming high he thought why instead of having 2-3 naked women don't we put 2-3000. At least everybody was happy at the end except of the father of the two girls who apart from losing 2 daughters in the same movie he had no sex. What a pity. At least the movie didn't leave the crowd hungry at the end. I really believe if the movie was more action-thriller oriented could be a movie to remember. After all its a matter of taking the right decisions. Writing a drama and concentrating on photography on a script that has no romance is a risk. I think the movie does not worth spending money to watch it. I can't believe how this movie has better voting than the brotherhood of the wolf. It must be the karate matrix scenes.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
374,filip-galic,Inch close of being a master-piece,8,13 November 2006,"I entered theater with only one thought, that this movie won't be some stereotypic serial-murderer movie. And from first scene until third/fourth before the end the movie felt like 'something'. From his humble beginnings as worker until his notorious killings, I felt as if Grenouille was really portrayed as dark, cunning, yet somewhat tragic character, my favourite . His own search for ultimate perfume varied from devoted, to maniacal.Then we came to hanging scene. I am practically always pleasantly surprised with sudden turn of events. But this time, I wasn't. Actually, this is not sudden turn of events that made movie good...it removed attribute 'master-piece' from it. May be too strong word for Perfume which won't be too much remembered, but will surely be known among movie fans by one really good movie. But hanging scene was simply too much. When you portray character in such style, you don't usually make him total hero. He is anti-hero and should remain like that, his tone has to be a tragic one, not start like one and finishing like other. To compare it, I'd take this movie looks like when a child is trying to draw perfect circle only with his hands and all goes well, but when he has to connect first and last spot, he misses it. This felt same for Perfume. Excellent going, but first and last point were missed, thus having not-perfect circle.I have not read the book so I can't say if this is accurate adaptation, but for this movie, it simply doesn't work. Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman had their short nice roles, although I think Hoffman could have got more space.Overall, must see movie.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Unless there was very clever CGI, what appeared to be a day old baby covered in blood lying on a pile of rotting waste with rats running around is only remarkable in that it passed the film censors. Watching a man relishing his sniffing every part and crevasse of a woman's dead body was enough to propel us out the door of the Cinema.

377,obradovic-jelena,Much potential but disastrous adaptation,4,16 January 2007,"The biggest problem with this film is that it concentrates too hard on conveying the sense of place rather than the subtleties of the story. The end result is a costume drama with sweeping music. Even the acting is a let down. Dustin Hoffman portrays Baldini as comical and almost camp, Wishart is far to young and pretty to play Grenouille, and all the characters and governors who join in the hunt for the killer look like they have just stepped off the set of a BBC drama.I think this film would have fared much better as an exercise in minimalism. Forget the stuffy costumes, the visually overcrowded sets and the awful cockney accents. Cinematography practised with more restraint would have been much more successful because the audience would have been allowed to concentrate and contemplate Grenouille's actions and the moral implications of the story. In this way, all the subtleties of the story are lost. The audience never feels anything for Grenuoille because it doesn't get a chance to. The film's aesthetics command too much of your attention and all of the psychic complexities of Grenouille's character (the inability to feel, the reason for his capturing of the scent, the meaning of the last scene) are lost in this visually polluted film.The voice-over is a disaster - sounds like something from a children's film. The same with the final scenes. I wasn't happy with them in the book either, but this is where the film goes from average Hollywood-type production to misguided direction and production. It is this, the voice-over, costumes, comical characters and cockney accents lowered the tone of the film.Also, can't help but feel that this would have worked much better in French!

382,benbandara,BrownPolar Review: Love's the Cure,10,9 April 2008,"According to anthropologists, the lifelong, mammalian bond that develops between a mother and her child has been the secret behind the human evolutionary success. It is now well understood that this bond has much to do with pheromones or, in other words, the smell of a mother that a child finds comfort in. In my opinion that is also the greatest weakness of the human condition: loved, well-fed, cared for and gradually accustomed to the society, a child develops into a loving, caring and responsible citizen, no matter where he or she is; if instead hated, neglected, abused and abandoned he or she can become a savage monster filled with bitterness, hatred and longing for love, that warm and protective smell of the mother, and may do anything, including rape and murder in order to recapture the lost smell of belonging.As I understand this is the theme behind Patrick Suskind's engrossing and complex bestseller, 'Perfume', which is not an easy subject for a film. But, Tom Tykwer, who hasn't got a step wrong since his phenomenal success, Run Lola Run, if not before, has characteristically seized the challenge, not by just conventionally adapting the book to the screen, but, in effect, developing a cinematic abstract of it much the same way as an experienced researcher summarises a 200,000-word thesis into a 300-word précis. To me, Tykwer's film looks, feels and, more importantly, smells just the way I conceived the book after reading it in a secluded Cornish coastal resort some twenty years ago, convincing me that Tykwer and his co-writers read the book, put it aside and wrote a screenplay, probably much later, of what their senses had distilled in tangible imagery and feelings. The result is not a laboriously crafted adaptation, but rather a new 'Perfume' in a totally different medium, and is as adorable and effective on its own right as the book itself.Every set, frame, angle and camera moment of this film has been thoughtfully conceived and painstakingly executed to capture and enhance that abstract perception of the book, so much so that the viewer not only sees the sumptuous recreation of a bygone era, but also smells its atmosphere and, above all, feels and experiences the turbulent mind of the protagonist, perfectly cast and played by Ben Whishaw. The excellent contributions of the rest of the cast, in particular Alan Rickman in one of his strongest performances ever, complete the equation making this one of the most unforgettable cinematic experiences of all time. As he did with 'Run Lola Run' Tykwer also contributes to the blistering score conducted by Sir Simon Rattle, which somehow resonates with the work of Zbigniew Preisner, yet again showing Tykwer's enduring admiration for the work of Krzysztof Kieślowski, as he did by making Heaven (2000), an unfinished screenplay by the late master.The mass hypnotism and orgy at the end of the film undoubtedly is one of the best sequences ever filmed and should be cherished as a modern classic.BrownPolar Edinburgh April 2008",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Jean-Baptiste is someone special since he is born, in the middle of a fish market, where the smelling was everywhere except in him. As he grows, the scents and smelling become his path for pleasure, for recognizing, for commitments. In his memories he keeps all kind of scents, even without knowing where they come from, and he tries to bring them back to reality, as perfumes. When he achieves it, he attempts to create his best perfume, moral apart, regardless of the way he does it. 'Das Parfurm', is a great manufactured film, no doubt, great scenarios, great cinematography, create custom design. The film, although basically a German production, was filmed in English, not being the first time (perhaps for an international appeal?), and not so important for the German audience (as it's common to see dubbed versions). I didn't actually mention 'good editing' among the virtues of 'Das Parfüm'. Some of the most exciting moments of the film, are when some scents call the attention of some characters (the plum girl, Baldini, Dominique, the orgy, etc), and the way the film 'tries' to show us the effect on them is with fast and short cuts, 'a-la-Hollywood', which I am not saying is bad, but it is just too rapid in the visual way, and not as subtle as a scent actually would work. A resource which is over-used lately in a lot of films is the close-up. And I guess that happens when a director finds kind of non-easy to portray a character, so, let us see at least a close-up of the actor. Again, lack of subtlety. So, I wouldn't even praise the achievement in make up in this film, only for showing us closely the noses and faces of some actors. I am not the greatest fan of Tom Tykwer, yet I think he's a good director (I liked 'Der Krieger Und Die Kaiserin' and 'Tödliche Maria'), but as a stage-director, he may lose some control on his actors, that lead us to see Alan Rickman as a flat character and Dustin Hoffman as mis-casted, Ben Whishaw is fantastic for creating and developing his own Jean-Baptiste (watch his tics) and it's hard to avoid to see him a bit overacted in some scenes. Jessica Schwartz in her short role is great, she has what is called presence, one keeps an eye on her. And the orgy's scene made me laugh for moments, I would rather have felt embarrassed. Another resource which is sometimes unnecessarily used is the voice-off. Again, lack of subtlety in 'Das Parfürm'. A couple of gags would have been enough for stating some facts (in the book a woman says that the child ""doesn't smell"", for instance), but trying to explain or just to state a feeling, it's just as annoying as it was in the 'Blade Runner' first version. I like voice-off in films like Wong Kar-Wai's, where the facts are stated, but the rest, is a work of the viewer... one again, lack of subtlety (perhaps Hollywood influence? in Hollywood films basically everything has to be clarified!) I am not disappointed with 'Das Parfürm', I was entertained, I enjoyed the experience, but I have to be honest by saying the typical phrase ""it could've been better..."". And more expectations are served, I heard someone will adapt 'El Amor En Los Tiempos De Cólera (Love In Times Of Cholera)' by García Márquez. Those are books quite different than those by Chrichton (while reading them the reader can only imagine ""for this character Chrichton wants Tom Cruise, for this one he wants Nicholson..."").",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
389,tzusj,"Perfume, the story of a murderer – Genius masterpiece.",10,23 May 2011,"I can say very honestly that this is one of the best movies ever made. The story is based on a fictional book, written by Patrick Süskind. This author has proved to be an exceptional writer. To be able to write such an intriguing story starting from the boring subject of smell expresses his talent. I must admit that I haven't read the book myself. But as the bookworm that I am, I can't wait to lay my hands on it.What I think of as the strongest point of the movie are the images. Every possible still that you could take from this movie is a work of art on its own. The composition, the colors, the contrast, the difference between light and darkness and others are always nearly perfect. The close-ups make you feel like you're almost in the middle of the movie. If this were a 3D movie, I think I'd surely have tried to touch a lot of things.The music is also suited for the movie. It makes the movie flow towards its goal. It doesn't dominate the movie but unnoticeable it makes you feel more part of it.The main actor is the formerly unknown Ben Whishaw. He put down an excellent act of protagonist Jean-Baptist Grenouille. But Ben Whishaw is not the only one who should be congratulated. Also John Hurt did an excellent job as the narrator of the story.There are some scenes that contain nudity in the movie. But this is shown in a non-sexual context. And even if you are very easily shocked by these things, just cope with it and watch!This movie has won a lot of prices, and they won them rightfully. Still the movie is not so famous as it should be. Probably because it's not an American or British movie but German. (mind that everything is spoken in English) Some people don't know it yet. But when organizing a movie night with friends, this should be a great choice.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
390,v_isha_ljain,Brilliant Movie which needs a little patience,10,20 December 2011,"Perfume, A story of murderer, started with a lean and weak guy whose hands and legs were cuffed. The guy seemed in ease but the uproar outside the prison demonstrated the weirdness of the story. People were screaming, shouting, stoning. They were having axes, weapons and wooden articles to kill the culprit. Soon the Prisoner was brought in balcony among a higher uproar and shouting of giving him the instant capital punishment but his punishment was read to people there and narrator travels in the past to tell us his past.A child was born with extra-ordinary capabilities that could smell good or bad, stench or perfume. He could recognize any scent irrespective of the distance of the source. He could smell dust, water, rock, stone, frog, iron, rotten rat and human body. There was not any smell which was hidden from him. Every day he encountered new smells and added them to the list of known smells without even knowing their source.One day he smelled something extraordinary and became hysterical about it. He started looking the source of such marvelous smell. It was a gal. He followed her without following conducts and manners of society and under some unstated circumstances he managed to kill the gal. He did not stop here, like an animal he smelled her body without any notion of pain or fear in his eyes. He wanted to preserve this smell desperately but he was helpless.Soon he found one old perfumer who might know the trick of preserving the smell. He created lots of new perfumes for the old perfumer and in return he asked oldie to teach him the way to preserve any smell. Old guy passed his trick to the protagonist but it did not suffice. With this trick the boy could not preserve the smell of iron, dust and animal body. So Old man suggested him to visit Rome city to learn other preserving mechanisms.On the way to city, the boy realized he was odorless. He was different from people, living and non-living things. So he determined to find his own odor. He reached to the city and started finding new way of preserving the smell. He found one and story of murders started from here. He killed one gal and tried preserving her smell but failed miserably in this technique. He learned another way and tried it on different gal and succeeded this time. Here started the spree of murders. Most 13 beautiful gals of the city were his victims and their smells were stored in different containers. Killer was merciless and inattentive and was committed to his duties. He worked like a messenger sent on earth to take beauties back to heavens.With these 13 smells he created a perfume which was unique and exemplary; and he decided to use this perfume as his own odor and rest of the story should be kept secret.I have tried my best to keep secrets; everything written above has an explanation in movie. I liked the movie a lot due to its unusual theme, direction, and pace of the movie. There was a sequence of 10 minutes which bored me a little but in all movie is must watch.

The main actor doesn't say much which works great for some guys, but not for this one. Dustin Hoffman is just to comic.

393,rookie11,Simply brilliant!!!,10,15 October 2007,"One of the best film I've ever seen in a long time. I've had no knowledge of this film whatsoever and by pure luck, I just picked up this movie with latest Antoine Fuqua's ""Shooter"" which was pretty entertaining, I thought. I did not even watch the ""Perfume"" until the next day because perhaps I was not in the mood for too artsy movie after the action movie like the ""Shooter"". I started watching this movie around midnight and I just could not stop. The story was simply brilliant and mesmerizing till the end which most of the classic films have in common ""Can not guess the ending"". I believe it is another classic German cinema and last one I thought which made me aware of their brilliant existence, beside Fritz Lang's early stuff, was called the ""Tin Drum"" by Volker Schlöndorff. Of course modern director of this generation who gave us ""Run, Lola Run"" Tom Tykwer pulled it off as beautifully even though, Stanley Kubric claimed the book was unfilmable. But I also have to wonder, did I felt in love with the story itself or film which had great story? I think both have to go side by side of course and I love how Tom incorporated subtle but necessary CGI of the beginning scene and used similar technique throughout the film with capturing the sense of scent by baby to the full grown adult. It was bit of a dark perversion to sympathize the character or even story line with the act of serial murders. This is a pure treat and completely understandable why Kurt Cobain carried this book in his pocket?? which I am not suicidal but how inspirational can this story be to a one of the best musicians of our time. Too bad, majority of US film audiences missed out on one of the best film ever to come out since such a long decades.....",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
394,janoshof,people who read the book can ignore the spoiler warning. It isn't much.,7,24 September 2006,"First of all I have to say that the movie was quiet good. Secondly that I hate those people who left the cinema saying:""I think somehow the book was more exciting and such bla bla. I must note this because I talked to some of those guys and asked when they have read the book. The answers where mostly 10-15 years ago. AHA! I read it a second time 4 months ago and I need to say that the book is not a real thriller to. You don't fear to death, you're just fascinated. This was quiet good transformed of the filmmakers. But anyway they also made a few mistakes. Not very important but why did they call her Laura. Her name is Laure. Probably it was easier to pronounce it for Mr.Rickman. And why the hell was the part in the cave so shortened. Thats one of the most important parts of the book. I mean its so obvious that in context to his birth and death on the most stinking place this is the decisive part of the story. Last thing I want to mention is that they've been a bit discouraged. They did not very much visual and sound effects to replace the missing of smellovision. It could have been more brutal especially the last murder was disappointing. And thanks to the US-market the first time they really showed pubic area was at the not very fascinating orgy. Always everything was hidden. Not very modern I think, because the sexual aspect is a major part of the story. Its Art! Brook Shields appeared nude when she was even younger than miss hurd-wood. So it is an exciting movie but I miss, some philosophical aspects of grenouilles identity and, please don't take it as a ""gore nerd English"", sweat and blood.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

While trying to do this, he is killing lot of beautiful women to have their body scents. Then murder (Grenoille) is having 12 beautiful women's body scents.

I didn't read the book, so it's possible that it's not entirely on Tykwer, but still I can not give any more than what I already gave, and that's already because the rest of the movie was pretty decent. Ben Whishaw seemed to me like a great lead actor, though after half way through the movie his character didn't really seem to develop or change in any way, and the lack of emotions started to feel like it's more of the actor's fault rather than the character's nature.

399,canalegrande,"brilliant, disturbing - a great film",8,7 October 2006,"First of all this is a very ""European"" movie, which among others means that nudity is not rated worse than showing how someone's head is chopped off spilling gallons of blood over his corpse. On the contrary: the violent scenes in this film are left to the subtlety of the visitor's fancy. Patrick Süskind, the South-German novelist has created a discomforting story from the world of scents. If one is not able to fit into the main character's world of odors, its impossible to follow the storyline. I had read this book twice before I saw the film. And my impression was similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy: The movie had caught the spirit of Patrick Süskind's novel surprisingly well despite all cuts. As mentioned above the movie contains some nudity scenes when Grenoiulle tries to catch the scents of his victims. Another good example that nudity and erotics have nothing in common here.Dustin Hoffman as the great Italian ""Parfumeur"" is fantastic with his baroque - grotesqueness behavior. When he tries to get the ingredients of his competitor's oeuvre, you are pulled into his world of dwindling scents and his half-funny despair. What a great actor he is!The main character is presented in a way which generates feelings of compassion even (baby scenes!), despite his monstrosity. This is also done differently to many Hollywood creations where the ""bad guy"" is often presented so damned bad that you know he will deserve to get his head chopped off and gallons of blood spilled over his corpse. And such a movie then, will be rated PG only. I liked ""The Perfume"" and was surprised how well done it was put to scene. And how its possible that such an alien story can move you. Sometimes I found the film's plot a bit too ""sober"" or clinical"" but this again, was another way of presenting Grenouille's monstrosity.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

401,kittyboomboom,dirty angel,1,12 August 2007,"I will begin this by stating that my sister sent this to me as a carefully bubble wrapped punishment. For what I'm still not sure but I will definitely never cross her again. Of course she tried to warn me and the fact that it took her 4 hours to watch it should have been telling. It was in a word: atrocious. One of the most visually stunning pieces of garbage I have ever set eyes on, literally. While points are clearly scored for originality, costume and set design the beginning & ending scenes were nothing short of vomit inducing albeit for different reasons. Born in truly putrid conditions - Female Trouble birth scene easily comes to mind only this time super-sized with maggots, rotting meat and fish heads - Guillotine (or whatever his name was) was not meant for this world and the gift that signaled his existence and his mother's douche-baggery would ultimately be his undoing, a tragic flaw indeed of Shakespearean proportions no doubt. Everything he touches dies, everyone is dirty/funky looking and Dustin Hoffman has seen better days and scripts. He can smell through glass containers, in crowds and over great distances with visuals no less. He also leaves dead naked virginal sinead o'connor look-a-likes in his wake. I was not entirely certain if this was a joke until I read some of the reviews on this site and realized there are people out there who dug this mess. Surely nothing this silly should take itself so seriously but alas I was wrong because it did and was somehow able to convince a large portion of the viewing public. Now that was some mighty powerful juice...I have seen much much worse (R.O.T.O.R. anyone?) that's for sure but nothing quite like this. I was rendered speechless by the orgy scene and wanted to destroy my DVD player and possibly myself when he finally made it ""home"". Simply put: avoid like the plague - beware of random dingy homeless looking street urchins with bags of animal fat that only want to ""capture your scent"".

404,filmaker44,Showing smell,10,3 June 2008,"This film uses picture and audio in a very unique and skillful way: to depict smell. Sight + sound does not usually equal smell, but that's what these filmmakers set out to do, and in my opinion, they succeeded. Since Smell-o-vision died a while back, the artists behind ""Perfume"" had to figure out different ways to get inside Jean-Baptiste's nose. The cinematography often becomes his sense-of-smell's point of view (if that makes any sense). It travels freely to search and discover new environments and people. The cinematography also put importance on certain objects and people by skillfully using light. The first shot is a dark figure leaning into a beam of light, exposing only Jean-Baptiste's nose. That image kicked off the film for me. The editing also helps the audience get inside Jean-Baptiste's head. For example, the first time he enters the busy city streets, the cuts are quick and sporadic. We are as visually overwhelmed by the pace of the cuts as Jean-Baptiste's nose is with the introduction of very new smells. There's too much information to take in at one time. Sound design is exaggerated to represent Jean-Baptiste's extraordinary sense. When he smells the perfume shop for the first time, every sound inside is heightened. Every movement from the customers to the glass bottles of perfume can be heard in a hyper-real way. It's not the same thing as smell, but it gets the idea across effectively. I enjoyed the fairy-tale-like style of the film. It's told almost like a bedtime story, but ""Perfume"" probably won't help put your 5-year-old to sleep. The tale is gritty, violent, and sexual in nature, which I believe juxtaposes nicely with this style. Despite all the murders Jean-Baptiste commits, he's still quite an innocent person. All he desires is the beauty of smell, but it leads him down a dark path. I believe ""Perfume"" is a very compelling story, told in a skillful and creative way.

I won't repeat the points others found. But the book has flaws as well. Art is always flawed. So Süskind fails to make his main character real. Through narration we understand smell to be deeply connected to our emotions, but we have no soul in the book to identify with. Therefore everything is left to our imagination. Did anyone really wish to accompany an ugly, demented Grenouille two and a half hours long, and smile about the satirical and philosophical subtleness of the story?

""Well, I'm assuming it won't stink"", I thought to myself. Luckily, this time my assumption was right.Perfume tells a story of a monster among men. It is fantasy - nothing else. It depicts a fantastic 18th century France, if you ignore the perfect British linguistics, and incorporates much of what we today know as facts about our sense of smell. Pheromones - the chemical love.The protagonist Jean-Baptiste Grenouille sees the world differently from all others. He smells it, more than anything. Given the gift of an extraordinary sense of smell, he effectively lacks possibility of love - but is able to capture it's very essence, objectively and clinically, in it's chemical form.The movie must be accepted as a fantasy, a fairy-tale, to be able to enjoy it to its fullest. If not, you will be annoyed by a mysteriously English-dominated France, and how in hell Grenouille succeeds with what he does, or how its even possible. Let it be a metaphorical fantasy, and enjoy the lush imagery, and acting, for what it is, and be struck by a thousand thoughts after the film has ended. It is possible that you will be a more philosophical human being after watching it, if you let it - be that good or bad.I give it 9/10 because it a wonderfully made film, in all aspects.

416,tajhridy,instinct about right or wrong.,9,27 July 2020,"Human instinct often forces us to choose a side whenever we read a novel or watch a movie. We often continue watching a movie with a expectation of favourable incidents of our choosen side. The interesting and unique thing about this movie is audience will not find a side to be leaned to. There will be moments where one might be sympathised with the main character, again there will be moments where one might completely hate him. Director was able to do the shifting of opinion in audiences' mind beautifully. This movie was made so artistically that it gave the sense of smell a visual representation. Yes, there were some exaggerated acting of the side characters. Even there were scene where it appeared as an advertisement of any perfume brand. But the inner message was conveyed very precisely. Many art films make the main message so confined with art moves that it often backfires. This movie was free from that which made the movie more enjoyable and curious. It leaves audience to think. As I said earlier about human instinct, this movie will make you think how actually instincts work. Will instint or norms work similarly if anyone was not taught it by external environment? The main character in this movie was not that much influenced by his external environment. That is why the way his instints worked was it actually wrong?...What is actual right or wrong?....These kind of thinking will storm out the audience's brain..At least it stormed out mine. Loved the movie. Will definitely recommend to watch it.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
417,tamurile,A visual highlight,8,17 September 2006,"I really enjoyed this film. Of course it is a challenge to visualise smell, but I think Tom Tykwer did a good job. This is one of the first period pieces that might just present the period realistically - with all its smudged faces, dirty fingernails, rags, the offal in the streets...not even the upper classes were ""clean"" (to our standards), with their grimy wigs and unwashed clothes, and the film presented this in every shot. Watching Grenouille do what he does feels voyeuristic and somehow wrong, and yet you cannot look away. Not a film for people with a weak stomach! A visual bonus for me were the beautiful shots of the Provence -after all the dark colours of the city scenes, the sun and the lavender fields are a feast for the eye, as it must have been a feast for Grenouille's nose.The film stays very close to the book and is an visual enrichment for those who have read it, and probably a great surprise for those who haven't.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

For the most part the main character is believable and makes a strong impression. The pace of the movie is good, never giving the feel of rushing ahead or talking too long to tell the story. I never had the feeling of time while watching, which to me is a stamp of very high quality. Now, for the last part. The ending of the movie is so ridiculous that the strong impression from the first part is completely ruined.

421,jessicahynes,The most beautiful film I have ever seen,10,4 January 2007,"Of course, (mercifully) we cannot smell what the Perfumer smells. In compensation we have hyper-real imagery, using stunning macro shots that are extreme close-ups in startling detail - the tiny hairs on a nose, the explosive splash of a single drop of essence falling into a pool. But more than the classic beauty was also the revolting beauty - maggots in a rat, the filth of the fishmonger, bad teeth, dirty hands - all in amazing, sometimes squeamish detail.This film could not have been made in Hollywood - it has a unmistakeably European flavor and is unflinching in the details of early 18th century France. The story of single-minded obsession and remorseless killing in the name of love by a nearly mute actor is mesmerising. And Dustin Hoffman's merry turn as a foppish Italian perfumer provides welcome comic relief!",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

425,kubus1987,Better than expected... mostly,8,15 September 2006,"Before going to cinema I had mixed feelings about the movie. How can you make the audience smell something through the silver screen? Will they adapt the dark, yet brilliant atmosphere of the book? On the other hand, they can't completely ruin the novel, can they?And you know what? After watching it I can tell they did a surprisingly good job adapting it to the big screen. Somehow they managed to let the audience imagine all the smells mostly by visual means (with some support by the narrator). Both the real, stinky world of post-medieval towns and the""artificial"" world people are drifting over when smelling Grenouilles creations are very well depicted. In this context you can't leave out Ben Whishaw's acting as Grenouille, which maybe isn't near as creepy as it should be according to the book, but has it's brilliant moments (e.g. after the first ""accidental"" murder) and really takes the viewer deeper into the world of smells.Also the atmosphere, something which I thought was very hard to adapt, was surprisingly good. Not as brilliant as in the book of course, but still a solid piece of work. The dark mood when Grenouille ""collects"" the ingredients for his perfume, the bright colors when he finally creates one (e.g. when Baldini smells Grenouilles first ""good perfume""), all that keeps the viewer in the seat till the end of the movie, without thinking that the time he needs to watch the movie could be spent better in, let's say, counting the number of toothpicks he possesses.The cut-out parts... Well, what to say. Let's explain it with a comparison: if you read The Fellowship of the Ring before watching the movie, you could complain that you missed Tom Bombadil, if you did not, you will not even notice that there should be anything more. Same here.So let's move to the final question: should you go out and watch the movie? In my opinion yes. You barely will have the chance again to watch a movie about a sense that can't be respond in cinema, and even if the chance occurs, it will hardly be as good solved as this. A good storyline based on a brilliant novel, good acting and a mostly gripping atmosphere, what do you want more? P.S.: The only reason why I give ""The Parfume"" a 8 is because, compared to the book, the atmosphere of the movie still lacks a little depth, but if you did not read it before watching the movie you can add a point.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

And I must admit the story seemed confusing and dull, but i was proved wrong. The story maintains interesting all the time, and there keeps coming new turns, twist and surprisingly changes. Another good thing about this movie is the acting. Ben Wishaw is convincing and intense, and i think he deserve an Oscar nomination (not to win, but be nominated) Its also beautiful filmed with great pictures, of the wonderful sets.if I have to say a bad thing about the movie it must be the ending. in the beginning you see him as prisoner, then the flashback of his history, and then back to the beginning, but it is changed, Why??My conclusion is: Watch it - you wont be disappointed.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Although it contains much nudity and has received an R rating, this movie is a ""must-see,"" whether you be a lover of romantic comedies or high action movies.It delves into the psyche of a murderer without blowing up people or slamming axes into their heads. It is not about murder, though, but more about the alienation and obsession of a person. It is so honest it makes you cringe, and doesn't hold back on the gritty details of the century, nor on the addiction that the main character has with creating his perfect perfume.Perhaps it is not exactly true to the book, but for a film that was described as ""unfilmable"" by Stanley Kuprick, it is one hell of an accomplishment that older viewers will find disgusting, but captivating.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
429,onembaby,Not another maniac flick,10,17 September 2006,"I just saw this film which was released in Russia on September 14. I predict this movie will arouse disputes concerning all of its aspects: director's style, Ben Wishaw's contribution to the image of protagonist, the (possible) miscast of Dustin Hoffman (though I think he was incredible as Baldini), etc I've got plenty of thoughts on it, but English isn't my native language so I'd better be short. I'm not a movie critic; I'm a mere mortal who really likes good movies. From this point of view Perfume is a brilliant feature. There are two things about it which I admire the most:1. Director's interpretation of the story which is much more sentimental and at the same time more humane than Suskind's oeuvre itself. What Tykwer has described is a character's journey in quest of recognition and love, while what Suskind had narrated in a cold, distanced manner is the story of an inhuman vanity of a great madman.2. Ben Wishaw's vision of Grenouille as a monster born into a monstrous world, who step by step is being transformed into a human with his suicide in the end being the highest point of his spiritual renaissance. This film is a work of Art, cruel and heartbreaking, that's why I give it 10 out of 10.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
430,steveg72,Beautifully filmed; but disappointing. Read the book!,4,20 September 2007,"I thought the book was excellent, and looked forward to the movie. However, I was disappointed. Ben Whishaw was excellent; Dustin Hoffman -- who can be an excellent actor -- was dreadful; he looked like he was he was ready to stop the action and tell a joke throughout his performance. The movie was exquisitely photographed. However, unlike the book much of the Grenouille's actions were not clearly motivated. Nor was the tension between different philosophic modes of understanding the world (logic, sensory). This was hinted at in the movie but never well-developed. What was well executed was Grenouille's alienation from the world, and we have Whishaw to thank for that. The underlying beauty of the book, the force of argument that smell is the primary orientation to the world was missing from the movie. Lastly, in the book, it was clear from that others rejected Grenouille and were not able to love him because he lacked his own personal odor. Hence his desire to create a personal scent to make everyone love him.So, in conclusion, I thought the movie was a whiff of what the book contained, and ultimately was disappointing.p.s.

""Perfume: A Story of murder"" was intoxicating to watch. I had read the book some years ago and enjoyed the dark and tangled story very much so. From the acting to the directing, to every technical aspect of the film it was a masterpiece that Hitchcock and Orson Wells would have applauded. In fact they would have hung their heads, sighed and breathed a whisper of a wish that they had created such a wonder for the screen. Certain elements were added to the storyline but they only improved the already brilliant tale that was told. I cried a bit towards the end, not out of sadness or longing, but out of amazement. I was moved so much and took so much from the images before me that I felt over whelmed with excitement and jubilation. One added element to the film moved me so much so that it pierced a deep part of my soul and let me answer a question about myself I could not realize on my own. I do not wish to spoil the film, but as Jean Baptiste comes to his own actualization I think that many others who see the film will see a part of themself in him. He is a combination of The Son of Sam, Gregor Samsa (The Metamorphasis), Golem (The Lord of the Rings) and almost a touch of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The fact that while watching/reading his story we can fall in love and relate to this person despite his obvious dark and dangerous nature proves man is not as good of a creature we would like to think him to be. Like the crowd before him, we all stand praising him as we do ourselves for loving something so much and allowing others to see it for how beautiful it is. Tragic and yet endearing, this story will envelope your heart as well as the darkest part of your soul. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It was a bizarre film to me, in that I liked the acting, I liked the plot, I liked a lot of things, but I don't think I liked the film itself. I don't know if it was too artsy, or too weird or what, but I walked out of the theater thinking ""What did I just see? And did I like it?"" My husband had the same opinion. Normally we have a definite opinion on things, but this film we just didn't. We're glad we saw it, but we won't see it again. Along the same lines, this review may not help since it doesn't give a definite thumbs up or thumbs down, but hopefully it lets you know that depending on your taste in films, this definitely is a love it or hate it film.

I'm not saying Tykver ain't great, OK. Then again, after seeing a couple of trailers I was convinced the film was spectacular, picturesque, which is not good, which is unnecessary, too Hollywoodish or whatever. I had ambiguous feelings. So the film began and this spectacularity really was at it's best - too much everything, too much makeup dirt on faces, too impressing the sights and the worst - the main character is attractive! His face is attractive - not scary at all! And the soundtrack makes you think of The Girl With The Pearl Earring. And the scene when the crowd begins making love has gone too far - it was made just unbearable by the incessant laughs from the back rows, I mean, why show naked people - the moment of undressing would be enough. Ben Whishaw was too good-looking, he didn't play bad but he didn't fit. But Dustin Hoffman was amazing. I have great respect for him and I admire him, and his acting was remarkable , as almost always. Now that the movie is all the rage about town the cinema was full of people and the bookshops are fresh out of the novel. A friend has borrowed my book and there's a couple of people waiting for their turn, and something tells me there'll be more redheads on streets quite soon. Really I'd like to re-read the novel to see if those who say that the film has spoilt it are right or wrong. Of course it won't make you bad if you watch it.

Tykwer is a genius because he can always involve and surprise his audience and I'm sure that this masterpiece will always be recognized as the best adaptation of the book, although Kubrick and many others said it was impossible to do.

YES! Was it necessary or famous? NO!If I'm not mistaken, this movie has not fulfilled the expectations in German cinemas at all, well, maybe it's a little bit too simple to take the bestseller-list concerning books and then make a movie out of it.

I want to be paid to watch such crap.I feel sorry for the guys behind the movie - they aimed faaaaaar to high, resulting in a weak story with displeasing unreality. The main character has an amaaaaazing ability to find beauty in smells, so the whole movie focuses on his nose (with some 300 great close-up shots) - Inspiring. One of all big flaws in the plot: The audience can not identify with this amazing ability of his, and him being orally inept doesn't really make anything better.It's obvious that it all was meant to be BEAUTIFUL, but we all know what happens when that fails, it goes purely PATHETIC.

After discussing the film with other viewers we all agreed to go back again and re-view the parts we missed, as each viewer picked up on different events in the film. The narrative was very effective and it is hard to imagine how the film would have worked without. The cinematography showed incredible sensitivity and the most ""horrific"" scenes take place in the viewers mind rather than on screen. We felt that in some scenes we could actually smell the flowers that were being described, it could only have been more realistic by a ""John Watersesque"" scratch and sniff card with the entrance ticket.

444,ahale-2,Oh dear...,1,5 October 2006,"I'm sure Perfume will be extensively discussed at many a dinner party for some deep philosophical meaning or its artistic direction, but as a whole in terms of plot, dialogue and narration, it was laughably poor. Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman should be watching their careers disappearing down the U-bend, yet what do I see this weekend - the film's taken a decent amount of money in Germany and has a decent rating on IMDb! I can only assume the filmmakers have been setting up new accounts left, right and centre, and the rating will plummet in time. Please. If not my faith in humanity will be irreparably damaged.Now I stumbled upon Perfume when in Florence, trying to kill a couple of hours before dinner, and therefore approached the film with no knowledge of the book or the plot, and as such no prejudice against it. In fact seeing 'Il Profumo' on the advert outside the cinema I was expecting a tale of '60s cold war scandal - my Italian isn't so hot! As Perfume unfolded, however, I quickly found myself thinking the whole concept was pretty ridiculous - the boy who could sniff for miles generally sniffing things for an hour or so whilst the narrator gave a toe-curlingly embarrassing account of the story (I found myself wondering how many times he must have burst out laughing whilst recording). Towards the end, when the murders were taking place, the film actually did manage to build some suspense and hold my attention. Fair play I thought - whilst not redeeming the earlier hilarity, the director may just have rescued a semblance of respect. Then came the finish. Oh my dear god no. Alan Rickman in full stage acting mode, pained expression on face at the injustice of his daughter's murderer escaping, surrounded by a sea of bobbing arses. That has to be a contender for the most atrocious scene ever to make it onto a cinema screen. I'm trying to think of a worse ending to a movie, or in fact a worse movie at all. It is seriously a struggle. Just god-awful.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
445,verbal22,"Cringeworthy, nauseating, a complete embarrassment",1,5 October 2006,"I stumbled upon 'Perfume' while travelling round Europe last month. At the time I'd never heard of Suskind's novel, let alone the film adaptation and as a result, I entered the cinema without any preconceptions of what to expect. I was staggered. I cannot think of a film I've seen that is as cringe-worthy, nauseating and ultimately, as ridiculous or as embarrassing as this awful, awful waste of 50 million euros.First, the positives (and there are precious few). The film is indeed beautifully shot. Medieval Paris is impressively realised and you really do get a sense of the grimy underbelly of the city that Grenouille inhabits. In addition, the second half of the film when the murders are taking place is undeniably tense as a cinematic experience.However, by this stage all credibility has already been lost as a result of the lumpen and unconvincing script and the appallingly nauseous narration, which is representative of the general feel of the film as a whole. Think 'Chocolat' at its most sickly, with Juliette Binoche stirring a hot pot in slow motion to a lush orchestral background. However, while that film just about saved itself from teetering into the realms of the ridiculous, 'Perfume' plummets into the abyss like a suicidal elephant, lacking any sense of subtlety, finesse or restraint. Hoffman's 'paradise rose garden' scene after smelling Grenouille's first creation should be consigned to the film-making skip permanently. Nobody should be forced to see that.Surely it can't get any worse I thought. I was wrong. The execution/orgy scene must count as one of the most unbelievable and embarrassing in cinema history, so much so that I actually felt sorry for Alan Rickman, as though his career was disappearing before my very eyes. Stumbling on from there we reach the ending, with Grenouille being crushed to death by a mob of filthy peasants acting for the first time ""out of love"".

Oh God I hate him much! I hate him! Its a unique life story. Born as bastard with no human's smell in his whole body. Good worker with good talent in smelling. No desire. He's so cold likes devil. Just read it and u will get the murderer taste. I wanna kill him!!! I hate him! if he's real and still alive. I like to smelling my ""kentut"" better than his ""yach!""perfume. Oh God I hate him!!!

447,karim-niazi,Book VS Movie,9,8 October 2006,"Hi! I have just watched the movie a second time and so feel myself now capable of giving a profound review. First of all I have to say I hate film-critics in general and rather love the word review because it gives the reader a nod or a simple suggestion of ones thought which is better than the know it all film connoisseur stance many tend to take.I was just in Germany for a week and went with some colleagues of mine to watch the perfume in cinema and the movie was presented in German. Now today I watched the movie here in Switzerland but in English and I have to say that I really recommend watching it in English, it gives you a totally other impression, for example the slight Italian accent in Dustin Hoffman's voice is brilliant and amusing, while in the German version it's simply dubbed and has no depth.I personally didn't like the book as much as many do (well, I don't worship it), i sure do acknowledge it in many ways, especially in treating the subject of scent but I don't see Patrick Süsskind as a brilliant writer nor do I think that ""Das Parfüm"" is an absolute masterpiece.The movie as such is in general great, the love for details can be seen in many shots and cuts throughout the film. Ben Wishaw exceeds expectations by playing the character in a silent, gentle way that pays more than just a tribute to the character in the book but enhances him and gives deepness to character, where I think the book lacked. The attempt of Süskind to create a demonic creature without feelings on the one side and on the other side that poor human thing, that is enslaved by the need of experiencing luck by smelling exquisite things, the confrontation of that robotic, cold version of Grenouille and that human Grenouille, is settled in the movie by Ben Wishaw by sometimes putting more emphasis on that human side (like watery eyes), which is more realistic and seems to fit even better. But don't be shocked, Grenouille stays Grenouille and still resembles the character in the book quite a lot, it's just the notion which I'm trying to capture.The other actors casted are brilliant and not even one seems misplaced. The imagery is great, the house of Baldini on top of that bridge, or Grasse or whatever scenery you may have thought of, it sure comes alive and is surely put to screen in a historical correct fashion. The first half of the movie is excellent. The second half seems sometimes a bit slow, maybe because the story is obvious to someone who has already read the book but it's still fun to watch over Grenouilles shoulder when he's making his perfume. *SPOILER* The execution/ orgy scene at the end is perfectly done, not being pornographic or something like that. *SPOILER END*In the end: I didn't watch the movie two times just because I wanted to give nice review but because I enjoyed it and its imagery is overwhelming. The sound is great and well done. All I can do is recommend this movie and that you get your own opinion by viewing, it won't be wasted money, because the way the movie was made is worth watching. I give 9/10 though I actually should give a 10/10 but I'm very stingy about that last star ;-)",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
448,a-smith-9,am i supposed to laugh out loud?,1,9 October 2006,"Firstly, this is my disclaimer: I did not read the book. Anyone who did read the book should also read the other comments written by those who also had before they went to see the movie. But, since not many people hadn't read before watching I feel justified in posting. Secondly, I would like to state that I am in no way a movie critic and in fact do not usually frequent online dispatches of modern culture such as IMDb. To post this I actually had to register which shows you really how much I know about movies. The reason I found IMDb this evening was because of a google search for 'Perfume' after coming home from the local cinema in fits of laughter. Anyways, we came out wondering really what the hell it was all about. It is one of the only times I have actually laughed out loud whilst those around me have eyes firmly fixed on the screen. It just seemed all wrong. -Was I supposed to laugh at: 'Forgive me, my son'? -What was Rickman's pathetic speech all about whilst interrogating Grenouille? I mean: 'I'm going to burn you like a piece of acid!' was delivered in such a dull fashion that I almost laughed before he got to the end. Quite unimaginative writing too I would say. -Hoffman: absolutely rubbish, at almost all points. -At one point near the end I thought that Rickman was going to be revealed as the long lost father of the bastard orphan Grenouille. (!?!?)Anyways, I have read quite a few people say that it really invoked the sense of smell and our awareness of it (some in fact wrote visualise the smell, but I supposed that isn't exactly what they mean). I would not agree. The first scenes evoked an emotional response from the chopping of 'disgusting' images but never did I take a breath in through my nose and savour. Only, at one other point was I close (Hoffman getting a kiss after smelling Grenouille's first perfume) but actually that had a lot more to do with the girl than anything else. If smell was so important I would be expected at some point to take a breath, to try and imagine, but this never came. In that sense I think the film really failed in its purpose. The orgy scene was the best and worst part. It was the best because it obviously inspired a well heeled European diplomat (sat in the seat behind us) to appear at the cinema by himself looking somewhat shifty. I guess he must have read a review and thought it was 'Deep Throat' all over again. At the same time it really was embarrassing. I am sure buried deep in the book somewhere there is some justification for it but actually in a futile attempt to stand up as a piece of art it fell quite flat. Anyways, at least after this scene I realised what to do: just like the people of Gresse I was to pretend the movie didn't happen and never tell anyone (at least in the flesh) about it.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

If any viewers are worried about the script being changed for a film you need not worry. It follows the book almost flawlessly. The sound track is marvelous and helps you to relate to the different smells and scents throughout the movie! The only thing that I found to be a let down was the casting of Ben Whishaw. Good acting mind you, its just that he's much too pretty for the role. I always envisioned Jean-Baptiste as an ugly scabby man with a large nose.

The acting, the direction, the score even the costumes and scenery are just flawless in what they do, which is give the perfectly adapted screen version of an extraordinary novel. One cannot help but admire and wish for the talent primarily and then passion and dedication of Jean-Batiste. Also one can't help sympathize and growing fond of Wishaw's Grenouille.

Maybe this movie has some sort of artistic value I don't get, but the idea of distilling people into a perfume that makes you like Jesus is just ridiculous. I can't imagine how they pitched this movie and got it made, but it was a waste. Please save yourself the trouble and do not go see this movie. Necrophelia and eating people just don't make quality movies. In addition the casting was pretty awkward. I like Dustin Hoffman, but he is not exactly convincing as an Italian man in France. His voice is just too distinctive to play that part. The same comment goes equally well for Alan Rickman. Another thing that bothered me about the movie was the omniscient narrator. There wasn't any other sound except his voice for about the first 15 minutes, and he kept popping back up to tell you what was happening in the movie. If the characters and actions on screen aren't able to tell the story then rewrite the script, don't add a narrator. That is just tacky.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

A truly remarkable piece of art, arousing a myriad of the most powerful human instincts and emotions within everyone that goes to see it.

Well, the book is amazing, for sure, no one can describe this things, all the smells and stuff like Patrick S., he is fantastic! I read the book for a school homework and I just love it. I was too nervous to see that movie and, when, I finally saw it, I liked it. The shots are great, the colors are perfect, the actors, the characters, the sound, the ""smell"" of everything, but I think that Tom T. removed somethings, some important things...who read the book can remember the Taillade-Espinasse guy, the scientist who ""take care"" of Grenouille, well, they cut it at the movie, I think that's an important part of the history, cause it's when he does ""Grenouille's perfume"" with rat poopoo and stuffs...but they jump it, going to Grasse, in Madame Arnulfi house's and etc. Well, they did a good job at the movie, some scenes, like the whore's scene was an great idea to explain who Grenouille is (that is very clear at the book, but in the movie is hard to see), the not-human guy, the cold one, the murderer. Well, the Priest, in the beginning of the book, didn't show up too...but, anyway, the other parts are perfect! just like I imagined, the fish market, the Paris Bridge, Baldini's house... For sure an amazing movie! You will fall in love with Grenouille cuz he's so cute an innocent, so pure! (ok, he's ugly at the book, but Ben Wishaw is cute!...but you can see him like an ugly guy too..)

460,ko_inu,I wish it had been a dream sequence....,4,18 February 2007,"I am not a critic, just a regular person who wants a few hours out to enjoy a good film. I want to say this was a good film, it almost was but it was let down in too many ways. It had a slight fairytale quality and the strangeness reminded me of the old arty French films with subtitles you watch at 3am because there is nothing else on - you sort of understand whats going on,and they are quite engaging but feel like you are missing something and hope you might get it if you keep watching.Grenouille makes uncomfortable watching,he is creepy,and grubby in a way that makes you want to give him a good bath even though you know it wont help(He is also horribly thin). I guess this was good casting in terms of the film as you had little empathy for him.About a quarter of the way in, I understood where the story was going, about half way through I was enjoying it, it felt like someone had come up with something different, really unusual, but then it started to feel too long - you keep waiting for a climax to the film but it does not come. When it finally does (in a fashion) in the crowd scene I was so disappointed at the complete absurdity of it, I wished for something that I usually hate.. that it was a dream sequence and that after the scene ended, it would end properly.The end sequence is not much better. It was such a shame, it seems that someone put a whole lot of effort into the graphic detail at the beginning (the birth was grim) and could not think of a decent ending. It was as if they ran out of ideas and just gave up.

Here on the other hand we see Jean-Baptiste as a Ubermensch. He wants to create beauty and preserving beauty is what drive his crimes without any remorse because the means justify the ends for him.Anyone familiar with Joseph Cambell's The hero with a thousand faces see many elements of the quest becoming a hero. With the quite obvious Plato's cave metaphor as a turning point in the story. The spectator even though appalled by his crimes wants to see him finish his work. Its not till the orgy around him(compare Hieronymus Bosch Garden of Earthly Delights)That he shows remorse/disappointment because what is beauty without love?Realizing this doesn't see life as worth living anymore.Some people called it cannibalism but its just as much cannibalism as eating the bread,Christ's Body during the communion.Which is here in my opinion referred to.This is my first take on a it and I am researching more into it.Johna42P.S. for any one interested compare the story of Amor and Psyche with Parfume",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

I have to add that I was far more entertained during the show than my mates due to my total unawareness of the plot (in Poland the title doesn't indicate that the main character is a murderer) At the beginning I simply sat there happily admiring the visual beauty and gracefulness of ""a story about a talented boy and whole admiration of our world expressed""...yeah, right.

The two that hadn't read the book really enjoyed the film, and the two that had were only very slightly less enthusiastic assuring us that the book was even better than the film.But then that's often the way.

I agree with the previous reviewer that some elements of the book have been hastily skipped over, presumably in order to pace the story for the screen. Although I usually hate this, I don't think it detracts too much on this occasion as the cuts are not really central to the main plot, but more about Grenouille's background mentality, which works better in print anyway.I also hope ""Nanny"" doesn't censor the nudity too much in the US. This is central to the plot, and is always tastefully and very artistically done... Don't think ""21st century style"" nudity, think ""old master painting"" type nudity.... The end scenes are some you won't forget in a hurry.Downsides...Dustin Hoffman is miscast for me, and his accent is way out of place. (But you do get a good performance from the ever imperious Alan Rickman to make up for it.) There are also a couple of ""flying camera zooms"" during travel sequences, which really jar compared to the slow sweeping camera work across the rest of the piece....but minor niggles really.....Just sit and watch the beauty of it! You'll need a strong stomach for the first five minutes which are a tad gory, and a sense of humour for the last quarter of an hour, but other than that it's an easy film to watch.I saw it here in the UK in a small art house cinema, and at the end, no one moved...

The way the film shows his sense of smell and desperation to find the perfect scent is wonderful.

470,loe-7,Another reason perhaps why the film takes place in a city called Grass,9,15 January 2007,"A very fine film.

I haven't read the book but the movie really worked for me  it is I believe excellent cinema, acting and directing are for the most part inspired while the recreation of 18th century Paris is memorable in its harshness and accuracy.The story is what it is  take it or leave it, there is very little point in debating its essence with the director and scriptwriters standing as the accused. I would only like to comment upon the execution scene in Grasse  certainly the dream finale for many of the Hippie and Woodstock generation members among the audiences. Some viewers and even a few 'critics' found it rather silly  but on the contrary, it is truly powerful and essential. To our eyes Grenouille almost becomes God when dispensing love and eroticism where previously only hatred and vengeance existed  but actually he receives almost nothing in emotional terms himself, finally accepting that his perceptions and feelings were ultimately made of an entirely different mold that still leave him empty and clueless. There is something both Messianic and desperate in Grenouille's presence there, evoking a variety of lingering thoughts to the perceptive viewer.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It is a film to watch time and again (specifically to overcome the slightly surreal nature of the ending). BUT it is well worth it!!

I really think that they have done a great job in turning an excellent book into an extremely catching movie. I did feel though, that, while the book focuses more on re-creating eighteenth-century Paris, the movie is more concerned with the murder. Nevertheless, the scenes in the old 'City of lights' do offer us a great glimpse of what Paris might have looked like before its restoration in the nineteenth century. In terms of same-century productions, I recommend watching Dangerous Liaisons (1987) as well. Fantastic movie on Choderlos De Laclos's even better novel. Both pictures combined tell us that that is a century well worth learning about.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

There were enough surprising death scenes (I don't mean murder scenes, although there were enough of those too ;P) that equal five fingers. All of them were surprising, as I've said above, but the two most surprising were: 1) When 15 yr old Jean wrote down the ingredients to all the perfumes Baldini asked for in return for making papers for Jean. After Jean had left, that night Baldini went to sleep with the book of ingredients in his lap and a smile on his face, but he never woke up for morning because his town-house had a tendency to shake on the regular, and this night it shook once more and then crumbled leaving an empty gap, separating the row of town-houses. It was very sad you know, after Baldini had saved Jean from the slave life/work he'd been doing since he was 5. The 2)... well, I'm going to let you see the movie for this one ;)On the real... This is a movie I'm definitely buying :) Last words---If you'd like to be shocked by a cute, baby-faced guy, then this movie is for you :P",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

I was however pleasantly surprised and feel that this film is at least as good as the book, and is better in many respects. However, there is no point in comparing apples and oranges. I get the impression that many of the previous comments are from young people who seem to get bogged down in the pedantic details and thereby fail to see the wood for the trees so to speak. Also, as a newcomer to this site I am surprised that you do not have a link to the musical score. What a wonderful score performed by the Berlin Philharmonic directed by Simon Rattle. Another aspect that was brilliant yet unobtrusive was the narration by John Hurt. I am surprised that neither the Director, the music or the cinematography warranted a nomination in the Academy Awards. I highly recommend this beautiful and sensual film.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
477,mihaimircea2005,Wonderful,10,10 March 2007,"First of all I'd like to say that is definitely one of the best movies I have recently seen. It is not only a good movie, but a movie that captures your entire attention during its duration and is the only thing you can think about several minutes afterward.This film has everything a movie addict like me would ever want: an extremely well developed storyline (witch I think will stay with me for a long time), originality, a plot that develops gradually and ends with a fantastic last scene, a soundtrack beyond anything I've encountered so far (mostly work of The Berlin Philharmonic) and the actors who make this film an authentic masterpiece.If I were to greatly reduce it I'd say it's a drama, but in fact it is so much more than a typical drama. It has that something that makes the difference between an ordinary movie and a truly great movie and in my opinion, in this case, that something represents fantasy or the ""out of the ordinary"".The sole purpose of Jean Baptiste Grenouille's existence is (and he realizes that in an early stage of the film) to capture and preserve scent, a scent so full of life, so beautifully powerful that he cannot live without. Once his obsession appears, it builds up and will not leave him until the end; he will stop at nothing to achieve what he wants, not even murder.It's a strange thing about this character's murders  we don't seem to mind them very much, they are not at all extreme acts of violence, but more necessary sacrifices for a greater, nobler goal.Anyway, I'd recommend this movie to just about anyone. It's a splendid movie to watch and it will leave you with a feeling of joy in your heart.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Just leave everything what the main character is thinking out. I suggest, that if you liked the movie, you should read the book. The main characters aren't written out completely in the movie.

479,adsert,love it but hate one thing,9,23 March 2007,"The novel in which this movie is based is one of my most treasured works of art, so when I heard a movie was done, I was very excited. I love books and I love films, so I was curious about how this book had been taken into a movie. There is often a sense of... skepticism, on movies based on books, and often, I enjoy the books much more. However, I think movies excel books in other grounds, and there's something in a movie that, no matter how better the story is told in the book, you can't find in the book. I'm also very disdainful of critics. Whether they flatter or criticize a work (any work) they often miss the point and their observations are rather lacking in intelligence, sensibility -a must when you're talking about art- and/or understanding. I think this film makes a fair adaptation of the book, and on its own, it stands as a beautiful work of art. The acting is great, the photography and camera work is awesome.. Any observation or doubt I had against the film was gone after it was over. All of them, but one. And here come the spoilers. While in the book Grenouille's essential frustration after achieving his masterwork stems from an utter feeling of repulsion for humans, and a realization that only in hatred, not in love, he could ever find satisfaction; in the film, this is portrayed as his frustrations stems for a feeling of... regret, sadness maybe, for realizing that he'd never could experience love and he had killed with his own hands his only chance to do so in his very attempt of trying to take possession of it, and that he had, in the end, only grasped an artificial love. While I also like this version on the story, it is an utter insult to the original character. Grenouille is a misanthrope. His only regret is that his hatred for the other people, the only thing he could give them, could never been acknowledged. Thus, not only his existence wouldn't be acknowledged for others, but not even himself could ever know who he was, 'cus he lacked any smell, and for him, scent was everything. He wasn't interested in any fiber of his being in loving or being loved. And that's what transform his masterwork in utter failure. Not otherwise, as portrayed in the film. If Grenouille could watch this movie, he'd probably say: ""bullshit! slander! I never felt sad for not being loved by them in the end! What I felt was rage and frustration for my hatred, my core, was doomed to be ignored by them forever!"" Or he might not say anything at all, but pour on himself The Perfum, and exclaim, not without sarcasm: ""What a great movie!""",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The best perfumes bring ones mind memories of beauty and love. Tom Tykwer along with Frank Berner created a effect the brought the sense of smell to the silver screen, engulfing the viewer in a horrible and also totally beautiful experience. The craft of visual story telling accomplished with near perfect balance. The book that was the inspiration of this film has give Mr.Tykwer all the spark needed for his full brilliants to shine. The casting of Ben Whishaw as infinitely gifted, and horrible cursed Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is true brilliants. Mr.Whiskaw portrays a tragic and menacing psychopath that forces one to weep for him and unmercifully loath him. The Mr.Hoffmen and Mr.Rickman also complement the plot with there typical greatness. Mr.Hoffmen portrays a astounding fallen master and tutor. Mr.Rickman plays a bone chillingly striking loving and desperate father. Also in this movie are two of the most breathtakingly beautiful women to ever be portrayed on the silver screen. The first Karoline Herfurth is so full of raw unimaginable but you i have not the words to describe her you will have to see her for yourself to truly grasp the idea. Second is the young but equally relentlessly awe inspiring Rachel Hurd-Wood how with the addition of surreal glowing red hair is mind blowing in her total beauty.Perfume is riveting attack in ones senses and emotions slowly bring you to frustration and rage and then your soul to lift like a rose pedal to the wind.

At no time are you ever given the opportunity to find any common ground to connect with the main character, or any other character at all. There is no sympathy or empathy, I could not have cared less what happened to Grenouille. The mis-match of different cinematographic styles, especially the high speed panning over long stretches of land (think music video) near the end, causes the film to look choppy and jumpy. For a film that is meant express sensuality and passion it lacks any kind of real emotion. As far as the story is concerned, I managed to tough it all the way through, though I almost ended it when the giant orgy at the end started. I was begging for it to be a dream sequence, rather than actually being some kind of mind-control oil of women deal. But no, sadly, first mind control then cannibalism...While not the worst movie ever, I couldn't help but laugh when I watched the special features and heard the directer say he was pleased to be making a realistic, non-surreal film that is relevant to our celebrity obsessed culture.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
484,noseknows,Loved the ending and the aromatic high!,10,25 July 2007,"As I began the movie last night, Jim (my husband) had asked me - ""what is this about""? I explained ""it is a wonderful murder mystery that takes place in the 1800 century - France"". The main character has an extra ordinary nose - smelling anything and everything - ugly to beautiful. I love the book for it captures aroma language in a descriptive way that creates the best olfactory language I have ever read. Describing a scent, so people can understand what one smells is a challenge - smell is very individual.The actors were well casted - BUT this movie is about the director Tom Tykwere and how he took a great story about a subject that we often do not understand - an obsession created by a scent. The directors slight use of sound allowed the viewer to focus on the imagination of scent. Tom spent a great deal of time, creating vivid visuals of aromas and the ability to capture a fragrance without an aroma was down very well.I love how the title ""Perfume"" is so misleading - that people would assume it is about nice smells and yet the main focus to this movie is smell and what any smell can do to a person. How a scent can cause a person to be so involved that it captures the persons soul. I loved the interpretation- scent is a person soul. The murder hunts down the various women to create that perfect accord. The old school perfumery about the the three accords, combing 4 notes and than adding the mystery 13th was nice to see( too bad most perfumery is no longer created this way.)The movie did a wonderful job explaining the art of perfumery. I particularly loved the techniques of distillation, maceration and efflerauge - this was done brilliantly. The perfumer played by Dustin Hoffman was also down very well for he explained ""technical"" blending but ultimately it is about a great nose!I loved this movie, I loved the stench of France and the aromatic high I captured when watching the scenes of lavender fields. The ending was so appropriate to our business, watching a crowd change their complete behavior because of a scent. Jim & I have witness similar behavior when we scent a room - the movie was extreme but brilliant.HTTP://web.mac.com/noseknows",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
485,karl_rossmann,"not great, not bad",6,29 July 2007,"Phantastic story, great cinematography, good acting - yet the weakest film out of Tom Tykwer's stunning oeuvre. Sorry. I cannot point a finger at it but something got lost on the long way of execution. Dustin Hoffman's cameo might be a good example. A perfect little 'étude' in itself, it lacks any depth of the character and doesn't contribute to the movie itself. While Alan Rickman and Karoline Herfurth gave gripping and touching performances, the much praised Ben Whishaw started to bore me towards the end. But this didn't seem to be his failure and i hope to see him soon again. The novel is an intriguing emotional roller coaster and this way makes you sense and believe the most unlikely situations and events. The film tries to go the opposite way, puts much effort into visualization and looses its heart. Maybe it's the script, maybe it's a lack of courage. (Look at the end: so shocking yet absolutely consistent in the book - here softened down to an irritating and helpless attempt to create a poetic moment). Nevertheless it is not a bad movie.

488,cryptokoala,Tom Tykwer = Grenouille ???,8,18 September 2007,"Just saw the DVD version of Perfume -- loved it. Pay attention to how the fleetingness of scent is linked up to the fleetingness of life in the movie -- these are big themes that are being dealt with: do artists need to suffer to create great art? Is beauty more powerful than death? Are there certain things in life -- such as love, beauty, art -- which rise above morality? Only the movie poses these questions much more subtly than I am. What i thought was very interesting, however, was watching interview with the actors about the film. Quite obviously, Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman *HATED* working with their director, Tom Tykwer, and were forced to compliment him none the less. So you have Dustin Hoffman telling us what a unique experience it is to work with a director who values the input of costume designers as much as that of his actors, and who doesn't need to only control ""every second of his film, but every millisecond."" Like Kubrik, who thought about doing this same project, Tywker is obviously one of those sadistic-control-freak directors, who will do anything to achieve their artistic vision, no mater how hated they become by their cast and crew. Another actor actually compares Tykwer to Grenouille, who is similarly unwilling to compromise his artistic vision. Looking at the movie in retrospect, Perfume's directorial style does have this cold, calculating, too-perfect quality to it -- I prefer a looser, sloppier style, where errors become doors of opportunity -- but i have to admit that in this case, the style matches the movies message.

489,svenbrailey,sensational,10,22 September 2007,"I've always loved how often Tom Tykwer's films subtly focus on the senses (especially in ""The Princess and the Warrior""---starting with the first scene with the ice cubes and a blind man...to later when he recalls the scene of Sissi's accident in his auditory memory when he hears the shop door's bell ringing). This sensory-focus makes the film-viewing experience memorable in many ways. Mr. Tykwer must have had his eyes/hands on Suskind's novel for some time because it seems to be a logical progression to finally focus a story entirely on a singular sensory experience. I'm sure the element of the tragedy of love also appealed to him...as it also does to me. I wish that I could offer my humble admiration to him for this film...I'm not sure how he can develop any more of a sensory experience in his next film, but he's the great artist and I'm the amateur critic, so I won't be surprised if I'm surprised again.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

492,matthew-lolomgwtf,A fair and balanced review by someone who hates this film with a passion.,2,23 December 2007,"I felt sick to my stomach the entire time I was watching this movie - not because of the graphic content, but because I knew I had just made a huge mistake by paying five dollars to see this film.First, I will admit that there is, at least, one good theme in this movie: Grenouille (French for ""frog"") realizes the transitory nature of our existence and tries (in his own ridiculous and horrifyingly non-compelling way) to establish something permanent about himself. The problem I have with this movie is that the thematic richness of the film can be summed up in that one sentence... Yet, the film is 2 hours and 27 minutes long.The film is about a sociopath with an absolutely unbelievable sense of smell, played by Ben Whishaw. The emotionless portrayal (thanks, Whishaw) and staggering lack of dialog leave the audience with absolutely no chance of feeling any sympathy for (or connection to) the main character, who is the only thing on screen, smelling something or another, for what seem like hours at a time.We can't feel especially sorry for his victims, either. Out of about fifteen girls, only three of them have any lines at all, and the best-developed victim (his final victim, the one he chases through the majority of the film, and is able to track from across a mountain range by her scent alone) is nothing more than a stock character. The victims have absolutely no character depth whatsoever - they could be played by mannequins, and the rational portion of the audience is left wondering why, exactly, we are supposed to care about Grenouille's killing spree at all.Alan Rickman's portrayal was excellent, although this portrayal was overshadowed by the terrible quality of the way the character was written. Dustin Hoffman's character was likely the most bland and uninteresting character I have ever seen him portray, and, although I am certainly a fan of Dustin Hoffman, I was not impressed with his performance here. None of the other characters even had enough dialog or screen time to develop into rich or interesting characters.The exposition of the film is mildly compelling, although no momentum initiated in the exposition comes anywhere close to building and carrying through to the climax. There is no rising action for what seems like a very, very long time. The majority of the first half of the film seems to be comprised of the anti-hero standing around, trying to look creepy while either smelling something or yelling at Dustin Hoffman's character for not being able to synthesize the scent of copper or something equally asinine and uninteresting to the viewer.The climax of the film is lazy and nonsensical. A frenzied, bloodthirsty mob that wants the anti-hero dead for killing thirteen girls begins to adore and worship him because he dabs some perfume (which he made from the dead girls) on his neck. Then the crowd rapidly becomes a giant orgy because he throws his perfume-soaked handkerchief out into the crowd. A man whose daughter was killed by Grenouille smells the anti-hero and begs for the murderer's forgiveness, calling him ""my son."" It's deus ex machina, it's not compelling at all, and it's completely infuriating.It is matter-of-factly stated by the narrator that Grenouille could literally conquer the world ""and more, if he wanted to"" with the perfume, which is one of the only things I can think of that is as utterly laughable as the orgy/forgiveness scene immediately preceding the line.Finally, the line that the audience is left with as the movie ends is as infuriatingly ludicrous as anything else in the film: after Grenouille entices the impoverished people of the Paris fish markets to tear him to shreds and eat his flesh by pouring the ""dead girl perfume"" on himself, the narrator states that the man's killers felt happy, because this horribly bestial act was the first thing that they felt had done purely out of love. Since the film does not even attempt to explore the immensely complex theme of what love is, I cannot even begin to properly express the incompetence with which this movie addresses the theme with which the filmmakers chose to end the movie.To summarize: what may be the film's most problematic aspect is the fact that, while the audience has almost no reason whatsoever to sympathize with the central character, the narration and the construction of the film's events are CLEARLY orchestrated to portray the murderous anti-hero as the true victim of the film. Unfortunately, that role belongs to neither the pseudo-creepy and non-compelling anti-hero nor his bland and undeveloped victims. The true victims of this film are the movie-going audience.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
493,wim-70,Not enough Patchouli!,6,10 February 2008,"It's a conundrum, isn't it? A book with millions of fans, with an astounding storyline, written by a recluse. Who could make the film that would do such a book justice? I heard Suskind had prevented Hollywood and a host of Directors/Studio's from taking on the task year after year, probably a good business decision on his part with book royalties continually rolling in, so can't blame him for that. Finally he allowed some of his German film people to give it a shot. Sadly, they missed an opportunity to give the book an entire new life. I waited years for the movie, as his book is an essential read for everyone. In my view, the movie plays it all too safe and did not ""push the envelope"" - the result is a timid mainstream 'copy' of the book. It tells the story of the book, but failed to do it with imagination. Too much bland alcohol, not enough patchouli. Specifically? Grenouille was wrongly cast - Ben didn't portray the uniqueness or menace of Grenouille, no character. What a role to be given, what an opportunity lost. No risk taken in casting or directing with the lead role. The script itself doesn't seem ""crafted"" - it felt like the writers again seemed not to bother to stretch, to craft, to improve, to communicate each line with the most effective and persuasive delivery. Rickman is a man of character, but he doesn't show it here. And Dustin tried to throw a twist into Baldini, but did we believe it? No. Even John Hurt's wonderful voice is frequently too casual in delivery, no menacing lilt there. Hurt no doubt selected because ""He's the best"" - yes, for National Geographic. He's a wonderful voice but again it didn't contribute, it didn't add, it simply strolled along beside the film. Did the Producer/Director test for others? It's the dark story of a murderer for goodness sake, not a children's fairy tale. The costumes and staging is good, and I see this is where the movie has won some awards. The cinematography in the first half of the film went convincingly, but it's in the second half of the story where the intensity increases, but this isn't matched in the film, with more and more wide shots, opportunities to drag the audience in deeper are not grasped. The final scenes where Grenouille escaped the gallows was treated in an overly simplistic way, all wide shots! Whereas this is supposed to be the er, climax. For once, I have to say, Hollywood may have made a ""bigger"" film. Very disappointed. Perhaps Suskind did not allow for any interpretation. Well Patrick, I think you've lost a lot of book royalties as the film won't make anyone buy the book. What a shame.

497,xautumnrain,Bad movie,5,1 December 2008,"I saw this movie and disagreed with it. It only plays on the negatives, and makes Paris seem like its dirty and disgusting and full of murderers. This movie was all about some freaky guy that had a really sensitive sense of smell. Then he went and killed everyone and then people were all wanting to kill him and then he uses his perfect perfume and even the father of the girl he killed was all in love with him. And at the end the sex was kind of weird. This whole movie was very disgusting and weird and it gives me the creeps. I recommend watching any other movies besides this one, unless ur bored out of ur mind and like to see weird disgusting obscene stuff, then this is the movie for you.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

(the answer of course in ""never"" since there is money involved, but it was a rhetorical question anyway) I have never seen a movie nearly as good as the book it has been inspired from (most characteristic example being The Lord of the Rings), and I personally consider every attempt to do something like that so crudely pure sacrilege, and an insult to all people who love books and consider both literature and cinema to be a form of art.Concerning this one: they didn't even manage to stick to the book's plot, let alone anything else...Don't see it - read the book instead, it will be much more entertaining and worthwhile in general.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

With that time you could do an awful lot of things - spend time with your family; read a good book; meet some friends for a coffee; make a papier mache chess-set. You should do any one of those things, rather than watch this movie. It's bad. Really, really bad. So bad that I was at times laughing out loud at the pure, unadulterated stupidity of it all.Perfume was released about 4 years ago. I had seen trailers for it, and it had sparked my interest. I finally saw it on TV just last night, and thanked my lucky stars I had not paid money to go and see it. And the reason I'm writing this review, 4 years late, is that I'm trying to save you from wasting your time.The film is full of absurdity, shockingly bad dialogue, faux-philosophy, and death-defying leaps of logic. It has possibly the most ridiculous ending I've witnessed in a film that is marketed as high-end, non-mainstream, ""art-house"" film making.Many of the reviews that you read here will talk about how amazing this film is. They will intimate that if you don't like it, you're probably a fan of action movies of the Steven Seagal sort, that you are some sort of plebeian that wouldn't appreciate an art-house movie of such quality.I like to think that I have a wide and varied taste in movies - yup, I like some action movies (Heat springs to mind. Great film, and one of the best shoot-out scenes you're ever likely to see. Must admit I'm no big Steven Seagal fan); I like some soppy love-type stories (can't really think of any at the moment); I like the occasional musical (Sound of Music, Chicago). Love a good war-film (Tora Tora Tora, Downfall) - even the occasional blockbuster (War of the Worlds; Deep Impact).But I really do lean towards ""art-house"" - if by that you mean quality story-telling, written and directed by people who respect an audiences intelligence (Examples? The Wind That Shakes The Barley is a favourite; The Science of Sleep; The Wrestler; Waltz with Bashir). So someone telling me that the reason I didn't like this film is because I don't understand art-house does not, I'm afraid, wash with me.I was going to write and explain the film, and tell you what it is about. I even ticked the box that you have to tick if you are going to have spoilers in your review - I'm going to untick that now, because I really would go over the 1000 word limit if I dissected the movie in gratuitous detail. So you can do one of three things: 1) disbelieve this review, watch the movie and enjoy it. Good luck to you, I bear you no ill will.2) Believe this review, and avoid this movie like the plague. Well done!! You've saved yourself a couple of hours. Use it wisely grasshopper.3) Believe this review, and watch the movie anyway. Yup - I can understand that approach - surely no movie can be this bad? Well - the movie is so bad, that I'm almost tempted to watch it again. Maybe I was just in the wrong frame of mind? Hmmmm...dunno about that. But I think it might be worth it anyway, just for the laughs.Good luck, whichever path on this choose your own adventure film review you decide to take...",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

He made you believe that he wasn't a bad guy, even when he killed. You don't get the impression he's evil, and you aren't quite sure of his true motive. Does he want to find the ultimate scent or something more concrete perhaps? You have to watch to know what I'm talking about.The story is dark, and it's not meant to be happy.

502,thundermane-745-554939,A movie you need to feel,9,22 May 2010,"I think it is rather horrible how some people bash this movie. It may be my education or just a ability to comprehend things, but I believe you need a certain point of view to ""dig"" this movie. Some people apparently find the urge or need to seek out stuff which they dislike about a movie. Either that, or they simply lack the ability to see different perspectives on the same subject. Some people, *cough* mostly Americans *cough*, only see a monster when they see Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. Apparently dividing people into categories is perfectly normal, whence every person is unique. If you would really look at it with a objective view, everyone is ""normal"". Everyone has a reason why they do certain things, and the main character most definitely has relatively good reasons. He is a idealist. Yes, he is a twisted boy. The first time he experiences love, he doesn't understand what it is, and gets confused, he even kills the perfect girl he likes. It than becomes a obsession, a life work to catch love, it comes with a price, but he succeeds. It's all very symbolic, but the way his experiences are brought on screen are overwhelming and you really catch the way of thoughts of the main character. Now here is the big deal: You don't sympathize entirely with the main character. But you don't have to. Should we hate people with such ambition to really become something they really want to be? Myself, I despise the routine of life. Living each day the same. The main character really strives to become something, or make something sublime. Sometimes that is the highest cause. And I think that is something they wanted to show in this movie, next to a lot more beautiful symbolism.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

They told us the story by the voice and it express everything we need. The author's imagination is transformed into our minds by that voice. I recommend that you should watch this movie without preconceived opinion. You are going to find so many different things from movies you watched before.

Overall the story is very original, interesting and enjoyable. From the beginning you're left with an eagerness to know what happens (as any good story should do). The only let downs for me are Dustin Hoffman's ridiculously poor Italian accent (as an actor's job is to convince the audience they are someone else entirely) and the bizarre and unnecessary orgy scene at the end. I was hoping that it was all going to be a dream that Jean- Baptiste was having before being executed. The acting from the extras when he unleashes the perfume is so over the top, it's cringeworthy. Despite this, the film is definitely worth a watch. Alan Rickman steals the show.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

Beautiful naked dead women and hetero male-oriented orgy scenes aside, the astoundingly terrible accents made me want to pull my own hair out. C'mon. They're supposedly in medieval Paris and Dustin Hoffman's character is supposedly Italian, yet everyone spoke English inconsistently tinged with accents from various parts of Great Britain. Better direction and acting might have made the incredible somehow believable (in the manner of dark magical realism), but here it just seemed irritatingly implausible.

You just have to see it! The hole movie is just a new thing... The way you think of it is different... In the middle of the movie your mind starts thinking and imaging the smells they might be feeling. Tom Tykwer has definitely managed to capture the writers way of telling a beautiful story of a young poor man in Paris who has extra sensitive smell perception and by accident ends up in a situation that will haunt him and change his life. His hole life develops into a mad chase for preservation of all smell and fragrances of all things in life. The unfortunate accident continues to haunt him all the time. During his learning's with the Italian perfume maker who is played by Dustin Hoffman he learn about this ultimate smell. And he is told about a legend that tells about a perfume who was discovered in ancient Egypt and made the hole world stand still when it was released into the air.

He did it to have a part of his victims with him always. However, instead of just ingesting them, he made them into a pleasant aroma that made people want to have lots of free loving sex.This movie was definitely a head-scratcher and had me saying WTF?! because the ending seemed completely off the mark from the rest of the movie.

I wonder why then try to kill and extract the perfume of a whole body when each part of the body has its own characteristic scent. Someone with the legendary acute olfactory sense of the anti heroic serial killer should be more than aware of this, but then it would obviously break the magic and poetry conveyed by the constructive build achieved the brilliant editing.The killer could discern smell at great distances, but we can only be aware of those things relatively close to us. The antihero is cursed by his almost supernatural capability which makes him in a way different from any other human being. He grows in extremely harsh conditions which deprive him from any other face of humanity than disgrace, which follows him inexorably and installs him with the obsession to capture something he will never be able to have.

There's a point in this film where he crumples in despair, pain and horror written across his face as he milks the giant cow, crying ""Forgive me!"". I think it's a plea to the audience to forget his part in this train wreck.There's some heavy-handed, pompous moralising written into this to justify it as an allegory and free it from the constraints of realism (and a sensible plot), but if I want suspension of belief to this extent I'll watch a Tim Burton movie. It's really not a good sign when I find myself laughing out loud at how ludicrous a film has become.

516,alangus,good use of metaphor,10,12 November 2012,"I think the movie is pretty good, especially its use of metaphor. But it seems that a lot of people hate it. Different from the novel, the director adds a little romantic characteristic into Jean-Baptiste's characterization, which I think is acceptable. In the novel, Jean- Baptiste is a very incarnation of lust, only pursuing for smell. But in the movie, it is obvious that the director wants to suggest that the first murder begins with a sense of love and was done by accident, which makes Jean-Baptiste be more like a human, not just a symbol presented in the novel. Jean-Baptiste does not know good or evil. Just like the movie says from beginning, he does not distinguish good or bad smell. He grows up with a hellish life, knows nothing about civilization, or care, or love. He does not know the smell he always wants to extract, can be pursued by other ways, to let them be alive and care for them. He has never thought about to ""grasp"" lives as beautiful as those girls. On this point, he is much clean and honest than those who always control Jean's life and treat slaves as animals and machines. Smell is everything for Jean. Smell is the proof of Jean's survival. But his perfume's smell, although can give people a sense of heaven, is also a smell of death. When the basket of apricots falls in his execution, he bursts into tears. When everyone indulging themselves in the sense of love, Jean knows all of their sense is a fake, and he can never get the true love forever.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

On the one hand it is hard to visualize smells and on the other hand not everything can be shown during the movie. But for me, it was realized pretty well. Even you can not smell the things, you can imagine how they smell which may be due to the camera work, which was well done! For me, the actors did a really good job, too. They played their roles really good and according to Grenouille, I really thought that he was the Grenouille described in the book. The only ""negative"" thing I can say about that, is that in the book he is described as an ugly person, but Ben Wishow is not ugly. But to me, that didn't really matter.

Alan Rickman fairs little better,throwing his weight around and asking where his daughter is,when clearly the question he should be asking is where his detonators are,because at least Die Hard had an exciting plot,and with them he could blow up the set of Perfume and take all evidence of it's existence with him.The climax of the film is unspeakably bad,and I for one was sitting in the cinema desperately trying to choke back the laughter.When Hoffman got this script on his desk,was he awake when he read it?

520,Spinelli_86,A sensual experience,9,14 September 2006,"To my dismay this movie has been accused of dealing with the addressed subjects only on the surface and just trying to shock the audience with extreme imagery. I strongly have to disagree with that. ""Das Parfum"" may be a lot of things but shocking sure isn't one of them. Of course it is visually overwhelming and not only with pictures of pretty flowers and sounds of the wind softly shaking the trees on a warm summer night but what is this movie, if not a piece about the sensuality of the human being? Yes, it is about smells but smelling is just simply not one of the things you can experience while sitting in a movie theatre. This motion picture however comes very close to it. We see close-ups on maggots crawling around and fish getting their heads chopped of but also human bodies in all their perfection and people declaring their honest love for one another. It might be impossible to make the audience fully understand the world in which Jean-Baptiste Grenouille lives but it does manage to create a similar vibe that brings us close to what Grenouille ""feels"" when he smells. Tom Tykwer beautifully achieves to always put the audience in the right mood, with the help of an amazing soundtrack and great camera work.One could criticize that Ben Wishaw is too good looking for the part but we have to keep in mind that this story is supposed to be about the character of Grenouille and the way he himself sees his live. Since to him, the smell is the soul of every being, his appearance does not matter to him. So we might as well thank Tom Tykwer for casting an actor who is pretty decent to look at for two and half hours.Please watch this movie without any prejudices. Open your mind to images and sounds and try to imagine what your feeling could ""smell"" like. And even if that does not work you can still just enjoy a beautifully told story.

I think this is not just a movie of different story but a different & unique person who possess a different power. Neither it's mighty, tiny nor strength. Surprisingly it's the power of smell. Superficially the visualization effect of this movie is really does a fabulous job & that certainly good enough to impact audience mind so that they should be overwhelmed to know how this power can be shaped & defeats the whole existent power of the world. I consider the movie contains a strong slice & it really has made me curious to know about an exhaust mind person who has no smell of his own self. Besides, according to the name it contains another portion that has made me concerned to know how the people forsake their morality in front of the selfishness & greediness. It's casually surprising me to see how the cruelty turned into the love by the only means of scent.

From what I see the costumes, scenery are well done and the actors are all beautiful looking. But once again, and this is what I hate about Hollywood, they show that women are only a sex symbol; an item for pleasure. Now you're probably crying about that he {Jean-Baptiste Grenouille} wanted their {the woman's} souls, but have you ever asked yourself why he never murdered a man, if it was really the soul he was after?Most of you will say I need to be more open minded or that I don't understand the plot, or that I ""judge books by their cover"". But please tell me, what does the plot really mean, what does this movie want to teach the audience? Also, what good feeling will come to me when the trailer already exposes the horror of the film? What good feeling will I have when I watch this disturbing film, only to see if my thoughts were correct? What enlightenment does one receive to see a crazy man who is driven by his passions; having no self control?This movie shows so well how women are abused in today's society. These kinds of movies are what motivate rape crimes! Just like the modern ""fashionable clothing"" we see women wearing now-a-days.Women are Beings with feelings, heart and soul. We woman deserve more respect.The correct action for woman to take is to stand up and destroy this abuse. Shame to those who see nothing bad about this movie, shame to those who do not see the corrupted society who has destroyed woman's femininity, our motherhood and gentleness!After the war woman achieved equal rights to men, women received the right to vote, to get an education, and so on. This is not wrong but it has gotten too far. The point is women are not equal to men. The truth is that we are different, but this does NOT make us less deserving then men, this does NOT make us less; being who we are is what makes us special!The movie, Perfume: A story of a murderer displays that women are just for pleasure, and in order to get to this pleasure one would even kill to possess it. This so dreadfully wrong!I have heard how women complain; trying everything just to be equal to men, how they demand more respect, but then why do they not start protesting when a woman is looked at as a sex object? Why not protest against all the abusive advertising of women? Pornography? Gender change? Etc.We women demand respect but first we also need to realize that by achieving it, we need to first respect ourselves. We need to realize who we are and why we are the beings we are. We need to show the world that we are not a sex object!I for one am very offended and from seeing just the trailer will not be going to see the movie, even if the actors are good looking and even though I am tempted just to see it for the fun of it - but I will NOT see this movie because it degrades women and the true role of a man.It is up to you now to decide, whether to like this movie because of the handsome faces and strange excitement; or to abolish it, despite the nagging of amusement.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer
525,sweetkissesofaith-722-570984,"Tom Tykwer composes an unparalleled, yet intoxicating potion of perplexing beauty and bewildering imagination, influential of macabre and lunacy",10,6 July 2013,"""What is in a name...?""That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet""As I sit hypnotized and saturating every element of this compelling international cinematique, I am reminiscent of all the intricately absurd locales and dramatic landscapes, the extraordinary design fabrications, and the exquisite acting portrayed by the supporting dramatis personae. Unfortunately, I have not allowed myself the pleasure of reading Patrick Suskind's illustrious novel; therefore, I cannot juxtapose. Why do I love this film? It is most definitely a travesty indulging greed, passion, and appetite. The leading character's perplexing magnetic performance compels the audience to fall in love and empathize with the villain's heinous affairs.The eerie introduction arouses the possibility that a sinister fairy tale is momentarily about to unveil, as a rapturous congregation growls and bellows its murderous consent of a sadistic punishment dispensed upon a heavily plagued man. A narrator flashes back to the 18th Century Paris, to the unsuitable, yet significant birth of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (BEN WHISHAW) at the unsavory Paris fish market. Orphaned and left to die amongst the discarded fish entrails, the undernourished infant was born with an extraordinary enhanced awareness of smells. The film aggressively places Jean-Baptiste Grenouille against a sequence of hopeless and repugnant circumstances as he develops into adulthood. Grenouille establishes an apprenticeship at a plummeting Paris perfumery owned and operated by Baldini (DUSTIN Hoffman), who portrays as his wretched mentor: an aging fragrance connoisseur. His collaborations with Jean-Baptiste jubilantly enliven and arouse the inspiration that lay dormant within him for so many years prior. Baldini eagerly tutors his aggressively ravenous pupil, and soon basques within the newfound successes and distinguished dignitaries congregating his perfumery. Baldini (DUSTIN Hoffman) is indeed the boisterously entertaining eye-candy. However, while viewing the movie, it is evident that Ben Whishaw's (Grenouille) conviction dominates the screen, contrary to his counterpart Dustin Hoffman. Grenouille rapidly exceeds his mentor, Baldini (DUSTIN Hoffman) in the medium of harmonizing and pairing fragrances especially formulated to intoxicate and mesmerize its beholder. The drama soon adopts its ""schizophrenic"" persona as Grenouille's uncanny sense of smell evolves into a macabre obsession. If the audience remains attentive, the film exposes the development of a man whom not only attaches, but also correlates beauty to nothing more than an exquisite possession. Ben Whisaw (JEAN-BAPTISTE GRENOUILLE) successfully conveys his character as vehemently infatuated and haunted by his insatiable appetite for preserving women' fragile aromas and fragrances. As the content matter surpasses daring and sinister, Grenouille feverishly seeks to eternalize the essence of women through their captivating aroma. Tom Tykwer composes an unparalleled, yet intoxicating potion of perplexing beauty and bewildering imagination, influential of macabre and lunacy. I feel the leading character Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, was depicted cleverly as his hopeless and afflicted spirit prevailed through scent. As the thought-provoking lunacy unravels, the audience witnesses Grenouille's most adored and treasured strength befalls as his utmost weakest link. I proudly salute to the finishing act in which Jean-Baptiste Grenouille has seduced the ravenous crowd into a stupor of erotica and rapture.[**Spoiler**] Perfume is a visually seductive and obscure account revealing an obsessive man pursuing beauty and appreciation within a virtueless society. I absolutely give this film 10 out of 10 stars! I must inquire, is this ""Art imitating Life"" or ""Life imitating Art""? Tom Tykwer acclaims that, ""Although you never come close to understanding Jean-Baptiste, you don't turn your nose up at him either"". "" It took imagination to tell it, courage to film it, thought to act it, and from the audience it requires a brave curiosity about the peculiarity of obsession"". ""Perfume is a feast for the senses"".--Roger Ebert",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It is really what I imagined while reading the book, good adaptation 2. I love the scenes, the close ups to things, its very artistic and it gives you the idea to be entering to his world 3. Great actors!!! U believe everyone, and Jean Baptiste is really really a master piece. 4.U never expect whats gonna happen....and thats why it is an awesome movie (or could someone say they knew how it was going to end??? NOOOO!) 5. I think is not another Hollywood dumb movie.

527,adrianwalby,A Dark Beauty 10/10,10,5 March 2018,"The story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (John Whishaw) takes us on a journey from the squalor of Paris's fish markets, to the city's most established perfume houses, to the quietude of the countryside and finally to the attention of society's elite.
Grenouille has the best nose in Paris, and a compulsion to continue expanding his library of olfactory experiences. He progresses from Madame Gaillard's orphanage to Grimal's tannery, and from here coaxes his way into an apprenticeship with the once-respected Perfumier, Baldini. Here he learns vocabulary for the aromas, how to write formulae and how to present himself in society if he is to become a great artisan one day. Without Grenouille's knowledge, the people who've had any influence in his disadvantaged life are doomed soon after he moves on from them.Having kept his promise of 100 written perfume formulae for Baldini, Grenouille is encouraged to travel to Grasse to further expand his skills. Here he perfects the art of ""enfleurage"", a process by which odorless fats, solid at room temperature, are used to capture the fragrant compounds exuded by plants. Without a scent of his own, the young man's ultimate goal is to apply this methodology in a manner which will change his status forever, from reviled and feared to adored by mankind.
German Director, Tom Tykwer, applies a mostly sepia / monochromatic colour scheme throughout the movie, with occasional bright splashes to focus the viewer on certain details: yellow plums, lavendar fields, flora and the red hair of the mesmerising young women Grenouille encounters. John Hurt's narration perfectly captures the author's original writing style, evokes the smells of the locale and slowly articulates the main character's disturbing thoughts.Whilst the movie is set in France, Grenouille's London accent eliminates the need for sub-titles and instead enables the viewer to keep pace as the story unfolds. The eerie choir music draws us deeply into this dark, extraordinary film. Our empathy for Grenouille's introversion and tenacity may begin to waver during the story. However, towards the end of the movie we are reminded of the struggles he's endured - his reasoning, sensuality and brilliance once again merit our respect. Grenouille's self-transformation from invisible to invincible is compelling.
Patrick Suskind's best-selling novel which I first came across 30 years ago has been beautifully adapted to film. 10/10 Score in my opinion. This movie will appeal to anyone who has enjoyed Peter Greenaway's ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"".",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

To imagine someone overcoming so many odds to escape into his own word. I found the main character acting to be (breathless). It is a story of a gentle soul embarking on a misguided journey. I declare it a must see!I had no idea what the movie was about when I started watching it. I tend to stay away from period pieces.

531,monooulin,Great adaptation of a novel,10,3 June 2007,"I don't remember watching a movie so equal to the novel what is based from! I read the novel by Patrick Süskind years ago and it was one of those books that you never forget! so attractively disturbing that it was one of my favorite readings... But with this movie, I completed my love. Because the director caught so well in images what the novelist expressed in words. It was amazing to prove that specially at the final of the movie, when the main character is waiting to be executed in the middle of all those people or when he finally arrives to Paris at the end, the director and me had the same vision of what was written. I mean, I imagined while I was reading this part of the book exactly the same images as the ones Tom Tykwer filmed. I don't know if that is a goal of the novelist who could express in words so precise images or the director who could express in images so precise words... How the director obtained through images express scents! The film is exactly what I wanted to watch from this project.

532,alexanderj19862,"Yea, that was quite enjoyable",8,11 July 2014,"One of those underrated gems you feel lucky to see. striking film. Story begins with a poor, orphaned child in 18th century Paris born with an extremely acute sense of smell. During his childhood boarding at an orphanage, his abilities become apparent to the other children, and he is alienated quickly. He is sold into the servitude of an overbearing task master who, inadvertently, brings the, now nearing adult hood, protagonist to the city where he becomes completely intrigued with all the smells of the world. Though we are shown how this can be destructive early in the film, it is difficult not to relate to the main character's plight, which leads him to become obsessed, to a great fault, with preserving smells of, what he perceives to be, the most intoxicating beauty. I will say nothing else about the plot, and would recommend this film to anyone. Ben Wishaw is quite an overlooked actor, especially in I'm Not There, and IMO never found a successful vehicle. Some truly amazing supporting acting in Perfume as well.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

This was not a even movie, it was a German teleplay and very unclear what genre it belongs to. It is not scary, not mysterious, not funny, not suspenseful, not intellectual, not arty - only bad. Most of the time you think you are sitting in a movie for blind persons. Nearly the whole time the story is told by a narrator, actors are just speechless. Ben Whishaw acts like an actor in a silent movie. Dustin Hoffman is given the only good performance. Alan Rickman, one of Britain's greatest stage actors, acts like a stage actor. It is really a pity what would be possible with another producer, director and director of photography. To be constructive, just a little action also might have helped. A little.

He's about to be executed but apparently his perfume is so good that it convinces the crowd that he's perfectly innocent or even an angel and they all fall over, hug and get naked. The ending is so ridiculously weird, bad and just unbelievable that it just ruined the whole film.

I imagined that this great perfume I was totally eager throughout the whole movie to smell, would be charming and make the one who wears it irresistible but in a good way not to make people turn into animals !

536,Vanguard_OYD,Don't Recommend,3,12 January 2007,"I didn't like this movie very much. I didn't think that it went over my head. From what I gathered the structure of the movie was supposed to be very much like the structure of the perfume; the bass chord that linger for days afterward was death, but that legendary 13th note was paradise. I figured that the images were so disgusting at some parts to compensate for the lack of ""smellevision,"" which would have truly been effective. However, I did think the acting was good out of Hoffman, Rickman, and Whishaw played his part effectively. But, this movie was far too long. I thought the journey to find the best scents was interesting, as was the journey to discover how to best preserve scent. But, it dragged on far too long, and the ending was horrendous, and totally ruined any shot it had to win me over. I also had no appreciation for British accents in France, in fact the only French in the movie seemed to be in writing or the overused monsieur. It started as an orphan tale, then it became a quest for knowledge, then a serial killer story, and finally a mix of myth and legend. 3/10",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

The movie is just as good as the book is. A must see movie! The way the sense of smelling is filmed is absolutely wonderful. The lack of smell in a movie is successfully compensated with suggestive imagery. It is as if you really smell all the smells and more. In the opening scene you can actually hear Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (the movies protagonist) smell. Beautiful scenery of Paris and France.

At-least they tried to make it happens.One thing, it is very tough to visualize smells and in the movie, it was very realistic to watch. But for me, it was expressed pretty well. Even you can not smell the things, you can imagine how they smell which may be due to the cinematic work, which was amazing. The actors also did a really good part and obviously very lively, which was important. Everything, everyone who acts here, are very much lively.So, all in all I have to say, I think that it is a really interesting movie.

This film, on the contrary is absolutely ridiculous.i can see why this may have worked in the book, but I don't know where it got lost in film..Perhaps it was the terrible screen play, the terrible acting, the gnaff narration, the kitch costuming, the overtly apparent and insulting use of lighting or the fact that the biggest emotional response it could pull from any audience was a grimace in confusion; it just doesn't work. At All.Some stories are too big for film, and this was one of them. i doubt I was alone in thinking as I walked out the cinema how on earth the films makers got enough people to think it was a good idea to produce this. Once again, Holly wood tries to do something it simply can't. In the opening blurb to this film on this very site, it suggests that Stanley Kubrick; whom has never shyed away from the 'impossible' film claimed that this very story was 'unfilmable'Jeez.

I suspected the same to happen with the perfume. the teaser trailer was excellent, but the regular trailer spoilt a lot as it just showed too much and didn't capture the film's quality at all. so i entered the film with trepidation and was convinced otherwise. Tom Tykwer showed us again and again that he is a huge talent, be it winter sleeper, Lola runs or the warrior and the empress. the perfume is a visual feast. all roles are perfectly cast, the music, the camera, everything fits together like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. And the film isn't Hollywood-like mainstream like e.g. the Da Vinci Code at all. thank god. it has lots of black humor without getting cynic, it is quite amoral and at other times just immersed in beauty - and every penny of its 50 Mio euro budget shows. how much better to spend 50 Mio in the perfume than 150 Mio in crap movies like Wolfgang Petersen's latest. i am already very much looking forward to Mr Tykwer's next film. he plays in another league now.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

It's really unusual, as the novel is. It's generally difficult to convey something like a SMELL in a book or a movie, and it's also difficult to create a satisfying adaption of a novel. So my personal opinion is that The Parfume Movie is one of the few good adaptations, because it eagerly tries to convey the complicated world of smells and the world of Grenouille and also achieves it in many ways. There are of course some parts missing or changed if you compare novel and movie, but that is always the case with adaptations.I saw the movie one hour ago and have just read some comments. Some of them are ""disappointed"" or ""boooring"", but most of these opinions are really not well founded, so I couldn't make out what EXACTLY was so boring and disappointing...

555,elissarizkallah-45018,A work of art,8,20 December 2018,"The most fascinating thing about ""Perfume"", is that it delivers a delightful form of synaesthesia to the viewer : not only does the movie centers on Jean Baptiste Grenouille's enigmatic olfactive powers, but Tyker was able to paint the portrait of every fragrance in the viewer's mind using color and sound. For instance, any viewer with an imaginative, artistic mindset could've sensed the roses in Laura Richis's curly auburn hair, the sweet acidity on the Plum Girl's pristine white hands, the ghastly odours in the moist sound of meat at the fish market, the aroma of coffee and spice through their movement, the smooth crushing of jonquils at madam Arnufil's workshop, the movement of wind through chiffon dresses itself was also enough to convey a tide of musk to the viewer... And the list goes on.In that extremely well made movie equally on the scale of production, acting, camera movement, scenery, decor and costume design, Tom Tykwer was also able to merge the perfect dosage of terror and sensuality. Technically, the movie is about an obsessed psychopath who finds pleasure in murdering young women and chopping off their hair : if directed otherwise, the movie could've turned out to be extremely bland and disturbing. However, Tykwer succeeded at picturing murder through a poetic, sensual and somehow mystical lense, without even one drop of blood.To sum up, the movie was to me, from a personal point of view, a legit work of art.",Perfume - The Story of a Murderer

I understand telling a crowd of extras, ""Okay, now look like you've just smelled the most beautiful smell in the world,"" is a tall order, and that conveying the effect of a scent on a person's expression and demeanor is for better actors. Ben Whishaw, Dustin Hoffman, and Alan Rickman succeeded in this. I suppose I can't hold it against the extras for overdoing something so subtle - that's why they're extras - but the close-up facial reactions of these people should perhaps have featured less.
