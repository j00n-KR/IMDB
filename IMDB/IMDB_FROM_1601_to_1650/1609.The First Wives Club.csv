0,MartinHafer,"A comedy, perhaps...but there are also MANY dark moments and a deeper message.",7,6 November 2011,"If you watch ""The First Wives Club"" because you need a good laugh, perhaps you should try another film. Yes, it clearly has some funny moments but it also is filled with dark ones--and a message you wouldn't expect to find in a simple comedy. You KNOW it's going to be a dark film at the beginning, as a lady whose husband has left her takes her own life. This horrible event brings some of her old friends to the funeral--and there they compare notes and see that they, too, were used and cast aside by their husbands--husbands who have no replaced them with trophy wives. So, the three friends (Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn) concoct a plan--a plan that involves fleecing their unfaithful ex-husbands and creating a club for wives going through the same sort of situations they have.As I said, there are some dark moments and some funny ones. But the film never falls to the level of slapstick or becomes mostly comedy--but a mix. Some may not like this and the film is a bit heavy-handed at times, but the overall film is well worth seeing and has a decent feminist message. Worth seeing.",The First Wives Club
1,bkoganbing,Marriage Veterans,7,9 June 2016,"The short cameo appearance of Stockard Channing as she takes leave of this life after being dumped by her husband for a younger model galvanizes three of her friends Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton to take some action other than sit on their alimony which can be a sometimes thing.Belaboring the obvious what they all have in common is that they were all first wives, veterans of marriage who get dumped by their husbands going into midlife crisis. The First Wives Club is open to any women who feel they've been put through the ringer in their divorces, don't just get mad, get more than even.Goldie Hawn is an aging actress who goes through all kinds of makeup and plastic surgery just to stay young. Graduate to character roles Goldie, better than you did that. Diane Keaton is this sunny optimist whose world was her marriage and she still tries to maintain her sunny outlook on life. Midler is the most bitter of all as her family money and connections help start Dan Hedaya's successful furniture business.It's Hedaya who suffers the most, but he's also the most likely in the end to realize what a jerk he's been. Of all the supporting roles I liked Philip Bosco best as Midler's Uncle Carmine. It irks him how his niece has been disgraced for as he puts it, he started his business with a lot of merchandise that fell off the back of a truck.Goldie Hawn's best scene is with her cosmetic surgeon Rob Reiner who tells her she's over the legal limit for botox. Hawn is beginning to sound like Gloria Swanson on being an aging actress, but no way is she ready for any closeup believe it or not Mr. DeMille.In fact her ex who is a producer has the chutzpah to want Hawn to play mother in his next picture opposite Elizabeth Berkley the teenage bimbo he wants to go back to his teen years with. Maggie Smith who is a marriage veteran herself who keeps herself nicely from alimony is friend to these women. Watch some of her work with the world's worst interior decorator Bronson Pinchot.In the end the women get into a worthwhile endeavor and do realize revenge is sweet but there's more to life than getting even.The First Wives Club is built nicely on the foundation of the good chemistry developed between the three first wives. And they get good ensemble support as well. A nice comedy from the 90s.",The First Wives Club
2,SnoopyStyle,wanted to like it,5,18 May 2020,"Elise Elliot Atchison (Goldie Hawn), Brenda Morelli Cushman (Bette Midler), and Annie MacDuggan Paradis (Diane Keaton) were best friends from college. They are reunited when their other college friend committed suicide over a failed marriage. The three women also find themselves struggling with marital troubles. Elise is a fading actress desperate for a role. Brenda's ex-husband has moved on with a hot young thing. Annie is a doormat. They decide to take their revenge.I don't like the idiot hot young new thing trope. It's too easy and too broad. I also don't like the trio's progression. There is an interesting turning point for women's relationship and then they go slapstick. I keep wanting to like this movie but these characters aren't doing it for me. I don't find this actually funny. It has the potential to be a compelling women's relationship movie but I don't buy that either.",The First Wives Club
3,mark.waltz,Lots of funny lines and situations don't make for a good film.,4,17 January 2021,"There's lots of hypocrisy in this so called feel good revenge comedy about three aging women, old college friends suffering from grief after the death of old pal Stockard Channing and the end of all their marriages. They decide to get sweet revenge but it's obvious that no matter how happy the ending is these women will never be content let alone satisfied, fulfilled or really smart in the way they deal with life's obstacles. The strength of how this film remains enjoyable comes from various funny lines and of course the cast which includes four Oscar winners as well as one non-winner.There's lots of man bashing which considering the feminist angle of this film isn't unexpected, but there's also women to women bashing, from the middle generation to the younger and from the middle generation to the older. There's vain Goldie Hawn, a middle aged actress desperate to continue playing parts younger than herself, grasping Bette Midler, upset her ex husband is now with a younger woman and that her teenage son doesn't seem to need her anymore, and Diane Keaton, seemingly the most sensible who really isn't. The fact that her husband, Stephen Collins, asks for a divorce after romancing her is a ridiculous twist that just seems far too forced.Even though their screen time is limited, Eileen Heckart and Maggie Smith steal every moment they are on screen. I would have loved to have seen them in a scene together. Smith gives up her British accent for her role as a powerful New York society matron while Heckart deliciously spoofs her seemingly domineering personality, a stereotype presumed by her raspy voice and imposing presence. Sarah Jessica Parker and Catherine Oxenberg are the younger women with Marcia Gay Harden given the unfortunate role as Keaton's therapist who as it turns out is having an affair with her husband.What really goes against this film is that even though they seem likeable on the surface when you first meet them, the three leading characters are really not all that worth rooting for. Yes, they may triumph with their big musical number at the end, but that only makes them smug and self-serving, Hawn's character truly ridiculouseven though you get to see her with a little bit of too much Botox in her lips. She may claim that she's never had plastic surgery, but all it does is make you wonder what else they used to freeze her face like that. Ultimately, this is a film that is really not flattering to women, and the Three Stooges type slapstick their antics get them into really makes them come off as complete buffoons. My 8/10 rating from when I first saw this decades ago has been greatly altered by my re-reviewing of it.",The First Wives Club
4,kosmasp,Women scorned,8,1 January 2021,"This may seem quite one sided - men bad and cheaters and all that. But if you can turn off your cynic and just enjoy the comedy this creates and what the movie does, you can have quite a lot of fun with this. It is not without flaws, no sir/mam. But it has great acting talent in front of the camera (gender neutral assessment).So while yes this is silly and yes this has female revenge written all over it, it is entertainment and it has to be taken with a grain of salt. Just accept this for what it is and roll with it. It does show its age a little bit and in Germany they even went crazier with the title, calling the movie Club der Teufellinnen - calling the victims devils ... ah well PC is overrated, right? It will become apparant early on if this is something you can dig or not ... that's a good thing. The movie does hold on to the pace and the tone it sets out ...",The First Wives Club
5,lee_eisenberg,age won't wear it down,7,1 August 2005,"The victims of chauvinist husbands who dumped them for younger women, middle-aged friends Brenda Cushman (Bette Midler), Elise Elliot (Goldie Hawn) and Annie Paradis (Diane Keaton) decide to take revenge. ""The First Wives Club"" is sort of a silly excuse to have all these big names together, but also pokes fun at American culture in general. For example, Elise is an actress, so she can't be full of herself enough (I don't know whether or not Hawn was parodying herself). A particularly zany scene is when the three of them climb onto a scaffold and fly down the side of a building. Overall, it's nice ridiculous fun showing that these three distinguished actresses have still got it.",The First Wives Club
6,jboothmillard,The First Wives Club,8,14 December 2008,"From director Hugh Wilson (Police Academy, Blast from the Past), this is a very likable comedy with three very likable Hollywood divas. Basically, in childhood, Elise Elliot Atchison (Goldie Hawn), Brenda Morelli Cushman (Bette Midler), Annie MacDuggan Paradise (Diane Keaton) and Cynthia Swann Griffin (Grease's Stockard Channing) were best friends at Middlebury College during the 1960s, but marriages and kids forced them to drift apart. They are brought back together at the funeral of Cynthia, who committed suicide because she and her husband divorced, and he went off with a younger woman. We find out Elise and Brenda have been recently divorced also, and Annie is separated, soon to follow their same situation, and all their husbands have done the same as Cynthia's, and gone for younger women. All three helped their husbands' careers, so they decide to get their revenge by ruining their careers, obviously they call themselves ""The First Wives Club"". Brenda is trying to expose ex-husband Morty Cushman (Commando's Dan Hedaya) - with Shelly Stewart (Sarah Jessica Parker) - for income tax fraud, Elise is trying to ruin the reputation of ex-husband Bill Atchison (Titanic's Victor Garber) - with Phoebe LaVelle (Showgirls' Elizabeth Berkley), and Annie gets half the advertising business of ex-husband Aaron Paradise (Stephen Collins) - with her own psychologist Dr. Leslie Rosen (Flubber's Marcia Gay Harden). But they decide the revenge plan would make them as bad as their husbands, so they are funding a new non-profit organisation dedicated to aiding abused women, in memory of Cynthia. Also starring Dame Maggie Smith as Gunilla Garson Goldberg, Bronson Pinchot as Duarto Feliz, Jennie Dundas as Chris Paradise, Eileen Heckart as Catherine MacDuggan and Scream 2's Timothy Olyphant as Brett Artounian. Apparently Midler steals the show from Hawn ans Keaton, I didn't really notice, I thought all three women got their had equal amounts of great moments, as for the film itself, the one-liners and physical comedy are fun to watch, it is a terrific comedy film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Marc Shaiman. Very good!",The First Wives Club
7,moonspinner55,Slickly-packaged sitcom,5,21 May 2001,"Three female friends in New York City extract revenge--er, that is, justice--on their scummy ex-husbands, thereby putting purpose back into their lives and scoring points for neglected women everywhere. Screen-adaptation of Olivia Goldsmith's book (which read like a screenplay) has echoes of a 12-step program, with every daffy moment followed quickly by female bonding and shallow tears. The leads (Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and a weakly-used Diane Keaton) are likable, but their characters are not based in reality. Besides, it's hard to empathize with anyone who vents their sorrows from the backseat of a limousine. Colorful supporting players and some big laughs help compensate for poorly-directed and edited film which too often lapses into preachiness. ** from ****",The First Wives Club
8,tavm,"Having finally watched The First Wives Club, it was an okay comedy",6,15 June 2020,"My mom and I just watched this for the first time on Amazon Prime Video just now. She thought it was quite funny, me, not so much. For me, there were some funny lines and scenes but not all the way through. In fact, some of the broadness of some scenes were too broad for me. I did like the teaming of Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton. Appearances of some actors were surprising to me as their names didn't appear in the beginning credits. There were also some surprising celeb cameos as themselves. Overall, The First Wives Club was pretty funny, if not hilariously so.",The First Wives Club
9,Calicodreamin,You don't own me!,8,24 November 2019,"Such a fun movie! Hawn, Midler, and Keaton shine as three jaded women who decide to get back at their ex husbands in the most boss way. The first wives club has laughs, drama, and heartfelt moments. The scene on the window washer is comedy gold. The storyline has a good pace and doesn't try to get too complicated.",The First Wives Club
10,view_and_review,Awesome Triumvirate,7,25 September 2020,"A club for all the first wives who've been abandoned by their husbands. Sounds like an instant success. It was.Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, and Bette Midler team up for a hilarious story of failed marriages, friendship, and revenge. OK, OK, so they didn't call it revenge. They called it justice.The three women were part of a foursome that were thick as thieves in college, but life caused them to drift apart. Twenty-seven years later they had a cause to reunite when one of their foursome, Cynthia (Stockard Channing), committed suicide. During their sad reunion they all learned that they were all victims of lascivious and trifling husbands. This common thread amongst them made them even closer, and it gave them a new sense of purpose. From their fateful post-funeral lunch they renewed their bond which would turn into The First Wives Club.I thought the movie was a gas. I'm not a fan of Goldie Hawn and I couldn't even name a movie Diane Keaton has been in, but I like Bette Midler; and furthermore, the three of them together just worked.",The First Wives Club
11,evanston_dad,"Midler, Keaton and Hawn as the Three Stooges",6,17 June 2009,"A goofy comedy designed as a star vehicle for its three leading ladies, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler.Is it a good movie? Not really. But does that matter? Not really. It mostly succeeds based on the sheer talent of the three actresses involved, who could probably make a movie about the invention of barbed wire funny if they had to.I don't know that this movie presents a very flattering image of middle-aged women, but since middle-aged women seem to be the ones who most love this film, if they don't mind, why should I? Grade: B",The First Wives Club
12,anaconda-40658,"Great Cast, Flimsy Delivery.",6,24 November 2015,"The First Wives Club (1996): Dir: Hugh Wilson / Cast: Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, Maggie Smith, Elizabeth Berkley: An ugly creation of retaliation where the sympathetic wives are as ruthless as their cheating husbands. Three women are dumped by their husbands for younger women, and after a fourth woman commits suicide over her break-up, they band together seeking justice. They form The First Wives Club for battered wives. Goldie Hawn plays an actress down on her luck and resorting to alcohol. Bette Midler eats away her frustration. Diane Keaton is in denial. Good background heads to formula and an ending that justifies revenge. This sort of theme worked much better in the comedy Nine to Five where three female office workers retaliated against their sexist boss. Here it just comes across as merely a lash out at men, as if they are all this bad. Hugh Wilson does a fine job directing but his Police Academy is far more funnier. On the plus side there is fine comic chemistry between the three leading ladies but the husbands are merely props. Elizabeth Berkley plays an underage brainless actress who lives with one of the cheaters. There is a message that many viewers may relate to when it comes to abandoned wives and husbands seeking younger women. The film is great to look at with its stunning art direction that makes the club worth entry. Score: 6 ½ / 10",The First Wives Club
13,HotToastyRag,Very 90s girl party,6,2 March 2021,"Pretty much every woman in America has seen this movie, but if the '90s passed you by or you were too young at the time to enjoy it, gather up a bunch of your girlfriends and throw a party. Anyone who has been left for a younger woman, bring over a bottle of wine for movie night and start planning your revenge.The First Wives Club is very funny, but it doesn't start out that way. A group of four friends from college (who have now lost touch many years later) are shocked by one woman's suicide. Stockard Channing was despondent because her husband married a younger woman, and she kills herself. The remaining three friends are barely in better shape. When they each receive a letter from Stockard instructing them to start the First Wives Club and get their dignity back, they learn to lean on each other for support.The three ladies (Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, and Bette Midler) try to exact revenge from their exes and their new squeezes; Victor Garber has chosen Elizabeth Berkley, Stephen Collins has chosen Marcia Gay Harden, and Dan Hedaya has chosen Sarah Jessica Parker. You'll also see Maggie Smith, Eileen Heckart, Philip Bosco, Heather Locklear, J.K. Simmons, Rob Reiner, Kathie Lee Gifford, Ivana Trump, and Gloria Steinem.Whether you're depressed, angry, bitter, jealous, or completely over your betrayal, this movie will help you realize your life isn't over - and that you're still attractive, even if your husband or boyfriend had a temporary lapse in judgement. Gather up your friends and get the party started.",The First Wives Club
14,phd_travel,Brilliant feel good comedy,9,27 August 2012,"This movie works because it uses each of it's leads in the way that best suits them and makes them shine. Three excellent comedians at their best. It's funny even the second time for all the funny details. A real feel good movie when their ex husbands get their just desserts.Goldie Hawn is in a role she is best for doing a diva actress who isn't afraid of making fun of herself. Diane Keaton Bette Midler has a good showcase for her sharp humor. Even SJP pre Sex and the City is good as the second wife. The men are well cast too. Stephen Collins as a cheating spouse, a role he has played well several times before is just right. Nice cameos from Maggie Smith and Ivana Trump and Marcia Gay Harden.",The First Wives Club
15,cherold,"begins well, goes downhill",6,6 January 2004,"This is actually a pretty funny movie for the first half, with the principals all doing a good job with their usual schticks.  The movie pretty much dies when the three comrades have a falling out; somehow this just seems to derail the comedy and from that point on it gets dumber, increasingly unconvincing, and worst of all, much less funny.  It feels like the movie had a cute idea but didn't really know how to flesh it out.  Not bad, really, but feels like an utter waste of time.",The First Wives Club
16,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,6,15 July 2014,"The First Wives ClubThe upside to being a man's first wife is that you get to enjoy pre-Viagra sex with him.However, that's no consolation for the ditched dames in this comedy.Brenda (Bette Midler), Elise (Goldie Hawn) and Annie (Diane Keaton) commiserate over their college friend's (Stockard Channing) recent suicide.Suffering from failed marriages themselves, and fearing a similar fate to their friend, the women decide to form a club and get revenge on their insignificant others (Dan Hedaya, Victor Garber, Stephen Collins) and their mistresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Marcia Gay Harden, Elizabeth Berkley).With help from a socialite (Maggie Smith), they also hope to turn their husbands cruelty into a woman's charity.By not having the characters rely on a Prince Charming to save them, or implausible theatrics to redeem them, this ditzy comedy empowers women to strive for more.However, the wealthiest women still belong to the Last Wives Club.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",The First Wives Club
17,The-Sarkologist,Did not really stand out for me.,4,5 February 2012,"Well, this was an entertaining movie, but it did not really stand out. The movie started off slowly and seemed to end in a whimper. The main characters came out on top, and the men that they were trying to manipulate were successfully manipulated. This is not an original movie as I had seen it all before in She-Devil. The only difference was that it dealt with three women instead of one.The basic premise is that four women graduated from college together full of idealism. Later in life their idealism is destroyed as their respective husbands walk out on them - and each of them handle it in a different way. One destroys herself with alcohol, another constantly complains and tries to hang onto her son, while another remains oblivious to the fact that anything is wrong. The forth one throws herself off of a building and it is this event that draws them all back together. They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life, and this has been discarded by them, so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them. Basically it becomes a similar plot to that of She-Devil.There is nothing that really stands out in this movie that I really wish to discuss. It looks at the frustration that women face in divorce, and though this may be a rare case, women can be just as vicious in divorce proceedings as can men. If we look at Liar Liar, we see a woman milking the man for all that she can get - while here the men have used the women and thrown them away. I agree that men can be bastards, but so can everybody.I guess the purpose of this movie was to try and bring us into the women's point of view - but the theme can be gender-neutral, with the exception that men (or men that I have known) will simply wallow in their misery, while women will carry on. Even then that statement is not entirely true as everybody reacts to a divorce situation differently. I was going to make a comment that it was based on a book written by a female, while the screenwriters and directors were male, meaning that the female psyche is not portrayed as well as say a film by Amy Heckerling. But this film does no such thing and is really a movie about people being thrown away and then climbing back up to the top.In conclusion, I will say that this is not an outstanding or impressive movie, and though entertaining after the first few minutes, it is nothing that I will really talk about that much.",The First Wives Club
18,didi-5,feel-good chick-flick,8,23 June 2009,"I really like this film. Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Stockard Channing have been friends for years and all have something in common - cheating, flaky husbands. So far, so cliché.But the 'First Wives Club' is an inspired bit of fluff, fun, perceptive, and full of high spirits. These forty-something ladies replaced by younger models aren't going to take their fate lying down, and what a hoot it is watching them set up their outfit to take fickle men to the cleaners.OK, the film is a little sexist, with a one-dimensional view of both men and women; but it succeeds as entertainment. Some of the supporting caricatures are simply hideous, but work well. You can also spot stars of the future such as Sarah Jessica Parker in smaller roles.If you take this film for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it. It's one of those films that you'll either love or hate - but with this calibre of cast it's worth a look.",The First Wives Club
19,helpless_dancer,"Somewhat funny, well acted",3,14 December 1998,"While not as funny as ""What's Up, Doc?"", I thought this one was ok. I like a comedy to cause me to fall on the floor laughing, but it didn't happen with ""Wives"". It did touch a nerve concerning the behavior of many husbands; the guy with the younger bimbo was a classic example of a silly middle aged man trying to relive his life through excessive sex.

23,jimbo-53-186511,A pleasant surprise,7,26 December 2013,"I came into this film with fairly low expectations as I wasn't sure that it would be my sort of thing. However, I must admit that I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.The premise is rather simple and focuses on 3 old college friends who end up re-united due to the death of their old college friend Cynthia (Stockard Channing). The 3 college friends are Elise Elliot (Goldie Hawn), Brenda Cushman (Bette Midler) and Annie Paradis (Diane Keaton). Whilst, the circumstances surrounding their reunion are unfortunate, the 3 women use this opportunity to catch up. Whilst, it is clear that they have lived rather different lives since they left college, they find that they all have one thing in common; their husband's have left them for/cheated on them with young women. With the 3 protagonists feeling disgruntled about the way they've been treated, they decide to set up the First Wives Club and take revenge on their cheating husbands;Whilst, the film is rather slow to get moving, I did find that this to be an enjoyable film. This film was a lot of fun with plenty of laughs. The 3 protagonists characters were all well developed and some of the schemes they come up with to get their own back on their respective partners were rather clever. I felt that Goldie Hawn gave the stand out performance, but that's not to discredit Midler and Keaton who were also fantastic.What really impressed me about the First Wives Club was the ending (which I won't give away), but let's just say that there was slightly more to it than meets the eye.All in all, this was a fun ride with plenty of laughs. The plot summary will suggest that it is geared more towards women and if I'm honest I think that more women will enjoy this than men. Having said that I'm a man and I still enjoyed it. Give it a try!",The First Wives Club
24,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Hilarious, devious, clever, romantic, and touching",10,17 November 2005,"THE FIRST WIVES CLUB, in my opinion, is a hilarious, devious, clever, romantic, and touching movie. I think the way Brenda (Bette Midler), Elise (Goldie Hawn), and Annie (Diane Keaton) got back at their husbands was pretty clever. Personally, I think what Morty (Dan Hedaya), Bill (Victor Garber), and Aaron (Stephen Collins) did to their wives was very cold, inconsiderate, and deceitful. If you ask me, Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton singing ""You Don't Own Me"" was hilarious. They sounded really good. Way to go, ladies! Also, I thought that they looked really beautiful as well when they sang ""You Don't Own Me."" In conclusion, if you're a fan of Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, or Diane Keaton, and you haven't seen THE FIRST WIVES CLUB, I recommend it. You're in for some real laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",The First Wives Club
25,davispittman,Don't get even. Get everything,7,24 June 2015,"In 1996's the first wives club, we are told the story of 4 Middle Aged college friends: Annie, Brenda, Elise, and Cynthia. Each of them had husbands leave them for younger women. Cynthia commits suicide within the 1st 10 minutes of the movie, suffering from drinking and depression when her husband left her for a much younger, better looking woman. They all decide to get together and in Cynthias honor and get revenge from their husbands. This movie offers up very funny jokes situations and also features women empowerment. In the end it offers up a great message. And also features a great cast from Bette Midler(Hocus pocus) to Goldie Hawn(Private Benjamin) to Diane Keaton(father of the bride) Stockard Channing (Grease) as Cynthia, Sarah Jessica Parker(sex and the city) and Elizabeth Berkley(Showgirls). As you would expect from this A-list cast, the acting is very good in this film.

I don't remember how well this movie did at the box office but I know there are women out there who have yet to see this and they should. Great acting ""women rule"" kind of movie, I know this movie doesn't appeal as much to men as to women but I think it was great and definetly a must see if not already having been seen.Very few movies that are as suited to watch in a cluster of your closest friends as this one.7-8 of 10.",The First Wives Club
27,nycritic,When Bad Stories Happen to Good Actresses,4,18 July 2005,"It doesn't matter that the reviews of the book version of THE FIRST WIVES CLUB were generally good. It doesn't take away from the fact that it's nothing more than a thinly disguised bad story with a potentially wicked set-up that has seen better days and which not even the good chemistry of the three main performers can save.On learning of the death of their one-time college friend Cynthia Swann-Griffin (Stockard Channing in an all-too-brief cameo) due to the abandonment from her husband, three recently divorced women, Annie Paradis (Diane Keaton), Elise Eliott (Goldie Hawn), and Brenda Cushman (Bette Midler) come together to get back at their former husbands by essentially taking away their freedom. Sounds familiar? In 1989, Roseanne Barr and Meryl Streep starred in SHE DEVIL, a bad (but compared to this trash, a classic) movie adaptation of the novel of the same name in which a middle-class wife, on being dumped by her husband for a successful romance novelist, decides to destroy her home, her family, and take away her husband's freedom by starting her own ""club"" for women in the same situation as she. Even farther to 1980: 9 TO 5 told a similar story about three co-workers (Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton) who band together to make mincemeat of their male chauvinistic pig of a boss played by Dabney Coleman, and essentially prove to the entire office that woman make work more efficient. And even farther, to 1939, to a classic and the mother of all ""desperate housewives"": THE WOMEN brilliantly told the acid tale of how society women lose their husbands to social climbers, and while Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) does what no feminist would do -- go back to her unseen Stephen -- it is still a powerful tale of women, their men, and how they survive in a Darwinistic society where bitches eat bitches for lunch while playing bridge at 5 PM. And at the same time gave many of its actresses (all icons, from Joan Crawford to Paulette Goddard to Rosalind Russell to the great Lucille Watson) roles to sink their teeth in, something that has essentially gone South in the Hollywood of today.But not to digress, even though I am talking of the same essential theme, THE FIRST WIVES CLUB should have been a much better movie than it is. All of the elements are there to make its comedy not only dark, but biting, cruel, politically incorrect (contrary to its PC nature), and not tack on the saccharine, cloying mess that pretends to be an ending. At the same time, there has to be something to like about in these three women: Annie comes across as vaguely sympathetic (a more intellectual version of Mary Haines), but her shrillness is so over-the-top and her transformation from klutz to business entrepreneur so unbelievable it's not possible to feel for her. Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn do better with what little material they've been given while still being little more than caricatures. Hawn at least does poke fun at Hollywood's treatment of actresses which may also be at her own ""persona"" which has (as Elise Eliott says) refused to age, but other than that, there's not much bite in her resolve to do her husband in.Then we have the supporting characters, none which fare any better. What is Bronson Pinchot doing as (yet another) affected character stupidly named ""Duarto Feliz?"" (Don't writers do their research in writing about characters with Spanish names?) None of the younger women are written as little more as props, though at least Sarah Jessica Parker has a couple of lines that hint of a different version of Carrie Bradshaw. The husbands... well... they're essentially unrepentant jerks, and while in THE WOMEN they remained invisible, there was the idea that in that story they were actual people. That inexplicably, Dan Hedaya's character suddenly does an about-face at the end seems made to satisfy at least a part of the audience who would want to see at least one of the women retain their partner. And what's with Annie having a lesbian daughter if it doesn't tie into anything else in the story? That lesbians hate men and make great allies to jilted women everywhere? I didn't get it, I still don't get it, and it didn't work for me.It just proves that a bad screenplay filled with unsympathetic characters will kill the central idea in a story, but also, that an equally bad direction with odd takes and bad editing will further the damage. Stockard Channing's death scene is so badly filmed it might as well been an afterthought from another movie that somehow found its way here. The sequence when Keaton, Midler, Hawn, and Pinchot intercept Dan Hedaya's apartment is another study in absolute ineptitude in creating comic slapstick, but then again, so is the sequence when Keaton discovers her husband wants to divorce her and in pops Marcia Gay Harden: what a lost opportunity to really make it the best moment on the screen! Didn't anyone do their homework? Does anyone recall the scene in THE WOMEN when Sylvia Fowler finds out her husband is set to marry Miriam Aarons (who is right in front of her) and then rips into her in a memorable cat-fight? That was a scene: this was a travesty. Which most of this movie is, anyway.",The First Wives Club
28,PredragReviews,The power of three!,7,2 May 2016,"This was a chick flick in many respects, but not so sappy and irrational that it annoys you like other chick flicks do. All three leads are legitimately angry and the audience feels for them, because we've all been scorned (whether you're a man or a woman, but it will obviously speak to you more so if you are a woman).A dynamite cast and a great script make a great comedy, and The First Wives Club is just that. Having Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler and Diane Keaton together for a picture should guarantee that the film is going to be something special, and it is, a witty, breezy comedy about women getting even with their philandering spouses. Although the film can be perceived as very anti-men, it manages to even out the put-downs with some sparkling humour, even though the men in this film are portrayed as not very bright creatures.

30,Maciste_Brother,It doesn't get any cornier than this,1,27 February 2007,"I love Diane Keaton and Maggie Smith. So-so Bette Midler. I can't stand Goldie Hawn. I watched THE FIRST WIVES CLUB on some channel while I was working on my computer, needing some sort of silly distraction in the background. Boy, what a corny movie. Seriously corny film. Embarrassingly corny flick. Were the three female stars going through menopause, which can only explain the bad decision the three gals made in agreeing to star in this crappy ""comedy"".I mean, any comedy from the 1930s, 1940s and even the corny 1950s, were much more clever than this treacly stillborn yawnfest. Speaking of yawns, can someone explain to me the appeal of Goldie Hawn? She plays the same kind of character in every film: ditzy babe (in this case, over-the-hill ditzy babe). She has no range whatsoever. And this is set against Keaton and Midler, who also play clichéd characters. And Maggie Smith is totally wasted in a pointless character.Everything in this product is pure corn. The gals exacting revenge on their philandering husbands is so unconvincing and simplistic, that I groaned non-stop in abject embarrassment. Who wrote this thing, a 12 year old? The ending is particularly awful, with everyone joining a party in honor of the first wives club, including the husbands they just emasculated. And in the closing shot we see the three women sing and dance in the middle of an empty street, which is a true low-point in corniness.Diane Keaton, one of my favorite actors, has been making a lot of bad movies these days. She should be more choosy with the kind of scripts she's being offered. After THE FAMILY STONE and now this, I'll probably stop watching all of her new films.",The First Wives Club
31,rupie,not as funny as expected,4,30 June 1999,"If you see ""First Wives Club"" expecting a flat-out, hell-for-leather comedy about revenge against husbands that have traded in their first wives for trophy wives - a premise ripe with comic promise - be forewarned. I thought it fell flat. Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton, college pals, have been brought together by the death of one of their group, who committed suicide (nice comic start, huh?) when her husband ditched her. As the plot develops it turns that each of their husbands is ditching them. They form the ""First Wives Club"" to plot exquisite revenge. The execution of these plans is interrupted in the movie by a touchy-feely set of ""therapy"" scenes in which the women get in touch with their inner selves or something, thus making another movie which can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy or not. After a while the emotional discovery is ditched and the revenge resumes, the women extracting huge sums of cash from their exes by a variety of chicanerous means. And what do they do with the cash? Build a Womens' Crisis Center. Now Womens' Crisis Centers are a worthy cause but, hey, I wanted to see a COMEDY ferchrissakes. These three women are fine comic actresses in their own right but their camaraderie in this movie never rings quite true. Cameos by Rob Reiner and Maggie Smith, who does a nice turn as a socially prominent dowager. Watch for Ed Koch, Ivana Trump and Gloria Steinem in the party scene. My wife liked it more than I did, but not by much.",The First Wives Club

33,TheOtherFool,Who wouldn't divorce these women?,3,19 April 2004,"My girlfriend described this one as: 'the perfect movie for women having their period.' I know, not the best recommendation a man could get... But I decided to watch it anyway (I mean, why not) as it starred Diane Keaton, who played in about half of the best movies of the 70's. But, too bad, as she is 'supported' by two of the most irritating actresses around, who play irritating characters as well. But oh well, let's focus on the story for now.Annie (Keaton) Brenda (Bette Midler) and Elise (Goldie Hawn) are three women in their mid-forties who are left by their men for younger women. After the suicide of an old girlfriend (because of the same reason) they come together and unite to become the First Wives Club. Now what they basicly do is trying to ruin their men. If you look at it this way it seems like it could have some fun (though for women in particular), but this movie takes a couple of (very) wrong turns.As I said, the movie begins with a suicide of a person we don't meet in the entire movie. How to deal with that? I mean, you want to make a 'light' movie, but there is a big tragedy involved in it. Sometimes it works out good (compare The Big Chill, where the humor is bittersweet), but sometimes it goes all wrong (The World According To Garp comes to mind, with a horrific accident at the wrong place), and this movie is one of the latter. The three women don't really seemed to be bothered with the death of their friend. It's more like a gimmick: 'oh, let's name our club after her, wouldn't that be fun'. It doesn't seem 'real' enough for me.Now, the other thing. We are supposed to feel for these women. In Annie's case, we actually do. She means well, but is left by her long-time husband for her psychiatrist. Plus her mom is not the most sensible one and her daughter just announced she's gay. She's just having a rotten time. No problem there. But what about Midler's and Hawn's characters? Midler is annoying throughout the entire movie, doesn't treat her son nice, and has no problems breaking the law (taking over her husbands illegal businesses).The biggest problem is Hawn though. She tries to make fun of herself (with a couple of lip-jokes) but all she is is a mean, arrogant, bitchy, drunk actress who won't play a mother in a play although she's 46 years old! How can that be the hero-in of the movie?Couple of good jokes, always funny Bronson Pinchot and a great sing and dance-a-long at the end don't make up for what is just a plain bad movie. 3/10.",The First Wives Club

They bond and not only plan revenge on their husbands but take their revenge to another unexpected level that is curiously refreshing for a comedy of this type. Keaton, Hawn, and Midler are marvelous as the women out for their ex-husbands'blood. Stephen Collins, Victor Garber, and Dan Hedaya are all on the mark as the scummy ex-husbands. There are funny bits contributed along the way by Rob Reiner as Hawn's plastic surgeon, Sarah Jessica Parker as Hedaya's mistress, Maggie Smith as a wealthy divorcée, Bronson Pinchot as a faux designer, Eileen Heckart as Keaton's mother, and Marcia Gay Harden as Collins'therapist/mistress.

36,majikstl,Divorced from reality...,3,4 March 2004,"To understand where the film is coming from all you have to do is note that it features cameo guest appearances by both Ivana Trump and Gloria Steinem. The former, of course, is known for having gained all her wealth, power and fame from exploiting the wealth, power and fame of her husband/ex-husband and the latter is noted for gaining all her wealth, power and fame from her male-bashing bigotry. The film embraces both of these icons with equal self-righteousness.THE FIRST WIVES CLUB film expects us to accept the notion that divorce in America is decidedly pro-male, designed to cheat women. This, it seems, is especially true if the women are white, well-educated, upper-class and socially prominent. While most people would be hard pressed to see such women as society's victims, the film takes it for granted that they are and expects us to never question that notion. If you don't, you will likely enjoy the film greatly. If you have even one working brain cell in your head, you should be rightly amazed at the gall the filmmakers have to so blatantly insult your intelligence.The film deals with three former college chums, now middle-aged wives, who, coincidentally, are facing divorce all at the same time. The three are Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler -- three absolutely wonderful actresses. Because the system is so anti-female, the three have to resort to blackmail, kidnapping, extortion and racketeering in order to wrestle the family wealth out of the hands of their dimwitted husbands. It is notable that in the cases of Keaton and Midler's characters, they claim to deserve their husbands' money because they helped and supported them early in their careers. Meanwhile, in Hawn's case, her husband worked as her business manager and helped her become a leading film star, but she claims that she is the bread winner in the family and therefore he is entitled to nothing. The film is so dull-witted that it presents these conflicting plotlines and is totally oblivious to their obvious irony. The film's logic is clear: What's his is hers; what's hers is hers and what's theirs is hers.
Battle of the sexes comedies can be great fun, but only if both sides are evenly matched and equally clever -- think Kate and Spencer, Doris and Rock, or even Lucy and Desi. This lame film tries to stack the deck by pandering to feminist stereotypes: Women are better, but victimized; men are evil, but stupid. The irony is that by the end of the film the men are the sympathetic victims and the three leading actresses come off as smug monsters (thus the tacked on ending wherein they donate their ill-gotten loot to open a shelter for abused women -- apparently you can buy off guilt).
The really sad thing about this sorrowful little mess of a movie is that it wastes the talents of the three terrific leading ladies. They are victimized, not in the movie, but by the movie.",The First Wives Club
37,pfgpowell-1,Possibly one for the undemanding sisterhood (or not even them) Hawn and Midler partly redeem a very pedestrian outing,5,16 November 2010,"This film is, I think, more one for the sisterhood than anyone else. I don't mean that in any derogatory sense, but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mish-mash, redeemed, in part, by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler, as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant, and Goldie Hawn, an ageing Oscar-winning film start, who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton (who is never my favourite actress, I'm sorry to say) as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group, the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street money-man, who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day, but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral, they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up', with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton, still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated, obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another, and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important: it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books: they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels (and even works of non-fiction). And there have been great films based on very poor material (and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor). In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel, this is no great shakes, though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems – great scenes, great acting and great one-liners – from Midler and Hawn. But overall, as I suggest, this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' (yes, I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind, although one pronounced in such a half-hearted fashion, I do wonder why they even bothered), the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is, as I suspect it was intended to be, some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to, of course, and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother: what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me. The inclusion of Maggie Smith as the queen bee of New York society (with a very dodgy American accent even to my Brit ears) seems more like an attempt to attract the punters and gain a little spurious 'class' for the film. She plays hardly any part in the film, except as a cackhanded plot device, and even that might have been achieved with a small re-write. Me, I'll remember the good bits involving Midler and Hawn, but I wouldn't have been heartbroken had I fished another £3 DVD out of my supermarket bargain bin rather than this one and never seen it.",The First Wives Club

40,mnpollio,Criminally unfunny,1,9 May 2007,"I must say that I am usually a fan of Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler - a bit less so of Diane Keaton - and the premise of First Wives Club certainly looked promising for clever comedy. Unfortunately, the words clever or intelligent never enter this film's vocabulary. The characters are thoroughly unsympathetic, hysterical, whiny, abrasive and shallow. The film dismisses every man (barring the stereotypically effete gay guy) as an ogre guided around by nothing but his privates. It also depicts every woman under the age of 40 as a gold-digging slut (unless she is a lesbian). The three leads are former friends whose respective men traded them in for younger trophy wives and who re-connect at the funeral of a fourth friend who committed suicide following the abandonment by her own husband. Oddly, the women seem strangely underwhelmed by the woman's death and treat it merely as a slightly dour social occasion. Hawn, Midler and Keaton are not especially believable as friends, as their personalities are completely at odds and their quest for vengeance seems to be the only thing that ties them together. They spend the majority of the film pining for their worthless husbands, regretting the loss of their youth and baring their fangs at the younger women who now have what they covet. And therein lies the problem of the film. Hawn, Midler and Keaton should be credible on some level and fully fleshed out to win our sympathy. Instead, they are as one-note, vindictive and shallow as the husbands/trophy wives they purportedly despise on principle, but really actually wish they were themselves. They are, in fact, no better than the people they demonize. The comedy is on the level of a grade-C TV sitcom and the performances from the top straight to the bottom can pretty much be described as stridently shrill.

46,wchngliu,"Even As A Female Myself, I Loathed This Movie",4,17 November 2007,"I saw the film purely by accident a couple of years ago on a plane when I was travelling to Hong Kong and this was shown on screen.The First Wives Club is mainly based on a book- of which I am not that familiar with- and is a very anti-male take on 3 women who get together and plan their revenge against their hubby's, after they mistreat them. The script was poor, the performances were below-par given the standard of the three female leads, Midler, Hawn and Keaton and for a film supposedly trying to promote gender equality it fails because it portrays the male characters as sleazy, money grabbing chauvinists.This comedy movie is also so devoid of actual laughs, the wisecracks were typically old-fashioned, sexist and the narrative derivative- and this coming from a woman. If society is ever going to become more equally tolerant and acceptable of men and women, then it needs to start by getting rid of pro-feminist concepts which celebrates the triumphs of femininity but ridicules and criticises masculinity. We have things such as women studies for eg, and yet if men were to have male studies, they would be slated for that too.I didn't really care one bit about the characters, because they were all stereotypes of men and women and in truth I don't mind watching TV shows and films with a predominately female slant to it, just as long as its treatment of its male counterparts is on an equal playing level and vice versa with the women. But with movies such as The First Wives Club, they are misleading and wrongly perpetuate the notion that all women are great and all men are heartless, scheming, cheating, lying toe rags.Such a shame that with a stellar cast in Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler, the film sends itself up to be male-bashing farce, as opposed to one that highlights the positives and negatives of both men and women through these characters and addressing the argument of the battle of the sexes, in a open minded and fair way that doesn't make all women out to be the good guys and the men the so-called bad guys.The ending was a bit of a farce because the men end up going back to their girlfriends and wives, despite their behaviour and going out with other women that Hawn, Midler and Keaton take them back.Whilst this will not rank in my top ten worst movies ever list- i've seen much worst in my time- this ultimately is a flawed movie which to be honest, having seen it once, I have no intention of ever seeing it again",The First Wives Club

But Midler and Keaton are also very good. Midler manages to deliver wise-cracks in her usual manner, but is still actress enough to display true sorrow about her failed marriage through facial expressions alone. Keaton, who has the slightest material to work with of the three, is actually the sweetest of the lot, and you do feel for her and understand her anger when her husband dumps her just after he's been sleeping with her. The supporting cast couldn't be bettered either. Maggie Smith should have been on screen more I think, her reactions towards Sarah Jessica Parker during dinner are priceless! Honorable mentions also goes to Hedaya, Berkley (who's coffee conversation with Hawn is a hoot!) and the before mentioned Parker.

49,xavrush89,This film's user rating says more about IMDb users than itself.,8,5 March 2005,"I have often pointed out on message boards that there seems to be a gender bias, a generational bias, and a heterosexual bias on this site. This films rating proves all three of those factors to be true. The three stars are at the top of their game. So what if the script is a little light? They more than make up for it with their moxie and comic timing. Diane Keaton, the least zany of the three, anchors the film well with her narration, yet her character is the one who experiences the most change in attitude. Midler knows that she's working as a team, and reigns in her usual larger-than-life persona, but when she lets it loose a little, it's perfect. Hawn is basically playing herself as an actor who's tired of being passed over for parts because of her age while too-old male actors get a pass. Not a big stretch in Hollywood. The fact that not one of them stands out as the lead shows how excellent they are together.I still suspect that most men do not like seeing women be too assertive or bold with their comedy. These women are not sex kittens, they are tigresses, and maybe that's a little off-putting, and they are biased against it. Don't think so? Then come up with a better reason why ""Old School"" has a higher rating than this film!",The First Wives Club

Hurrah for Diane, Bette & Goldie",9,15 August 2003,"The sleeper of 1996 about three 50ish one-time college best friends who reunite at a friend's funeral and hatch a plan to get even with their philandering husbands (all of whom have taken up with sweet-young-things). Hawn, Keaton & Midler have a ball, but has anyone else noticed that underneath the hilarity lies a sad fact of life.  Aging woman are discarded (in the movie industry as well as everyday life).  These fearsome femmes not only poke fun at themselves but also revitalized their careers in the process.  But the opening scene of the abandoned Stockard Channing walking off the terrace of her East Side highrise adds a bitter, melancholy truth that pervades the entire film.

But at other times i wish that the husbands could just file a restraining order against them and keep them well away!This movie does have its bits and i will admit it was well done together, it also starred my friends favourite movie star in this (Stockyard Channing) so he made me watch it with him, but to be honest with you, i would rather have watched this in the dead of the night when i was suffering from insomnia. I know i'm criticising alot but i beleive that this movie could've been sooooo much more if abit more planning had went into it.There were some class bits in this movie, like the scene in the club and also the scene when the ""girls"" tell the men what they want, but all in all, this movie i must admit was kinda medoicre for these girls.

52,Marie-62,Pretty dang funny,10,12 November 2000,"Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton. What more can you ask for in a movie? A hilarious movie about three women that are really looking forward to get back at their idiot husbands. Bette Midler's character, Brenda, has a husband who falls for the bulemic beauty queen, Shelly. In the movie, you see scenes where your heart goes out for Bette. You can actually imagine how heart-breaking it is to be called 'fat' and the insecurity she feels about her weight. She should have gotten an Oscar. Goldie Hawn's character is a drunken actress, whose husband leaves her for a seventeen year-old. She's hilarious. She should have gotten a Tony. And I saved the best for last. Dianne Keaton plays Annie, the soft-spoken woman whose not ready to face reality. Raising a lesbian daughter and having her husband cheat on her for her physchiatrist, Annie seems to be the most emotionally disturbed but also the one who holds the group together. She should have won the Oscar, the Tony, and the Golden Globe for her performance. Definately a movie worth buying or renting. You'll laugh until you cry, and then you'll cry at some sad parts, and then you'll realize their revenge and laugh again. See it!",The First Wives Club
53,estherwalker-34710,"""Don't get mad. Get everything"" : Ivana Trump; ""You Don't Own Me"" :The Three Amigoeses.",8,26 July 2021,"The 2nd chick flick comedy of 3 I'm aware of that feature 3 women who bond to punish a man, or in this case, 3 men, who have behaved badly(from their viewpoint). The first was 1980's ""9 to 5"", where the issue was chauvinistic men in general, focused on their office boss. This comedy was quite popular, presumably especially for women, and earned a handsome profit. Then, in 2014 the 3rd of this group, ""The Other Woman"" was released. It dealt with a philandering wealthy middle-aged husband, with 2 surprise mistresses bonding with the wife to financially emasculate the husband, rendering him unattractive for future desirable mistresses. As you should gather, all 3 films are extremely sexest when it comes to relationships between the sexes. Most men are greedy and most women are victims of this greed................ The present film features 3 one time college friends who are now about 45, and happen to live not far from each other, and who had recently received a divorce summons from their wealthy husband. In these cases, the husband had apparently gotten tired of his 'old lady', and wanted to look for a significantly younger replacement, as a wife. So, the 3 divorcees happen to meet at the funeral of a mutual friend who had committed suicide with the marriage of her ex to a beautiful young woman. The 3 decided to put their heads together to figure out what they could do to severely punish their exes, including causing their new relationships to break up( They eventually succeeded). ...............
About midway through, one got on the case of another, instigating a serious verbal and physical war, which nearly broke up The First Wives Club, as they preferred to be called. But, they later regrouped and finally figured out ways to financially ruin their exes. Since there are 3 men to punish, instead of one man, as in the other 2 films, more complications arise, despite very similar run times. Thus, I won't be surprised if you find the present film to be the most entertaining of the 3, for this reason. ................ In 2 cases, they discovered that their ex had done something illegal in the past, or was doing something illegal at present, each with a potential long prison sentence. After gathering incriminating physical evidence, they presented their ex with the choice between prison, or doing everything they asked of them............ Of the 3 films, .""9 to 5"" has the highest mean IMDB rating, while ""The Other Woman"" has the lowest rating. From my brief survey, all three films have a probable majority of 8,9 or 10 ratings. But ""9 to 5"" has only the occasional 1,2,or 3 rating, while the other 2 films have many 1,2, or 3 ratings, thus apparently explaining the spread in mean ratings............I will say that ""The Other Woman"" and the present film take too long, often with minimally important conversation, before getting into the meat of the screenplay. In fact, I might recommend that you fast forward through the first 30 min., ending with Diane Keaton's through-the-roof response to the discovery that her ex is dating her psychotherapist! ................Unfortunately, Goldie Hawn's character is rather obnoxious through much of the film, usually babbling with a glass of alcoholic drink in her hand and maybe smoking, looking half drunk and being angry. She is a fading actress, concerned about plastic surgery to make her look 20 again, getting lip injections to supposedly make her look sexier. But after her vicious fight with Bette Midler's character, Brenda, she sobered up and became wildly optimistic, as new ideas filled their heads. A remarkable transformation!..........Ivana Trump played herself in a brief cameo appearance at the gala opening celebration for the organization sponsored by the trio to help women who were depressed, or otherwise in trouble. She got to utter her famous quote in my review title ""Don't get mad. Get everything!""............Among other celebrities with small parts, is Heather Locklear, as one of the exe's new girlfriends. Also, Elizabeth Berkley, who starred in the flop of the previous year: ""Showgirls"", which has since become a cult favorite of many. Goldie's character supposedly dug up evidence that Elizabeth was only 16(actually 24), which was a shocker to her 46yo ex. Who was dating her(very unlikely, unless you are 52yo Charlie Chaplin, who fell in love with his last wife when she was only 15 or 16!). Interestingly, all 3 main actresses were 50yo +- 1 year, although Goldie's character claimed she was only 45................ The film ends with an enthusiastic song and dance by the 3 to ""You Don't Own Me"", perhaps worth the price of admission in itself! The strong lead cast much helped to sell the film, which was a big box office success.",The First Wives Club

I mean it's a funny movie, but not the type you feel like paying to watch it. Said this, I've got mixed feelings when it comes to value The First Wives Club. If you are looking for some crazy fun it's ok, but if that's not your case you can be a little disappointed.
This film has hilarious parts, of course, but anyway it's never making it to my top ten list. I think the three lead actresses did a good job. I'm not going to discuss if the plot does make sense or not. Perhaps it doesn't, but if you are looking for a funny movie and supposedly feminist - although in reality the three rejected wives are only interested in squeezing their ex hubbies dry by taking all of their stuff, sure you can pick this one.I rated it with a seven, but that score could vary from time to time.",The First Wives Club

I will have to admit I like Bette Middler and Goldie Hawn a lot and they shined here. Goldie Hawn alone is enough to watch it, her character was hilarious.Many of the other actors were great and I love Bronson Pichett in all of his roles, this was his dullest and most unfunny role I have seen, but it worked. I hate Stockard Channing and was glad to see her commit suicide quickly. If she had been one of the main actors I would not have been able to watch it.If you like movies that deal with personal feelings that we all go through this is for you. This is a perfect revenge movie for those of us who have been cheated on and would love to get back at our scum partners. It shows that no matter how rich or successful or perfect your life seems that truly everyone hurts and we all go through life the same and pain is pain and tears are tears and love is love or lack there of.Touching, funny and full of those infamous one liners.

Yes, the film is very ""anti-man"" and if a similar film were made today reversing the roles with the same unapologetic glee there would be misogynistic outcries of rage.  But the real problem is that it's simply not funny.  Black comedy without humor is just plain bad.A big fat Zero out of 10.

Goldsmith's book was bitter and, like her other books, extremely insulting to men. While the men in the movie aren't the most admirable and there are a bevy of them all in one place (so to speak), I was able to take it as an entertaining metaphor rather than a completely emasculating experience. Also, one couldn't be totally surprised that these friends all ended up where they did. The worst part of the movie was Goldie Hawn's over-plumped lips. The best was the sparring between Sarah Jessica Parker and Bette Midler. Oh, and the revenge. Who hasn't wanted that against ex at some point in the grieving process?!",The First Wives Club

Bette Midler was out of her class in this one although she wasn't given that many chances to shine. Morty was good. When I see him I see Cheers and the way he was always after Carla.

65,critic_w,One of the worst movies for good men and great women I've ever seen!,4,28 November 2008,"I was one of two men who watched ""The First Wives Club"" in a room full of 9 women! It was incredibly interesting to watch both the movie and the variety of reactions to it in this audience of married, divorced, and never married family and friends. As for the movie itself, I found it to be typical Hollywood in it's plot and comedy; full of obligatory characters and as predictable as anything, but with enough witty lines to get me to laugh four, perhaps five times in the 102 minutes, mostly in the first 1/2 hour. In the end my opinion was that this movie was simply too predictable, the story too sad, and if not for great lines and delivery by Beth Midler, a painfully pathetic waste of time! I won't take too much time justifying my opinion other than to say ** SPOILER COMING** Midler's character, while funny, was sad and angry, with insufficient money or decent child support, Keaton's character who was sad and wouldn't stand up for herself, is viciously betrayed not only by her husband but by her therapist, and Hawn's character was just a sad stereotype of Hollywood self-centeredness. Some would say, that's the point, when the movie ends, they are all better... oh really? I will grant you they have a successful venture, but of the three only Midler's Brenda seems to be better off socially...which was point of the whole stink in the first place was it not?! Simply put, the remedy for a philandering husband that doesn't love or respect you isn't to ruin his career and start a new business, it's to have him wake up to his foolishness, admit that he was wrong, and (if you'll have him) show you the love and respect that you deserved; only Brenda's husband does that. And please don't call it a great ""womens"" movie, because the cruelest blows in the show were delivered by reprehensible women upon our unsuspecting four leads. Two of which, Sarah Jessica Parker's character and Marcia Gay-Harden's character get away scot-free with not so much as a stereotypical slap to the face! So, so much for the movie, it is by no means something women should be proud of. And where it does women a disservice, it is an out and out insult to men! Scarcely a single redeemable male in the entire movie! Four out of four leads are deadbeats! 100% stinker rating for men! Are all men really that horrendously horrible? Out of 4 college friends ALL FOUR have cheating spouses that invariably toss them aside for younger women? Is there no balance in the world at all? So by the same measure, if Olivia Goldsmith writes a vampire move EVERYBODY is a vampire? This is simply ridiculous and very hurtful to the decent men who DO exist! Some would argue, well this is just a movie, just a comedy... it's a farce. Well to that I ask with genuine concern, what is it about a movie like this that you find so enjoyable? Are you thinking it's about time men got paid back for all their cruelty? Is this TRULY the state of women in your mind? 'cause I saw this movie with 9 women varying in age from 30 to late 70s, and the least of them was ten times better that the best of these 4 pathetic women! Those who'd suffered through divorce and/or infidelity have moved on, and found life and love and success that had nothing to do with getting ""everything"" from ""man who'd done them wrong."" In fact the women I know and love (starting with my terrific wife) do not need to beat down someone in order to feel good about themselves. They are great women, beautiful, successful and strong, who've triumphed over adversity and are happy with what God has given them. That is the kind of woman that men who love and respect women are looking for, and they avoid closet male-bashers like the plague! If you are one who LOVED this movie and at the same time think there are no quality men in the world, perhaps you should examine what this movie says about you.",The First Wives Club

The way that they shine on these magnificent actresses is disgraceful. All the jokes are old and tired, My only favorite part is Balki as an Interior Designer. These actresses, with or without the age are as beautiful now as they were before, if not more so. As with any woman, beauty comes through at ANY age. There was even a 'cameo' if you want to call it that from Zsa Zsa Gabor. ""Don't get mad, Get EVERYTHING!""

I think that the major reason that the movie is unappreciated by too many critics is because it's a ""woman's picture."" It's designed to be a very light comedy that brings in women and their families to generate box office. Whatever its genre, however, the movie works in every way it's intended to work. The sets are great, the costumes are perfect and the acting is really funny and also touching when it needs to be, such as when Sarah Jessica Parker says to Bette Midler, ""Brenda, this outfit might look really good on you... why don't you try one on in YOUR SIZE!"" Midler's fury suddenly deflates, and she exhibits pathos. Lots of funny lines and facial expressions and over-the-top emotion, and the directing was, I think, very precise and well done.",The First Wives Club
85,smq,Let´s play fair girls,1,28 September 1999,"Ladies I know everybody gets revenge fantasies but please let show a little maturity.  If this movie where made like John Travolta´s white man´s burden, there would be total controversy. Taking that into account this movie is totally unfair, I don´t deny men have affairs with other women, but please ladies, you have also have had affairs.  As Christ said: ""Let the innocent cast the first stone"".Let's be honest were humans beings, that includes men and women. So establishing the idea that ""..all men are scum"", would make all women to be scum as well.Looking at the movie itself, it's irresponsible and just not funny.  If you were going to treat the topic of divorce and male affairs, you could at least taken a more serious approach.  As it turns out, it plays more like a revenge fantasy of frustrated people.",The First Wives Club
86,ivahhc,yuck!,1,23 January 2001,"Perhaps I shouldn't have read the book first. Or perhaps it's a good thing I did, else I would have blamed Olivia Goldsmith for this vacuous, vapid, vile movie, and she doesn't deserve it.The film should have been called something else; it doesn't deserve to bask in the book's praise. Where are the issues of self-image, age, mental illness, abuse, reconciliation, motherhood, and strength that Goldsmith's Annie, Elise, Brenda and Cynthia deal with? Instead of seeing these topical themes unfurl, the viewer is saddled with the enactment of inanity, vanity, and greed by the three filmic ""heroines"".Do yourself a favour: avoid the movie. *Especially* if you've read the book.",The First Wives Club

89,smithtyler1963,You Don't Own Me!,8,18 July 2016,"This feels like such a good film. I watched it last night and I can't be any happier. It's definitely the best film I've watched in a long, long time. I originally came to know about this film from a Youtube video of the three main characters performing the song 'You Don't Own Me' which got me really excited to watch it.So, I watched it. The three main characters had three strikingly different yet similar backstories and the way they met was just genius. The personalities of all three women, Brenda, Elise and Annie, were magnificent. Elise was vain, Brenda was tempestuous and Annie was timid yet fun-loving. I mostly relate to Annie although Brenda was such a great character too.The ending, for me, was just perfect and I couldn't have enjoyed it any more. Sure, there were parts in the middle of the film that lacked energy, but overall it was a marvellous film. At first, it didn't seem like my kind of film, but I gave it a go and it became my kind of film, hence the title of this review.I don't know what else to say, apart from Maggie Smith was excellent, and the whole plot was perfect.I. Loved. It.",The First Wives Club

As a woman, I can say it's a generous overstatement.A film with much noise and screaming, cheesy dialogs, and shallow gossipy characters can't please everyone, and The First Wives Club certainly didn't please me.I'm happy that not all women are like the characters in this film. Otherwise, I would have to consider a sex change operation.",The First Wives Club
91,jackknight007,The First Wives Club is one of the best,10,15 June 2006,"I for one, think the First Wives Club is one of the most funny films ever made by Paramount. I went to the premier in New York when i was 9. I got to meet the three ""Wives"", and they were so sweet and funny. Then a few months later there was an auction of the props and costumes from TFWC. And my Mum went a bit overboard with betting. She brought the Lichenstein picture, the picture of the red coat or dressing gown, Ms Midler's pearls, the Lambroghini and a few other bits and pieces.

I'm sorry but men ditch women all too often to go and date other younger women. this movie is a light, humorous way that 3 ladies deal with there pent up anger and jealousy toward their ex-husbands and their mistresses. i enjoyed this movie greatly and as long as you have a sense of humor you will too!",The First Wives Club
96,grayianphoenix,A Wonderful Glimpse into Relationships,8,15 May 2008,"The story is about how three friends end up reuniting after a tragic death of a friend. After this the three friends end up catching up and seeing what life has done to them. Once the friends have their emotional roller coasters with one another the decide to make the husband they helped create and make success in their professions to pay for ruining their futures.What makes me absolutely irate are men who label this movie as feministic hatred toward the opposite gender. I am a man and I found this movie to be amazing in that it starts off labeling these men, jerks. But through the emotional toil these woman went through, some of the woman find out that their husbands were in fact decent men. This film goes on to show you that you can't possibly know everything about everyone. You have to live life and find out what it holds for you. Plus after reading Olivia Goldsmith's original novel, I thought this was an appropriate adaptation considering the audience. The original novel would have been most certainly rated ""R."" I was not only entertained, but I found myself chuckling at more than a few scenes. Sure there is the wasted talent of Stockard Channing who is on screen for all of 5 minutes. But then again if I had a chance to work with all the wonderfully talented people in this movie, I would have taken that part as well. I give it an 8 out of 10. I would have said 9 but Bette Midler doesn't get more than one song to sing on the soundtrack!!!",The First Wives Club

99,steveneaklor,A psychotic revenge fantasy,1,8 January 2006,"If you are a man-hating feminist who has read every word of Susan Brownmiller, Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin and hung on every syllable of their writings as though they were incandescent truth, have I ever got a film for you! First of all, I did not go to see this movie about three women who plot revenge on their husbands for having committed the unspeakable crime of leaving them for younger women, or rent it. It happened to have been playing on a tour bus I was on, and try as I might, I could not ignore it. I have resolved on the basis of this movie never to ride another tour bus if any movies whose titles or content I do not know in advance are playing. I found this a thoroughly disagreeable film.Looking at it, I found myself thinking of a review by the late Richard Grenier of the movie M*A*S*H. Writing in the October 1981 issue of Commentary, Mr. Grenier said: ""...I have never watched an ostensible comedy with such stony grimness..., and this for the simple reason that I found it to be inspired by no humor..., but entirely by cruelty, malice and an inordinate craving to humiliate. It would have been like laughing at a dog running frantically in circles, driven mad by a tin can some boys had tied to his tail. And also being asked to admire the boys."" As noted, the center of this film is the relationship between three women (Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton) whose husbands each leave them for younger women, which in the context of this film is the unpardonable sin. The heart of the film is their elaborate revenge plots, all of which seem wildly disproportionate - rather like setting an arson fire to a hobby shop that sells you a model airplane kit with parts missing. Continuing from Mr. Grenier: ""What makes (the movie) even more repellent is that the torment our heroes inflict on their adversaries is administered so smugly, with an air of overweening sanctimony, as if anyone who stands in their way deserves what he gets."" But enough. I have wasted too much time on this ridiculous film already. Let me close with one final Grenier quote, which applies perfectly here: ""...every foot of (this film is) marked by...smug hooliganism.... Its most essential trait is the complacent assumption that if one is in the right...one can commit any brutality, any cruelty, any humiliation. If one is right, human dignity no longer applies.""",The First Wives Club
100,theappleorchardeh,great entertainment,10,20 November 2006,"Although many feel that the movie fell short I think they missed the point of the movie. The movie starts showing four very different women, and flashes back 25+ years ago when they were close collage friends. Their lives have taken them in four different directions and their lives are very different from each other. The movie isn't about making fun of men, divorce, fame or fortune. Its about women friends - not casual ""how are you, nice to see you again"" friends - the kind of friends who know the you way down deep inside, and don't let you get away with anything because they know you too well. These women interact in a way that men will never understand, but that most women will identify with.In the end, this movie is great entertainment. Pure and simple. No great message to deliver - just relax and enjoy it, thats what its there for!",The First Wives Club
101,blueflame1991,Perfect for divorce-es,7,19 September 2008,"Not that i'm generalizing here, but I think this movie is great if you have been wronged by a man in any way similar to these women. It may contain a bit of man-bashing, it may generalize middle-aged men as skirt-chasing losers, but there ARE men like that out there, and if you don't take it too seriously it really isn't a problem. This movie is kinda like a middle-aged chick flick, where anything is possible and revenge is exacted perfectly. Personally, I watch this when i'm feeling a bit bitter, because even if the storyline isn't that deep and meaningful, there's some good comedy in it. I haven't read the book that the movie was based on, so i can't judge in that respect, but i really enjoyed this film.",The First Wives Club

The script is utterly disgusting and absolutely noting as far as acting is concerned. 1:42 mins of disappointment.... you wait for something average to turn up, although going by the way this movie goes, it does not look like there will be anything above average, still going by these actresses track records, you hope for them that something the movie will take a turn for the good.",The First Wives Club

The other two, Goldie and Betty also remarkable, dream trio of comedians. Goldie with pumped up lips made me cry of laughter. Only complete snobs could write off this film as frivolous, and that is why we do not have more movies with good normal human humor, but loads of attention attracting hysterical farces and deviant experiments with enforced plots. Plot here is down to earth vengeance of cast off spouses with eventual triumph of values over weakness (Americans simply could not resist the ethical pathos) yet it's all very workable and performance of the actors 10+++.",The First Wives Club

When Cynthia dies at the very beginning three of her best friends are thrown into a whirl pool after her funeral when all three of them find themselves to be suffering from the very thing Cynthia committed suicide over, Neglect and betrayal. All four women: Cynthia, Annie, Elise and Cynthia; dealt with their husbands divorcing them for younger ""poptarts"". A delightful trip this movie is as these four women search for themselves in first trying to gain revenge on their husbands but then by using that revenge in a way, dedicated to Cynthia whose death sparked this entire thing, by building a crisis center for woman named after Cynthia.",The First Wives Club

I have been a military wife; an office manager; a rental car manager; a Big Rig Driver; a Subsititue teacher; and have had a great time living my life doing all the things I have done. This movie, I hope has allowed other women to be more like me, without the guilty feeling's of having been able to do these things.
